INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
COMPANHIA SIDERURGICA NACIONAL-CSN
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) with the guarantee of the Federative
Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$95 million to help finance a
project for expanding CSN's raw steel production capacity from 2.4 to 4.4
million tons per year. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including
4 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2% per annum. The Government of
Brazil would charge CSN a guarantee fee of 1-1/2% per annum on the outstanding
amount of the Bank loan, bringing the cost of the loan to CSN to 10% per annum.
The loan would be made simultaneously with a loan of US$63 million from the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of
Brazil" (355a-BR), dated June 20, 1974, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 3, 1974.   Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.   An
economic mission visited the country in October/November 1974 and its report
is in preparation.
3.        The Brazilian economy grew by 9.6% in 1974 continuing the rapid
pace which began in 1968. The average rate of growth of about 10% over the
period 1967-74 has resulted in a 60% increase in per capita income, a 130%
increase in manufacturing output and a 350% increase in the value of exports.
During much of this period, with carefully designed fiscal and monetary
policies, the Government was successful in gradually reducing the rate of
inflation. Some overheating of the economy developed in 1973. While initial-
ly the price effects of this were contained by administrative action, there
was a fairly sharp increase in prices during the first half of 1974 as a
result of the relaxation of controls and higher import prices. Inflation in
1974 was about 29%, compared to an annual average of 18% in 1970-73.
4.        Recent international economic developments have caused a sharp
deterioration of Brazil's balance-of-payments performance. The fourfold
increase in the price of crude oil (adding some US$2 billion to the import
bill), the steep rise in the price of most imported raw materials, as well



-2-
as the hardening of terms of external financial credits, made management of
the external sector very difficult in 1974. Further, these external factors
caught Brazil at the time when its economy was overheated and growth of import
demand was very high because of limitations on domestic capacity in key sectors
coupled with inventory accumulation. The current account deficit which
averaged US$1 billion in 1969-73 or 2% of GDP, widened to about US$7 billion
or 7% of GDP in 1974, reflecting the sizeable differential between import
growth (about 100%) and export growth (roughly 30%). The bulk of the deficit
was financed by a large increase in the inflow of external financial credits
(about US$3.7 billion on a net basis). However, starting in September 1974
the tight international market for long-term funds brought about a slowdown
in the flow of financial credits and there was a moderate drawdown of reserves
(about US$1 billion) in the latter part of the year. Nevertheless, Brazil
began 1975 with reserves of a reasonably comfortable US$5.7 billion.
5.        Measures to cope with the new external situation began in March
1974, when a new government came into office. The first efforts of the new
economic team were directed at restoring control of aggregate demand to reduce
the current account deficit of the balance of payments to more manageable
levels and to halt the acceleration of inflation. The main instruments used
to achieve these goals were the implementation of a more restrictive monetary
and fiscal program, the imposition of higher import duties and acceleration
of the "crawling peg" exchange rate adjustments. Indications of a tapering
off of the rate of industrial expansion and of inflation since the third
quarter of 1974, as well as of a decline in imports in early 1975, suggest
that the Government policieshave begun to take hold.
6.        The Government is committed to a substantial reduction of the
balance-of-pavments current account deficit in 1975. To this end, it intends
to continue monetary restraint, a balanced budget and a realistic exchange
rate policy, and to reduce stockpiles of imported intermediate goods accumu-
lated by public enterprises during 1975. The balance-of-payments outlook for
1975 is more favorable because prospects for most Brazilian exports continue
to be good, a slowdow-a in import price increases is expected and an increase
in domestic oil production is likely, thanks to earlier discoveries of off-
shore deposits in some Northeast states. The Government's plan to reduce the
trade deficit to about US$2.5 billion in 1975, compared to US$4.6 billion in
1974, should be attainable if imports can be kept at the same level as in
1974. However, the expected decline in the trade deficit in 1975 will be
partly offset by a substantial increase in interest and'amortization payments
as a result of the large external borrowing contracted during 1974. The
current account deficit would be approximately US$5.4 billion. With expected
long-term capital flow, US$4.8 billion would remain to be financed through a
combination of financial credits and utilization of reserves.
7.        In recent years, Brazil has become more closely integrated into the
world economy and its growth has become more dependent upon and vulnerable to
changes in the world economic situation. The slowdown in the rate of growth
of the world economy could have an adverse impact on prices of Brazilian pri-
mary exports and on the rate of growth of its exports of manufactures. World



economic conditions will probably not permit Brazil to grow during 1975-80
at the 10% pace attained in the preceding years. In fact, considerably slower
growth is likely during 1975-76 with the very steep decline in OECD economic
activity. However, a growth path averaging 6% per annum still seems feasible
over the 1975-80 period. This pace of growth would result in an annual average
current account deficit of US$4.6 billion (US$3.5 billion in 1974 prices). In
financing this deficit, Brazil is likely to look more than ever to multilateral
lenders, not only because loans from other sources on good terms may be some-
what less available than in the past but also because multilateral lenders can
act as catalysts to help mobilize other sources of financing. It is estimated
that to finance the projected growth path, the average annual net inflow of
medium- and long-term capital (that is, capital other than direct investments
and financial credits) required for the 1975-80 period will be substantial,
about US$1.8 billion, or three times the average for the 1970-74 period. On
the other hand, the direct import needs of most public investment projects
are relatively low, reflecting the ability of the domestic capital goods
industry to compete successfully under international competitive bidding and
the low direct foreign exchange component of many projects with strong social
impact. Hence, an appreciable part of official external financing would have
to be made available to cover domestic expenditures if Brazil is to achieve
its growth targets.
8.        By the end of 1974, Brazil's total external debt (public and private)
reached US$17.4 billion, of which two-thirds or US$11.6 billion, was in the
form of financial credits. Despite the large increases in the level of in-
debtedness, Brazil's external liquidity steadily improved up to 1974. Exten-
sion of the average term of financial credits and virtual elimination of
short-term credits had a favorable impact on debt structure. Together with a
rapid increase in exports, this resulted in a decline in the total debt ser-
vice ratio from 44% in 1971 to 31% in 1974. The public debt service ratio
for 1974 is estimated at around 17%, which is in line with that of other
countries at a similar stage of development. Further, net foreign exchange
reserves as of the end of March 1975 were still large, about US$4.9 billion,
equivalent to some four months of the expected 1975 imports of goods and
non-factor services. If an export growth rate of around 17% per year in
dollar terms (compared to 30% in 1970-74) can be maintained over the 1975-80
period and if average maturities on new financial credits gradually improve
from six to eight years, the total debt service ratio in 1980 can be expected
not to exceed the level prevailing in the 1969-73 period (about 38%). The
ratio for. public debt alone would remain at the present level of around 17%.
Nonetheless, the fact remains that Brazil's external debt service obligations
are high. However, the large foreign exchange reserves accumulated over the
past several years ensure that Brazil will have the liquidity to meet its
debt service obligations in the short term, while the countrv's record of high
caliber financial management provides grounds for confidence in the maintenance
of creditworthiness over the longer run.
9.        There has been a remarkable broadening and deepening of the country's
productive base and of its infrastructure in recent years, as well as a con-
siderable strengthening of its external sector. However, despite its recent



-4-
growth and vast potential, Brazil is still a country with a very unequal dis-
tribution of income and extensive absolute poverty. The present Government
acknowledges the gravity of the country's income distribution problem and
accepts the responsibility for its alleviation. Whlile like the previous
Government it believes that a high rate of growth is necessary to increase
the incomes of the poor, it does not believe that the "trickle down" effects
of rapid growth are enough and is in the process of shaping a new positive
policy which could be labeled as "redistribution along with growth." To this
end, in addition to pursuing some of the social programs initiated by its
predecessor, the Government is also working on new measures for improving
income distribution. These can be classified into three broad areas: (a)
regional development; (b) provision of social services; and (c) wage policy.
10.       As to regional development policy, the Government has formulated
a program known as POLONORDESTE for rural development in the Northeast. This
program, which envisages investment expenditures of about US$700 million during
1975-79, is designed to raise the productivity and incomes of small farmers
in the Northeast through, inter alia, formulation and execution of integrated
rural development projects, including changes in land tenure. POLONORDESTE
is based on the assumption that the rural Northeast cannot be regarded as a
homogenous whole and, therefore, uniform standardized programs are inadequate.
Active consideration is being given to a major modification in the state
value added tax system to redistribute fiscal resources from the richer to
the poorer states, in order to give the latter the fiscal resources which
they badly need to accelerate social programs, particularly in education.
iAs to the provision of social services, the Government has created a new
Ministry of Social Security in order to consolidate its social benefit programs
and to extend these programs to new groups in the population. It is also
planning to strengthen the nutrition program which, under the old Government,
got off to a poor start. Greater emphasis is being given by BNII (the National
Housing Bank) to low-income housing, whose beneficiaries will enjoy better
financial terms than in the past. BNH is also developing a site and services
program to reach parts of the population even lower down the income scale.
In agriculture, the recently reorganized rural extension agency (EMBRATER)
will expand and strengthen its activities directed specifically toward the
small-scale farmer; and the newly established federal agriculture research
institution (EMBRAPA) is defining its program to include a selection of crops
and farm systems which will ensure that small-scale farms benefit from research
efforts. Overall, the Government's vecentlv apnroved Dubl4r 4nvestment Dro-
Rram for 1975-77 gives hi2h 'riorit-r to education, health. aericulture and
reginnal development. which account for about 30% of total nublic investment.
Finally. the Government intpnds to use wage Policy to imDrove income di-tr4hu-
tion or at least to avoid its further deterioration. Tt has alreadv reviced
the formula zoverning the adlustment of the union waee scale and has introduced
an 8-10% increane in the real minimum wage.



EART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
Bank Operations
11.       By April 30, 1975, Brazil had received 52 loans from the Bank
amounting to US$2,164.5 million, of which 32 had not been fully disbursed.
During FY65-69, disbursements averaged only US$10 million per year, increasing
to an average of US$136 million per year during FY1970-74, reaching US$225
million in FY74, and US$187 million in the first nine months of FY75. Dis-
bursements will continue to increase during the next few years. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of April 30, 1975 and notes
on the, execution of ongoing projects.
12.       Bank lending to Brazil was very active in FY72, when seven loans
were approved totalling US$437 million, including three loans totalling US$192
million for the Stage II expansion of the steel industry. In FY73, six loans
amounting to US$187.7 million and, in FY74, three loans totalling US$242
million were approved. Thus far in FY75, three loans to Brazil totalling
US$308.5 million have been approved. At an advanced stage of preparation are
a proposed loan of US$60 million to Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA)
for its Stage III steel expansion project and a polder irrigation and agri-
cultural development project in the lower Saq Francisco Valley, in the
Northeast of Brazil. We are also working with the Brazilians on the prepara-
tion of an integrated rural development project in the Northeast state of Rio
Grande do Norte, an agricultural research program, a nutrition project,
second grain storage and agro-industries projects, a small- and medium-sized
industry credit project, a secondary and feeder road project, a project in
support of the establishment of a non-flat steel enterprise, a project to
rehabilitate and expand the Sao Paulo state railway enterprise and an electric
power distribution project in the Northeast.
13.       Brazil's external public debt outstanding and disbursed at the end
of 1974 totalled US$9.1 billion, and of this amount the Bank held 9.6%. The
Bank's share of the service on this debt was about 4.3%. If present trends
continue as expected, the Bankts share in total public debt outstanding would
increase to 12% by 1980. The Bank's share of public debt service would rise
to about 6% while its share of Brazil's total external debt service would
remain at the present level of 2.7%.
IFC Operations
14.       IFC has committed more financial resources to Brazil than to any
other country. Since 1957, lFC has made 26 commitments to Brazil, totalling
US$252.9 million, of which US$32.5 million has been cancelled, US$14.7 million
repaid and US$126.9 million sold. Of the balance of US$78.8 million, US$56.3
million represents loans and US$22.5 million, equity. A summary of IFC's
investments up to March 31, 1975, is given in Annex 11.



-6-
Lending Strategy
15.       In its lending to Brazil, the Bank has sought to help the Govern-
ment achieve a number of important development objectives, which are inter-
dependent and complementary. One of these objectives is to help Brazil ease
the foreign exchange constraint on its development, a constraint that has
become more critical since the increase in petroleum prices, by financing
projects designed to increase Brazil's export capacity and, where economical,
to substitute domestic production for imports. The latter is the principal
aim of the steel expansion program, which the proposed loans to CSN and the
companion loan to COSIPA, which we intend to present to you shortly, will
support. The additional 2.6 million tons of finished steel products per year
which will be produced by those two companies by 1981, will save Brazil about
US$1 billion in imports (in 1974 prices). The balance of payments will also
be aided by the proposed grain storage and agro-industries programs which are
both oriented toward exports -- the supply of major quantities of food-stuffs
to the rest of the world. Much of the investment in the transport sector --
railways, ports and highways -- is designed to facilitate the smooth and
economical flow of exports.
16.       Another of our lending objectives in Brazil is to support insti-
tutional development and policy reform, designed inter alia to help maxi-
mize public savings and ensure that they are used economically. Our lend-
ing in the steel sector is giving the Government support in following a
comprehensive and rational plan for the development of the national steel
industry. It has also helped the borrower enterprises to improve their
management and organization.
17.       Another najor objective of Bank lending to Brazil is the identi-
fication and support of projects designed to increase productivity and in-
comes in the lowest income segments of the population, to broaden the
economic opportunities open to those groups and to alleviate human misery.
Project preparation efforts in this area have been intensified, and we hope
to present an increasing number of loans with this objective. We are ac-
tively associated with the preparation of new projects in the fields of
rural development, water supply and sewerage, and site and services. A
project designed to assist Brazil in formulating a national nutrition pro-
gram has been appraised. A particular effort is being made to help Brazil
develop effective integrated rural development projects to increase the
productivity of the small farmer in the Northeast, the poorest section of
the country. Furthermore, a project is in preparation to support agricul-
tural research in the Northeast (with emphasis on the technology available
to small farmers) and to strengthen the federal mechanism for coordinating
and supervising agricultural research. In general, the more efficient use
of public savings should enable the public sector to devote more resources
to the social sector.
18.       A final objective of Bank lending to Brazil is to provide part
of the very large volume of medium- and long-term capital inflows that
Brazil has needed and will continue for some years to need in order to
sustain rapid growth and achieve its employment creation and regional



-7-
development objectives. In some sectors, especially in electric power and
steel, the Bank's participation has helped Brazil obtain additional bilateral
resources in greater amounts and on more favorable terms. Our lending to CSN,
for example, is being accompanied not only by the loan of US$63 million from
IDB, but also by loans totalling an estimated US$493 million from equipment
supplying countries.
PART III - THE STEEL SECTOR
Bank Group Participation in the Steel Sector
19.       The proposed loans for the Stage III expansion programs of CSN
and COSIPA would be the Bank's fourth and fifth loans for the development
of Brazil's steel sector. The Bank and IDB will not participate in
financing the Stage III expansion of USIMINAS, a former borrower, which
includes a large amount of equipment to be ordered from the same suppliers
that won orders under the Stage II program. Since bilateral credits are
readily available for this equipment, Bank/IDB support for USIMINAS has not
been requested. Nevertheless, while appraising the proposed loans for CSN
and COSIPA, the Bank appraisal mission also examined USIMINAS' new expansion
project, since it forms an integral part of the national Stage III program.
The mission was satisfied that USIMINAS' Stage III expansion project is eco-
nomically justifiable and compatible with the Stage III expansion projects of
CSN and COSIPA.
20.       The Bank's association with the Brazilian steel industry began in
1965 when it made a US$420,000 technical assistance grant to the Government
for a study to assess the gap between the supply and demand of steel products
in Brazil in the period 1966-72 and make recommendations on the most econo-
mical expansion program. The study concluded that Brazil's comparative
advantage in producing steel and the prospective growth of domestic demand
justified a substantial expansion of steel-making capacity. It also concluded
that priority should be given to bringing CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA to balanced
annual capacities of about 3.5-4.0 million raw steel tons each. Shortly
thereafter, the Government requested Bank support for the Stage I expansion
program, but the Bank did not participate and suggested that the Government
seek financing through bilateral channels.
21.       Significant delays in launching Stage I program and the rapid in-
crease in the consumption of steel with the recovery of the econom.y after
1967 led the Government to give the highest priority to the coordination of
the steel sector and the implementation of an expansion program for the
1970s, in the hope that this would forestall the need for massive importation
of steel products. In June 1970, the Government established the Conselho
Nacional da Industria Siderurgica (CONSIDER), a steel coordinating agency with
executive powers. CONSIDER, with the help of consultants, drew up the Stage II
expansion program, which called for CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA, the three large
companies that comprise the flat sector of the industry, to increase their



- 8 -
respective steel making capacity from 1.7, 1.0 and 1,0 million tons per annum
to 2.4, 2.4 and 2.3 million tons per annum, with additional rolling and
finishing facilities. The Government requested assistance from the Bank and
IDB in financing this expansion because it wanted Bank support in securing
additional external financing on favorable terms and because the presence of
the Bank would permit the companies to reduce investment costs significantly
through procurement of equiptnent on the basis of international competition.
Accordingly, in 1972, the Bank and IDB made loans totalling US$320 million,
consisting of US$192 million from the Bank and US$128 million from the IDB.
The Bank's contribution consisted of three loans; US$64.5 million to CSN,
US$64.5 million to COSIPA and US$63.0 million to USIMINAS. As already noted,
the Bank has also been asked to help finance a large new private-sector plant
for not-flat products to be located in the State of Minas Gerais. Appraisal
of that project is scheduled for later this year.
22.       The Brazilian steel industry has also been supported by iFC which
made investments in two major non-flat steel producers; the first to Acos
Villares, S.A. for US$9.9 million and the second to Companhia Siderurgica da
Guanabara for US$73.5 million.
The Stage II Expansion Program
23.       Progress in the implementation of the Stage II expansion program
has been good and completion is scheduled for 1976, taking into account an
average delay of about six months. The relatively close adherence to the
original schedule must be considered a major achievement, in view of the
difficult equipment supplying conditions which prevailed over the past two
years. By the end of December 1974 about 75% of all equipment orders were
placed, after international competitive bidding following Bank guidelines
for Bank/IDB financed items, and a modified procedure which takes into ac-
count credit terms, for bilaterally financed items. Particularly noteworthy
are the low price levels at which the major equipment was bid and contracted.
This factor enabled the companies to keep the overrun on total project costs
to within 40% of the original estimates despite far greater increases in the
cost of civil works and erection, ocean freight and engineering and adniinis-
tration of expansion. Brazilian suppliers and sub-suppliers have obtained
about 16% of total orders placed, or about 30% of orders placed with Bank/IDB
financing. Their performance in terms of quality of workmanship and adherence
to delivery schedules has been satisfactory. Similarly, all civil engineer-
ing, construction and erection work have been carried out successfully by
Brazilian contractors.
Brazilian Steel Industry
24.       The steel industry in Brazil is of comparatively recent origin.
Belgo-Mineira in the State of Minas Gerais was the firs. major producer start-
ing up in the 1920s. Before CSN began operations in 1946, domestic steel
production was less than 300,000 tons per year or less than half of the



-9-
domestic demand'at that time. Since then, production has increased rapidly.
In 1974, although handicapped by shortage of imported coking coal, the
Brazilian steel industry produced 7.6 million raw steel tons, and made Brazil
the sixteenth largest steel producer in the world. The principal steel mills
are located in the area bounded by the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro,
Vitoria and Belo Horizonte. Within this area are also the main sources of
raw material except coal as well as Brazil's major steel-consuming industries.
25.        In 1974, 45% of the raw steel produced was processed into flat
products and the remaining 55% into non-flat products. CSN, COSIPA and
USIMINAS produced virtually all the flat products. Non-flat steel was produced
by 40 companies (in addition to CSN), of which the ten largest accounted for
2.8 million tons or about 75% of total capacity. The remaining 30 companies
are all below 150,000 tons in capacity and work mostly on the basis of scrap
metal.
Steel Consumption and Supply
26.       Consumption of steel products in Brazil exceeded one million tons of
raw steel equivalent for the first time in 1947 and by 1963 had increased to
about 3.5 million tons. The next few years of economic uncertainty resulted
in a decline of steel consumption, but by 196.7, it increased to 3.8 million
tons. Since then consumption has increased steadily, outstripping even the
remarkable development of the Braziiian steel industry.

27.       The high rate of economic growth in Brazil during 1970-74 resulted
in a much greater increase in steel consumption than previously forecast.
The average annual growth rate of apparent steel consumption (production
plus imports less exports) during 1970-73 was 21% per annum for flat products
and 14% per annum for non-flat products. Since import restrictions have not



- 10 -
curbed consumption of steel in recent years, apparent consumption is judged
to reflect real demand. In 1973, apparent consumption reached the 1975
consumption level forecast during the appraisal of the Stage II projects. The
increase in consumption of flat products can be attributed mainly to growth
in durable and non-durable consumer goods production (especially automobiles)
and heavy industry including shipbuilding. Growth in construction and large
infrastructure investments contributed to the increase in consumption of
non-flat products. With the steel industry producing at full capacity,
Brazil still had to rely on increasing amounts of imports during this period:
0.5, 0.8, 0.7 and 1.5 million tons, respectively, for 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973.
28.       Preliminary data for 1974 indicated an apparent steel consumption
of 9.1 million tons of flat and non-flat products. Of this total, imports
are estimated to have been 2.6 million tons of flat products and 0.9 million
tons of non-flat products. It is known that the global shortage of steel
products which lasted until late 1974 induced Brazilian industry to stock-
pile large amounts of imported steel during 1974. Exports accounted for
less than 2.5% of production in 1974 and for the most part constituted ful-
fillment of previous sales commitments and an effort to maintain a presence
in certain markets of potential importance.
The Market
29.       As part of the appraisal of the Stage III projects, Bank staff
prepared an estimate of the growth in demand for flat steel products through
1981 (see Appraisal Report, Annex I). According to this estimate, which is
based on a probable growth ra'te of 12% per annum for flat steel products,
the demand for flat steel products would be 8.6 million tons in 1980. This
estimate is 1.6 million tons less than the demand forecast of 10.2 million
tons of flat steel products established in the Second National Development
Program which was based on a national economic growth target of 10% per
annum. The lower projection of demand made by the Bank staff reflects the
less favorable short-term outlook for Brazil's economic growth resulting
from the petroleum price increase and the slow-down in world economic acti-
vities.
30.       Under the Stage III expansion program, production capacity for flat
steel products would be raised to 9.0 million tons per annum by 1980. The
timing and scope of the expansion program is well justified, even on the
basis of the lower demand projections made in the Bank. First, allowance
must be made for a possible delay in the implementation 'of the program. Some
lead time is necessary to bring equipment up to full capacity. Furthermore,
some excess capacity is necessary from the point of view of maintenance and
efficient production programming at the factory level. In terms of individual
companies, the efficiency of Stage III equipment would be such that CSN would
be able to operate at a profit at 53% of capacity even on the basis of the
relatively low assumed steel prices. Finally, one of the stated objectives
of the Government is to export 10% of the Brazilian steel production. How-
ever, unless the Stage III expansion were implemented on time and the dom-
estic demand for steel were very low in 1980, Brazil would have only a very



small exportable surplus of either flat or non-flat products. If a larger
surplus did in fact arise, temporarily, there should be no difficulty in
finding export markets, since the selling price of Brazilian steel products
is projected to be fully competitive with prices of US and European pro-
ducers.
Institutional Aspects
31.       Over the past two years the Government has refined and improved
its organization for planning and financing the steel industry. As stated
earlier, CONSIDER was established in 1970 to prepare the National Steel
Program that was the basis of the Stage II expansion projects, and to arrange
the necessary foreign and local financing. In September 1973, the Government
created Siderurgia Brasileira S/A-SIDERBRAS (SIDERBRAS), a holding company
intended to be responsible for new public sector companies and public sector
contributions to private projects. The new Government which took office
in March 1974 decided that all public sector companies, both new and existing,
would be placed under SIDERBRAS, and designated SIDERBRAS to make the necessary
detailed plans and financing arrangements in order to implement the long-range
steel sector expansion plans outlined by CONSIDER. The Board of SIDERBRAS is
appointed by the Minister of Industry and Commerce and consists of the
President, the Director Superintendent, Director of Finance and Director of
Raw Materials and Marketing. The day-to-day operations of SIDERBRAS are
handled by a staff of some 20 engineers, financial analysts and economists,
most of whom transferred fropi CONSIDER to SIDERBRAS when the latter was
created in 1973. The staff of SIDERBRAS has been placed under a heavy work
load involved in carrying out the enormous steel expansion program, but has
been performing in a competent manner. Staff of the Bank and IDB, who have
maintained continuity since the preparation of Stage II projects, have pro-
vided much needed guidance and consultation during the difficult initial
phases of the preparation of the Stage III projects.
32.       In August 1974, the Government expanded the scope of CONSIDER to
include overall planning and coordination of the non-ferrous sector as well
as the iron and steel sector. Working relationships between CONSIDER (now
Conselho de Nao Ferrosos e de Siderurgia) and SIDERBRAS are good. The two
entities will cooperate closely in the preparation of a new National Steel
Plan for the period 1975-85, which will be a comprehensive document covering
all aspects affecting the development and operation of the Brazilian steel
sector, both public and private, and will determine the scope, location and
timing of the Stage IV expansion program (see Section 3.06 of the draft
Guarantee Agreement).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       A report entitled "Appraisal of CSN Expansion Project - Stage III"
(No. 754-BR dated May 21, 1975) is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. The main features of the proposed project and loan are summarized
in Annex III. The project was appraised by joint IBRD/IDB missions in May/
June 1974 and September 1974. Negotiations with CSN and the Government were
held in Washington from April 22, 1975 to April 28, 1975. CSN was represented
by a team headed by its President, Mr. Adhemar Pinto. In early May, Mr. Plinio
Reis de Cantanhede Almeida, formerly financial director of CSN, replaced Mr.
Adhemar Pinto as President.
The Borrower
34.       CSN is a Brazilian corporation founded in 1941.   Most of its shares
are held by the Government, through SIDERBRAS and other governmental agencies
(Social Security Institute and a public savings bank). Until recently, the
Treasury held all of the common shares totalling 54% of the share capital (as
of December 31, 1974) and half of the preferred shares which make up the
remaining 46%. At the end of April 1975, 51% of the common shares held by
the Treasury were transferred to SIDERBRAS.
35.       CSN's plant is located at Volta Redonda, a city about 145 km north-
west of Rio de Janeiro. It is centrally located in terms of major sources of
raw materials and markets (see map attached). CSN started steel making in
1946 with an initial capacity of 170,000 TPY. The Stage I expansion which
is almost completed will increase capacity to 1.7 million TPY by mid-1975.
The Bank/IDB financed Stage II expansion will further increase capacity to
2.4 million TPY of raw steel by 1976. The proposed project which is the
Stage III expansion is designed to increase the capacity of the plant further
to 4.4 million TPY by the end of 1979. In 1974, the Company produced 1.5
million raw steel tons and had sales of steel products of about US$371 million
equivalent. It is one of the largest steel mills in Latin America and in
1974 supplied 35% of Brazil's market for cold rolled products, especially
galvanized sheet and tinplate (used for cans and bottlecaps) for which it
has a monopoly. CSN's steel operations are vertically integrated by direct
ownership or through subsidiary companies and include coal, iron and manganese
ore mines, limestone and dolomite quarries and coastal vessels for coal trans-
port.
36.       CSN has a general know-how and technical assistance agreement with
the United States Steel Corporation (USS) and Armco Steel Corporation. In
addition, CSN has a technical training and general consultation agreement
with USS. These agreements are comprehensive and provide CSN with the
technical back-up and training facilities which it requires for the success-
ful operation of its plant. Some of the major suppliers also provide tech-
nical assistance, in particular Nippon Steel, who supplied the No. 3 blast
furnace and the No. 3 coke oven battery.



- 13 -
37.       Currently CSN has about 19,200 employees including about 15,600
in the steel works. The company has not had strikes in the past six years
and labor turnover has been low. The incremental output of 2.8 million tons
of raw steel per year (TPY) at the completion of Stage III calls for the
addition of 6,300 workers. After the expansion, the index of man-hours per
ton of finished product will decrease from 35 at present to 16. This compares
with the 1972 average levels achieved in some of the most advanced steel
producing countries as follows: Japan - 12 man-hours per ton; US - 12.2;
Germany - 15.6; France - 17.6 and the UK - 24.9. While CSNTs target may
appear ambitious, the 1974 labor force already included manpower being trained
for Stages I and II facilities which were not yet in operation. On the other
hand, the Company has a relatively large investment in labor-intensive finishing
facilities which require above average man-hours per ton produced. As in the
Stage II project, the Company has agreed to set targets for the achievement
of reasonable labor productivity levels (see Section 4.08 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
38.        The debt equity ratio of CSN would remain favorable during the imple-
mentation of the project. From 51:49 in 1978, the debt equity ratio would
decrease to 29:71 in 1983 mainly as a result of the expected increase in
the cash generation after the completion of the Stage III project. This
conservative capitalization will enable the Company to finance further
expansion. The current ratio will decline during construction from 1.2:1
in 1975 to a projected low of 1.1:1 in 1978. 'After the completion of Stage
III, the current ratio is expected to increase to 2.0:1 by 1983. In any
event CSN would maintain a current ratio of 1.1:1 and SIDERBRAS and Banco
Nacional do Desenvolvimento Economico (BNDE), which is the designated banker
for the Government steel companies, would promptly furnish funds when needed
(see Section 5.10 of the draft Loan Agreement and Section 4(c) of the draft
Project Funds Agreement).
39.       CSN's financial position should allow payment of reasonable dividends.
The Company agreed that it will not declare cash dividends on common shares if,
after payment of such dividends, the current ratio were to fall below 1.3:1
(see Section 5.08 of the draft Loan Agreement). Also, CSN will not issue new
preferred shares if by doing so the total value of preferred shares were to
exceed the total value of common shares (see Section 5.09 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Project Description
40.       The project consists of:    (i) expansion of the Casa de Pedra iron
ore mine in Minas Gerais to reach 9.2 million TPY of ore; (ii) two 400
ton/day calcining plants for limestone and dolomite respectively; (iii)
two batteries of coke ovens with 52 and 51 ovens respectively; (iv) a 4,600
ton/day sinter plant; (v) a 1,100 ton/day oxygen plant; (vi) a third
200-ton vessel in the BOF shop; (vii) a semi-continuous 66" hot-strip mill;
(viii) a plate finishing line; (ix) two continuous pickling lines for 1.1
million TPY each; (x) a 66" six-stand tandem cold strip mill; (xi) expanded



- 14 -
batch and continuous annealing facilities; (xii) two new temper mills;
(xiii) two cold strip finishing lines; (xiv) a continuous galvanizing line
for 180,000 TPY; (xv) a painting line; (xvi) a coil preparation line;
(xvii) two electrolytic tinning lines; (xviii) two roll shops; and (xix)
new railroad facilities and equipment. Revamping, enlargement and replace-
ment of old equipment as well as service utilities installations will also
be undertaken.
41.       The new facilities will complement and make full use of some of
the investments being made as part of the Stage II expansion, such as blast
furnace No. 3 which together with furnaces No. 1 and No. 2 will provide
enough hot metal to meet the 1981 production target. The phasing out of
the existing open-hearth shop and its replacement by a BOF shop (Stage II
and III) will reduce steel-making costs and improve finished product quality.
The addition of a third BOF vessel in Stage III to the existing vessels will
mean a capacity increase from 2.5 to 4.6 million TPY of liquid steel.
Engineering and Project Execution
42.       The engineering and procurement for Stage II has been successfully
undertaken by Companhia Brasileira de Projetos Industriais (COBRAPI), a
subsidiary of CSN and one of the largest engineering corporations in Brazil.
Some assistance was also obtained from US Steel Engineers and Consultants
and from McKee, US. For the Stage III project, COBRAPI's responsibilities
are similar, and outside consultants and sub-contractors will be hired as
necessary to cover further w6rk including engineering, procurement assistance
and project management.
43.       CSN has received recommendations from the consulting firm A.D.
Little on improving the organization and management of CSN's expansion pro-
grams and has largely accepted these recommendations including computerized
scheduling and cost control systems. Improvements will be completed during
1975 and the Bank will be kept informed of the progress. The Stage II and
Stage III projects will overlap sufficiently to allow beneficial continuity
of the management and staff responsibilities for expansion. Construction
and erection will be carried out almost entirely by outside contractors
with coordination by CSN. Equipment suppliers will provide supervision of
erection and assistance in start-up, along the same lines as for the execu-
tion of the Stage II expansion.
44.       Engineering and procurement action has commenced.     Orders for
the equipment to be financed by the Bank and the bilateral agencies are ex-
pected to be placed from early 1976 on and most installations are scheduled
for completion bv the middle of 1979, with some of the finishing facilities
(e.g., annealing, tempering and tinning lines) to be completed by the end of
1979. The delivery and construction times are based on information provided
bv potential equipment suppliers and are considered achievable.

Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
45.       The total cost of the project, as estimated in March 1975, is
US$1,901 million equivalent with an estimated foreign exchange component of
US$838 million equivalent. Contingencies have been estimated on the basis of
price escalation forecast for equipment and civil works consistent with those
now being applied by the Bank world-wide plus a 10% physical contingency on
equipment and 20% on construction and installation.
46.       CSN plans to obtain a total of US$651 million equivalent from the
Bank, IDB and bilateral financing sources. The remainder of the project
cost of US$1,464 million will derive from CSN's internal cash generation,
capital increase by SIDERBRAS and loans from BNDE and Agencia Especial de
Financiamento Industrial (FINAME) managed by BNDE.   The Bank and IDB loans
totalling US$158 million equivalent will be applied to finance a list of
equipment and parts on a 60/40 sharing basis between the banks as in the
Stage II loans. The equipment to be financed includes steel making and
associated equipment, equipment for the improvement and expansion of existing
facilities, and other equipment for foundry, maintenance shops and construction
(see Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement). The loans would not finance
construction and installation (including civil works) costs, which will be
financed from Brazilian sources.
47.       Equipment not on the Bank/IDB list will be bid competitively
among the major suppliers of the countries providing bilateral credits and
Brazil, with the financing terms being taken into account in bid evaluation.
Of the estimated US$722 million cost of this equipment, CSN plans to finance
about US$108 million (15%) in company contributions from local resources,
including cash generation; expects to obtain financing from equipment supply-
ing countries for US$493 million; and plans to finance the remaining US$121
million in loans from FINAME, that figure being a tentative estimate of
orders that might be won by Brazilian manufacturers. So far, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, UK, and USA have indicated interest in participating in this
scheme.
48.       The Bank loan would be made to CSN at 8-1/2% interest per annum
for 15 years including 4 years of grace. CSN would in addition pay a guaran-
tee fee of 1-1/2% per annum to the Government, bringing the cost of the Bank
funds to CSN to 10%. The IDB loan will be made at 8% interest per annum for
15 years including 4 years of grace. Commitment charges will be 3/4% per
annum for the Bank and 1-1/4% per annum for IDB. In addition, IDB charges
a flat inspection and supervision fee equal to 1% of the loan amount. The
terms of the bilateral credits have not been finalized but are expected to be
for 13 to 15 years, including 4 years of grace, at an average interest rate
of 9% per annum. The BNDE and FINAME loans are expected to have an average
nominal interest rate of 6% per annum plus monetary correction and an amorti-
zation period of 15 years including 4 years of grace.



- 16 -
49.       IDB's Board approved its loan in the amount of US$63 million on
December 12, 1974. The signing and effectiveness of that loan are contingent,
respectively, on approval and effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan. The
effectiveness of the Bank loan would be contingent upon the effectiveness of
the IDB loan (see Section 7.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Disbursement and Procurement
50.       The Bank and IDB loans would be jointly disbursed in a 60:40 pro-
portion against appropriate documentation for the CIF cost of imported goods
or the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured goods. No disbursement would
be made for expenditures made prior to the signing of the Loan Agreement.
The estimated schedule of disbursement is given in Annex III.
51.       Procurement of the equipment to be financed by the Bank and IDB
would follow the Bank's Guidelines. Bids containing Brazilian components
totalling at least 50% of the bid value would be allowed a margin of pre-
ference of 15%, or the applicable import duty, whichever is less; and the
same margin would be allowed for identifiable Brazilian components (which
could have been bid separately) of bids for equipment packages with less
than 50% Brazilian component. Since Brazilian firms are becoming more
competitive, and because the Bank/IDB list of equipment contains equipment
for which there is local manufacturing capability, we estimate that the
Brazilian firms will win about 60% of the bids. On that basis, and allowing
for the fact that Brazilian equipment on the average is estimated to have
an import content of 40%, Bank financing would be attached to local expendi-
tures of about US$34 million equivalent. However, the total expected foreign
exchange cost of the project (US$872 million), is much greater than the total
foreign financing (US$651 million) so that substantial Brazilian resources
will be used in any case to cover foreign exchange expenditures.
Ecology
52.       Brazilian pollution control regulations are still in the early stage
of development. When specifying the new facilities to be installed in both
Stage II and Stage III, the Company proceeded on the premise that air and
water pollution control should be in line with US practices or Brazilian regu-
lations, whichever are the more stringent. The cost of the pollution control
equipment is included in the cost of the project and is estimated to account
for approximately 2% of total equipment costs, as compared to about 5% for
Stage II. The reduction is due to the fact that many of the environmental
devices needed for the project were already installed as part of Stage II.
An environmental study of the plant recently completed by UNIDO consultants
noted that "extreme care has been taken by CSN to incorporate from the start
latest anti-pollution measures in all the expanded units."    The consultants
also noted the marked improvement planned for the expansion in contrast with
the existing facilities.   The Company would be committed to install adequate
air, water and noise pollution controls, including suitable measurement de-
vices acceptable to the Bank, and also monitor emissions to maintain them
within acceptable limits (see Section 4.07 of the draft Loan Agreement).

Economic Return
53.       The project will help eliminate massive imports of flat rolled steel
products, especially tinplate and galvanized coils which the Company can pro-
duce competitively. Net foreign exchange savings resulting from the project
are estimated at about US$440 million per year by 1981. CSN's selling prices
are on the whole slightly below European domestic prices for similar products.
Current CIF import prices are somewhat higher than domestic prices and it
is expected that upon completion of the project the Company could meet
substantially lower import prices and still earn an acceptable financial
return (after taxes) of 10.8%. Based on projected long-term import prices
for steel products over the assumed 18-year life of the assets, the project's
rate of return to the economy is estimated to be 17%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Loan Agreement between Companhia Siderurgica Nacional-CSN
and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federative Republic
of Brazil and the Bank, the draft Project Funds Agreement between SIDERBRAS,
BNDE and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,

approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Features of the draft Loan, Guarantee and Project Funds Agree-
ments of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 32, 37, 38, 39, 49
and 52 of this report.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
(As of May 16, 1975)
There are now 31 effective Bank loans under disbursement:
Loan No.
403/474   Estreito Hydroelectric Project:   US$57 and US$39 million loans
of February 26, 1965 and December 19, 1966; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976. The project is completed and the loan
is almost fully disbursed. Equipment costs were substantially
below estimates.  The original Closing Date was April 1, 1971.
404       Xavantes Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.5 million loan of
February 27, 1965; Closing Date:   June 30, 1975.  The original
project was completed in early 1971 (after a delay of about 18
months).  The project had been amended to include the installa-
tion of equipment for an associated transmission line. In March
1972, US$2.7 million was cancelled from the remainder of the
loan. Ordering and the proposed delivery of the latter equipment
were delayed, but the loan is now expected to be fully disbursed
by April 30, 1975. The original Closing Date was December 31,
1969.
565       Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.3 million loan
of October 23, 1968; Closing Date: March 31, 1975. Changes
in the project layout and design have increased substantially
the local cost, which will be covered by ELETROBRAS, without,
however, significantly affecting the economic justification
for the project. Construction work is completed. Retention
payment schedule is under review to determine the period of
postponement of the Closing Date.
566       Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project:   US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, 1968; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The project
was delayed six months by spillway foundation difficulties.
This problem and price escalation greater than estimated
* increased powerhouse construction cost by 72%, but, as the
original cost was very low, the resulting cost per kW of
generating capacity is still attractive. The project is
virtually completed and the fourth and last generating unit
is expected to be in commercial operation shortly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No.
656       Industry:   US$25 million loan of February 16, 1970 to Banco
do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB); Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The loan has been fully committed. The Terminal Date for sub-
mission of subprojects, originally June 30, 1972 and postponed
to June 30, 1973, was postponed a second time to June 30, 1974
to give BNB an opportunity to submit subprojects in an advanced
stage of preparation. Slow utilization of the loan was due
mainly to BNB's unusually burdensome security conditions on
subloans and its emphasis on larger scale projects, for which
financing from other than World Bank funds has been available.
676       Second Highway Construction Project:    US$100 million loan of
May 25, 1970; Closing Date:- July 31, 1975. Construction works
are underway and the overall quality of construction and super-
vision is satisfactory. There have, however, been substantial
cost increases on some contracts, so that the total construction
cost of the project is now estimated to be above the appraisal
estimate, excluding contingencies, but still within the appraisal
estimate including contingencies. The execution of some contracts
has been seriously delayed by inclement weather conditions and
project changes. Disbursements under the loan are behind the
appraisal schedule, due to a late start of the project, but have
improved during the last two years. The original Closing Date
was July 31, 1974.
677       Marimbondo Hydroelectric Project:    US$80 million loan of 'May 25,
1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977. Construction work is proceeding
on schedule. The cost of increased excavation and concrete work
resulting from poor rock foundation and increased equipment cost
will result in an increase over the original cost estimate of
US$65 million or 24.5%. This does not significantly affect the
economic justification for the project.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:    US$70 million loan of April 5,
1971; Closing Date: May 31, 1977. The construction of the Salto
Osorio hydroelectric plant is progressing satisfactorily. A cost
overrun of about US$72 million, due to increased equipment and
construction costs, is foreseen, but this does not significantly
affect the economic justification of the project. The cost overrun
is being financed by loans from ELET.OBRAS and a commercial bank.
The construction of the transmission system, delayed to allow a
re-examination of ELETROSUL's market, is proceeding with corres-
ponding modifications.

Loan No.
755       Education Project:   US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1975. Progress on the construction and equip-
ment of the project schools is now proceeding satisfactorily.
However, the project implementation is behind the original schedule
due to initial delays.
756       Santos Port Project:   US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979. Execution of the project is now proceeding
satisfactorily, although there have been further delays and cost
overruns which will be financed by the Borrower. DNPVN, with the
assistance of management consultants, has been improving port
operations in Santos. The National Port Development Study financed
under the project is nearly completed. The Government is studying
legislation which would convert DNPVN from a Government agency to
a public corporation.
757       Sao Paulo Water Supply Project:    US$22 million loan of June 21,
1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. The project suffered initial
delays caused by the State of Sao Paulo not furnishing the required
counterpart funds which are now included in the state budget. The
Government has consolidated all the'water and sewerage companies
in the state into a single company, SABESP, and a loan assumption
agreement with the new company was concluded on December 18, 1974.
During the last four months progress has been slow but improvements
are expected with new management of the company which took office
recently. The original Closing Date was June 30, 1975.
758       Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project:    US$15 million loan of June 21,
1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. A review of the original
design resulted in its modification to exclude the discharge of
raw sewage including a treatment facility. Bidding procedures are
in progress for other portions of the project. As a result of the
modifications in the project, the loan amount has been reduced to
US$12 million. The Government has consolidated all the water and
sewerage companies in the state into a single company, SAEESP, and
a loan assumption agreement with the new company was concluded
December 18, 1974. Progress of the project is expected to improve
with new management which took office recently. The original
Closing Date was June 30, 1975.
786       Railway Project - MBR:   US$46 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975. Implementation of the project
is generally satisfactory but behind schedule. Derailments on the
central line and technical problems at the MBR loading and unload-
ing sites curtailed some traffic flows, but with improvements under
way in track-rehabilitation, bridge strengthening and siding

lengthening, traffic has reached the monthly target level by the
end of March 1975. Except for the construction of the Jaceaba
workshop, the. project is expected to be completed by the Closing
Date.
787       HBR Iron Ore Project:   US$50 million loan of August 25, 1971:
Closing Date: December 31, 1976. The project was complcted on
schedule, in November 1973, and has been operating satisfactorily
since. The delay in completion of the railway project limited
output to about 80% of capacity in 1974. A 20% overrun in capital
costs resulted primarily from a change in scope of the project.
797       CSN Steel Expansion Project:   US$64.5 million loan of February 8,
1972; Closing Date: July 1, 1976. The latest cost estimate is
US$570 million, an increase of about 32% over the appraisal estimate
due to design evolution, unforeseen site works and increases in
local construction costs. The project is now 65% complete and is
about three months behind the appraisal schedule.
812       USIMINAS Steel Expansion Project:   US$63 million loan of Apri] 11,
1972; Closing Date: June 1, 1976. The latest cost estimate is
US$800 million, an increase of about 40% from the appraisal estimate
due primarily to design evolution and increases in local construc-
tion costs. The project is 70% complete and is about six months
behind the original' schedule.
813       Third Highwiay Construction Project:  US$89 million loan of April 11,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. Construction works are more
than three-quarters completed, but are slightly behind schedule;
the estimated total contract cost is slightly above the appraisal
estimate. The feasibility studies and detailed engineering financed
under the loan were started later than planned, but are now completed
at a cost substantially below the appraisal estimate. Disbursements
are lagging behind the appraisal forecast, but have improved during
the past year and are nowq expected to be completed by the original
Closing Date of the loan.
828       COSIPA Steel Expansion Project:   US$64.5 million loan of June 14,
1972; Closing Date: January 15, 1977. The latest cost estimate is
US$668 million, an increase of about 40% over the appraisal estimate
due primarily to increased local construction costs. This will not
significantly affect the economic justification of the project.
The project is now 60% complete and proceedino according to schedule
829       Sao Simao Hydroelectric Project:   US$60 million loan of June 14,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1979. The contract for the civil
works was awarded to an Italian-Brazilian consortium in Mav 1973,
and the project is proceeding according to schedule. An anticipated
9% cost overrun is being covered by local borrowing.

853       Alto Turi Land Settlement Project:   US$6.7 million loan of July 24,
1972; Closing Date: December 1, 1978. COLONE has prepared revised
farm development plans whose credit component, to be financed by
public financial institutions, will be significantly higher than
originally estimated, although still low in comparison to other
settlement projects. Administrative delays in the release of public
funds for farm credit and COLONE working capital requirements and
difficulties in recruiting project staff delayed the start of
project execution. Settlement, however, has now begun and the
project should be completed in 1978 as envisaged.
854       Fourth Highway Construction Project:   US$51 million loan of
August 4, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976. Construction
works are more than half completed but behind schedule; the esti-
mated total contract cost is slightly above the appraisal estimate.
357       Grain Storage Project:   US$30 million loan of September 27, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979. After some initial difficulties
with the appraisal of subprojects, the project is now well underway.
The Bank and,the Borrower have agreed on a revised indexing system
to ensure that sub-borrowers are charged a positive real interest
rate. The loan funds are expected to be fully committed by October
1975.
868       Interim Second Liveseock Project:   US$26 million loan of December 19,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977. The project is proceeding
normally. The loan has been fully committed and is expected to be
disbursed as scheduled.
887       Power Distribution Project:   US$20 million loan of April 16, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976. Principally due to difficulties
encountered in preparing bidding documents and delays in deliveries
of equipment and materials, the project is behind schedule. The
Borrower intends to accelerate procurement significantly this year
and disbursements are expected to be completed by the Closing Date.
923       I.tumbiara Hydroelectric Project:  US$125 million loan of August 1,
1973; Closing Date:  December 31, 1982.   Contracts for both the
