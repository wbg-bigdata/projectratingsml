PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
CSN STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT STAGE III
(Loan 1151-BR)
PREFACE
The Loan to Companhia Siderurgica Naclonal (CSN) in the amount of
US$95 million was approved on Hay 30, 1974, and signed on August 4, 1975.
On the same date a Guarantee Agreement with the Republic of Brazil and the
Project Funds Agreement with S±derurgica Brasileira S.A. - SIDERBRAS were
also signed. These Agreements became effective on April 30, 1976. The
Loan Account was closed on January 28, 1985, compared to the original
estimate of June 30, 1980. US$0.4 million equivalent was cancelled.
The main objectives of the loan were to increase CSN's steel-making
capacity from 2.4 million to 4.4 million tpy, place more emphasis on coated
products in order to satisfy market requirements, replace obsolete equip-
ment, improve product quality and reduce production costs.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) has been prepared by the
Industry Department based on the completion report prepared by the Borrower
(BCR) and supplemented with information in the Project File, as well as
knowledge of staff in the Industry Department who were associated with the
project. A Bank mission visited CSN in December 1985 to discuss the first
draft of the report prepared by CSN. The final draft of the Borrower's BCR
incorporates all of the comments made by the Bank mission. The Borrower
had no further comments (see Attachment I).
This project has not been audited; however, OED proposes to
evaluate it in depth as part of a group of steel projects in several
countries, including another project in Brazil (COSIPA: Steel Expansion
Phase III), tentatively scheduled for FY89.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
CSN STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT STAGE III
(Loan 1151-BR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.      Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN), a government-owned entity,
commenced operations in 1946 with an initial ingot capacity of 270,000 tpy.
Subsequent expansions brought production up to 1.5 million tons of raw
steel in 1970. CSN then undertook a long-term expansion program in three
stagess Stage I was designed for a nominal capacity of 1.7 million tons of
raw steel, Stages II and III, assisted *y the World Bank, were designed for
nominal capacities of 2.45 million tons nd 4.4 million tons of raw steel,
respectively. In 1971172, the Bank and IDB jointly appraised Stage II and
subsequently agreed to lend US$64.5 million and US$43.0 million, respec-
tively, to help finance the project. The Stage III project was appraised
by joint missions of the Bank and IDB in May/June and September 1974,
January 1975, and various subsequent discussions with representatives of
CSN and the holding company SIDERBRAS (PCR, para. 1.01).
Obiectives
ii.     The project was intended to (a) increase CSN's Volta Redonda plant
capacity from 2.4 million tons (Stage II) to 4.4 million tpy by 1979 and
add rolling and finishing capacity, primarily for the production of flat
rolled products, of which about one half would be coated; (b) reduce
production costs and improve product quality through modernization of CSN's
installations; and (c) satisfy domestic and export market demand (PCR,
para. 1.01; BCR, pp. 47-48).
Implementation Experience
iii.    Shortly after Loan effectiveness in August 1976, it was realized
that the project scope agreed during appraisal would have to be changed.
The Bank therefore requested that CSN carry out, with the assistance of a
Brazilian and a foreign engineering consultant, a technical, economic and
financial review of Stage III. As a result of this Review, a number of
major changes were introduced. Liquid steel production -.as increased from
4.4 million tpy to 4.6 million tpy and balancing capacity was added in some
of the major equipment; the planned implementation schedule was extended
from four to six years; and capital costs rose from US$1,840 million
estimated at appraisal to US$2,401 million (excluding working capital and
interest during construction)4I/ A now company budget and long-term
financing projections incorporating a revised financing plan were also
prepared (BCR, pp. 19-46, 63-68).
11 Unless specified, future comparisons and references in this PCR are made
between the "Review" and the actual results.



- v 
iv.     Delays in basic .ngineering and procurement, resulting from the
Review and the financial constraints *xperienced by CSN during implemen-
tation, contributed substantially to an overall delay in project completion
amounting to 43 months.  The financial constraints stemuaed from:  (a) the
shortfall of local resources not compensated for in a timely manner by
additional equity cortributions; and (b) the lower than projected revenues
due to price controls which did not keep pace with inflation (PCR, pares.
1.02-1.04, 1.07, 1.13-1.15; BCR, pp. 50-55, 69-72).
v.      CSN's basic corporate structure underwent successive modifications
during the period 1977-85 in order to define clearer functional responsi-
bilities and improve control of operations and expansion. Heads of the
executive vice presidency, finance, marketing, operations, procurement and
engineering were roplaced by new staff. The Company, and the prioject
implementation group in particular, benefitted from this new stronger
leadership that emerged (PCR, para. 3.01; BCR, pp. 121-128).
vi.     The total financing required to complete the project is estimated
at US$3,439.0 million, which is 62.6% higher than the appraisal estimate
but 7.6% lower than the Review estimate. Compared to the appraisal, the
main elements of the increase were (a) equipment procurement (43%) due to
the increased project scope; (b) civil works (15%) due to the larger scope
and underestimation of complexity; and (c) interest during construction
(240%) due to the longer implementation period. At the same time,
increased domestic supply and the beneficial effect of competitive bidding
resulted in considerable savings (PCR, paras. 1.05, 1.06; BCR, pp. 56-68).
Results
vii.    CSN's production performance during the period 1977 to 1985 was
about 25% lower than projected in the Review. This resulted from the
combined effects of delays in completing the Stage II project, unrealistic
targets for production build-up for Stage III, operational problems, and
the domestic recession resulting from the second oil price increases in
1979. However, with all new facilities of Stage III almost completed and
started up, production performance is expected to improve and exceed the
volumes foreseen at the time of appraisal. CSN is presently (actual 1985)
operating at about 80% of capacity (PCR, paras. 2.01-2.04; BCR, pp. 78-100,
112-120).
viii.   On the whole, although there has been considerable delay in imple-
mentation and a slower than expected build-up of production, the project
retains its economic merit, CSN is competitive in the international market,
and its export performance has been remarkable. It is now estimated that
the project's economic rate of return is 13.62 compared with 17.02 at the
time of appraisal. However, CSN's overall financial performance and
situation has been weak throughout the period compared to the Review
estimates. Net income and cash generation were substantially below budget
expectations mainly because of a depressed domestic market and delayed and
inadequate price adjustments during a period of rapid inflation. These
factors led the Company to rely heavily on short-term borrowings to meet
capital and operating expenses. An action plan for the financial
restructuring of CSN was adopted in 1983, which included revision of
pricing policies, capital contributions to reduce or liquidate outstanding



- vi -
short-term debt, and rescheduling of bank loons. Although CSN's liquidity
and debt service coverage had improved by 1985, financial ratios had not
reached agreed targets. The financial rate of return, if the underlying
assumptions hold, is estimated at 10.5Z (PCR, param. 1.07-1.12, 2.05-2.09,
3.031 BCR, pp. 101-108).
Sustainability
ix.     The project had not been completed at the time the completion
report had been prepared -- alb*it the Bank's funds had been disbursed.
Although the project is well managed, it has had serious financial problems
due to factors largely beyond the management's control, and a financial
restructuring program was under implementation at the time the PCR was
prepared. Nonetheless, although economically sound, the sustainability of
the project is conditioned on the successful implementation of the
financial restructuring program under way.
Overall Assessment and Lessons
x*      The main objectives of the project have been attained.  OED
proposes to re-examine all three stages of CSN's expansion program and
CSN's financial situation in a sectoral context in the course of an
upcoming audit of a group of other steel projects, including Brazil -
COSIPA Expansion Phase III, at which time the sustainability of the
project's benefits will be more firmly established. The Bank has followed
the project very closely since its inception and has been instrumental in
improving CSN's organization and management structure, project implemen-
tation and operations in many ways (PCR, para. 3.02). A13o, t'he Bank's
participation encouraged project cofinancing, while financial covenants and
frequent Bank supervision missions were helpful in maintaining a dialogue
with the Government and in focussing iss attention on CSN's financial
difficulties (PCR, paras. 3.01-3.02, 3.04; BCR, pp. 129-130).
xi.     The project experience is instructive in several respects.  It
suggests thatt
(a) Significant changes in scope right after-loan effectiveress,
impacting inter alia on the project's capital cost and
financing plan, could be avoided through a more diligent
appraisal effort.
(b)  The potential disruptive effects of an expansion project on
ongoing operations should be carefully assessed during the
stage of project preparation.
(c) Greater attention should be given during preparation and
appraisal to the sponsor's organizational structure and
leadership, to ensure proper management and control of the
complex nexus of project activities. For instance, the -weak
management style within CSN and the inadequacy of financial
planning created a potentially serious management situation
that was improved only after a major reorganization effort.



- vii -
(d) The Bank should be more firm in its position with respect to
continued breach of financial covenants and non-compliance
with other major commitments by the project sponsor and, in
this case, the guarantor (the Government). The guarantor did
not live up to its commitmonts to (i) maintain the required
financial ratios; (ii) provide timely and adequate equity
increases; (iii) maintain price/cost relationships at such
level* as would enable CSN to earn a reasonable return on its
assets, meet its financial obligations and further provide
funds for capital investments; or (iv) exchange views with the
Bank on the development of the steel sector (PCR, paras.
4.01-4.05; BCR, p. 131).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
CSN STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT STAGE III
(Loan 1151-BR)
I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Objectives and Description
1.01      CSN Stage III, which overlaps with Stage 11, was part of an
overall program, simultaneously with two other major Government-controlled
steel companies, to increase Brazilian raw steel-making capacity from
7.9 million tons to 22.3 million tpy. The project's main objectives were
to maximize steel-making capacity, satisfy market requirpments, reduce
production costs and improve product quality through the acquisition of new
or revamp and replacement of obsolete equipment, service and utilities
installations. It would complement investments made for Stages I and II
and make CSN, upon completion, one of the largest integrated steel plants
in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the most modern in the world. With
the ultimate development of Stage III, the expansion of Casa de Pedra iron
ore mines in the state of Minas Gerais, about 420 km from the plant, was
also required. The mines expansion included crushing facilities,
reclaiming system, loading and distribution facilities. As part of
Stage III, the mine operations were to be expanded from 2 million tpy to
9.2 million tpy of iron ore with the excess production over the Stage III
requirements to be sold.
B. Project Implementation
1.02      Completion of the project was originally envisaged for June 1981
and subsequently changed to 1982 to include improvements to the cold strip
mills 1 and 2. The main production installations start up delay ranged
from 6 to 43 months and the weighted average delay was about 31 months.
The actual implementation schedule of major facilities compared with the
plan is summarized below.
Original         Actual        Delay

Continuous Caster #2               2nd Qtr. 1981    Mid-1983            25
1.03      Delays in procurement and equipment manufacturi.ng were
responsible for about one third of the overall delay. In that respect,
administrative delays in obtaining import licenses for imported
components contributed to longer delivery periods. Lack of local funds,



particularly towards the end of project implementation, was responsible for
about one half of the overall delay because erection serv'ces for equipment
already received at site could not be contracted.
1.04      Among some of the steps taken by the management to reduce
implementation dela s were. (i) subcontracting detailed engineering work
and creating a third shift for erection of steel structures and equipment;
(ii) establishment of expediting teams to follow-up on local suppliers'
performance; and (iii) procurement policy for civil works and erection
contracts was changed so that most of them were placed with large
contractors on a unit cost basis rather than on cost plus basis. This
reduced the load on the purchasing and construction supervision departments
and facilitated cost control follow up.
C. Project Scope and Capital Cost
1.05      The total financing required for Stage III, including working
capital and interest during construction, was estimated at
US$3,439.0 million. Expressed in 1976 dollars, this corresponds to an
actual total financing required of US$2,219 million compared to a Review
estimate of US$2,813 million. Hence total cost underruns reached 19% in
constant terms and 7.5Z in current terms. The following table compares the
three estimates (appraisal, review and final).

1.06      As stated, Stage III was completed with a total cost underrun of
US$281.0 million taking into account an amount of US$87.5 million
(US$60.6 million in 1986 and US$26.9 million in 1987) to cover the
estimated cost of the remaining construction and erection work. These
savings were brought about by (i) savings of about US$345.0 million on
domestic supply, and (ii) the beneficial effect of competitive bidding on
equipment packages plus the use of turnkey system in construction
contracts. This, however, was partially offset by the increase in interest
during construction (US$342.8 million) caused by delays in start-up and the



- 3 -
increase (due to appreciation of the yen) in equipment cost from Japan
which supplied the majority of imported equipment.
D. CSN's Financial Position
1.07      The Company's problems during project implementation resulted
from two main areas: First, there was a shortage of local resources
contributions (BNDES particularly) which were not timely compensated by
sufficient capital infusions. Second, steel prices until the end of 1983
did not keep pace with inflation - average 1983 real prices were 15X below
those in 1981. Thus revenues lost from price controls further contributed
to CSN's financial and project problems forcing it to rely on increasing
amounts of debt to finance operating and project expenditures and to meet
debt service comitments. These problems were compounded by the fact that
two other Government steel projects (CST and AOMINAS), which had strong
political support, were being constructed at the same time and given
priority thus diverting resources from CSN.
1.08      CSN's financial position started to deteriorate in 1978 and
accelerated during 1980 and 1982. This situation was caused by a number of
factors, including: (i) lower cash generation despite aggressive cost
cutting measures as a result of weaker domestic markets; (ii) higher
financial charges on increased levels of short-term debt; (iii) the
staggering of authorized price increases which in fact reduced planned
average real revenues; (iv) increase in inflation with the effect of
increasing current liabilities faster than current assets thus
deteriorating liquidity; and (v) difficult international credit markets
which prevented CSN from raising the budgeted levels of longer-term debt to
pay off excessive carrent liabilities.
1.09      In mid 1982, representatives of the Brazilian Governmen.,
SIDERBRAS, CSN and IDB met in Washington to discuss measures which would
enable CSN to complete the project as quickly as possible and thus improve
its financial viability. In the resulting Memorandum of Understanding, the
Government agreed on a number of measures to fulfill this objective. In
support of these measures the Bank agreed to support Brazil's foreign
borrowing requirements and to amend the financial ratios covenants of the
loan agreements - which had been in default for several years - in line
with the financial recovery plan.
1.10      Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, the Government took
some corrective action, particularly with regard to bringing the price
levels in line with inflation. Over the following three years, though, the
timing of price increases was such that the desired results in terms of
cash generation were not fully obtained, and since price increases were
given only quarterly, inflation between periods of price adjustment
significantly reduced the average price realization.
1.11      By the end of 1983, despite operating performance at capacity
levels and an aggressive export marketing program which doubled export
shipments during that year, CSN's financial position was critical and
foreign debt repayments, including interest, had to be made on CSN's behalf



- 4 -
by Banco do Brasil in order to avoid default. In December 1983, a
Brazilian delegation visited the Bank to explain a plan of action for the
financial restructuring of CSN (in order to achieve the revised financial
ratios agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding) and other companies in
the SIDERBRAS group. The plan included, as its main features, a revised
pricing policy, capital contributions to reduce or liquidate most of the
short-term debt and rescheduling of BNDE's loans.
1.12      In early 1984, at the request of the Government, the Bank started
discussions on the prospects for Bank involvement in the study of the steel
sector to serve as the basis for the effort to re-structure and re-finance
the sector. Such study would provide the strategy to achieve adequate
operating and profitability levels throughout t:-^ qector and allow
SIDERBRAS to complete CSN and other ongoing projects, in a timely manner.
In February 1984 it was agreed that a committee of independent experts
would be set up to recommend the set of policies and decisions to be taken
by the Government and the Bank to achieve the objectives outlined above.
The Committee completed its report in December 1984. On July 2, 1985, the
undisbursed balance of about US$0.4 million equivalent was cancelled
effective January 28, 1985. At the time, although liquidity and
debt-service coverage had improved, the agreed ratios had not reached the
targets established in the 1982 Memorandum of Understanding.
E. Procurement Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
1.13      The equipment packages financed by the Bank were procured through
ICB in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Brazilian manufacturers
received a 15% preference, which also applied to bids for equipment
containing clearly identified components manufactured or supplied in
Brazil, equal to at least 50% of the value of the complete goods.
Financing of these packages was shared with IDB on a 60:40 basis. The
remaining equipment packages were financed from bilateral credits of the
supplying countries, while the line of credit for locally supplied
equipment was provided by BNDE through FINAME using the same procedures as
IBRD/IDB procurement. Civil works and construction equipment installation
were competitively bid in Brazil and financed locally. Brazilian
manufacturers won 41% of the IBRD/IDB financed packages against 60%
forecast at appraisal, and 61.5% of the packages financed by other sources,
or a total of 59.1% equivalent to US$712.9 million against the total of
US$1,206.0 million. The large Brazilian participation (which was partly
due to incentives available to Brazilian manufacturers through the terms of
BNDE and FINA&E loans) partly contributed to longer implementation time due
to slightly longer deliveries.
1.14      After the Brazilians, the Japanese were the next major equipment
supplier winning about 36% of IBRD/IDB equipment contracts or
US$384.9 million in dollar terms. The table below shows the breakdown by
supplying countries for all equipment and spare parts bid under the
project:

F. Project Administration and Use of Consultants
1.15      The Brazilian consultant played a major role in project
administration, together with the external consultants who provided limited
technical assistance in the preparation of equipment specifications,
process flow, general design and procurement, as well as project management
assistance in budgeting, implementation, construction and start-up. The
manpower used for the project management is quite significant (46.7
man-years) and is one of the reasons of the cost underrun, and the very
good quality of construction works.
II. PROJECT OPERATION
A. Production and Sales
2.01       Productivity in 1984, particularly of coke, sinter and pig iron,
dropped relative to 1983 due to lower production of raw steel brought about
by the revamping of blast furnace #3 and the labor problems that CSN
experienced for the first time in its history. However, with the start-up
of some major facilities in the same year and the rationalized operating
methods and better trained personnel, productivity improved appreciably in
1985. Although still below the forecast, sales slowly gained through 1985
as a result of CSN's effort to push sales in the international market.



2.02      CSN's sales took a sharp dip in 1980 as a result of slackening
demand, particularly from the domestic auto industry and increased
protectionism from the US and Western Europe. The reduced shipments to
local markets, however, were partly offset by increased exports in 1982/83
which accounted for about 25% of CSN's tonnage sales.
Price and Cost Relationship
2.03      CSN's gross profit margin per ton of finished products averaged
from 54% to 67% or US$117 to 145 from 1977 through 1985, as shown below:

a/  Internal prices include sales tax (ICM); external prices on FOB
basis.
b/  The average direct cost includes ICM on the materials and does not
include depreciation, provisions and other fixed costs.
2.04      From 1980, the Brazilian steel prices were among the lowest in
the world, compared with domestic prices in Japan, US and UK. The price
adjustments authorized by the Government, aside from the rates being
insufficient, were much delayed from the expected implementation or
application date. This has caused CSN losses in sales income of
approximately US$315.0 million in the period 1982-84 alone. In 1982 price
adjustment stagnated due to the Government's counter inflationary measures.
B.  Financial Results and Return on Investrment
2.05      The overall financial performance of CSN has been weak throughout
the period compared to the Review estimates. Net income and cash
generation were substantially below budget expectations mainly on account
of a depressed domestic market, and delayed and inadequate price
adjustments during a period of rapid inflation. These factors were largely
accountable for CSN's poor financial situation that led the Company to
heavily rely on short-term borrowings in order to meet capital and
operating expenses.



2.06      After the Bank repeatedly emph sized to the Govc.rnment and
SIDERBRAS the need to improve CSN's financial situation through adequate
price adjustments and increase in owner's equity, in 1984 the Government
agreed to deve'op a comprehensive pricing policy for the steel sector
allowing producers a reasonable profit margin over costs at efficient
operations, at the same time taking into account domestic and foreign
market conditions. The impact of this policy has yet to show its effect in
CSN finances.
C. Economic Benefits
2.07      Although there has been considerable delay in implementation
and a slow build up of production, the project is considered to be of
economic advantage to the country. CSN is already competitive in the
international market. CSN, however, did not generate the foreign exchange
savings as anticipated in the original appraisal (US$440 million yearly by
1981 and US$550 million by 1992). Due to the Brazilian cruzeiro's
devaluation, CSN's expenses in foreign exchange increased by about
Cr$1.8 billion annually while its yearly earnings grew only by
Cr$0.5 billion, leaving a net foreign exchange outflow of about
Cr$1.3 billion (US$30 million) per year.
2.08      The internal economic rate of return of the project in real terms
is estimated at 13.6% compared to the 17% of the original appraisal.l/
This was essentially due to the higher capital cost resulting from the
increased project scope, delayed project completion and lower than
estimated border prices resulting in smaller margins.
2.09      The project has had other economic effects with its impact on
local manufacturers who participated in the supply of equipment and
resulted in transfer of technology through consortia formed between
Brazilian and foreign manufacturers. Local participation in equipment
supply increased from 10X in Stage I to 19% in Stage II to 59.1% in
Stage III.
D. Environmental Aspects
2.10      Many environmental devices needed for the project were already
installed as part of Stage II. The remaining equipment to be installed,
including measuring devices, are expected to meet the acceptable pollution
and environmental quality levels set by the State of Rio de Janeiro. The
Company has set .p a program for environmental control management to assess
progress on a continuing basis.
III. BANK'S ROLE
A. Project Formulation and Supervision
3.01      Stage III overlapped with the Stage II expansion program along
with the other Government-owned steel companies, CST, COSIPA and AgOMINAS.
1/   Economic rate of return was not calculated at re-appraisal.



The project was appraised jointly by the Bank and IDB in 1974/75 and both
played a major role in its formulation. The leadership and organizational
changes, particularly under the Vice President of Engineering, suggested by
the Bank, led to the implementation of a new project management team which
resulted in more efficient working conditions and better performance.
3.02      The Bank was instrumental in many aspects towards the improvement
of CSN's management and operation. On implementation, the Bank recommended
that detailed engineering for civil works be subcontracted and
responsibility for erection and installation be given to equipment
suppliers to relieve CSN of too much coordination work and expense. Upon
Bank advice, CSN exerted pressure on suppliers to provide drawings more
expeditiously. On manpower constraints, CSN engaged a third shift for
erection of steel structure and equipment in order to recover lost time due
to delayed deliveries. The computerized costing system introduced in 1974,
which was of limited use to the commercial and production departments, was
improved on Bank's suggestion so that management personnel and supervisors
in all departments could make use of it as a decision-making tool. Data
processing procedures for monthly costs and product costs were
implemented. Attention was also paid to training and upgrading of skills
of the existing work force which helped CSN achieved a high production
level. Studies on cost reduction and standard costing were carried out and
emphasized to all operating managers.
3.03      CSNts export performance has been remarkable.  Its efforts to
push sales in the international market since 1982 have been responsible for
increases in its export sales with a peak of 1.1 million tons or 48% of
total sales reported in first quarter of 1985. It helped offset the
reduced demand in the local market. Tnis achievement is mainly due to the
outstanding quality of steel products produced by the facilities installed
under Stage III (the project).
3.04      Through its participation, the Bank encouraged project
cofinancing. The Bank has made it possible for CSN to acquire foreign
equipment at competitive prices through international competitive bidding.
Financial covenants and frequent Bank supervision missions were helpful in
maintaining a dialogue with the Brazilian Government and focus its
attention on the financial difficulties of CSN.
IV. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
4.01      The performance of CSN in the implementation of the Stage III
expansion program, characterized by its size, complexity and financial
magnitude, calls for several comments.
4.02      The first and most important lesson is that greater appraisal
efforts should be given to evLluate fully not only such a complex project,
but more importantly, the ongoing operations and the interfa.._e between the
two.
4.03      Second, the Bank should be more firm in its position with the
continued violation of the financial covenants and non-compliance to other



- 9 -
major commitments by the Borrower and, in this cast, the guarantor
(Government of Brazil). The Brazilian Government did not live up to its
commitments to (a) maintain the required financial ratios; (b) provide
timely and adequate equity increases; (c) maintain price/cost relationships
at such levels as would enable CSN to earn a reasonable return on its
assets, meet its financial obligations and further provide funds for
capital investments; or (d) exchange views with the Bank on the development
of the steel sector.
4.04      Third, greater attention should be given during preparati-n and
appraisal to the organizational structure and leadership competence to
ensure proper management and control of the operation and project. The
weak management style within CSN and the inadequacy of financial planning
created a potentially serious management situation that was improved only
after major reshuffle.
4.05      Finally, steel projects of this complexity and magnitude will
continue to be the most difficult among the large industrial projects, and
the experience gained by the Bank staff in this project has made them aware
of the lessons for future steel projects. While CSN Stage III has fallen
short in terms of delays and financial performance, they are only temporary
in nature. The implementation of Stage III facilities will serve to
strengthen Brazil's competitive position in the export market and is seen
as having a substantial beneficial impact on its balance of payments
through foreign exchange earnings when full production capacity is reached
contributing to making the Brazilian steel industry one of the most
efficient in the world.

FOREWORD
This document, os required by IMO, costitutes on anticipated report on thn
completion of the Stage III project of the CSN's Expansion 'D Plan.
The project following-up has been a matter of succosivo CSN monthly pro-
gress reports, duly forwarded to IBRD.
This Report follows the model suggeted by IBRD, in accordance with its letter
doted July 12, 1985 to CSN.
It Is important to notice that the project In execution corresponds to that of
the Alternative I of the work 'Review and Rework of Stage IlIl ExpansIon Project' developped
in 1976 byCSNwifl the technical asistance of Cornponhic de Projetc Industrials (COBRAPI
ond USS Enginee and Consultants, Inc. (UEC).This Al ternative chosen by CSNtobe
executod, among three studied alternotives, diffen, under certain spects, from the project
which had its general features summorized in the Report 754-BR-'BRASIL-Approisal of CSN
Steel Expansion Project Stage Ill, prepared by IBRD in 1975.
It is presented In the * Introduction' of this Report o short comparative study
between the IBRD's 'Appraisal and the CSN's *Review and Rework.
This Report superndes theReports SP-4/86 - Revision 1, of January, 1986, and
SP-7/86 of April, 1986. I contains not only revised and up-dated information, but a I so
further data and clarification, as requested in the World Bank's telex dated Decmber 4,1985,

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i,           In 1962, CSN undertook a long term expansion programn, developeJ :r thr2ee
stages. The Stage I had for scope to increase therowsteelpreduct;one;pacifytol,7 niilion
per year and became completed in 1974. The Stages Irand Ill, which were ossis;ed by th-e
World Bank, ained to rase the capocity of production to 2,45 and 4,4 mili.n i or s per I
year of liluid steel (later on increased to 2,5 and 4,6 million) respectively.
The Stage III, 171<e the Stage II, is a complex project, so it cornprises e.ien-
tially the following works: a) new s1ntering plant (no.4);b) two new co!;e ove;'  bntt:.rs 
(nos. 4 and 5); c) revamp of the existing blast furnaces (nos. 1 and 2); d) new BCW  v e, s e Ij
(LD Converter no.3; e) new hot strip mill (no.2); f3 new cold strip rl I I (no. 3); 9)    n e  w
finishing lines; h) other facilities and improvements.

iI.          In spite of the overall teclhnical. and administrative steps taken Ly  the
CSN's top manogement, and especially those related to improve the Engineering sector
responsible for the Stage III project erection, the project itself was not completed. yet.
The completion originally forecasted to June, 1981 was successively postponed. The I as t
estimates indicate the completion in the first quarter of 1987 and the full capacity to be
reached in 198k. The weighted average delay of thP S'oS?* 'II project is now around 30.8
months.Although there are several causes for this de'ay, the most ;mportont of them is the
scarcity of own financ;al resources; This defficiency con.e. from the CSN's inability   t o
generate own capital and from the restricted contributions of the share ho Ido r s to the
capital stock.
iit..        The total capital cost, as estimated in the'Review;   amounted    to
US$ 3,720.4 million. The present estimate is of USS 3,439.4 million, with an apparent
difference of US$ 285,0 million.
This difference Is due to a reduction of the projecl cost fzom US$3,025.00
million to USS 2,401.2 million (n,inus USS 624,0 million) counteibolonced by a increase
on interest  during construction that possed from USS 381.2 millioni to   UJ S $ 724. 0
million (plus USS 342,8 million).
The main causes for these value changes were the devGluation  of  the
Braz1lian cruzeiro ' (CrS) in relation to the Americon dollar, a smaller lf6ecast for
the price contingencies ond thlo project delay.
iv.          The actual cummulative production of liquid steel during the peri od cf
1977 to 1984 plus the estimated cummulalive production during th pepiod of 1985  to
1987, by the end of the Stage III, is around 20% lower than the"Review"  forecast. Th.s
factwoujd have bee,. caused by the combined effects of tho aclual and future project de-
liys and by other interval troubles, such as equipment stoppoge for ,evomping,strike onar
fire.

At present, all the metallurgical area of the Stage III project is completed
and o the Comrpany is able to produce already 4.6million tomn of liquid stel per annun.
Regarding the rolled produch, the production of 2.841 million tons in 1985 represents yet
around 7D% of the maximum capacity 6f 4.067 million tons that is forecasted for year' of
full opwution, from 1988 on.

INTRODUCTION
I - H ISTORY OF THE PROJECT
Companhia Siderugrica iNaciona! (C SN) was fo-nmed in 1941 a n d  i ts
operotions started in 1946, with the prodaction capacity of 270 000 tons per year,  of
stcel,in ingots.
In 1962, CSN began its Plan ' D' of Expansion. in three stages, as  a
part of the execution of the Bruzilian Govemment Generol policy which ciined to  sig-  !
nificantly reduce the country's dependance on externully produced steel.      j
Sf cge 1, completed in 1974, raised the CSN's steel produclcion czpoc-
* ity from 1.27 to 1 .7 million tons per year.                                 |
Stage 11, suirted in 1972 and completed in September 197/, increosed
the Steel pioduction capacity io 2.5 million tons per year, be;ng in fuli opera.ion  by   !
1979.
The works for the developpirent of Stoao Ill of expansion began ;n 1973,  i
and the techricol-econci-nicol fees .b-lity sludy was preserated lo the Banks (13RD/iDD) inr

The feasibility study was examined by IBR'D and IDB joint missions  in
May, June and September 1974 as well as Jantuary 1975, aside from several subsequent
discussion moretitigs with CSN and SIDERBPJ.S representatives.
All the feasibility study revisions since March, i9Y4 cilready  purposed   ,
a totoI production  capacity  of 4.6 millinn tons per year ofliquid steel.

In accorda've willh the 'Appraiscl, the growth of ;he C SlN proctuct iornf

4.4 million tons p;r year, together with cn incroase in produc4or, cf rcllad fl;t pv.vc'*,
46%, of which should be coated.
For the financing of this project, IBPJD would grant a loan equivalent to
US$ 95 million, that is about 4.5% of US$ 2 iOO rnililon, which is tlhe total financing
requ rement, for the internotioncil bidding of the equipmurn.
In August 1976, CSN casipned Compcnhaia Brasileiro c Piaje:c. ln;.--

CSN decided to adopr the Alternative I for the following rca.ons:
Q) It was more feasible from a financial standpoint, not only in regard to I ho  re-
turn on investritent, but also in regard to the total net profit;
b) It was quite well balanced, with regard to the   ur:it  capecities
aiming ut a high utilization rote of the main units, and sal, sufficiency with re-
gord to the metallics, except witlh reference to small purchiases of  ro II ets
(500,000 tons per year);.
c) It did not present the discvoantages of th'le Alternatives If und Ill, dependirig on  I
a supplier of plotes and on the reduction of scles of finished producft,repoctive

By molkina such a decision, CSN wa; aware of tl e fcct tha, altva.o'

II - COMPARISON BE7WEEN "APP'UAISAL" AND 'R&VI.kW
1   -               - -.- - - .     --   - -  --   -  - -
A detailed comparison unit by unit, betvween the installations
fireseen, as project scope, in the mAppraisal" and in the "Review"
i  presented in the Annex 1.
hs a resume, the main changes were as follows:
a) Sinter Plant no. 4
It had its capacity increased from 1,510,000 to 2,175,000 tons         er
year, because the "Appraisal" took into consideration a             load- I
ing of pellets in the Blast Furnaces, havit:q in sinht th4t CSNr    3t
that time, was planning to build in -Casa de Pedra"  a    pelIet if -,i
plant, with the production capacity of 3,000,000 tons of         pellets
per year, 58S of which, was for its own use.
b)jnxygen Plant
Ithad its capacity increased from 1,100 to 1,400 toins per day,  be-
cause, in the "Review", besides the need of oxygen for the BOF  shon,
the enrichment of the air for the Blast Furnaces was still taken into
account (22% for the Blast Furnaces na. 1 and 2 and 25% for the Blast
Furnace qo. 3).
c) Continuous Casting
This had its capacity increased from 3,200,000 to 3,700,000 tons   of
Steel per year. bacause, studies canducted by CStI led to the conclu-
sion that the Blooming Hiill, in view of itSobsob301e:ce.-ce,   w o u 1 d
hardly produce more than 1 millton tons per year, without a        tota;
revamp.
It was thus chosen to revamp the Continuous Castinq Machine no. 1, in |
order to enable it to pass froni 1,000,000 to l,200,000 tons per year,

while the machinesnos. 2 and 3 had their capacities specified for
1,250,000 tons each per year.
d)   Rot Strip Mill no. 2
The maximum weight of the coils was raised, in order to   reauce
the coils handling and in consequence, to imporve the metallic ef
ficiency and the productivity of the producing units.
e)   Plate Finishing Line no. 2
This line was planned to be installed in existing buildirIs.LAter
on, more detailed studies indicited the inadeqoiacy of this instal-
lation due to the size of the buildings, layout continnencies and 
products handling.
f)   Cold Strip llill no. 3
This mill, w-:ith S stands, is able to perform adequate  reductions
in products for sheets.
9)   Batch Annealing, Temper Mill no. 4 and Cold Polled Sheets Finish-
ing Line no. 3.
CSN chose the Oalvarized products market in view of its *iteract-
iveness; this led to the cancellation of lines of production   of
cold rolled sheets and gave a chance to the irclusion of    t h e
Galvanizing Line no.2, which had not been orifainally planned.
h)   Continuous Calvanizinn Line no. 3
This line was included to enable CS4 to cover 311 thc          market
thickness band, from 0.21 to 2.67nim, besides the fact that there
is a more attractive r;iarket for this product than that for   colU
rolled sheets.

i)  Painting Line
The Painting Line was cancelled, due to the fact tha.t thiI,a:ke i
section was already being assigned to private comnpariies.
2 - PROGRAM!MNG - PROjtCT SCHEDUWLES
The main diffarence Detween the Stage III project schedules   of
the "Appraisal" (Schedule "A") and of the "Review" (Schedule "B") lies    i n
the delay of the Cold Strip Mill nos.l and 2 revamping,and in the delay   o f
the Cold Str.p till no. 3 installation. These delays were necessary to  avoid
the very long paralization of the cold rolling lines which c¢n be no..ed   i n
the or'iginal planning.
With this chanqe, the to,al implcmentation time of the State  I111
project passed from 4 to 6 years, referred to the time of the purchisc-             s
issuance. Aside from that, some lines had their start-un dates de!ayed             6
*months, due to the inclusion, in the "Review" schedule, of the item  relative
to the buildings erection, that had been originally omitted. In this way, the
lines that extended their ending date of installation beyond-the           original
four years were as follovws:
- Continuous Casting nos. 2 and 3
- Hot Strip Mill no. 2
- Continuous Pickling Lines nos. 3 and 4
- Cold Strip Mill no. 3
- Continuous Annealing no. 1
- Continuous Galvanizing Line no. 3
To enable the comparison, schedules "A" a.1d "B" are   presz. :...d
in the next paqes.

necessary, to enable the comparison between Budget 'A" values and the values
presented in the "Review" budget.
Such criterium was adopted in order to allci a comparison                   on

Th!  coWparison between Budgets WA  and "B", in values  referred
to Septeuber 1976, shows that the Budget "B  surpasses Budget "A" by         USS
1,136.8 million, that-is, 61.3%.
The main variations that caused this difference were as follaws:
a) Higher value of the cost of equipment, due to the fact that the new
estimate took into account the changes of scope,as already  c a m -
mented. This.estimate, which considered the data relative to Stage
II as well as the advice from the manufacturers,(aside from   t h e
actual values from biddings already realized) p.esented a    higher
degree of reliability.
In Consequence there were also changes in the estimates for con -
itruction,erection. installations, and interest during construction.
b) Higher value for "phvsical contingencies' due to the fact that  the
calculation of this ttem in Budget 03" used a higher       per4-ntage
(one point more) than in Budget "A".
The item "physical contingenciesu is taken as the amount of   r e -
serves assigned to cover deviations caused by changes of        scope
due to occasional error in the original forecast as well as       t o
small improvements introduced in the units and installations  orig-
inally specified.
c) Higher value for the amount assigned to working capital   increase,
having in sight the projected differences between Assets and   Lia-
bilities shown in the "Appraisal" and in the "Review".

5 - STEEL MARKET
There are thre documents that r based on diffnt evoludtions of the
Brzilion steel market deman that or* involved in the sudi  concerning the imPlerenta
tion and the revision of the Stage Ill expansion project:
a) 'Feaiiblity Study: - 'Rovision 1 - Stage III Feasibility Study- Altermtive 2
of April 1975, of CSN.
b) 'Appralsal: Report no. 754-BR", of May 1975, of IBRD
c) 'Review: - 'Reviww and Rework of Stage II Expansion Pnoject, of December
1976, of CSWCO6RAP/UEC.
I - The "Fessibility Study" was based on the document known as 'MSA-3', prepared
in 1974, that evaluated the steel demand in the domestic mar*et, ;n the1974-1985
period. This projection wasm2de by TECNOMETAL,a consultants firn contracted
by IBS/CONSIDEP/BNDF/SUDENV/SUDAv.
The 'MBA-3" applied a methodology of evaluation of the steel demand by
industrial sectors, supported by a macroeconomic global demand projection, based
on an economic gowth at an average rate of 10% per year. This rate was compe
lble,at the time, with the official goalsof the 11 PND( '11 National Development Plan")
2-  Considering that the presure on the balanceof payments would still remain for a
nwnber of years, the Word Bank mission that visited Brazil in January 75 estimated
in the "Appmaisal "a GDP growth atan average rate of 7% for the period 1 975 -
1980, insfead of 10% as consideed in the If PND.
Winh the consumption structure that prevoiled to 1975, the Word  Bank
used as a base mucroeconomic prevision, prepared a new series of demand  projec
tion for the main flat products.
3-  The "Rqviewtook into account the steel detiandevuluationforthel 975-1986 pe
riod that was presented in the work 'RAM-M3A-No. 1I', by the Steel Market Cor
mittee(CONS1DEliYIB4SIDERBA4S), in 1975.

Tho 'AM-MBA-t 1o." projections were worked out when the *ffech of
the intemational energy crisis hit the Brzilian balance of payments and finally caused
the reduction of the country's development rhythm.
The GDP growth rate, that was kWpt around 10% along seven consecutive
years, dropped to 5% in 1975, this making the prior projection no longer reliable.
And so, for the shaping of the future steel demand, it w*s asummed that
the mobt probable GDP growth rates i the 1976-1985 perod would be as shown in  the
table bolow, which indiates a presupposition that therewould boa reaccel ortion of the eco
nomical growth by 1981.

6- PRODUCTION PLAN - PRODUCT MIX
/           The ptoduction plans for the years of full operation, as forewsted in t h e
"Apprmisll (198i) and in the 'Review', are shown in the following tables 'A' and "B"|
The comparison between these production plans is presented in table 'C
further on and leads to the following conclusions
i-  In both plans, the liquid steel production was considered as4,600, 000tons peryeor.
2I-   The increase of (3,771 -3,512)x iO00 = 25O0Otonsper yeor in finished products
in the "Review' plan was pfincipally a result of the following points
a) Increas, of the forecasted capacity and of the efficiency of the continuous cr-st-
ingmaichines,which madepossibleoniincreaseof700,000 'eonsper year of

b) Reduction of 36,000 tons peryearof non-flat products, which resulted in an I
increse of 21,000 tom per year of liquid steel for the production or flat prod-
ucts.
c) Incrase of production of plates In coils, with improvenent of officiency  and
shut-down of the 3/16" shear line, of low efficiency.
d) Improvement of the forecasted efficiency of the pickling lines nos. 3and4 end
shut-down of the pickling line no.2, for low efficiency.
3 - Hot Rolled Flat Products
The 'Review' offer is 275,000 tons greater, in view of the copacity  in-
crse of the continuous csting machines and the 36,000 tons reduction of noni-
flat products.

%of
hI the Review, them was also a significant offor increase of plates
(446,000 tos) an reuction of hot roll ed shet (171,000 tons). This offe.cuange
is du to tho gre  difference bween the donevaluations of the "Apprai;al
and Rsview'.
In 1975, the fint yew of the serew "he demand of hot rollIed shoots, a s
foresen in the "Rcv;ew' is subskintially lower (22%), whi;o the demnd of L _t
rolled plat  is practically the some as that of the 'Appraisal".
In 1981, the Reviiow  etimates a greater domand of heavy p'ates and  a
continuation of a snaller demand for sheets (19%). This fact caused the reoriente
tion of the CSN's offer for a remater tonnage of heavy plates.
4-  Codd Rolled Flat Products
In viewof the transference of pertof the cold flat products for the area o f
coated products (gaivanized sheets and colis arnd tin- plates), the offer of cold rol led
flat products was 301,000 tons lower.
Tis lteration of offer brought the following equipment clanges
o cancellation of the temper mill no.4 and of the finishing line no.3;
* incluion of the contirous galvanizing line no.3;
* tncreas of the foresseen production capacity of tin-plates
5- CDoted Flat Product
In view of higher demand for packicg shet and galvaniz./teme plates
sheets, aipmiectedby the 'Rview  (1984), in comparison with those c f the
"Appraisalr (1981) and in v;ew of the pfiority given by CSN to the supply of coa
ted products, the Review offer was increased of 321, 000 tons. This offer increse
was due to the inclusion of the galvanizing line no.3 and to the incrne of capac
ity of the tin-plates line.
The paniting lines were also cancel led.Th;s resulted from fhie policy of as;g

7- FINANCING PLAN
Rearding the sources of funds, the comparison botween the "Appraiscl2L
and "Review" estimates is shown in the table below.
The major causes of the variations are as follows:
*  A higher contribution of the local financing sources, due to the increased bud-
getary amounts foresseen for local mede equipment (FINAME) and for construc-
tion and erection services (BNDES - Associated credit).
* A tower contribution of biletemul loans, as a result of the reduction, in the  bud
get, of tho amount forossen for imported equipkaent.
* A higlier contribution of shareholders and cash gon'-ation, in consequence  o f
the changes in the remaining budget iHe-ns, the iter, "Contingencies"   beir.g
mainly resl)onsible for this var;ation.

8 - SELECTED FINANCIAL INDICATORS
('Appraisal" x "Review'")
As far as the financial terms are concemed, the "Review"' reflects, in com
parison to the "Appraisal" a situation of lower cash genertion in the first years,although
theis is a relative advantage in 1985. Nev,;tIeless, in consequence of the innebase   o f
long and short term debts, as foreseen in tho "Review", there is an unfavorable provision
for the evolution of the current ratio and debt/equity ratio. Theso constraints also affect
the long term debt service coverage, since the Profit before Taxes, aside from other items
of cash generation, form the numerator and the long term debt service forms the denor.;no!
tor of the fraction used to calculoze the coverage facior.

9- PERFORMANCE OF THE ECONOMICAL INDICATORS
("Appraisal' x 'Review")                                0
The "Review", compared with the "Appraisal", reflects, irn 1977 and 1981,
a lower cash genertion, due to the fact that it foreseens a longer term for the project im
plementation. Ai the end of the period, in 1985 (1983 for the "Appraisal "), tho "reviow' 
indicatod already high production levels, wtli a richor product mix, which includes   a r.
imported portion of tin-plate sheets and coils, well known as nobler products.
In the "Review", the forecast of a smaller GCst of the Pl',ducts and So r-
vices Sold, in the first yoars, reflects tht sm3ller quantities to be produced, w hi 1 a, i n
1985, the forecast of cost grceeter tham that assummed in the "Apraisal' re;accts n3t on5
a production at higher lIvels, but also a richpr mix.
However, as far es thc results are concerned,  hl  " Review" f ; i e c a s t s a
profit in 1985 lowat then that of tha "Appraiscl ", due mainly to the foreseen high  Iong
and short terms financial expones an=d depreciation.

Although all steps hove been taken, there were doloys as set forth  in

On the main reasons for the delays indicated above, it is nece ary  to
make the following comments:
a) Enigineering
The delay in the issuing of drawings and information by t he *equipmr-n-t
supp~ing consortiaiwos detrimental to t'n project development, mainly with reoiad to  te
foundoti'ondrawings, as well as to the drawings on electrical iristolhtairn a.-d fetLmn-

unsettling the execution of the field services.

The remittance of drawings and information related to certain units becanne
initially bound to the obtaining of the import licenses and this was c6using.delays; how-
ever, after further understandings with the supplierts, part of thmn agreed to providcl.hq in
fownation, so preventing longer delays.
The development of the drowings for civil works did not follow as well
the time-schedule, so hinderinig .he services xaecution.
b) Procurement
Just after the approval of the 'Review', a detailed program was es ta b -
lished for the main phases of the equipment supply contract;ng. The comparison between
the scheduled and the effective execution dates reflects a nuinber oi delays which  can
be summarized as follows: requcsts from the bidders to postpone the dotes settled for tcch
nical and commercial bid opernings; revisionsof specifications; technical or cornmc;c;al
anolyses; definition of Brazilian sub-contractor- change of consortium member;and ob-
taining of import licenses.
c) Equipment Manufacturing
There were significent delays in the mechanical and electricol equipment
manufacturing.
The erection of some units %vas affected by the delivery of supporting,
structures and equip.nent out of the settled crection sequence schedules;and other units
were offected by defects of fabricatior.
The delay toobtain import licenses become a serious problem. Insprite of
CSN'soften understandings with the suppliers, ttky did not agree in starting fabiicotion
without having the import license duly grmnted.
Until now, the erecrion ot sorne prncess lines is paraly ed by I n c 1  o f
equipment.

cd) Construction and Erection
I
lntorferences and need of special supports not initially foreseendelayed
the foundation digging services. Some controcton  in charge of the foundation    n nd
other concrete works delayed too.
There were postponements of the ending of mechanical erection, e I e c |
trical installation, piping and tests, in consequence of delays caused by the coiitractors.
Some contractors that were not following the time-schedules for the foun
dation constijctions and for the erection services or not rspcnding to the service ne6ds
have to be replaced by others, irl order to avoid longer delays.
Some unith were affected by accidei,ts with equipmentduring the erection, |
including fire.
e) Financial Rescurces
Since March 1981, due to the restriction of finoncial re.-ouices, priority
was given to the areas of steel production, hot rolling and cold rolling. The units f or
the production of coated and non coated sheets were paralysed.
Later on, these units were executed as required by the production p!an,
but in line with the restriction of the financial resources.
f) Others
The components damaged during the tost cof the units in erection   and
those used by the mointenance services were replaced by those purchased for *he  units
that had the erection postponed. This was done tr) avoidy ut the timerthe purchaseof new
components. As the erection services restarted, all components no ionyer avaiinble had
to be acquired.

The star- up of some units waited for the conclusion of others which were
delayed and also for the decision of the Company with respect to plan of production.
Part of the above mentioned delaos was absorved by the succeedin_ as-
tivities. However, other delay affected the conclusion of the work, as it is showm in the
Annex 5 by operational unit and by main cothegories.

The table below shows details of variationsobserved in the cost of theproject:
VARIATIONS OBSERVED IN THE PROJECT
(US$ Million)
Domestic Equipment                        (121.6)
Imported Equipment                          127.2
Construction                               (424.3);.

Total                       (231.0)
1.07         The cost variations, as indicated above, leading to an apparent total reduc-
tion of US$ 281.0 million can be explained as follows:
o) The domestic portion corresponding to 745 of the project cost was  strongly1
influenced by two maxi-devaluotions of cruzeiros in comrison to d o I I a rsi
which represented a saving of about US$ 345 million;
b) A substantial valorization of yenes was perhaps the moin cause of the 35% in-
creuse on the cost of imported eq,sipment from Japan where t;he rnajor volume
of purchase was concentrated;
c) Lorgeand.well definedpackagesbecomrmeittractive notonly for the equIpment
s4ppliers6ut mainly to several contractors leadingthe Comonny to good co.> 
tracting conditions. Several constnuction contracts were done by using  the:
"turhkey`systcm resulting in better beneFits thon the system used in Stage l,i .e.
contracts 'by administration".
d) The Oecessity of mainthaining port of the orgoonzationnl set-up due topreject's
delay represented a co.t increase of US$ 93 mlilion.

e) The original calculation (provision) of the price contingoncies was w-r ke d
out considering differontiated indoxes for equipment and its f re i,. t, and
others, whilo it should have been done taking into consideration the differen   I
tiotion between domesic and foreign currencies.                         I
f) Due to delays of the equipment start-uN the interest during construction sur-
passed the original provision, around US$ 343 million.
1.08         Fcr the execution of'the construction and erection services of the  t:ige !I1
project, some finms already registered in CSN were contracted. The selection wasbased on
the workir.g capacity of the contractor and on the extension of the work to be  executed.
CSN used two conftract modes:
- global price
- unit prices
The global price contract was the preferred mode; only whe.a this contrac;
mode was not possible, CSN adopted the unit prices contract, where the main parcmeaers
wero the work choracteristics and the Complete Project. This system brought better results
thon the one used in the Stage 11.
There were problems in some jobs, that disturbed the accomplishmnent of the
time schedule: delay of the comrpletioni of the erection services, c'h a n g e of contractors
which were not working satisfactorily and Intorferences with existing installations. Howev-
er, the genercl performance can be considered as a good one.
The Stage Ill project was much more conplex jhon tle Stage 1, due to thb   I
sevve-raoJ types of units.to be installed, revamp ond modetnizatinn of others, and   the
shutdown of old ones which were considered outclaused and overtaken for the greut perfor 
mance of the future project.
The international bidding for the Sioge Ill projectwasapplied for the acqusis
4ion of the equipment, taking into conAderotion lijat most of the units vere of foreigntecb
nology ond the Brazilian industry had nol yet the necessury "know-how" to satisfy the

market demand. In consequence, this 9aveorigin to the organization of "consortin usually
formed by foreigner and local suppliers, which, as required by contrachtul formalities, had
to be led by a local supplier.
The consortia were awarded with the main equipment package contracts ancr
brought to the grazilian industry a gain of notionalization of about 70%, agoinst 22% i n
the Stage 11 project execution.
During the developnient of the oroject, there were some discrepancies re-
lated to the forwarding of information and basic instruction, which were attributed by the
contraictors to their subcontractors, so cousing delays and discontinutties.
At the same time, repented delays in the remittance of drawings by fore!sn
supplier caused niany project revisionsthat; in consequence affected the ttme-schedule of
the expansior ................................... 
As a consequence of conjunctural problems, the project time-schedule had
to be altered, in some cases, in rooson of technical and econormicol conditions of Ihe s'Jp-
pliers.
As a whole, however, the performance the Stage I11 project was good not-
wisthstanding the mentioned deviations.
1.09         During the project detailing same alterations were introducod i n  t hi 9e
scope of the expansion project which omounted US$ 67 million und are listud in Ainex 7.
Major alterations were done to improve the operational croa as follows: complementary
torpedo cars, increase in the' products stocking haust, .. ndF buildings,niod                     l
fication in the plates tronsfor and refiigerotion system in the continuous costing arec. In

In the item AuxilIiry Services other expenses were udded to face warohous.
Ing. cleaning, protection of the equipment whose erection was interrupted due to limita
tion of financicl res.ourcos os well as exponses ior the preparation or worehousing  areas
for matcrials and equipment.
These different scopc changes deserve some comments, as follov s:
a) Torpedo Cars
Using the torpedo cars since 1976, CSN found out that their inde :es  of
mcaintenance  time were substantialy higherthln theforecasted oaes. Moreover, W it thiP
introduction of the operation of pig iron desulphiration, theo.3 wase aemarkoale incrnase
i-n the time of the car rur,ning up to the steel mni;l. Bosed on this experience, the. CH;a
ny decided to add 8 (ei. t) new uniMh to its torpedcl rars fle*t.
b) Stond-by Compressor - FOX's 85U ond 1200 t/d
-     The imperative need of inclusion of a stand-bycompressor for ihee;:;s: ng
Oxygen Shops was a consequence of the hard difficulties experienced by CSN .hen fo-
cing the problems presented by the oripinal compressor of the FOX 850 t/d (Siege 11) in
1977.
So, the cddition of such a unit'woa determined strictly to gjuomrnteo the
minimum wfety level required for the continuous operation of 1he BOF Shop.
c) Continuous Casting - Plates Transfer ond Cooling Systemn
At the time of development of the !wsic project for the instcilotion  of
the coslers no.2 and 3, it was realized ihat the area available for the instnllutionoft[.e 
cooling system would not be s'ifficient, if a spray system like the exisling ones were  toi
be used. In consecluence, a system for the cooling of the plnies by immersion in  tar,ks,

1.15         The execution of the Stage lll psoject was preceded of a  general
planning where solutiou were studied for several problems, such as:
a) Intemra traffic, especially during the critical phase of the civil con*ruction
taking into account root only the production activities of the pcant, but cAsn the
transportation of great masses of cotistruction materials;
. b Most economical sites for the disposal of excavation materials and normal indus
trial reiects;
c) Need of concrete, rich and thin, and adaquate sites for r.ev 'concrcet cen-

e) Settlement of job sites, provisional lodging and sanitor, installations for work-
on;
O Settlement of storage sites for materials cand equipment;
g) Auxiliory services, as mechanical shops, iron bending centrak, corpentries,
manitenance services for mobile equipment, topographic services, etc.
At the some time, preliminary CPM networks for the construction and
erectionof eoch item, as well as specific programs for the equipment procurement were
worked out. These programs, which intended to help the organization of ihe G enerol
Schedule and .to guide the bidding judgement, were up-dated immediately after approv
el of the "Review", In 1977.
The above mentioned CMP networks vwere later eniiched with t he de-
tailed taslk reloted to engineering, drawing and information forwarding, equi pment
fabricaiion and transportation, so periniiiing a better follow-up,analyses of tendencies
and control of contract terms.
Yet under the standpoint of global planning, priority wcs given  the
fabrication, construction and erection of the buildings of the rolling mills area, in or-
der, with it, to provide suitable areas for the storage of equipment.
During the phase of orders placement, there were regular meetings,
even ot the level of the Board of Directors, to follow up the main events.
COBRAPI developped a strong expediting service to assure t h e trans-
mittal of drawinys and information from the suppliers, by means of meetings, messages,
letters and visits to those firms, even overseas, ull to avoid delays or, in some  cases,
even to anticipate data necessary to carry on the project.
The preparation of drowings for the foundations and general  installa-
tions was assigned to contrc4cted locai technicel firriis, just avoiding concentration  of
services on COBRAPI and peatnitting a better control.

The local and foreign manufocturers were closely followed u p, with
ground on previously d;scussed and approved piograms. The fabrication of more critical
equipment items, their packaging ancd their transportation were appreciated   tthrough
monthlyreports sent by the suppliers and monitored by means of messages,meetings cnd
the presence of CSN representatives in t'ne factories.
In the phase of contracting the civil works and erectio'i serv ces, a pre
vious program was broadly discussed with the intereseed parties and telen a pp roved.
Through this pr-ogram, the monthly reports from the contructors and the follow/ing-up by
the CSN controlling team, it was possible to check the development of the works,  to
act immcdiateiy in case of deviation and even So rrmove future prob!rems thiat c oul d

A- Production and Sales
2.01         After conclusion of Stcge It of the Expansion Plan in 1977, CSN's Corti
production reached 2.2 million tons of liquid steel in 1978,. presenting an increase of
approximately o. 8% over the preceeding year. The big effort is now concentrcted  o n
the complotion of tho Stage Ill Expaniion up to 15987, to reach the production. capaci-
ty of .3,841 million tons of rolled productsin thatyearand 4067million from 1.9°8on.
In operating terms, the equipment In t-he metallurgical sector posted
good performances, however due to the Blast Furnoce no.3 revamp and the firsi strike in
CS N's history, the production of coke, sinter and pig iron wor. substantially affected in
1984.
In 1984, besides the no. 3 3icst I nQ_iu.e revarplp Iht following   equip-  I
ment started up for experimental operation: no.4 Cod Finishing I ire, no. 3 Continuous

IThe start-up of these pieces of equipment will practically allow the Plant
to reach in 198i the prouction levels c!oser to those foreseen for lite Project of the Stage
II of the "D Expansion Plan, not only in terns of quantity but mainly in tenrm of qual;ty

The productivity drop observed in 1984 in relation ro 1983, was a ccr.s^.-
quence of I owe r  production of raw steel between September and December, due ta 
the paralysation of the E last Furnace no. 3 for revamp and to the five days strike in Juns.
If, instead, the tonnage of finished rolled pioducts is considered, the productivity rate
of 165.13 tcn/W/yeor in 1984 is better than 158.18 ton/&,iyecr obtaiined in 1983.

The quantities of galvanized products ore quite the some of the "Rsviqw",
even with the withdrawal from opertion of the semicontinuous galvanizing line and lead
coating rnachine. The present estimates on packing sheets show a less tonnage rhan  t lie
'Review', but a greater product area, due to a thinner average thickness.
The improvements on the del ivery of rolled products are due m:ainly to th
material efficiency along the process. Only in the metallurgicol sector, where the Review' I
forecasted a production of 4,278, 000 tons of semi-finished products, the present es t i -
mates indica te 4,451,000 tons for the some quant;ty of liquid steel, with an apparent. 4* %
growth. The rolling mill is responsible for additional 4% gain in the do!lvery.

2.06         The smtalla offer of non-flat prodicts in favour of a greater offer of t he
flat ones is due lo the fact that the Gompany decided not to compete, in the future, in the
market of rails and teavy structurals, where the presence of other producers was expLcted.
In consequence , CSN did not implement the changes necessoryto incre.se
the production of the structurals and rails tolling mill, w hich slhould basically   involve
alterationm on the prcjects of 1he cylinden:; for the 3 - stcndi, optimizing thoirn wifth  t tio
intermnediate rolling mill. So, CSN centalized the offos in the flat products, produced by
modem equipment and, in consequence, more competitive.
Additionally, since the 2nd half-year of 1985, CSN took stronR  mcesues
to reduce thc prrporition of products out of litic and :t-!l othersoim;njI to the m=4-.etinc F|
more profitable products, among then. noblnr produ:s ond piching s!ioets of smllor Il.c'.!

on dates convenient to the counterinflationiary p o Icy O ny I n  1983, the  stc .1
productspriceturnedtokeeppace withtheinflation.frcknth3rd.. quarterof 1984 on,
the accumulated price adjustments redched higher mrors.
In the period up to November 1985, the steel products price had a real in-
crease.
It is worth noting that, frequently, the price adjustments for tha steel prod
ucts were authorized by the Government with a greot delay in relation to the expfcted
date of application: this caused losaes of sales incorne, besides a growth of CS N's short
tnint debts, since such adjustmcnts fall behind the growth of oosts.
Tkough the tollov ing table and charts, it is possible to raolize, in regord
with the domestic m=1k<6, that the pricc adjus'ment rates of tho smni-finishcd prodJcts,
rails cnd acces ories, structumis and bors, galvOnizoa end leadcooted shecis -r!d coils5
and also the non-coated flat products,wero kept bv!ow the Wioleanle Pricez i dex (IPA)
since September, 1976, when it was expected that tle price variation would kccp  pcca
with that index (IPA).
Rogarding the coatedand non-coated coil: and packing sheets, their Price
adjustmeni rates, up to 1982, were indeed higher than the IPA; however, this  sittiatic:n
was then inverted and ir; that year,the accumulated price adjustment remnained blcwthle
I PA.
On the whole, it is possible to notice that, by the comparison of thoe Aver
agoWeighted Price Index of the CSN products with IPA, there were threedisiinct phases:
a) from 1976 to 1979 the price adjustments were, in general, higher than tfio IPA
variation;
b) in 1980 and 198), there was a bvlanco between the uccumultcd p;icco vera
tion and that of IPA, and
it IPA = "ndico do Pragos por AIocado". (Wholesole Paico Index)

corrosnonding IPA variation.
Such behaviour of the prico adjustment in relation to tho IPA variotton rep
resented a loss of about US$315 million in tie CSN sale-, income, only in the  period
from 1982 to 1984.

Comparing these results with the Review it could be noted that a favorable
posttion only happened in 19/7.
In 1981,the steel consumption had a strong impact from tho establsked an
ti-inflationary policy, reducing the large government plans and retracting the consump -
tion of the main steel products, leading the buyers to schedule again the,ractivities ta4ing
into consideration substontioi cuts on orders to CSN.
The cost of c-oo.is sold tias influenced by this sales    t-ductiol,
and the net profit before taxes still reflects the operational expenses above
tihe prevision which are predominanitly composed by financial expenses.
Regarding 1985. the lower results cbtvainlid in tl.e first  i a 1 f
were due to a stcel production low!er than that schc-duled by operational prob-
lenS(no.3 Bl;Jst Funnace stoo)      and by loss of Pjrojfit ;,!argin due to.  t h e
steel product prices that wiere atuthorized at a lcvel belo. tl.e expected   c,one
and retarded in relation to the gro':th. As also noticed, the exportaticn3  was
lower because of prohlems related with the opening of new ttade channels thien
forced by some traditional markets, which imiposed reduced quotas to Ct.|
The cost of goods and services sold follows this tendency  a n d
the net result before income tax was negative due to high operational   e x -
penses, where the financial expenses, reflected the high level of CSN   debt.
Though the indicators show an unfavorable perfoniance for  1°85,
the perspectives of improvement will depend on political decisions and   also
on exogenous factors cuch as prices Policy,domestic market perfonrmance,inter-
national conmerce policy, interust taxes (Libor, Prime Riate) and possibility
of exploring nex potential marrets.
2.14         As a consequence of the mentioned factors (low increment of  the
real price in relation to the real increase of costs, reduced production lev-
el in comparison with the Rovie;, less rich mix by imposition of the mar:ket),

the steel prices   that    &uthorized lo-wer prices than expected and retarded
in relation to the costs gro:th.These factors which caused the income   drop-
ping, contributed to increase CSN's short-term debt, affecting its liquidity.
The Deht/Equity shows some improvement along the period.. with a
slight redjction in the lovq-term liabilities and an increase in the share ca
pital.anid reserves, nowever, w/ith insufficient funds supplied for      future

vorable position it, 1987 when compared with the Review. Only in 1982,'.tk  debt

The Debt/Service Coverage shovws a biggi-r anc! b;nger distonce from  the
forecosi, basicolly reflecling the low internol cash generation, !ong-term debt level and
insufficienit resources fron shoreholders (SIDERtB1P.S), causing inclusive tlt- sucessive cle-

2.17         The calculation of the finoncial rate of return on the Stage liI investment
(Annex 16/1) was based on the following criteria:
a) the project period of life was assumed to be 18 years starting in the year of
commissioning;
b) the cost and benefit streams were calculcted in constant money referred to Sep-
tember, 1976;
c) the puoduction costs were those indicated in thie SIDERBPAS Financial Projec-
tions - Hypothesis 'E" (November, 1985). These projections weoe prepared
with the objective of getting optional operational resuits, which covered not
only a aignificcnt mtduction of the unit cosis, but also a better product quality
and a nobler mix;
d) the incremce:'al indirect costs were considered, each year, as the sun of the
incremental adminisirative at-d salcs expenses. Tl.e incie;ner.dcl irdirect costs
adopted for the yecrs 1983 through 198.5 were those correspOncling to effective

2.22          This rmte of 13.58%, if compared, however, with that of 17. 0% estimated
in the "Appraisal', shows itself quite distant frorn the lotter. Such a distance con be ex-
plained, ma;nly, by the fact that the Stage 1II project, which wos executed in live wiih
the 'Reviev;", substantially differs from that designed in the "Aopraisal ". These  differ-
ences should respond for a greater in"luence of the factors whiclh would contribuie to a re
duction of the economic rote of return, such as the project delay, the shadow-pricingand
the higher production costs, capital cost and working capitcl, than the factors   w hi ch
would contribute t. on improvement of that rate, such as the increase of salos revenue
and the recuperation of the working copital and of 10% of the investments at the end .of
the period.
2.23          The Stoge IIl project increased the genuroa economic effects thot brought
to the country, principally, through thc stimulation of the devocopn.ent of the capital
goods manufacturing sector.
The supply to the steel indushy of equipment mnnuFactured by Bra =i I i an
firms ilon3or in consortia with foreign monufacturers,increased substantially since  the
expansion p-ojects of the steel plants have started. As far cs CSN is concerned, the par-
ticipation of the local industry in the supply of equipment increased from 10% in the Stage
I project (1974) to 19% to 19% in the Stage 11 project (1977) and to 69% in the Stage Ill
project. In recent projects of modemization at Volta Redonda Plarnt units, that  partici-
pation was almost total.

the preparation of the Stage III expansion project and the actuul   c-C)niza-

By this reasQn, althiouqh therue were already laws in force estahlishing t h e
allowable leyels of polluter concentrations in the environment, thcre was   a
lack, at the time of the Stage III project, of a mana.prial structure to care
of the environment, not only on the part of governmental control agencies,but
also on the part of the Coi'ipany. This fact prevented a global evaluation   of
the impacts that would be generated by the expansion of CStf's production ca-

III - THE STEEL MARKET
l~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.01         The time of implementation of the Stage. III   projcct   elapsed
through two very distinct periods of the Brazillian economy.
a) Period 1974 - 1980
As a result of the nearly exhaustion of its productive capacity dur
lng the first years of the 70's decade, Brazil passed to import ca-
pital goods in order to keep up the domestic economical grawth.   On
the other hand, the purchasing of big oil quantities at high prices
and of other necessary products and raw materials caused a substbn-
tial intrease of importation, at the same time.
The second raise of the oil prices in 1979 and the high interest
rates of the international loans harmed the Brazilian balance of payments,  so
compelling the country to ati economical recession In 1981, as a mean to recov
er.

b) Period 1981 - 1984
/    The economical crisis was generalized,with high inflation ;ates come
from the.prior period and a high unemployment rate.
A more significant credit value in the commercial balance of trade was a-
chieved only by a strong imporI.s reduction in 1983, and then consoli
dated by an export increase in 1984. This exporting attitude allowed
the retaking of the economical growth in 1984 and its   prossecution
in 1985.

3.02        The Brazilian domestic steel market followed, as it  would    be
expected, the economic  evo'sutior,. The year of 1980 was that of the     utmost
steel demand in the conuntry, responding to the veracity of a heated ecQfol;y.
However, starting in 1981, there was a decay in the steel demand, which   ar-
rived to 1984 with rates simnilar to those of 1978.  It is worth  noting thzat
there was a certiin recuperation in 1934, due to tLhe r-.-Lkin.g  ' Le  ec-nowV
expansion and to ti;e ex,)ortttic;. -f products with a high participation    o f

3.04       The table below shows, for the CSN's products line, the comparison
between the m,arket demand as forecasted in the "Review" and the actual CSN's
offer, in the period from 1977 to 1985. The "Review" forecasts indicated   an
yearly average demind increase rate of 13.B%, but, actually, the rate was only
of 0.8%/6 perannum. On the other hand, by the "Review", the CSN's offer in the
Stage III, in 1985, should satisfay 22% of the forecasted inarket dei,and, say,
3.77 million tons of finished products. This, however, did not happen.   With
the market recession observed sirnce 1981, the actual demand in 1985   reac'ied
only 33% of the forecasted one and the CSN demand share,  restricted to  1.6
million tons, turned at last to be about 6 percentual points superiorto  the
forecasted share.
A great part of the C'N offer, since 1981, was directed to    the
external narket, in order to coripensate the retraction occurred in the domes-
tic market; the exported tonnages were greater than 1 million tons   in  1,83
and in 1985.

As regards   the coated flat products, the rate of growth of the
CSN's offer (5.9%) even go beyond that of the demand, keeping the - Company's
share  in the domestic market around 91X to 93%. This comes from the   CSN's
position as the sole supplier of galvanized sheets and from the small  market
participation of USItlINAS, with its non-coated sheets, which are included  in
this product class.
In reference to the non-coated flat prodticts, CSN  chase        t. o
furnish only plates of the "hot strip mill", since its exparsion did not in-
volved any "plate mill", as those of the sister Com'panies. To countcrbalance,
the modern "hot strip mill", in the hot area,allied to the also modern  "cold
strip mill" and to the "continuous annealing and processings line",in :h6 cold
line, will allow a greater participation in this product class. Sc, the 23.7?o

annual average rate of growth of CSN's offer to the  domestic market is jus-
tified by the comparative advantage of the CSN hot and cold thin sheets   be-
fore the competitors.
I  the above mentioned period, CSN will continue, in view of  the
domestic markft narrowing, as one of the main exporters of Brazilian    steel
products.

As shown in the table presented, the peak value of contributions occurred
In 1983. The decoy In the subsequent years Is due to SIDERBRAS budgetary limitations.
This policy of funds advancements followed by capital contributions .hy
SIDERBRAS combined with the CSN bad financial results in the last years led to almost
total shnriiig control by the holding Company, in prejudice of the sharing of the  oth e r
stockholders.

the mon"g.ment of the following areas: Engineering, Industrial, Commercial'and Finan-

nominated as Vice-t)irectors, to manage the followin'g areas: Planning, Supplying, Con-
trolling, Contiolled Companies (subsidiaries) and Hu%nan Resources and Social Services.
The upper corporate structure was again changed in 1980 as follows:
a) suppression of the positions of Director, Executive Vice-President and Vice-Di
rectors;
b) creation of the position of Director, to manage the administrative area;
c) criation o c 4(four) Secretories, to coordinote General Planning, Supplying  ar d
Controlled Companies(Subsidiaries), directly connected to the CSN's P reside;cy.
d) The specific areas of ConWolling and Human Resources/Social Services wereres
pectively incorporated the Financiol and Administrative functionol arees.
In 1982, there was a new change in the CSN's Board of Directors in order
to m a k e ;t similar to that of SIDERBRAS . The new Board was composed as fo I l o ws  :
1 (one) President and 5 (five) Directors in charge of the following areas: Operations, De-
velopment, financial, Administration and Coordination. The Operations Director a_-cumu-
lated the functions before attributed to the Engineering Director. The Development Direc
tar took over the functions before attributed to the Commercial Director and incorporated
the Supplying Secretary later on, the latter was transformod  in a managerial function.
A new change occurred in 1983 in the Board of Directors. The number o f
Directors was increased from S (five) Io 7 (seven), to manage the areas of Social Service$
and Properties, which pertained until then to area under thc Administrative Director.
Besides the changes made in the CSN's Board of Directors, a great nuFnber
of other changes accurred in the corporate structure, at the level of the roanagerial sys -
lems . Such chcnges were due not only to new administrative philosophies of SiDERBRk,ks

A-Project Formulation and Supervision
5.01         The analysis of the conduct of both CSN and lb RD in the execution and
supervision of the Stage il project, already completed, brought many lessons to both par
ties, that led to Important steps for a better performwnce concerning the Stage III project,
as follows:
a) a deeper analysis of the Stage IlIl project concerning its basic engincering, i ts
inherent complexity and the interferences of its execution in on-going opela-
tions of the steel plant;
b) a more rigid statement of project scopes;
c) procedures for the improvement of the project detailing, in comparison  wi th
that of the Stage II, execu'ion of the works regarding all tho technical aspects,
procurement of equipment physical and financial controls)

Stage IlI', usudlly known and referred to as "AppraTsale.
In 1976, as recommended by IBRD, CSN promoted, jointly vwith its  subs;c
ioty  COBIfAPI - Companhia Brasileiro de Projctoi Especiais and under the Supervision o0
ULC - Uniled Siotes Engineering Consultants, a complete re-study of the Stage IlIl project' 
which comprised the ano!ysis of 3 (t'N.re) pr-reject'Orernatives. TViis *:cs issuee undEr the

B -Lessons to be Learned
5.05         The execution of the Stage III Project of the CSN expanion was hit  by
troubles crising fr(m the deterioration of the country economic-financial situation. Th e
Increase of Inflation rates, the exPansion of the public debts, the drop of consumption,
the increase of the oxternal debts, and so on forced the Government, to take steps that ,
simultaneously delayed the project completion, increased its cest, constrained the lcons,
of Goverrnmental financial agencies affected the CSN economnic-financial conditions.
5.06         Apporen~tly, in a prelect of such a dimension, the troubles arising  from
extemnal causes and out of the Company's Control are of difficult or even imipossible cor-
rectioan or detour by the Company itself and/or by financial agents that initially   we re
gathered.to provic:e the necessary support to the execution of thew works.
