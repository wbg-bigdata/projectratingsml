MEMORANDUM AND REM                AO OF THE    DENT OF THE
NTRNATONAL A".EYEOLPMENT ASSOCITIN
DTHE EXECIFlE DIRECIDItS
ON A PROPOSED CRED1T TO
THE REPUBUC OF MCARAGUA FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL TECINOLOGY AND LAND MAGEMENT PROJECr
1.    I submit for your approval the faowing emandum and rco mmendation on a
proposed redit to the Republic of Nicagua for SDR 31.1 mfiion (US$44.0 milin eqivalent)
to help finance the Agcultural TeDolg and Land Mana  t PrjecL The credit would be
repayable on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, Inluding 10 yes of grace. The
project would be co-financed by the Swis Dvebpment Cooperation (SDC) with a grant of Swis
francs 6.75 mMion (US$4.5 million equivalent).
2.        l      Nicaraguas economic growth and export drive are heavily dependent on
agicuiu  The agricultural sector accounts for 30% of GDP, generates over 7T% of expt
earnings, and direcy employs 33% of the work force. he fi main export ommodities -
coffee, cotton, sugar, beef and bananas- account for over 75% of agricultural GDP and 65% of
total exportL
3.   hIappropriate m   no c policies, cvl strife dung the 1980s, and severe trade
restrictions are the major factors that have affected the country's productive structu  In the
agricultural sector, a centrally controled economy with an inapprote incentive framework and
producers' dependence on direct and indirect Gove ent s es   d to a serious decline in
output. Controlled prices and production, and alocation quotas also contrbuted to the downturn
in the sector.
4.    Since the present Admi   n took office in April 1990, attempts haw been made to
correct the countrys economic imbalances characterized by uncontroled monetary expansion and
a growing fical deficit. In March 1991, the Government implmented   economic stabilizatin
adjustment program, partially financed by an IDA Economic Recovery Credit (ERC). Under the
ERC, the anti-export bias of the trade regime was reduced, government intervention in grain
marketing curtailed, and nominal protection levels for basic grains decreased to 10 - 40%. In
addition, interest rate and exchange rate management was substantially imprved.
5.    Ihe main present impediments to prvate sector led agricutural growth include: weak
government institutional performance; inseurity rei  land pwperq rights (and its negative
impact on farmers' acces to credit), compounded by technical deficencies in the cadastre, land
titling, and regtering processes; and an hiadequate agricultura technolog generation and
traner system. A particular weakss is the absence of a coherent soil management and erosion
control strategy that could effectvely address continuing environmental degradation In addition,
pesdcide pollution and poisoning is a sernous    onmental and health hazard problem in many
rura area

6.    Folowing DA's initial suport to Nicrgas adjustmet progr    IDs strategy wt
respect to the agrcultue set focIsCss on helping to refmulate the Incentive fhaewmk for
private sector involvemet and natudal resource c ation order to reverse the economic
and social decie of the past decade, and to set the country on a path of sutained gowth.
Pwject pparation acviti - helped to conceive a   _ompehive sector growth strategy
redefining the role of ke sector institutiom (tbe Minitry of Agricuture and Livstock - MAG-,
the Nicargu  ksitute of Agarn Reform - INRA and the Nicaraguan  stitute of Natual
Resourc  and the E ment - IRENA) according to a new set of function and
responsilities, and the establis int In April 1993, of the Nicaraguan Insdtute of Agricultural
Technology (INTA) The changes in suctue and organization bave been a means to increase
public sector agenee' capacity to anticipate and influence changes affDcting the factor of
producton, and to make hifomed decisions, Improving the dery of basic services and
establishing a reglatoy framework to support pive  sector developmenit Nohtithstanding
these positive de nts, without the cordinated support of the donor community, it is
unhkely that the Government woud be ab7e to undertake a comphe program addressing
the bgy isues affectig agricultural sector gowtiL
7.     e     gThe main objective of the prject is to assist Nicara in its move
towads a market-oriented economy, and to incease and disfy agricultural output and exports,
while preseving the country's natual resource base as one of the few vible alternatives to
promote sustainable economic growth. By reactivating land markets, encuging invtmt,
ceating employment opportunities and improving agitural productvt and the icomes of
small and medium famers through better access to basic agricultural services, the project will help
to amelorate the countrys extreme poverty. Specificaly, the project would: (a) establish a sound
and balnced agricultural technolog generation and transfer system aimed at optmizig public
and private resoure allocation, providing farmers with madret choices, and ensuring their fair
shae of costs and pa pation in servioe selction and evaluaton; and (b) pwvide the foundation
to secue land property rights by integating project activitis thin a consolidated set of polices
and adminsative procedures, including the establishment of a nationa cadaste, titling and
registerig progrm based on modem tehical criteria. The prject would also help protect
envirni~ntally sensidve areas by layig the bss for appropriate land use and soil consation
pracdces, and by cotroUing pestcide poludto
8. PKmjoct Descdpdo. Tue prject would have two min cmpoent  The Agiuual
Tec1adg  _Cmponet (US$21.8 minion) would decentralize agiu       public services and
sUppOrt the develpment of a demanddrven mechanism for pivate and public research and
exeion. It would consolidate public reseamh and techno    tranfer services into the newly
created and de l  INTA, incoporatg si onservation and pestide management as
integral parts of the system. Spcificaly, the pject would, through INTA, support pgram  for:
(a) Tnodoky Validation and Transfr (IVI) to emphasize crop management research and
extension focused an small and medum farmers, inclung an artisanal seed progam; (b)
Inteated Pest Manament; (c) Soil and Water Conservation; (d) Research Grants-, and (e)
Academic Stdie  In addition, the Agicultural Technolg Component would support (a) a
MAGAIRENA Pestcide Management Pwgram, as part of establishing a national environmentally
sound strategy for pesucde use and  et; and (b) a Private Technical Asisn  Pgram
to help famer groups conct technical ssde from the private sector.
9.    The Laud                p       (USS33.6 millon) would support the desi  and
implemnetation of a nao  cadaste, land titing and land regiatio system. Specifcall, the
poject would (a) stramline   d    n and improve inter-ag   ooria   of  RA,

di           d technial grouwork for the fuue demarcation of the boundaries of
indigenous lands and natr reseve   he project would also support a Project Coordintig
Unit (UlS$24 mUion) to coodinate and monitor Implemntation ofboth components, and specia
studies
10.   &mW g Cost and   IgdU& Total project cost is estimated at US$57.8 milon (Schedule
A). The credit wold povide SDR 31.1 million (US$44.0 millon equivalet), GON US$9.0
milo, SDC Swis fhacs 6.75 milion (US$45 millon equialent) and frmers US3,000. Of
the total prwjc cost, US$47.1 mllon are ivetment cut and US$10.7 miin incmental
recuent cos  The credit would fund 24% nf icremtal recuten cas on a decling bais,
for the pilot Private Technical Assistance Program for agricultural etenksi, given the need to
st  field acstites and raie the current low lvel of operating xpenditures. he credit would
also fund 63% of local costs, a level warrted by the countrs severe mac-economic constrants
and prevaing poverty. To promote the smooth start-up of INTA progrms and urgetly needed
cadaste and land titlng activdes, retractiv financing of up to US$1.0 milion is recommended
for projct expenditues    red after March 31, 1993. Schedule B shows tbe amounts and

13.   Deu rin i° IDA                          uhhement g the past 20 years, Nicara
has reeived two Bank loans and two IDA cits for agriculture, amounting to USS82.6 mill.
Two loas (In 1974 and in 1980) were for diected eredit; one IDA acedit in the late M97Mh was
for a na ide agcultue and  dustry wehabilitiona progrm, and a second IDA credit in 1981
financed pretment sbtue
14.   Key lessons from these oprati and other BankiDA cepie   relevant to Nicaag
are that the lack of a compe_ ie approach to agrculu  sector leng and a distorted
incentive framework undemine struural adjustment efforts and weaken econemic initiatveL In
addiion, project success depends on the Government's ability to build-up poltcal consensu for a
setor reorm prgrm of the scale underway in Nic_aru  whih will be supported and continued
by the proje
15.   In light of eqxpince in Niaragra and elswhere specal attention has been given during
pIoect prparation to the need for imprfiving grnment agencies' ml aion capacity and
coordination btween them, cearly  e     pject objectve, and eliminating ovakpping
institutional   onlitis Simpcity in pjet  deig is being pursued by fousn on key
obetive within the overal sctor polc framwrk mplmented under IDB's Agrultural
Str Adjustment Loan (AGSAL4 The AGSAL was approwved by IDB's Board of Directors in
December 1992, and has its origin in the joint IDA/IDB  -Iefication msio of Febuary-March
1992, which also identified this proposed project.
16.      de   r WA Iiormes The project is an integad part of IDAKs  te
sratea, particulay those aspects dealing with institutional and policy reoms, the  hbiitation
Of key secto;s, and improvig the busie  enironment for the private sector and export
development. As such, the project wudd build upon the Geconomic stabilization
and the agricultrl sector adjustment progrm  supported by IDA' ERC and IDB's AGSAIL
resetvey. Ibe project would be the first Bank or IDA-assisted agricultue project since 1980,
and would lay the groundwork for future operations in the sector. IDA involvement in the
poject would allow the transfe to Nicaaga of Bank-wide exeiene with agricultura
teholog and land management projects. Moroer, IDA inoment in project prpation
has already proven useful in helpig design a comprehensve sector strateg and m attrting
support for other muliateral and biateral donors, incudig cooperation with DRB. Ths
coordinoating wrle woud continue thugh dose upeision of the project.

21.   Project Benefits he project would prvide a meas for Nicargua, duing a period of
economic rcntucton, to jumpstart' the agriulural sector by introducing a new demand-
dri  approach to technology generion and trsfe, and by upportn the requred
technologcal and institutional framework for defining and ensuring land property rhts. As a
result, the projea a  pected to: (a)  nat higher agriul   output growth and mprve
smal famer income through an enhanced technology genertion and transfer system; (b) develop
and stengte sector policies and institutions; (c) reativate land markets and sector investment
as a result of the reg atn of agrarn popety ris; (d) foster new emplyment
opportuniies m the agricultural sectr, (e) mprv the qualitq and cost-effectivens of public
services to the sector, and (f) Integrate envnntal c e    ionto sector planning and the
teHmq of land atbn i i    (ie., cadaste, titlg, and regit) and agricultural techolog
services. Under the Agriuurl Techology component, 34,500 mostly small and medium famers
would benefit directly from research and extension progrms and, under tb ld MLanag
componen  50,000 lanholde would receive secure tide to their propety. Non-quantifiable
benefits of the project include: (a) creating a conducwi environment for prvate invstment,

cmpetion ad nnovatio through a improved policy, legand rgltory famework (b)
suprt  hum   esoue development tbrough trainig (c) Imroving the delivery of basic

poplatonwith limited poli* aticlo economic inuece; and (d) respondng to agro-ecological
imbalne wi a view to conseving the countrys natual resoure bas.
22.   BaL  A major risk relates to the Goenenets commitment to the agreed sector
poly firaework and to the breadth of institutonal and tchage proposed,
compounded by limited project implementatn capaci at the government leveL In particular,
the decent     n of agricultural services may not be carried out as forcefidly and efficiently as
planned~  To mitipte this risk during project preparation, concerted effort were made to desig
and agree on a reaic deceta    n prwam and major og i           changes ad policy
took place prior to Board presentatio n addition, the IDB AGSAL Policy Matrix,
prepared in paralel with the proposed project, and endorsed by IDA, specifies an hsttutional
fimewor establishing explicit policy priorities and a clar division of labor between sector
23.   The potcal seniivity of land tenure issues and the fraie nature of the economic
reform proce in Nicragua may also jeopardi project implm  o    he effective
enactment prior to Board presentation of an agreed and dearly defined reguatoty famework
should sificantly improve the poltical and economic enironment. Govenmet recgnizes the
seity of the poblem and has started to take effectvc acion towads completig the ogoing
pr    of land    nts,    ving competing claims, completing the classification of unduly
expropriated  or assged rural propertes, and proceeding with a fomal financial    ion
24.   Remm              I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Emecutive Dlrectou approve it.
