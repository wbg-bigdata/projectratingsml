F. Results Framework Analysis

Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The Project Development Objective was to mitigate environmental and health risks
associated with chlordane and mirex in termite control by (a) demonstrating the
elimination of their use through the introduction of integrated pest management in
selected areas, and (b) preparing a national replication program for complete phase-out of
chlordane and mirex in China.

  The above PDO is exactly as presented in the PAD and it had always been used during
implementation for monitoring and reporting purposes. Consequently, this PDO is used
in this ICR for final assessment of results. However, it should be noted that the PDO
presented in the project Grant Agreement had a slightly different formulation: "to assist
the Recipient in substituting the use of chlordane and mirex (which are harmful to human
health and the environment) with integrated pest management techniques ("IPM") as a
means to control termites in Jiangsu and Participating Provinces; and establishing a cost
effective framework for promoting IPM in termite control."

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Context. The project was conceived in 2003 to contribute to China’s efforts in
complying with the Stockholm Convention on elimination of persistent organic pollutants
(POPs)1. The Stockholm Convention, that initially-listed twelve POPs, was adopted in
2001 and entered into force on May 17, 2004. As a country strongly committed to the
Stockholm Convention, China ratified it and became a Party to the Convention on August
13, 2004. Parties are requested to prohibit and/or take the legal and administrative
measures necessary to eliminate the production and use of the chemicals listed in Annex
A of the Convention, which includes chlordane and mirex used as termiticides in China.
China needed to completely eliminate the production and use of chlordane and mirex five
years after the date of entry into force of the Convention (i.e. by May 17, 2009), unless it
would request registration of specific exemptions for a period of up to another five years.

Sector Context. At project appraisal, China had one of the most diverse termite
population and most severe termite damage in the world. Since their introduction to
China in 1964 and 1979 respectively, chlordane and mirex were the main insecticides for
termite prevention and control in termite control in residential and public buildings in
China. Their effectiveness, persistence, low cost and ease of application have led to their
widespread use and contributed to the fact that termite management in China heavily
relies on chemical methods. In December 2004, there were nine chlordane and five mirex
manufacturers in China, all located in Jiangsu Province. From 2000 to 2003, they
produced between 450-820 tons of chlordane and 9-31 tons of mirex annually. It was
widely recognized that the use of both termiticides posed significant local and global
risks to human health and the environment.

Issues addressed by the Project. The project was designed to reduce the production and
use of chlordane and mirex for termite prevention and control in the building
constructions sector. The project tried to address the key challenges that hindered the
phase-out of chlordane and mirex in China including: (1) lack of effective alternative
chemicals; (2) lack of integrated pest management (IPM) expertise for termite control;
(3) ineffective termite control policies and regulations; (4) weak institutional capacity for
chlordane and mirex phase-out; and (5) insufficient public awareness and education.

Demonstration Approach. To address these sector issues comprehensively while allowing
flexibility to fine tune the interventions along the way, a demonstration approach was
selected. The demonstration of introducing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) concept

 These chemicals were widely used for their low cost, stability and effectiveness. Their use in recent decades have
become banned or severely restricted, however, due to increasing evidence of their toxicity to people and the
environment, their tendency to accumulate in the food chain, and their ability to travel long distances through global
ecosystems and persist in the environment.




                                                            1
and technologies (the monitoring-baiting system in this case) as a way for phasing out
chlordane and mirex, took place at a provincial level in China. Demonstration
experiences were expected to be incorporated into preparation and implementation of a
nation-wide replication program.

Project Financing. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), the interim financial
mechanism of the Stockholm Convention, supports demonstration projects under its
Operational Program for Reducing and Eliminating Releases of Persistent Organic
Pollutants (GEF Operational Program 14). The Bank, as an implementing agency of the
GEF, has the responsibility to assist its client countries in achieving the global
environmental objectives supported by the GEF, which is consistent with its 2001
Environment Strategy and its Country Partnership Strategy 2006-2010. The Bank’s
technical expertise in POPs management and its experience in the design and
implementation of GEF projects made it well suited to extend its assistance to China’s
POPs program.

The Bank’s Early Involvement in POPs Issues. The Bank’s Canadian POPs Trust Fund
supported China from 2002 to 2003 in developing and organizing awareness-raising
workshops for public officials representing relevant provincial and municipal level
authorities, POPs experts, scientists and researchers, and representatives of industries that
produce or consume POPs.

It was in this context that the World Bank was requested to assist China in mitigating the
environmental and health risks associated with chlordane and mirex through a
demonstration project with the GEF financing. The project’s high-level objectives were
to help China meet its obligations under the Stockholm Convention and to contribute to
the global effort to control POPs.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

The Project (Global) Development Objective (PDO) stated in the PAD was to mitigate
environmental and health risks associated with chlordane and mirex in termite control by
(a) demonstrating the elimination of their use through the introduction of integrated pest
management in selected areas, and (b) preparing a national replication program for
complete phase-out of chlordane and mirex in China.

This PDO is the one presented in the PAD, which had always been used during
implementation for monitoring and reporting purposes. Consequently, this PDO is used
in this ICR for final assessment of results. However, it should be noted that the PDO
presented in the project Grant Agreement is a slightly different formulation: “to assist the
Recipient in substituting the use of chlordane and mirex (which are harmful to human
health and the environment) with integrated pest management techniques (“IPM?) as a
means to control termites in Jiangsu and Participating Provinces; and establishing a cost

                                             2
The only performance indicator of project outcomes (the PDO-level indicator) was “no
use of chlordane and mirex by termite control professionals in the demonstration area?.
The performance indicators of project outputs (results indicators) were the following as
stated in PAD Annex 3:

   a. Component 1: (1) The project team at CIO and local PIUs adequately staffed,
      trained and equipped; (2) CTA, NTA, and technical experts recruited; (3) Semi-

      documents reviewed, revised if necessary, or issued.
   c. Component 3: (1) The IPM Operation and Training Manual disseminated; (2)
      IPM training conducted to train at least: (i) 3 managerial personnel from each
      termite station; (ii) about 100 researchers; (iii) 3 trainers from each participating
      city level station; and (iv) 10 termite control operators from each termite station;
      (3) About 400,000 in-ground bait systems installed for preventive treatment of
      newly constructed buildings; (4) About 500,000 above-ground stations installed
      for remedial treatment of buildings; (5) Use of 150 MT chlordane and mirex for
      termite control in the demonstration area eliminated; (6) Integrated termite
      management website published.

      permanently; (2) Contaminated facilities, equipment and waste from the
      manufacturing site removed; (3) Hazardous waste from the plant closure properly
      disposed; (4) Plant owners and workers compensated for lost income.
   e. Component 5: (1) Workshop on monitoring and evaluation conducted; (2)

It should be noted that the presentation of three results indicators under Component 4 (1,
2, and 4) in the ISRs is slightly different with the above in the PAD. The rest of the
indicators are the same in both and ISRs. Since the nature of the three results indicators
are the same in ISRs and PAD, the PAD indicators were used as presented in the ICR
datasheet for the ICR assessment.

1.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

There was no revision of the project development objective or the PDO-level indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project main beneficiaries were the Termite Control Stations (TCSs) in the
demonstration areas (initially-included Jiangsu province, Anhui and Hunan provinces



                                            3
identified at the beginning of project implementation, and the other five provinces:
Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang added at the later stage of project
implementation) that used chlordane and mirex for termite prevention and control before
the project. The project provided free monitoring-baiting and monitoring-dusting systems
to these TCSs and provided incremental cost for installation and monitoring of these
systems (labor, travel etc.). The managers and technical staff benefited from the project
investments in better understanding the IPM concept and use of IPM technologies for
termite prevention and control, as well as better working environment and safety
conditions.

Urban population especially those living in termite rich areas in the three provinces and
five provinces where IPM technologies were demonstrated or tested as alternatives to
chlordane and mirex for termite prevention and control were also important beneficiaries
of the project as their exposure to toxic chemicals were reduced. In the long-run, the ban
on use of these POPs will benefit the entire population. Other project stakeholders also
included the national and local government agencies including the Ministry of Finance
(MOF), Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD), the National
Termite Control Center (NTCC) of MOHURD, the provincial and city-level Financial
Departments, Environmental Protection Departments, Construction Departments, and
Pricing Bureaus.

1.5 Original Components

The project had six components at appraisal which are summarized as below:

Component 1. Institutional Capacity Strengthening (GEF US$971,919), including
establishment of the project team in FECO/MEP and the three PIUs (incremental
operating cost); hiring project CTA, NTA and other individual experts; project inception
workshops and project management training workshops.

Component 2. Policy Framework for Elimination of Chlordane and Mirex (GEF
US$640,000), including formulation and revision of policies, regulations and standards at
both the national and provincial levels in order to facilitate the phase-out of chlordane
and mirex and promote IPM for termite control.

Component 3. IPM implementation (GEF US$9,677,281), including development of IPM
training manual and conduct training programs for different target groups; public
awareness and information dissemination campaigns; demonstration of the IPM
technology (monitoring-baiting systems); and research and development activities.

Component 4. Closure of Chlordane and Mirex Manufacturer (GEF US$940,800),
including permanent physical closure and dismantling of the chlordane and mirex
manufacturing facility of the Liyang Guanghua Chemical Company; and clean up the
facility’s chlordane and mirex contaminated site and disposal of chlordane and mirex
waste.




                                            4
Component 5. Monitoring and Evaluation (GEF US$74,000), including a monitoring and
evaluation workshop, annual project review meetings, and development of management
information systems to track project progress.

Component 6. National Replication Program for Elimination of Chlordane and Mirex in
China (GEF US$748,000), including a technical consultation workshop; development of
a national replication program (NRP) for elimination of chlordane and mirex in termite
control based on the experiences gleaned from the demonstration area; preparation of
environment impact assessment (EIA) reports for the rest eight chlordane and mirex
production sites; a national consultation and dissemination workshop and an international
workshop by project completion.

1.6 Revised Components

The project Grant Agreement was amended in March 2007 as expected to include
additional demonstration provinces: Anhui and Hunan. Under this amendment, the
project funds were reallocated. There was no any change to the project components and
indicators.

The project was restructured again in December 2010, because of the following: (a) the
project implementation suffered delays (see details in section 2.2) since its beginning and
some project activities were not completed by the original closing date (December 31,
2010); (b) by the end of 2010, the project had savings of about US$ 3.8 million resulted
from the procurement of bait systems; and (c) the IPM option - monitoring-baiting
technology demonstrated in the three provinces proved effective for termite prevention
and control but with higher cost than use of chlordane and mirex. FECO proposed to pilot
another IPM option – monitoring-dusting technology which the Chinese considered more
cost-effective than the monitoring-baiting technology. Therefore, FECO through MOF
proposed to extend the project closing date for one year in order to fully achieve the
PDOs by completing the originally-designed and newly–added project activities.

The newly-added activities to address project delays and sustainability issues included:
(a) a second-round IPM training, additional public awareness activities, MIS installation,
training and use in all involved TCSs, and monitoring and evaluation activities in the
three demonstration provinces; (b) one more contaminated site for cleanup in Jiangsu, (c)
a pilot program on monitoring-dusting technology in five new provinces representing
different region and climates, by which the IPM concept can also be introduced to more
provinces since FECO decided not to seek further GEF financing to support the NRP, and
(d) IPM training for all other provinces in China infested by termites. All these activities
were considered to fall into the same definition of the PDO as presented in the PAD.
Under the second restructuring approved by the Country Director, the project component
3 and 4 were modified in the Grant Agreement as below:

   1. An additional activity was added to Component 3, “Integrated Pest Management?:
      Carrying out program for the pilot application of monitoring-dusting system for
      termite control in the building construction sector in selected participating termite



                                             5
      stations. Termite Stations in five new provinces (Guangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang,
      Jiangxi, and Sichuan) were selected based on termite infestation situation, termite
      species, region representativeness, the management and implementation capacity,
      as well as the willingness and support from the local governments.

   2. Component 4, “Closure of Liyang Facility in Jiangsu Province? was revised to
      “Closure of Selected Chlordane and Mirex Facilities in Jiangsu Province?:
      Permanently closing and dismantling selected facilities that produce and store
      chlordane and mirex; cleaning up the chlordane and mirex contamination at the
      facilities; and disposing the chlordane and mirex wastes.

Under Component 4, the Liyang Guanghua Chemical Co. was identified as having the
largest production of chlordane and mirex and it was selected during the project
preparation for closure and dismantling of its plant and cleanup of its contaminated site.
The company was consulted and agreed to participate the project. However, during the
project implementation, the company changed its mind and decided not to participate in
the project because it considered compensation from the Chinese government for its
closure to be insufficient for re-building the entire plant. Therefore, another chlordane
and mirex producer (Liyang Xinhai Chemical Factory) was selected to replace Liyang
Guanghua based on the EIAs conducted under the Component 6. At the later stage of the
project, one more chlordane and mirex production site (Changshu Fengjiang) was added
for cleanup under the project based on the EIAs as well. In total, the project financed
dismantling and cleanup of two chlordane and mirex contaminated sites. Closure of the
two plants was compensated by the Chinese government.

FECO/MEP, Jiangsu Environment Protection Department, local government in Liyang,
and Liyang Environment Protection Bureau had also urged closure, dismantling and
cleanup of the Liyang Guanghua Company site. By the end of 2011, the Liyang
Guanghua contaminated site has also been cleaned up with Liyang government’s
financial support, but its closure was not compensated.

Another change is the number of bait systems. The total 400,000 in-ground (IG) bait
systems (for termite prevention) and 500,000 above-ground (AG) (for termite
remediation) bait systems were originally estimated based on the construction area
treated by chlordane and mirex in 2003 (most recent data during project preparation) in
Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces (Zhejiang dropped from the project before the project
appraisal), and then were reallocated to the finally selected three provinces (Jiangsu,
Anhui and Hunan) based on their consumption proportion of chlordane and mirex.

During the March 2008 supervision mission, the Chinese experts (based on an assessment
report) proposed to reduce the number of AG bait systems to 150,000 sets and increase
the number of IG bait systems to 1,042,860 sets based on experience gained from use of
bait systems through a small-scale pilot procurement. The reasons were (a) the number of
AG was overestimated (seven systems per infestation as originally designed against
newly proposed two systems per infestation, and (b) both AG and IG should be used for
termite remediation instead of using AG only. This change was agreed among FECO, the



                                            6
three PIUs and the Bank team during the mission and reflected in the second Grant
Agreement Amendment in December 2010.

In April 2010, due to implementation delays on installation of bait systems, procurement
of about 30% IG bait systems was cancelled. Therefore, the final number of the AG and
IG bait systems procured under the project, including the small-scale pilot procurement,
two competitive procurements, a procurement for maintenance purpose beyond the
project life, and a procurement proposed by Anhui only and used for its historic buildings,
were: 151,500 AG and 762,000 IG bait systems.

The above project activity changes resulted in project intermediate results indicator
changes as listed in the table below.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
The project implementation evolved beyond its original scope and scale, but always
within the originally-designed PDO. At a later stage of the project, project activities were
adjusted according to the project circumstances. Its implementation focus was shifted
from demonstrating one single alternative IPM technology (monitoring-baiting
technology) to diversifying IPM technologies (adding dusting technologies), engaging
more TCSs to participate the project, deepening policy outreach, IPM training and public
awareness, establishing and using management information system for termite control
practices, as well as expanding the scale and demonstration effect of contaminated site
clean-up activities.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Factors during preparation that contributed project implementation and outcomes

Firstly, project component design were appropriately responsive to the following key
issues facing China on elimination of the two POPs in order to meet the Stockholm
Convention requirements as well as to the government’s efforts to reduce environment
pollution and to protect human health.

a.   Policy constraints. Before the project was conceived, some strategic directions and
     policies as stated in the PAD Annex 1 were undertaken and established by the GoC
     on control of production and use of chlordane and mirex. However, the background
     analysis concluded that these policies were not effective in helping China reduce and
     phase out the production and use of chlordane and mirex in termite prevention and
     control, in particular, the 15 years quality guarantee and pricing policies.

b.   Lack of appropriate alternative technology. The background analysis also identified
     that as of 2004 China registered and applied some chemical alternatives to chlordane.
     Such chemicals include fenvalerate, permethrin, bifenthrin, imidacloprid, and
     chlorpyrifos. However, these alternatives have some serious limitations in
     comparison with chlordane, including short preventive protection period (less
     persistent), higher price and unfavorable odor. Moreover, these alternative chemicals
     are not necessarily safer than chlordane (oral LD50 for rat: 200-700 mg/kg). Due to
     potential health risks, chlorpyrifos (oral LD50 for rat: 95-270 mg/kg), for example,
     was removed from the market for termite control in the United States in 2000.

c.   Limit of Public awareness. The background analysis found that public awareness
     about the adverse impacts of chlordane and mirex on human health and environment
     was very limited.




                                             8
Secondly, in accordance with Article 5e of the Stockholm Convention to “…promote the
use of best environmental practices…,? it was suggested by the Bank to consider
introducing IPM concept for termite prevention and control in China as an alternative
approach to phase out chlordane and mirex in order to fulfill the Stockholm Convention
and also avoid large-area treatment by using other non-POPs toxic chemicals. The IPM
approach is to use the least amount of bio-pesticides (less toxic and less persistent control
agents) to prevent and control termite population by eliminating termite colonies near
structures. Selection of an IPM technology during the project preparation was based on a
review of different IPM technologies and scientific data of successful colony elimination
were available only for certain bait systems, thus the monitoring-baiting technology was
chosen as the core technology and the most suitable for achieving elimination of
chlordane and mirex through best environmental practices. However, China had no field
experiences on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for termite control before the project.

Thirdly, the provincial PIUs were proposed and established. At the national level, China
established the National Leading Group for Implementation of the Stockholm Convention
in 2003 when developing the National Implementation Plan for POPs. SEPA (now MEP)
was the lead agency and was authorized to manage all POPs activities in China. The
Convention Implementation Office (CIO) under FECO of SEPA is responsible for day-
to-day compliance work. A termite project team was established in CIO/FECO. However,
the project selected establishment of the provincial PIUs to manage most project
activities instead of limiting to individual demonstration sites only managed by
CIO/FECO, this was because the project aimed to promote a partial shift by
demonstration from the chemical approach to the IPM approach for termite control and
therefore it considered effective capacity building focusing on perception and behavior
changes crucial for promoting IPM concepts and technologies. The implementation
mechanism of setting up provincial PIUs was adopted in order to build the technical and
management capacity at the provincial level with involvement of more TCSs and the
provincial government agencies. These PIUs were jointly established by the provincial
government departments including the Environment Protection Departments (EPDs), the
Construction Departments and the Termite Prevention and Control Associations and
housed either in the EPD or in the Construction Departments. Project activities including
IPM manual development and training, policy reforms, public awareness-raising
activities and demonstration use of bait systems were designed to support in building the
management and technical capacity.

Fourthly, project preparation was built on public awareness workshops on POPs for high-
level officials in China and linked to the ongoing termite studies financed by the
Canadian POPs Trust Fund and pesticide studies financed by the Italy Trust Fund. Both
Trust Funds were supervised by the Bank. Therefore, there was strong support from
MOF, MEP and the three provincial governments to the project including counterpart
funding commitments for both project implementation period (originally 4 years) and 11
years after the project life for continued monitoring of installed bait systems. This
arrangement was based on the 15-year quality guarantee policy.




                                             9
Fifthly, the project design considered simultaneous phase-out of chlordane and mirex
consumption and production. This approach has emerged as one of the main lessons from
the implementation of a highly successful program on phase-out of ozone depleting
substances in China. It was expected that by the end of the project, the three provinces
would completely stop the use of chlordane and mirex. Accordingly, equal amount of
production of chlordane and mirex would be reduced as well. This would sustain the
phase-out. In addition, as chlordane and mirex are toxic chemicals, the project financed
not only dismantling of the selected chlordane and mirex producer’s facilities, but also
cleanup of the contaminated production sites.

Factors during preparation that delayed project implementation and outcomes

However, there were some factors and events during the project preparation and design,
which caused substantial delays in project implementation since it started. Firstly, this
project was one of the few projects in China for the first time to apply financial
monitoring report (FMR)-based disbursement method. However, the FMR was not well
understood by the participating provinces and lack of immediate training hindered initial
project implementation progress.

Secondly, the demand of AG bait systems was largely overestimated. Although almost
all TCSs in the three provinces were invited to participate in the project for use of AG
bait systems, installation of AG was not able to be completed by the original project
closing date and waste installation of AG bait systems still existed during the project
implementation.

Thirdly, most of the project indicators are output-based instead of outcome-based;
especially indicators for measuring effectiveness of bait systems are missing. It caused
difficulty by the end of project to collect sufficient data for proving the demonstration
effectiveness of bait systems applied in the three provinces. And the project design
encouraged the participating TCSs to install IG bait systems as preventative measure
mainly in newly-constructed buildings, which normally do not have apparent termite
activities in early years after construction, thus no bait consumption (woods need to be
replaced with baits when sufficient termites are found in the bait stations) was recorded in
most of the IG-installed sites during the short monitoring period after installation from
2009-2011. This led to insufficient data collected and available for analysis on
effectiveness of bait systems.

Fourthly, the project provided support to facilitate some policy and regulatory reforms
considered essential to the achievement and sustainability of the project objectives, but it
would have been better to include stronger measures to help guarantee these reforms
were carried out within the project time-frame (i.e. some key policies should be in place
before the project close).

Fifthly, during project appraisal, the risk that use of baiting systems would be more
expensive than the use of chlordane and mirex in termite control mainly due to the high
labor cost for installation and monitoring during the 15-year quality guarantee was rated



                                            10
as moderate. This was under-rated in terms of its sustainable and replicable use after the
project life and mitigation measures were not sufficiently considered to be incorporated
in the project design.

Lastly, if participating provinces (Jiangsu and Zhejiang) had been selected through a
competitive process at early stages of project preparation, it might have been possible to
avoid implementation delays caused from adding other provinces to the project (see
details in section 2.2).

A “Quality at Entry? review conducted by the QAG in 2007 rated project preparation as
Moderately Satisfactory (3) overall. Strategic Relevance and Approach, Technical,
Financial and Economic Aspects, Environmental Aspects, and Risk assessment were each
rated Moderately Satisfactory. Poverty, Gender and Social Development, Fiduciary
Aspects, Policy and Institutional Aspects and Implementation Arrangements were each
rated Satisfactory (2). Bank Inputs and Processes were rated Moderately Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

Factors during implementation that contributed to project outcomes

Ban of the two POPs. During project implementation, a public notice, banning the
production, consumption, use, import and export of chlordane and mirex in China from
May 17, 2009, was issued to fully fulfill Chinese commitments to the Stockholm
Convention regarding these two POPs. This Ban provided a solid legal base for
completely phasing out the two POPs, although this was not expected at project appraisal.
This marked the achievement of one part of the PDO (phase-out of chlordane and mirex
production and consumption), exceeding the goal of 150 tons set up in the original
project design well ahead of schedule.

Stronger Capacity building. The project implementation supported two rounds of IPM
technical trainings to different target groups: managers, technicians, operators in TCSs.
Additional trainings on IPM concepts for financial management staff of the TCSs, staff
from property management companies for demonstration sites, and local government
officials were also provided. A total of over 5,000 managers and technicians were trained
on the IPM concepts and practices. In addition, Management Information Systems (MIS)
for recording applications of bait systems were installed and trained to all participating
TCSs (more than expected at appraisal stage) in the three provinces (Jiangsu: 59, Hunan:
105, Anhui: 86) during the project implementation.

Broader public awareness. Through the project implementation, public awareness on
risks associated with chlordane and mirex and the IPM concepts and benefits was broadly
raised. It turned out that many public and private institutions (enterprises, schools,
residence communities) actively requested the TCSs to install bait systems for termite
control in and around their buildings or houses, and also offered support to prevent bait
systems from being stolen or removed.




                                           11
Strong local government support. The support from the provincial government agencies
to the project implementation was significantly stronger than expected. The provincial
Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Housing and Urban-Rural
Development, the Bureaus of Finance and Pricing were all involved in the project,
receiving IPM concept trainings and reviewing and issuing revised policies and
regulations, and providing counterpart-funding in a timely manner. In particular, the site
cleanup was strongly supported by the Liyang city and Changshu city governments. It
guaranteed timely completion of cleanup.

Project activity adjustment. In order to overcome the project delays, project activities
were adjusted, including: (a) reducing procurement of overestimated AG bait systems and
cancelling the last tranche procurement of IG bait systems; (b) inviting all TCSs in Anhui
and Hunan and most TCSs in Jiangsu to participate the project; (c) allocating more
project funds saved from the procurement of bait systems to support second-round IPM
technical training and public awareness on IPM; (d) urging issuances of policy reforms to
promote IPM; (e) revising the standard “Experimental Method and Evaluation on
Effectiveness of Pesticides Registered for Termite Prevention and Control? in China to
encourage registration of safer and less persistent pesticides for termite control; (f) MIS
installation and use in all participating TCSs; (g) collecting data for evaluation of
demonstration effectiveness of bait systems; (h) carrying out cost analysis of bait systems
and chemical treatment; (i) testing another IPM technology (monitoring-dusting
technology) in five new provinces; and (j) cleaning up one more contaminated site.
FECO also proposed to conduct a project implementation evaluation for the three
provinces. All these adjusted measures facilitated project completion and achievement of
the PDOs.

Factors during implementation that delayed achievement of project outcomes

The project implementation experienced substantial delays that delayed timely
achievement of project outcomes. Actions were taken to overcome those delays, while
the project closing date had to be extended. The project implementation progress was
rated moderately satisfactory (MS) from the first Implementation Status and Results
(ISR) report of the Bank in May 2007, and had been MS until the December 2008 ISR.
As a result, the Bank rated the project progress unsatisfactory in June 2010.

Late start of project implementation due to changes in project provinces. Two
demonstration provinces with the highest consumption of chlordane and mirex (Jiangsu
and Zhejiang) were originally selected for the project in order to gain sufficient
experiences in different termites and different ecological and climatic conditions.
However, Zhejiang decided not to participate in the project in January 2006 just before
the planned project appraisal. The Project was processed and approved with only Jiangsu
province confirmed and one or two more provinces to be identified during
implementation. This was considered as the best option by the Bank, MOF and SEPA in
order to start project implementation earlier as the selection of new provinces would take
at least six months. It was very difficult to identify one province to match exactly the
chlordane and mirex consumption of 71.2 MT (150 MT-78.8 MT committed by Jiangsu)



                                            12
that was required in the Project, and only Anhui and Hunan expressed their interests and
met all agreed selection criteria, therefore both provinces were proposed to be included in
the Project, resulting in a total consumption phase-out of 139.4 MT in the two provinces2.
The project Grant Agreement was amended in March 2007 to include Anhui and Hunan.
However, before the two provinces were added, no project activities were initiated as
expected.

Low government efficiency and inefficient disbursement. The implementation agreement
between MOF and SEPA was signed only on August 22, 2007, and the project designated
account under MOF was finally opened in September 2007, 14 months after the Grant
Agreement was signed in July 2006 3 . Due to lack of timely training on FMR-based
disbursement arrangements during the project preparation stage and early project
implementation stage, the first withdrawal application was made in June 2008, which
means 24 months after the Grant Agreement was signed. This halted initiation of some
key project activities: policy revisions, public awareness activities and IPM training for
TCSs which were very important to facilitate smooth installation and monitoring of bait
systems and avoid many technical difficulties, public’s interference and losses of bait
systems. These activities were only initiated after June 2008 when project funds were
available to the PIUs. This consequently resulted in delays of installation of bait systems,
thus insufficient data collection on effectiveness of bait systems and cancellation of the
last tranche procurement of IG bait systems due to project duration constraints.

Bait system procurement and installation delays. During the early project implementation
stage, there were only three suppliers of bait systems registered in China: Dow
AgroScience (Sanction bait system), Ensystex (Exterra bait system) and Changzhou
Yekang (Yekang bait system). In order to quickly gain hand-on experiences of using bait
systems, it was proposed and agreed to do a small-scale pilot procurement through direct
contracting first. However, the small-scale pilot procurement was not started until July
2007 after Anhui and Hunan were added to the project. Although the project was
launched in Jiangsu earlier in July 2006, it had to wait for the other two provinces as
FECO had arranged during the project preparation to procure the first batch (30%) of bait
systems together for all three provinces (the small-scale procurement was considered as
part of the first procurement) considering the PIUs did not have procurement experiences
following the Bank’s procurement rules. The following table provides a snapshot of bait
system procurement and installation.

  The Bank team completed the appraisal report for the two provinces in December 2006 and GEF approved it in
January 2007. Under the GA amendment in 2007, the project indicator on chloredane and mirex production phase-out
was not revised.

3 The ICR team was not able to find the reasons why the implementation agreement between MOF and SEPA was
signed and the project account was opened so late.

In addition, site cleanup also encountered delays due to the decision by the Liyang
Guanghua Co. to withdraw from the project; however, this did not affect the project
progress and the final achievement of outcomes. Jiangsu PIU made great efforts to
facilitate the completion of cleanup at the alternative site by the end of 2010.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The project had weaknesses on M&E design. Firstly, there was just one
outcome indicator and it focused on phase-out of use of chlordane and mirex only,
without any outcome indicators for monitoring IPM demonstration. Production phase-out
of 150 tons chlordane and mirex was considered as a results indicator (not an outcome
indicator) under the project component 4. Secondly, too many results indicators were
proposed and most of these results indicators are outputs-focused (not outcome-oriented),
such as indicators for training, installation of bait systems, and policy aspects. The
original results framework did not cover the complex and multi-layered PDOs stated in
the PAD.

M&E Implementation and Utilization. The M&E reporting on the project was done by
CIO and the three PIUs through the semi-annual project progress reports. As most of
project indicators are output-based, the project progress reports just well recorded outputs
of main project activities. Thus, the project progress reporting did not fully measure
whether these activities result in the outcomes required to achieve the goals of
components and the PDOs.

MIS development and utilization was supposed to be a good M&E tool to track
installation, monitoring and demonstration effectiveness of bait systems during the
project implementation.    The project financed software development, basic hardware
equipment for operating the MIS, as well as MIS training for all participating TCSs in the
three provinces; however, the development of MIS was initiated late and completed,
installed and functional in all participating TCSs only at the late stage of project
implementation (Jiangsu, end of 2010; Anhui, September 2011; and Hunan, May 2009).
This impacted negatively the implementation and the meaningful results of the MIS,
which was supposed to be completed during early stages of project implementation.

To overcome the M&E design and implementation weakness, the project financed, at the
project later stage, additional studies/activities including collection of data proving
effectiveness of baiting systems, cost analysis of baiting systems and chemical spray, and



                                            14
project implementation evaluation. Results and data from these activities were used to
assess the PDO achievements in the ICR (see specifically Section 3.2).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

Site cleanup. The project was classified as a Category A project. The key environmental
safeguards issues in the project were the site contamination and potential risks related to
the permanent physical closure and dismantling of the chlordane and mirex
manufacturing facilities and site cleanup under the Component 4. An open bidding
process was adopted for selection of a qualified contractor and the site remediation was
successfully completed; i.e. production equipment were dismantled and cleaned for
recycling, buildings were cleaned and/or torn-down, contaminated soil were in-situ
and/or ex-situ treated, and all the wastes were properly disposed of. Hazardous wastes
were treated in an qualified incineration facility, high-risk contaminated soil was sent to
cement plant for co-treatment, medium-risk contaminated soil was chemically de-
contaminated and backfilled, and low-risk soil was treated and recycled as the cover soil
in landfills.

Besides the originally planned closure and cleanup of one manufacturer, the project also
took an overall approach to assess the other 8 chlordane and mirex manufacturers in
Jiangsu under the replication component. Therefore, initial environmental impact
assessment (Phase I Site Assessment equivalent) were conducted for the 8 plant sites,
based on which 4 sites were selected as priority sites and a further environmental
assessment was conducted for these 4 sites. This provided a solid foundation for the
Liyang Xinhai site which can be quickly selected as a substitute for Liyang Guanghua
site and also for selection of the second site for cleanup.

Pest Management Plan for the demonstration Provinces/Pilot Provinces. The project
activities met the objectives and targets set up in the project Pest Management Plan and
complied with the provisions of OP 4.09 and BP 4.01 Annex C. Pesticides used in the
project demonstration provinces comply with both the national pesticide legislation and
the selection criteria in OP 4.09 and their use is fully justified under an IPM approach.
The pesticide used in the testing of the “monitoring-dusting? technology and the one
recently registered for such technology also comply with the selection criteria in OP 4.09.
The measures taken to reduce risks are adequate and consistent with education, skills, and
equipment of users. The use of all pesticides is always conducted by trained personnel of
the selected termite institutes who are equipped with appropriate protective gear. The
participating termite stations paid keen attention to operational safety when handling
pesticides and urged them to keep copies of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for
all new products used in the demonstration areas. The Bank team encouraged
representatives of the three demonstration provinces (Jiangsu, Anhui and Hunan) to share
some of the chemical baits with other provinces before their expiration date to avoid that
they become obsolete.




                                            15
Environmental and social benefits. The elimination of chlordane and mirex will reduce
environmental and social impacts associated with termite control. Annex 3 of this ICR,
Economic and Financial Analysis, has detailed summary of the benefits. Although
difficult to quantify, the environmental and human health risks from using chlordane and
mirex will be largely reduced.

Financial Management

The project had adequate project financial management system that provided, with
reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information that the Grant is being used for the
intended purposes. The project accounting and financial reporting were in line with the
regulations issued by MOF and the requirements specified in grant agreement. However,
disbursement was slower than planned at the initial stage, mainly due to unfamiliarity of
the FMR-based disbursement approach. This issue was rectified in March 2008 through a
comprehensive training. Thereafter the withdrawal procedure and funds flow started, but
were still slow up to early 2010 due to implementation delays.

PIUs’ financial management was satisfactory, partly due to standardized fund
management. Special project accounts were created and financial statements and reports
were prepared in line with Bank procedures. An effective internal control system through
annual financial audit was maintained to ensure that project expenditures were properly
authorized, supporting documents were maintained, accounts were reconciled
periodically and project assets, including cash, were safeguarded.

Procurement

Yearly procurement plans were developed and shared with the Bank team for review. The
updated procurement plans were disclosed publicly in time in accordance with the Bank’s
requirements. Procurement of all works and goods as well as selection of consultants
under this project was carried out satisfactorily by following the Bank’s Procurement and
Consultants Guidelines. Procurement documents were found to be properly maintained
by FECO and the PIUs in the three provinces during the Bank’s annual post review.
FECO and the PIUs in the three provinces have adequate capacity with qualified staff in
carrying out procurement under the project. The grant was used for the intended purposes.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

At the national level, the Management Regulation on Termite Prevention and Control in
Urban Construction revised under the project proposes to reduce the warranty period
from 15 years to 10 years. This policy is expected to be issued in late 2012. The
Guidance on Replication of IPM Technologies for Termite Prevention and Control in
China drafted during the project is now under review by relevant ministries. It is
expected to be issued soon to support replication of the termite IPM in the entire country.
Furthermore, provisions of requesting set-up of targets for applying termite IPM nation-
wide have been included in the draft 12th Five Year Plan (being reviewed by MOHURD)




                                            16
on termite prevention and control in China, which is a substantial step forward for IPM
replication in China.

Among the three demonstration provinces, Hunan province, during the project
implementation stage, issued a new price policy which increased the unit price for termite
prevention from RMB 2/m2 to RMB 2.5/m2 for newly-constructed buildings. Although
this increase was limited to cover the full cost of using bait systems which is two to three
times more expensive than chemical treatment calculated based on the 15 year warranty
policy, it reflected Hunan government’s efforts to make changes adapting to the IPM
approach. In order to sustain the project outcomes, i.e., the participating TCSs will
continue to monitor bait systems installed under the project for the rest of the warranty
period and the termite IPM will be replicated in broader area in the three provinces, all
the three provinces were urged to consider the adoption of mechanisms to ensure the
project sustainability after the project ends. The project sustainability mechanisms listed
below were reflected in the project completion report prepared by each provincial PIU.
The commitments in writing from all provinces were considered satisfactory, especially
the needed counterpart funding as committed during the project preparation stage are
reported available.

   a. Financing guarantee. All provinces committed sufficient funds from its
      provincial Finance Bureau and from the Termite Control Station’s charge fee for
      termite prevention and control. See Annex 1 for counterpart funding amount.
   b. Management mechanism:           The administration authority in the provincial
      Department of Housing and Urban - Rural Development will incorporate the post-
      completion operation management into its daily management work in the termite
      sector. The Termite Control Stations will incorporate monitoring of bait or
      dusting systems installed under the project implantation into their daily work on
      termite prevention and control.        The technical operational manual and
      policy/regulations issued under the project will be followed. The MIS will be used
      to track monitoring after the project.
   c. Staff guarantee: All TCSs participating in the project will maintain sufficient
      technicians and operators to continue their responsibility of monitoring bait or
      dusting systems installed under the project. Technical training will be regularly
      provided to them as needed.
   d. Policy and regulatory guarantee: All provinces promised to continue follow-up
      on issuance of the policies and regulations promoting IPM revised under the
      project.
   e. Supervision mechanism: The provincial Termite Prevention and Control
      Association will incorporate regular supervision to all TCSs into its regular
      management and supervision work. It will also provide technical assistance as
      needed.
   f. Public awareness during post-completion operation: Public awareness activities
      will be continued through news media including newspapers, TV, websites, etc.
      and will be expanded to building developers and builders, property management
      companies, building owners and individual households.




                                            17
During the last supervision and ICR mission in December 2011, the Bank team met all
PIUs’ managers and also managers from the five TCSs in the new five provinces. They
all expressed strong willingness and support to sustain the IPM approach and continue
monitoring of those installed bait or dusting systems, because it is realized not only by
the Chinese government agencies but also by the public that spraying large amounts of
toxic chemicals (POPs and non-POPs chemicals) are not sustainable for the termite sector
development. The IPM approach demonstrated through the project has proved effective
and very promising for replacing toxic chemical spray. All the participants were
confident that China will continue to develop easy-to-use, environmentally-sound, cost-
effective and domestically-produced products and tools to practice termite IPM in the
future.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory

The PDO is deemed highly relevant to China’s commitments to the POPs Stockholm
Convention and the global efforts to control POPs in general and to eliminate chlordane
and mirex in particular. At the national level, the government strategy of eliminating
POPs pesticides and reducing risks to human health and environment from toxic
chemicals through promoting the use of best environmental practices has been remained
high priority. At the global level, the elimination of chlordane and mirex in China has
contributed in long-range to reduce transportation of these chemicals to other countries.

The project design and implementation are also relevant to the specific National
Implementation Plan for phasing out POPs in China. The features of the project
components closely mirrored the development directions in the termite control sector.
The project was also consistent with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with
China for 2006-2010, one of the five pillars (pillar 3) is to “Manage resource scarcity and
environmental challenges, through reducing air pollution, conserving water resources and
optimizing energy use (partly through pricing reforms), improving land administration
and management, and observing international environmental conventions? and the
progress report for CPS in 2011 has reported that China has made great progress within
its 11th Five Year Plan period. The project was also strongly supported by the line
ministry (MOHURD) as a means to replicate the termite IPM nationwide in the future.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project met its PDO (even with some delays) in three main ways: (a) environmental
and health risks associated with chlordane and mirex were mitigated through complete
phase-out of the production and consumption of the two POPs; (b) the IPM approach
with the monitoring-baiting technology was promoted in three provinces and the
monitoring-dusting technology was tested in five provinces; and (c) the national
replication program for termite prevention and control in China was prepared and has


                                            18
been included in the draft 12th Five Year Plan for termite prevention and control in China
(which is currently under review).

IPM concept is well accepted (perception changed). Through the project implementation,
the project has facilitated a change in the attitude toward termite prevention and control
practice among those involved (TSCs and the public). A total of 94 training workshops
on IPM concepts and techniques were held for 5,754 management staff and
technicians/operators on termite prevention and control. A number of public awareness
activities in different forms (including IPM demonstration site signboards, bait system
installation signs, posters, brochures, news reporting in publications, public campaigns,
TV shows, Videos and press conferences), as well as five research and development
activities were carried out. All these activities influenced perception changes of both the
termite control service providers and the public who ultimately would benefit from these
improved termite control services.

Reduction in pesticide use is one of the two pillars for termite IPM (the other is to reduce
termite populations by colony elimination) and it is clear that this concept has had
impacts on the Chinese termite control personnel participating in the project. The
representative from Hangzhou Termite Control Station has stated in his report that by
using monitoring-dusting systems, the station has reduced pesticide by 900-fold (4 kg of
fipronil dust vs. 3,590 kg of chlordane that would have been used in the same sites). This
is a drastic change from the past when the success of termite prevention and control
application was measured by the larger amount of pesticide being applied.

Policy framework for promotion of termite IPM established. During the project, a
number of regulatory developments occurred at the national (6) and provincial levels (25)
that provided a good enabling environment for the promotion of termite IPM. These
policies, regulations and technical standards provided guidance and support to sustain and
replicate termite IPM in China. In particular, an important policy measure, additionally
proposed at the later stage of the project implementation, was the completion of the draft
“Guiding on Replication of Integrated Pest Management Technologies in Termite
Prevention and Control? led by FECO. This Opinion will be jointly issued by MEP and
MOHURD in 2012. This further supported the achievement of the PDO (promotion of
termite IPM) not only in the three provinces but also in other provinces infested by
termites. This policy will also support implementation of the national replication program
during the 12th five-year period.

Termite IPM (monitoring-baiting systems) proved effective4. The project supported the
termite IPM demonstration (bait systems, see Table in Annex 2) in three provinces with
all participating TCSs (Jiangsu 59; Hunan 105; and Anhui 86) involved by the end of
project. Between early 2008 and summer of 2011, about 694,100 IG and 151,500 AG
stations were installed at 55,354 buildings and/or sites including residential buildings,

  Data used in this section are from the data collection report on bait system effectiveness, the completion reports from
the PIUs, and the completion report on the other five provinces provided by the National Termite Control Center.




                                                           19
schools, manufacturing plants, office buildings, hospitals, commercial buildings,
historical sites, parks and green areas (sidewalks and median), military facility, and other
public utility (water and electric) buildings. The total buildings areas protected by IG
systems reached around 166 million m2, resulting in the replacement quantity of
chlordane by 372 metric tons. For the current soil insecticides (chlorpyrifos, permethrin,
bifenthrin, fenvalerate), the replacement amount was estimated at 260 metric tons. The
application of AG systems replaced the mirex use by 163 kg. Although the amount was
the total of three-year period, the bait systems were used only in approximately 15% of
the termite control operation in three provinces. Among the 7,378 sites where termites
consumed AG baits, the confirmed elimination rate was 77%. With the 100% acceptance
rate and 90% confirmed elimination, AG performance was the best in Hunan province.

Environmental and health risks associated with chlordane and mirex mitigated by
complete phase-out of chlordane and mirex. The project was successful in mitigating
environmental and health risks associated with the two POPs by providing crucial support
to a complete phasing out in production and consumption of chlordane and mirex. By
May 2009, the Chinese government needed to take a decision on whether to ban the two
POPs production and consumption entirely, or to request for a registration of specific
exemptions for another five years. At that time, the government was facing international
and national pressures because of the spraying of large amount of toxic chemicals (POPs
and non-POPs chemicals) in the termite control sector. Based on the IPM demonstration
effects (including pilot use of bait systems, training provided and policy reforms
initiated) produced at the early stage of project implementation, the GoC decided to
completely ban the production and consumption of chlordane and mirex nationwide since
May 17, 2009 (even by losing the opportunity of requesting registration of specific
exemptions for the two POPs). It is certain that introduction and demonstration of the
termite IPM approach by the project greatly influenced the government's decision to issue
the Ban for complete phase-out. For this, the project provided an ongoing platform
(already proven an effective one) to continue testing and disseminating IPM concept and
technologies to expand the substitution of the two POPs in the coming years. The project
definitely increased the GOC's level of comfort with this tough decision and provided
assurances it was possible to maintain an effective and efficient termite control level by
using newly developed IPM technologies and chemicals.

Environmental and health risks associated with the two POPs were also mitigated by
cleanup of contaminated sites. China had a total of nine chlordane and mirex producers.
All of them were closed by May 2009 following the issued Ban. The total production of
the two POPs was reduced from 303.5 tons in 2005 to zero in 2009. The project financed
environmental impact assessment of eight chlordane and mirex production sites except
for the Liyang Guanghua site, for which an EIA was carried out during the project
preparation stage. Two sites (i.e. Liyang Xinhai and Changshu Fengjiang) were selected
for contaminated site cleanup for demonstration purpose under the project. A total of
6,946 m3 contaminated soil, 550 m2 contaminated buildings inner-surface, 398 m2
contaminated buildings and 6.4 tons hazardous waste were cleaned up and/or disposed.
The cleanup experience will be used for cleanup of the other sites.

Locally-produced benign chemical registered. In addition to less quantity, termite IPM
also requires the use of less toxic and less persistent pesticide. With this demonstration
project, efforts have been put in place to register safer and less persistent pesticides for
termite control. One such benign chemical, ivermectin was recently registered for termite
control in China, and may be incorporated in dust or bait for future use. Ivermectin is
one of the bio-pesticides, and is a fermentation product by soil actinomycete bacteria. It
is highly toxic to target species such as insect pests, and less persistent than most organic
pesticides. Since the Chinese termite control personnel has recognized the importance of
using less toxic and less persistent insecticides, it is expected that more such benign
chemicals will be sent to pipelines for registration in China.

Advanced technologies (Infrared Camera, GPS and other tools) used. Although the
monitoring-controlling system uses less pesticide, it is also more labor intensive and
costly than conventional methods. As part of the research and development activity of
this demonstration project, Chinese expert has developed the domestic version of
electronic sensing/monitoring system so as to remedy the labor cost associated with the
monitoring phase. The practical application of this electronic system needs to be further
tested by the market, but this is the type of innovation that is needed to sustain termite
IPM in China.

Through the demonstration project, several new detection technologies such as infrared
camera and acoustic emission device were introduced to Chinese termite control
personnel. These new technologies allowed them to use a more targeted indoor
application of pesticide such as AG baits to further promote reduced pesticide use. The
introduction of these new technologies also stimulated innovations on the part of Chinese
termite control expert to develop or adopt other technologies to advance their pursue of
termite IPM in the daily control practice. The Nanjing Termite Control Station, for
example, is testing a precision GPS device to locate IG stations that are often difficult to
find when they are buried beneath vegetation or soil. Once improved and simplified, the
device may save time and labor for IG application and make the baiting system more
sustainable. It is also expected that the cost of IPM options will go down as more
systems will enter the Chinese market (from international and local sources) and labor
costs will decrease as termite institute operators gain experience in installation,
monitoring and maintenance.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Satisfactory

A traditional cost-benefit analysis was not possible due to lack of available data and
difficulties in measuring the overall environmental and health benefits. A cost-
effectiveness method was used for the analysis. The significant benefits generated from
the project are the environmental and health benefits resulted from phase-out of the two
POPs production and consumption coupled with the use of IPM. The proxies used to
evaluate the benefits clearly recognized that environmental and health benefits from
phase-out of the two POPs would be greater than economic value of using the two POPs




                                             21
for termite prevention and control since environmental contamination and health issues
would cost huge efforts and financial resources to recover.

The cost-effectiveness analysis has shown that in order to achieve the goal of phase-out
of production, consumption, import and export of chlordane and mirex in China through
termite IPM, the project, compared with the “without project? scenario, has provided an
efficient way to assist the Chinese government to fulfill its obligation to the Stockholm
Convention with technology demonstration, policy support and technical assurance. It is
significant that the project’s IPM experiences will be used in the national replication
program. See more details in Annex 3.
.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderate Satisfactory

The project was and remains highly relevant to GoC priorities on environment protection.
As stated in Section 3.2, the project was successful in achievement of mitigating
environmental and human health risks associated with the two POPs as well as other non-
POPs insecticides through demonstration of the termite IPM and development of the
national replication program. However, the project experienced substantial delays as
mentioned in Section 2.2 to achieve these outcomes; and sustainability and replication of
termite IPM remains challenging. Therefore, the overall outcome is rated as MS

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project, through the Chinese Government’s support and finance, addressed specific
poverty impacts by assisting former chlordane and mirex production factory employees
with alternative employment opportunities, training and cash support, according to their
choice and after consultation. A social assessment was conducted for the chlordane and
mirex producer Liyang Guanghua that disaggregated the project-affected population by
gender and income and provided opportunities for stakeholder participation in developing
mitigation plans to respond to the employment and income impacts of factory closure.
Gender equity in relation to the mitigation of the negative impacts of factory closure was
ensured by providing to both male and female employees opportunities for consultation
and choice of various options.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

It is commonly recognized that the institutional capacity has been strengthened through
the project implementation. The project, through introducing IPM international
experiences (IPM concepts and monitoring-baiting technology for this project), has
assisted the national and provincial governments in China in finding environmentally-
sound alternatives to toxic chemical treatment for termite prevention and control and in
making policies to sustain the development of the termite control sector. The annual
project review meetings and workshops strengthened the inter-provincial coordination.



                                           22
The project has also assisted CIO/FECO/MEP in establishing itself as a leading agency in
China providing strategic guidance and technical assistance on POPs phase-out. All the
staff of CIO and PIUs has attended training in project management (e.g., filing,
procurement, financial management, MIS and others). In particular the project
implementation has enabled CIO/FECO to strengthen its capacity in coordination with
the line ministries, the oversight ministries and the provincial government agencies,
mobilization of domestic funds, project and knowledge management, and procurement
and safeguards.

The IPM demonstration has strengthened technical and management capacity of the
Termite Control Stations. The technical assistance through the project chief technical
advisor (an international consultant) transferred international IPM knowledge to them.
During project implementation, termite professionals attended several workshops to learn
the concept of IPM and on the specific use of bait systems and dusting systems. Several
provincial representatives participated in exchange/study visits with private termite
control professionals in the United States. The improved IT system through the MIS
development and use under the project will standardize their termite prevention and
control practices and improve their working efficiency and effectiveness.

Chinese scientists had opportunities to network and exchange ideas with international
experts in the field. The project has also enabled relevant research institutes and
universities to strengthen their capacity in development of domestically-produced
products and tools for termite prevention and control.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

Three contaminated sites including Liyang Guanghua site were cleaned up during the
project period. The successful cleanup experiences will be transferred and replicated to
other potential sites. Additionally, the cleaned lands will be used for new development
bringing possibilities for more job opportunities and other environmental, social and
economic benefits.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The Project Implementation Evaluation Report done by an independent consultant hired
by FECO included a survey of recognizing IPM approach. The interviewees included the
three PIUs, residents of the communities where the IPM approach was applied and some
TCSs which demonstrated the IPM approach. The survey results showed high
acceptance rates. The report is available upon request.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The overall risk to the development outcome is rated moderate on the following basis.
Through implementation of the project, mitigation of environmental and health risks
associated with chlordane and mirex by phase-out of the two POPs was successfully


                                          23
achieved nationwide. Chinese termite control personnel and the key stakeholder has
recognized the importance of using less toxic and less persistent pesticides at smaller
quantity for their termite control practice, and has been actively developing their own
versions of needed technologies to sustain termite IPM in China. Efforts were made to
revise policies and regulations so as to promote and sustain termite IPM in China. The
closures of POPs manufacturing plants eliminated production of chlordane and mirex,
and the adoption of bait systems in three provinces replaced substantial quantity of liquid
termiticides. The public’s knowledge on environmental and human health risks
associated with toxic chemicals and IPM has also increased.

However, sustaining the termite IPM in China is still facing challenges: (a) IPM
technologies require high operating cost during the post-completion project operation
stage, especially when the warranty policy of 15 years remains unchanged; and (b) non-
POPs chemicals have emerged and are being used in China.

The cost difference between IPM technologies (especially bait systems) and liquid
termiticide applications is largely due to: (a) the higher cost of the imported bait systems
(baits and stations, in this initial demonstration stage through the project) and (b) higher
labor costs required for annual monitoring after installation. It is expected that the cost
of IPM technologies will go down as more locally developed products (i.e. baits or
dusting chemicals) are registered in China and labor costs will decrease as termite station
operators gain more experiences in installation, monitoring and maintenance. Capacity
built through the project in China will be extended to address these challenges in the
termite control sector.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

During the project preparation, the Bank maintained an intense dialogue with the
government (FECO and MEP) and other key stakeholders (the National Termite Control
Center under MOHURD, TCSs in selected demonstration provinces, the international and
national termite experts). The Bank team made full use of studies undertaken by the
FECO to collect comprehensive data and information on termite control: (i) the Strategy
for Phase-out of POPs Pesticides in China, funded by Italy and supervised by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP); and (ii) the Termite Study and five high-level
public awareness workshops on Stockholm Convention, funded by Canada and
supervised by WB. These have laid a solid base for development and adoption of the
project with introduction of the IPM approach to replace the two POPs in three
demonstration provinces.

The project design had weakness as mentioned in section 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, including
weakness in M&E (design of results framework and project indicators), weakness in risk


                                            24
assessment, insufficient training on the disbursement mechanism, and insufficient
demand analysis of bait systems. These weaknesses led to frequent adjustments in project
activities and extending project closing date during implementation. Therefore, the Bank
performance at Entry is rated as MS.

The key concerns raised by the Quality Assessment Group (QAG) were some issues
relating to overall design (specifically measures to ensure key policy and regulatory
reforms are undertaken), a lack of economic analysis and associated questions relating to
sustainability of the selected IPM technology, and some weaknesses in M&E aspects and
risk assessment. The QAG also raise that the PDO and indicators focused only on
phasing out use of chlordane and mirex, whereas it is clear from the project design that it
is equally aimed at shifting users to termite baits (and possibly other IPM-compatible
technologies in future) rather than just substituting other chemicals. It was also pointed
out that some alternative design options (physical barriers) were rejected, based upon
advice from a workshop of experts but sufficient convincing explanations were not
provided. Also, there is no explanation why baits are provided to termite control centers
during project implementation for free.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank team provided high degree of coordination not only with the implementing
agencies (FECO and PIUs), but also with the oversight agencies including MOF and
MORHUD. At least thirteen supervision missions were undertaken by the Bank. A
number of field visits were undertaken to ensure compliance with safeguard policies, and
to verify physical progress and achievements. There was also regular, monthly and
(even) biweekly follow-up reviews in many instances especially when the project was
facing substantial delays and being in the process of back on track after the MTR review.
The Bank’s Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of
the project and provided project progress information to the GEF. There was also a very
high level of inputs from the Bank’s procurement, financial and safeguards staff
throughout the project, both in ensuring fiduciary requirements were met, and in
providing training for FECO and PIU’s staff.

The significant project implementation delays were discussed with Bank management.
The Bank management provided sufficient guidance for the task team to assist FECO and
PIUs in addressing project issues. The Bank team closely worked with FECO and the
three PIUs following the progress milestones agreed during the April 2010 mission and
appropriately adjusted the project activities in order to overcome project delays and M&E
weaknesses. The project implementation status was finally upgraded to satisfactory in
September 2011 with the joint efforts by FECO, the PIUs and the Bank team. And the
project was closed as scheduled after one-year extension.

However, it should be noted that the project indicators (most are output-based indicators)
were not formally revised during the project implementation although this weakness was
indicated in 2007 by the QAG review. Also, the slow disbursement issue was not



                                            25
effectively addressed early enough (during preparation and early implementation)
causing delays in levels of disbursements. Some project activities were added to better
collect data for measuring achievement of PDOs, but only at the late stage of the project,
which impacted negatively the complete and effective data collection to satisfactorily
prove achievement of the project outcomes, especially on the termite IPM promotion.
Finally, the alternation of four task team leaders during the project duration created
continuity problems. Therefore, the rating is given MS on the Bank’s supervision.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

On the basis of the above assessment of Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
and in supervision, overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government maintained its commitment to the Stockholm Convention on POPs
during the project life ensuring phase-out of the two POPs. The political will and
commitment to sustain the outcomes of this project ensured by developing and adopting
sound framework of policies, regulations and standards on termite prevention and control
at both national and provincial levels to promote the IPM approach with diversified
technical options. This includes six national and 25 provincial policies, regulations and
technical codes on termite control (out of which 3 national and 11 provincial were
published prior to the project closing date of December 31, 2011 (see Annex 2).

On April 16, 2009, the Notification on Ban of Production, Circulation, Use and Trade of
DDT, Chlordane, Mirex and HCB was promulgated as a joint effort of ten ministries and
agencies led by MEP and in cooperation with NDRC, Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology, MOHURD, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Commerce,
Ministry of Public Health, General Administration of Customs, General Administration
of Quality Supervision，Inspection and Quarantine and State Administration of Work
Safety. The issuance and promulgation of this national ban reflects China’s engagement
to honor its commitments under the Stockholm Convention.

Government funds have been provided through FECO and the provincial PIUs under the
tight supervision of the Ministry of Finance. GoC’s financial support to the project has
been also reflected in form of mobilized counterpart funds for both the project
implementation duration and over 10 years after the project life for continued monitoring
of installed bait and dusting systems for termite prevention and control. The major
shortcoming of MOF during project implementation was the slow pace of opening the
project account, funds request and reimbursement processing, although there have been
some improvements by the end of project.




                                           26
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

FECO and the provincial PIUs consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to the
fulfillment of the project development objectives and provided adequate internal staff and
resources to ensure implementation success.

FECO established a termite project team which monitored, managed and operated the
project in a satisfactory manner at the national level, although its leadership at the later
stage of the project could have been stronger. The project team responded timely to
Zhejiang’s retrieval at the beginning of 2006. FECO remained committed to the project
throughout the project implementation period despite the changes in its team members
and project leaders.

To address technical problems in project implementation and assist itself in technical
support and guidance, FECO recruited a Chief Technical Advisor (CTA), a National
Technical Advisor (NTA) and other technical advisors in line with project requirements.
As the authority of termite control in China, the National Termite Control Center (NTCC)
under MOHURD provided FECO with administrative support and policy guidance at the
national level, specifically in the drafting and revision of national policies and standards
and promoting their promulgation. It also supported Termite Control Stations in the
demonstration provinces to apply IPM. This gave FECO proactive leadership to propose
adding an additional component for testing the monitoring-dusting technology in order to
diversify IPM options in termite prevention and control, using different types of
chemicals used in the bait system.

The PIUs performances have been consistently satisfactory mainly due to their proactive
leadership at the provincial level, clear implementation structure, recruiting and retaining
experienced and qualified personnel, as well as timely and quality reporting. They
complied with all Bank grant covenants and discharged its fiduciary duties in a
satisfactory manner. The quality of supervision support by the three PIUs’ managers and
technical staff was high, and their intensive efforts in following up with the termite
stations and other project activity contractors was a key factor for ultimate project
success.

The three provinces’ representative Steering Groups, efficiently coordinated, supervised
and guided project implementation, and provided administrative as well as technical
support. This reduced disruption risk during project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

On the basis of the above assessments regarding Government and Implementing agencies’
performance, overall Borrower performance is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned


                                            27
Capacity building with a perception-and-behavior-change approach at the both
national and provincial levels guarantees project sustainability. This was a pioneering
project trying to achieve change in a complex institutional environment with little
practical example to follow. Capacity building in policy and regulatory framework
establishment and enforcement, effective organization of public awareness raising
activities, accurate and practical IPM technical knowledge education, and institutional
management with improved IT technologies are crucial for making changes for this type
of project. The provincial PIUs played a key role in coordinating with local government
agencies and following up on project activities, which was a key factor for ultimate
project success.

Undertaking in-depth needs assessment is required to ensure project is accurately
designed to directly respond to local needs. Based on past ten-year termite threats in the
selected provinces, the project was initially designed to procure 900,000 bait systems, of
which 500,000 are above-ground and 400,000 in-ground. It was found during installation
that the proportion of the two types was inappropriate, leaving a huge gap between real
and designed demands. Miscalculation in project design leads to frequent component
adjustment, significantly impeding implementation and lengthening project development
period for one year. In addition, given that procured above-ground systems largely
exceeded local demands for termite control, termite control stations in demonstration
areas intentionally neglected instructions when installing these systems at an early stage
so that they can finish their tasks on time.

Connecting knowledge centers with international consultants, implementing agencies,
and the private sector guarantees the intensive knowledge and expertise exchange. Part
of this project’s success was its implementation model, which dynamically linked
different PIUs with FECO with centers of expertise, researchers, and international
consultants. This allowed a quick transfer of knowledge, in addition to a quick return of
expertise from the sites to the research institutions. This back and forth exercise allowed
the refinement of implemented IPM technology, especially the Monitoring and Dusting
system which was a pilot exercise. In addition, it appeared very important to have as part
of the counterpart team an international advisor who is familiar with international best
practices and can expedite and facilitate the decision making process by sharing global
experience and targeted advice.

Introduction of new alternative technologies always entails new challenges, which
require effective and timely training and education. Installation of above-ground
stations poses strict technical requirements regarding the timing (breeding and control
season) and location (sites where termites are discovered alive), otherwise would not
deliver expected results. In addition, their labor intensive maintenance (bi-monthly site
checks) increases the cost and reduces consumer commitment. Limit knowledge of the
public on how bait systems work for termite prevention and control lead to high loss rates
of in-ground stations (30 to 40% in some neighborhoods) and frequent dismantlement of
above-ground stations by residents. Communication and training efforts before
application of bait systems, coupled with summarizing and improving experiences during
the installation and maintenance periods are crucial to enhance practitioners’ skills. In



                                            28
addition, strengthened communication among project stakeholders, including property
management agencies and residents, combined with outreach activities on IPM
knowledge and related project activities are important to increase public interest with
regards to IPM technologies in termite control.

Impact analysis and the integration in project design of mechanisms for generating
new solutions are needed when confronted with higher operational costs derived from
the application of new technologies. It was found that application of monitoring control
technology is labor intensive when compared to traditional methods of chemical control.
This is mainly due to long duration of the termite control engineering, specifically the
high labor cost to conduct regular monitoring and maintenance. During the
implementation of the Demonstration Project, such problem of incremental costs has
been solved through subsidized GEF and national funds. However, this endangers the
sustainability of the project. It is highly recommended in future operations to integrate in
the project design a comprehensive and realistic procedure to phase-out or reduce
subsidies, including policy revisions to reform the termite control pricing system and
guarantee policy, and encouraging R&D to develop less labor-intensive systems as well
as more effective chemicals for termite control.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

FECO raised issues in its completion report on overestimation of demand for AG bait
systems, shortcoming of bait system technology in terms of longer treatment time and
high labor cost, complicated procurement procedure of the Bank, project M&E weakness,
inefficient funds disbursement, and frequent task team leader change. Most of these
issues are agreed and considered as the key factors affecting project implementation and
outcomes and rating the Bank’s performance in the ICR. Regarding the issue related to
the opinion that the Bank procurement procedure was long and complicated, the Bank
team thinks that in order to guarantee the procurement procedure is transparent and fair, a
certain procedure and standard procurement documents need to be used. The Bank has
been and will continue to make efforts for simplification and flexibility to better serve our
clients. The delays on procurement of bait system were mainly because implementation
delays and unfamiliar with the procurement procedure, not the procurement procedure
itself.

In addition, a survey in some TCSs carried out under the project implementation
evaluation indicated “the cost of communicating with the Bank is high and they don’t get
satisfactory feedbacks from the Bank. For instance, the TCS in one city had several
unsuccessful attempts to get contact information from the World Bank experts.
Difficulties in project implementation were reported repeatedly to the World Bank staff
during their field inspection, but no feedback was ever given.? The Bank ICR team thinks
that there may have been insufficient communications between the Bank team and some
TCSs due to difficulties in language or other reasons. However, the Task Team was not


                                             29
aware of the existence of this issue before (otherwise it would have been addressed
properly).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to mitigate environmental and health risks
associated with chlordane and mirex in termite control by (a) demonstrating the
elimination of their use through the introduction of integrated pest management (IPM) in
selected area, and (b) preparing a national replication program for complete phase-out of
chlordane and mirex in China.

During project preparation, due to lack of data and information readily available in China
and inherent difficulties in measuring the effect of these pollutants, it was impractical to
carry-out traditional cost-benefit analysis, therefore the economic analysis was based on
qualitative analysis. The economic and financial analysis intended to assess the
introduction of IPM approach for termite control in buildings requires information on the
total number of buildings exposed to termite damage, present number of infestations,
detailed information on the building age, when and how it was last treated, cost of
damage per case etc. Unfortunately, such information was not available then; the analysis
was not able to be done. Alternatively, the cost analysis between chemicals presently
used and potential alternatives including non-POPs chemicals and IPM technology (bait
system) was conducted. The unit price (per kg and per M2) information was from WHO
(World Health Organization) and the information on costs by different sized structure
was estimated from the past termite prevention and control practices. The cost
comparison results showed that chlordane was the most economical approach and the
IPM was the most expensive approach in terms of operational costs. However, the
analysis was not able to assess the potential health and environmental impact of the use
of chlordane and substitute chemicals.

At ICR stage, the analysis still faces similar difficulties in carrying-out quantified
analysis since relevant information and data are still not available. This is mainly due to
the lack of specific scientific research on the environmental impact and human health risk
from the use of chlordane and mirex in China. Fortunately, such research has been done
internationally in the late 1990s, and the evidences and results will be used for this
analysis as references. The focus of this analysis is on assessing the economic benefits
and costs based on a number of assumptions and scenarios. .

Methodology Applied

The traditional cost-benefit evaluation that estimate internal rate of return (IRR) and net
present value (NPV) derived from cash flow calculations is not applied since it is difficult
to quantify the environmental and social impacts and benefits in monetary terms.
Therefore, the approach of cost-effectiveness approach is applied in this analysis.

The analysis following focuses on evaluating economic impacts on environment not
financial benefits to the project entities since financial costs of the integrated pest



                                            40
management (IPM) are higher than the costs of existing traditional approaches of
chemical block for termite prevention and control.

Main Assumptions and Proposed Scenarios

Main Assumptions

IPM will reach its expected effects: The IPM (bait system) approach for termite
prevention and control was introduced for the first time to China. Due to its technical
requirements and the short period of implementation, full effects were not properly
reported. However, this IPM approach has been implemented in other countries (US,
Australia, Pakistan etc.) and is a mature technology. Its effects have been fully revealed.
In the different project provinces and cities, despite some problems related to the
technical installation, initial effects have been visible and recorded through a rigorous
monitoring and inspection, and relevant assessment was undertaken. It is assumed that
the IPM (bait system) has reached its expected effects, and will be viable for replication
in China.

Public awareness and acceptance of IPM: Since the public was used to the traditional
approach (application of chlordane and mirex) for termite prevention and control due to
its low cost and long-period efficiency, coupled with a lack of scientific publications
related to its environmental contamination and its impacts on human health (e.g., cancer
occurrence), they would be reluctant to accept high-cost termite treatment and frequent
visit for monitoring. The public awareness campaigns under the project tended to
increase awareness regarding the negative environmental impacts as well as the risks to
human health due to the exposure to chlordane and mirex and the advantage of IPM
technologies. Furthermore, the Project Implementation Evaluation Report included a
survey of recognizing IPM approach.             The interviewees included residents of
communities where the IPM approach was applied and the Termite Control Station
workers, who implemented the IPM approach. The high acceptance rates have been
reported in the survey result. Therefore, an assumption of the public’s willingness to pay
the incremental cost to utilize bait systems is made.

International research results are applied in China: As mentioned above, China does not
have specific scientific research data that can be used for this analysis on evaluating
impacts of using POPs, particularly the impacts of chlordane and mirex on the
environment and on human health and data on benefits of gradually terminating the
production, use, export and import of these two POPs. This type of research was
conducted internationally in the late 1990s when developed countries (e.g., US, Japan)
issued a ban on using these chemicals.

  i.   One Japanese study showed six times higher chlordane concentration in mother’s
       milk in houses treated with chlordane for termite control and another Japanese
       study showed strong correlation between chlordane in blood and operators who
       applied chlordane for termite control.




                                            41
 ii.   A recently published American study showed that 20 years after the ban of
       chlordane, high chlordane in fishes near the areas frequently treated with
       chlordane for termite control is still detected.

Those studies have not shown any adverse effects on human health, nevertheless the US
study clearly indicates the persistency of chlordane and thus its bio-accumulation in our
ecosystem. If these POPs continued to be used, they will eventually affect human health
since we lie on the top of the food chain.

Although there is no scientific proof of correlation between the exposure to chlordane
and the occurrence of cancer, the ICR mission learned from Termite Stations some
existing evidences that cancer occurrence among workers of termite control stations was
40 percent higher than the national public average. But official or scientific data proving
this is not available.

In addition, assessment of the environmental hazard from chlordane and mirex use is
cited from Stockholm Convention website under “Listing POPs in the Stockholm
Convention?, which summarized the research results from international society:

“Chlordane remains in the soil for a long time and has a reported half-life of one year.
The lethal effects of chlordane on fish and birds vary according to the species, but tests
have shown that it can kill mallard ducks, bobwhite quail, and pink shrimp. Chlordane
may affect the human immune system and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. It
is believed that human exposure occurs mainly through the air, and chlordane has been
detected in the indoor air of residences in the US and Japan.?

“Direct exposure to mirex does not appear to cause injury to humans, but studies on
laboratory animals have caused it to be classified as a possible human carcinogen. In
studies mirex proved toxic to several plant species and to fish and crustaceans. It is
considered to be one of the most stable and persistent pesticides, with a half life of up to
10 years. The main route of human exposure to mirex is through food, particularly meat,
fish, and wild game.?

We would take these research results as references to evaluate potential adverse
environmental impacts.

Proposed Scenarios

Based on the incremental cost analysis prepared during project preparation, the following
two scenarios, without project and with project, which are consistent with the baseline
and GEF alternatives, are used for cost-effectiveness analysis. The below cost-
effectiveness analysis will be based on these two scenarios.

  i.   The scenario of “without project?: China as the Stockholm Convention member is
       obligated to find alternative environmental friendly approach for replacing
       existing practice of using chlordane and mirex for termite control. However,



                                            42
       since the CIO and SEPA and termite control stations have no experience and
       capacity on IPM for termite control, as well the existing policies, regulations and
       standards and operational procedures were all promoting and indirectly mandating
       the use of chlordane and mirex for termite control, it would take a lot of effort and
       much time to introduce and implement IPM method and potential problems in
       policy support, technical constraints and public acceptance would appear. Before
       IPM approach is fully introduced and functioned well in China, the Government
       might request for another five-year exemption after the first exemption was
       expired in 2009. The consequence would be: (i) more areas would be
       contaminated and more financial resource would be needed for cleaning up the
       contaminated soil and water system; and (ii) more costly and time consuming for
       introducing IPM approach for termite control and establishing necessary policy
       and regulatory framework and developing technical standard for implementing
       IPM.

 ii.   The scenario of “with project?: The IPM (bait system and dusting system)
       technologies through the project have been implemented within three
       demonstration provinces and five pilot cities, representing a high potential for
       replication in the termite prevention and control sector in China. Although the
       IPM approach’s positive advantages with regards to the environment and to
       human health and long-term effectiveness have not fully revealed, plus its higher
       costs (equipment and labor) and technical requirement might slow down the
       national replication progress, the project objectives have successfully achieved,
       the policy and regulatory framework for supporting IPM implementation has been
       established, the institutional capacity has been strengthened and the technical
       standard has been developed and technical experience for implementing IPM has
       been gained.

Assessment of Economic Benefits

The project did not directly generate any economic revenue or financial return. The
significant benefits generated by the project would be its positive environmental impact
resulted from the reduction of soil and water contamination associated with chlordane
and mirex as well as other non-POPs chemicals, and the positive social impact via
reducing the risk to human health. As it is impossible to quantify the negative impact of
using chlordane and mirex, the analysis has to use some proxies for evaluating these
benefits, such as savings from the remediation costs of chlordane and mirex contaminated
sites (such as chlordane and mirex production factories), and the medical expenditure on
treating cancer. As mentioned above that no direct evidence of the correlation between
closely contacting the chlordane and mirex (termite controls station workers) and the
cancer occurrence has been found as research has not been conducted yet. But there have
been incidence that the cancer occurrence rate among Termite Control Station workers is
much higher than national average.

The higher cancer occurrence among termite station workers has two economic effects:
medical expenses and labor productivity loss (reduce economic income). With IPM



                                            43
technologies used in this project, the workers are less exposed to toxic chemicals; at least
the possibility of cancer occurrence among termite control station workers would be
reduced considerably.

There is no specific report of cancer occurrence within exposed residents in termite
treated areas with chlordane and mirex. The US report indicated that the potential risks
to human health existed, and no one could project what would happen with the infants
who had mother milk with the chlordane contamination in the future. The most
significant concern is that the contamination of POPs will remain for long periods and
will not decompose naturally, thus hard to clean up.

Under the project, the cost of cleaning the site of Liyang Xinhai Chlordane factory was
almost 6 million yuan (RMB, roughly equivalent to $900,000), which was a small-scale
collective enterprise. Although it will not be possible to estimate the accurate cost for
cleaning all the contaminated areas, it would be with no doubt tremendous. With the
introduction of IPM, these tremendous cleaning costs would be saved. As IPM
replication progress would not be rapid due to its high costs and technical requirements, it
is suggested to carry out a specific study to measure the environmental costs of cleaning
the contamination.

Additional economic losses related to chlordane production and use would be:

   i.   Loss of economic value of land due to contamination. For example, the site of
        Liyang Xinhai Chemical Factory, which produced chlordane, had been idle for
        more than five years after closure, and it would be very cautious to use after
        cleanup;
 ii.    In contaminated water body, fishery industry is affected as the US research report
        indicated that chlordane was still found in fishes near the areas of termite
        treatment after 20 years after terminating the use of chlordane. The income loss
        due to affected fishery would be hard to estimate; and
 iii.   Potential loss of crop production value if the crop was planted in contaminated
        soil.

Another non-valued benefit is the institutional capacity building through the project
expedited the access of IPM technologies to China. The government officials’ capacity
to review and revise IPM related policies was strengthened through the project
implementation as all the targeted policy and regulatory reforms at national and
provincial levels were reached. Technical trainings and technical assistance were
provided under the project to improve workers’ technical skills to install and monitor
IPM stations.

Cost-effectiveness Analysis

Based on the scenarios proposed above, the following analysis will specifically evaluate
the efficiency of the project approach in assisting the Chinese government to fulfill its




                                            44
obligation to the Stockholm Convention for achieving the goal of eliminating chlordane
and mirex.

Introduction of IPM technique: The IPM approach for termite prevention and control
was for the first time to be introduced into China through the project. Implementing IPM
method requires a lot of knowledge and technique. The international successful
experiences and lessons in implementing IPM method have been taken into consideration
in the project design, which included developing IPM training manual and materials,
providing training to all existing staff at termite stations, research institutes, chemical
suppliers and officials. The results of project implementation have demonstrated its
efficiency of the approach for implementing IPM. In the three demonstration provinces
more than 694,000 in-ground bait systems covering more than 77 million M2 were
installed and more than 165,000 above-ground system covering almost 4 million M2
construction areas were installed. The IPM technique has been successfully applied in
the archaeological and historical sites to avoid huge loss. More than 5,754 technical staff
and project management personnel have been trained. The international technical advisor
also provided technical assistance to resolve the problems confronted during
implementation and provided a lot of suggestions for improving implementation. In
addition, the experience of implementing IPM and the project-supported/promoted
scientific research in evaluating IPM effects provided guidance for developing the
national replication program, which would save time and avoid lacking of knowledge for
dealing with technical constraints.

Policy and regulatory reform: As indicated in the proposed scenario above, there were no
policy and regulatory framework to support IPM implementation in China prior to the
project, therefore without any experience and assistance, it was a challenge for the
Chinese government to issue policies and regulation before the first exemption expired in
2009. The government would take much longer time and inputs to issue policy and
regulation to support IPM implementation. Under the project technical assistance, the
process of the policy and regulatory reform in reviewing and revising policies and
regulations was speeded up and the project also promoted the government’s approval
process. By end of the project six national policies and regulations and 25 provincial
policies and regulations have been drafted or revised, of which three at national level and
11 at provincial level have been issued and the rests are under approval process.

Public awareness education:         The Chinese government signed the Stockholm
Convention to terminate POPs, but the public had not realized the environmental damage
and risk to human health from application of chlordane and mirex due inadequate
information dissemination to the public. The higher costs of implementing IPM for
termite control would make the public reluctant to accept IPM even under the project. It
would be difficult to implement IPM without the public support. The project public
awareness education was fully used various measures including the media and press
(newspaper, TV and radio broadcast) and social activities (e.g., city fair) to disseminate
IPM information. In the project demonstration areas, there are thousands large signs with
IPM information, more than forty thousands of brochures and placards were disseminated
to the public, and cooperation relationship with communities was established. The



                                            45
webpage for recording and disseminating all the information on IPM has created, which
provided the government a tool to manage and monitor the termite control work. The
public awareness education was greatly changed the traditional concept for termite
control and the public in the demonstration areas voluntarily accept IPM. The public
survey results showed the public awareness education has reached its expected effect and
made a great contribution to IPM successfully implementation. The approaches of public
awareness education would be applied in the national replication program.

Capacity building in project management: As CIO and SEPA as well as the termite
control stations lacked experience of IPM for termite control, it would take time for them
to learn the related knowledge and management experience. The project provided a
relatively efficient way to strengthen the institutional capacity of the government
agencies. Under the project, three demonstration provinces and five demonstration cities
have established effective training system and exchange mechanism for the project
management staff. The management capacity of the CIO and PIUs’ staff and local
government officials and management staff of in-line administration agencies has
increased significantly and the inter and intra provinces exchange mechanism has been
strengthened. The establishment of MIS not only changed the information management
approach, but also provided a permanent electronic database for bait system monitoring
and maintenance. This MIS provided a platform for the government to monitor the
termite prevention and control progress status, and for recording daily activity for IPM
implementation, which would improve work quality. This MIS as a sample would be
taken into consideration in designing the national replication program.

Due to lacking information, it would be hard for us to estimate how long it would take
and how much would cost the Chinese government to eliminate chlordane and mirex and
implement IPM for replacement without the project assistance. The above analysis has
demonstrated the efficiency of the project in introducing IPM method and strengthens the
capacity to fulfill the obligation to the Stockholm Convention.

Operational Costs Comparison

During project preparation, a cost comparison had been carried out and five examples had
been used for the analysis. However, since then, IPM has not introduced to China some
of data were based on estimation. In the end of project, actual operation costs of
implementing IPM have come out, and the following comparison has confirmed the
estimation that operation cost of IPM is higher than that of traditional chemical block
approach.

During project implementation CIO and provincial PIUs carried out a cost evaluation
analysis based on a detailed calculation with actual data collected in the project areas.
The costs comparison between IPM approach and traditional chemical block approach
provided guidance for making technical regulations and pricing in IPM implementation,
which was new to all the project pilot demonstration provinces and cities as well for
future replication in other areas. The operation costs include: (i) equipment and
chemicals for installing Bait systems; (ii) labor and transportation costs; (iii) monitoring



                                            46
and inspection costs; as well as (iv)other indirect costs (management costs, social
insurance, public housing funds etc.).

The table below is the result of a detailed calculation of unit costs of different approaches.
This calculation was based on termite control for a six-floors building (total 3,600 M2)
including all auxiliary facilities (well, stairs etc.):

It is obvious that the operation costs of IPM (bait system) are higher than the costs of
chemical block system. But this might not be the case if we factor the major
environmental and health hazards caused by chemical contamination.

In three project demonstration provinces the cost comparison varies as shown in the table
below. Among them, Jiangsu’s has highest ratio between IPM and chemical, while
Hunan has the lowest one. This is because Jiangsu has the highest unit cost of
implementing IPM and lowest unit cost of chemical spray, while Hunan has lowest cost
of IPM, which implicated that it would be relatively easy for replication in the entire
province.

  Another comparison is to decompose the costs of 10 M2 as follows:

              （yuan      ls         ion（yuan） nt                costs          （yuan/10m2

                                                                               20.57

  In the table above, among various costs the materials are weighted the highest in both
  approaches. The bait system requires more labor input and transportation and this is the
  main factor of high costs of implementing this IPM approach.

  The cost comparison analysis confirmed the hypothesis of high operational cost of IPM
  method. However, comparing to the cost of cleaning the contaminated environment, for
  long term, IPM method would be the lowest cost for termite control.

  Conclusions and Recommendations

  Based on the analysis above, the proxies used to evaluate the benefits clearly recognized
  that environmental and social benefits from terminating use of POPs would be greater
  than economic value of using chlordane and mirex for termite prevention and control
  since environmental contamination, pollution and damage would cost huge efforts and
  financial resources to recover.

  Ban of production, use, import and export of chlordane and mirex was issued in 2009
  during the project implementation stage; however, replication of IPM is still a long-term
  task, as the operational costs of IPM are higher than the traditional practice of chemical
  block. IPM sustainability needs the government policy support and technical regulation
  for implementing IPM, especially for the national replication program.
  The cost-effectiveness analysis has shown that for reaching the goal of terminating
  production, consumption, import and export of chlordane and mirex in China and
  replacing by IPM for termite prevention and control, the project has provided an efficient
  approach to assist the Chinese government to fulfill its obligation to the Stockholm
  Convention with policy support and technical assurance. The significance is that the
  project successful experience would be applied in the national replication program.

As mentioned above that due to lack of data, it was not able to carry out a quantified
analysis. It is therefore recommended that the relevant research and studies should be
carried out to evaluate the adverse environmental impacts caused by chlordane and mirex
and the benefits from implementing the termite IPM as well as its cost reduction
approaches.

  Context

  1.      Termiticides chlordane and mirex are among the twelve persistent organic
  pollutants (POPs) identified for elimination by the Stockholm Convention due to
  increasing evidence of their toxicity to people and the environment, their tendency to
  accumulate in the food chain, and their ability to travel long distances through global
  ecosystems and persist in the environment. As a country strongly committed to the
  Stockholm Convention, China participated in all preparatory meetings and was one of the
  original signatories of the Stockholm Convention (signed on May 23, 2001). On August
  13, 2004, China ratified the Stockholm Convention and became a Party to the Convention.

  2.     China has one of the most diverse termite population and most severe termite
  damage in the world. It is estimated the direct economic loss caused by termites in China
  is about 2 to 2.5 billion Yuan annually. China’s explosive growth in new residential
  construction and general infrastructure development has substantially increased the
  demand for termite control.

  3.      Since the introduction of chlordane and mirex to China in 1964 and 1979
  respectively, they had become the principal instruments for termite prevention and
  control. Their effectiveness, persistence, low cost and ease of application have led to their
  widespread use and contributed to the fact that termite management in China heavily
  relies on chemical methods. From 2000 to 2003, China produced 450-820 tons of
  chlordane and 9-31 tons of mirex annually, which mainly used in termite control in
  residential and other buildings. The use of both termiticides poses significant local and
  global risks to human health and the environment.

  4.      Demonstration of Alternatives to Chlordane and Mirex in Termite Control Project,
  a self-standing, full-size GEF project (GEF Grant TF056588) had been designed to lay a
  foundation for a national replication program for the phase-out of chlordane and mirex in
  China. The project Grant Agreement was signed by People’s Republic of China and the
  World Bank in 2006, with the GEF grant of US$ 14,357,000 plus a local contribution of
  US$ 13,341,000.

  5.     Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) in the Chinese Ministry of
  Environmental Protection, worked as the national implementing agency for the project.
  Jiangsu, Anhui and Hunan Provinces were selected as the demonstration provinces. Three
  PIUs were set up for local project implementation.

  6.     The original project implementation period is from mid-2006 to the end of 2010.
  Due to project implementation delays, the project was extended for one year.

  7.     The project’s development objective is to mitigate environmental and health risks


                                               54
associated with chlordane and mirex in termite control by (a) demonstrating the
elimination of their use through the introduction of integrated pest management in
selected areas, and (b) preparing a national replication program for complete phase-out of
chlordane and mirex in China.

8.       Consistent with this objective, the key project outputs included (a) elimination of
150 MT of chlordane and mirex use in the building construction sector of the
demonstration area; (b) comprehensive policy, regulatory and institutional reforms at the
national and provincial level to replace termiticide-based termite management with
integrated termite management; (c) closure and clean-up one of the chlordane and mirex
facilities and a permanent reduction of 150 MT in the national chlordane and mirex
production; and (d) development of a national replication program for phase-out of
chlordane and mirex in the rest of China. But in December 2010 when the project was
restructured, additional project activities were added. More detailed outputs are
summarized in Annex 2.

9.        The project had six components:

10.     Component 1: Institutional capacity strengthening. The objective of this
component is to mobilize institutional capacity for project management, technical and
advisory capacity for project implementation, and capacity of key stakeholders to support
the shift from pesticide-based termite control to IPM-based termite prevention and
control. It has three subcomponents:

     a.    Project management and technical implementation.
     b.    Technical and advisory capacity for project implementation.
     c.    Inception activities and mobilization of key stakeholders.

11.      Component 2: Policy framework for elimination of chlordane and mirex. The
objective of this component is to improve policies, regulations and standards so they
facilitate elimination of chlordane and mirex and promote IPM for termite control. It has
two subcomponents:

     a.    National policy and regulatory study.
     b.    Provincial policy and regulatory reform.

12.    Component 3: IPM implementation. The objective of this component is to
replace the existing chlordane and mirex-based termite control in the building
construction sector of the demonstration area with an IPM-based bait system and
complementary IPM measures. It has five subcomponents:

     a.    IPM operating and training manual.
     b.    IPM training program.
     c.    Public awareness and information dissemination.
     d.    IPM implementation.
     e.    Research and development (R&D).



                                             55
13.    Component 4: Closure of chlordane and mirex manufacturer. The plant
closure is a critical activity for phase-out of chlordane and mirex, and an important
complement of IPM implementation. It has two subcomponents:

    a.   Permanent physical closure and dismantling of the chlordane and mirex
         manufacturing facilities.
    b.   Clean up one of the facility’s chlordane and mirex contaminated sites and
         disposal of chlordane and mirex waste.

14.     Component 5: Monitoring and evaluation. The objective of this component is
to evaluate the overall performance of the project, facilitate IPM learning, and capture the
knowledge necessary for the preparation of the national replication program. The
component would fund monitoring and evaluation workshops, annual review meetings,
and a computerized management information system (MIS) necessary to track and
evaluate project implementation progress.

15.      Component 6: National replication program for elimination of chlordane and
mirex in China. The objective of this component is to develop a national program for
elimination of chlordane and mirex in termite control based on the experiences gleaned
from this demonstration project. The component would fund workshops and consulting
services for preparation and dissemination of the replication program, drafting of the
national replication program document, stakeholder consultations and supporting
activities. It would also fund preparation of baseline information feeding into preparation
of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for closure of the remaining eight chlordane
and mirex manufacturers.

Project Achievements

16.    By the end of 2011, the project objectives have been all achieved as summarized
below.

a) Establishing high-qualified project management and implementation team. To ensure
   high-efficient project management and implementation at both the national and
   provincial level, under the supervision by the National Leading Group for
   Convention Implementation consisted of thirteen national ministries, FECO
   established a termite project team to manage and coordinate the project and to
   coordinate with relevant international agencies. The three demonstration provinces
   established multi-department steering group at the provincial level and the project
   implementation units (PIUs) to manage and support project daily work at the
   provinical level. In addition, FECO, worked with the World Bank, and its consultants
   prepared manuals on IPM operation, financial management, procurement and
   auditing, and organized a series of professional training workshops for managers,
   financial and technical staff. 612 people in total participated eight training workshops.
   Based on these trainings, the three provinces continued to organize technical and
   management trainings in each province to ensure enough qualified staff to be
   engaged in the project.



                                            56
b) Preliminary development of termite control policy framework. A sound framework of
   policies, regulations and standards on termite control by using IPM approach is
   preliminarily established at the national level and in demonstration provinces,
   providing institutional support to project implementation, sustainability and national
   replication in the future. There are six national policies and 25 provincial policies
   drafted or revised under the project. Most important, on April 16, 2009, the Ban on
   Production, Use, Sales and Trade of DDT, Chlordane, Mirex and HCB was issued as
   a joint effort of ten ministries and agencies led by MEP, which stated that, since May
   17, 2009, production, use, sale and trade DDT, Chlordane, Mirex and HCB in China
   will be banned. In addition, Guidance on National Replication of IPM in Termite
   Control, which was drafted under coordination of FECO, is planned to be issued in
   mid 2012 by MEP and MOHURD. The issuance of the ban has enabled China to
   honor its commitments under the Stockholm Convention and has found a solid base
   for national replication of IPM in termite control during the twelfth Five-Year-Plan
   period.

c) Complete elimination of production and use of chlordane and mirex. The project
   promoted closure of all chlordane and mirex production lines in Jiangsu Province
   which was not anticipated, completely eliminating production, use and circulation of
   these two POPs in China. Furthermore, to ensure all related provinces in China fulfill
   the claim by the Ban, FECO organized a one-month signing and commitment
   campaign in whole China for the elimination of chlordane and mirex from Apr.17-
   May 17, 2010, which covered over 15 provinces and municipalities affected by
   termite damage, and over 10,000 people signed the commitment.

d) Introduction of Environment-Friendly Alternative in Termite Control and Green
   Upgrading. IPM is a comprehensive approach for termite control that focuses on
   monitoring, complemented by biological, physical and chemical barrier technologies.
   Compared with traditional measures of spraying pesticides, IPM reduces chemical
   consumption by 99%. As the most important part of the project, FECO organized
   application of bait systems in three provinces by providing 762,000 in-ground and
   151,500 above-ground bait systems through the project. By end of 2011, three
   provinces had installed 694,100 in-ground and 151,500 above-ground bait systems
   with preventive treatment covering 77.24 million m2 and remedial treatment 3.8
   million m2; the remaining 67,900 IG will be used for bait system maintenance for
   next 10-years. Compared with traditional extensive use of chlordane and mirex,
   application of bait systems reduces chlordane and other chemicals by 372.37 MT and
   mirex by 163.3 kg. It effectively protects environment and human health from POPs
   pesticides, generates sound environmental and social benefits and promotes green
   development of termite control.

    Besides, regarding the high cost of bait system resulting in the potential risk of its
    sustainability in China, FECO organized monitoring-dusting (MD) applications in
    Hangzhou, Nanchang, Nanning, Guangzhou and Chengdu, five provincial capitals,
    as a supplement pilot operation of IPM under the project. FECO procured 45,375
    monitoring stations for five cities, and 41,250 sets were installed by end of 2011, the



                                            57
     remaining will be used for future maintenance. To promote MD implementation in
     the five cities and expand IPM influence, in December 2011, FECO procured another
     15,600 monitoring stations, which will support replication of IPM and its extensive
     implementation in China after the project is closed.

     For termite prevention, all the IG bait systems and MD systems were installed in
     17,086 residential buildings, 1,137 office/commercial/manufacturing buildings, 52
     historic sites, 274 hospitals and schools, and 471 other buildings. For termite control,
     all    AG       were    installed    in    12,782    residential    buildings,    1,229
     office/commercial/manufacturing buildings, 72 historic sites, 458 hospitals and
     schools, and 269 other buildings.

e) Clean-up demonstration of contaminated sites for chlordane and mirex production
   facility. With approval of FECO and World Bank, Liyang Xinhai Chemical Plant and
   Shanghai Fengjiang Termite Control Material Co. in Jiangsu Provinces were selected
   for contaminated site clean-up. The project cleaned up 6,946 m3 of contaminated soil,
   550 m2 contaminated buildings inner-surface and dismantled 398 m2 contaminated
   buildings, and disposed 6.4 MT of hazardous waste and 450 liter of residue,
   effectively addressing leakage and movement of POPs pesticides. And Liyang
   Guanghua Chemical Plant was cleaned with the local counterpart funding of Liyang
   government. These provided experience for proper clean-up of other POPs
   contaminated sites in China.

f)   Training, Publicity and Raised IPM Awareness. To spread IPM knowledge and
     application results, FECO and PIUs organized 92 training workshops for 5729
     managers and technicians. In addition, public campaigns were carried out in
     demonstration areas to raise public awareness of IPM concept and technologies.
     Over 10,000 copies of IPM operation manuals, brochures, posters, CDs and other
     propaganda materials for publicity were produced. FECO also worked with CCTV to
     make TV show for the purpose of replicating termite IPM. Anhui PIU disseminated
     260 signs and 30,000 promotion brochures and set up 2,500 placards and 2,000
     posters for IPM implementation. Hunan PIU, worked through media, produced 21
     TV coverages and 62 reports in publications, disseminated 3,000 IPM brochures and
     200,000 promotion sheets. Jiangsu PIU organized innovative activities, such as press
     conferences on implementation of multilateral environment conventions, large-scale
     publicity campaigns in public squares and opening ceremonies for clean-up of
     contaminated sites and hazardous waste, with 5,000 promotion material disseminated.

Main factors affecting project implementation

17.    One of the main reasons for one-year project extension was overestimation of bait
system demand in project design, which led to frequent procurement adjustment and
funding reallocation. This significantly impeded implementation progress.

18.     Bait systems need longer time than chlordane and mirex in termite prevention and
control. It also requires frequent inspection resulted in high labor cost. And damage and



                                             58
loss of the bait stations caused additional work for inspection and new installation and
also affected the control results.

19.     The project funding availability and procurement did not match well the
physiological season of termite control. In some provinces or cities, 3 to 6 months were
lost, which caused delays on IPM demonstration.

20.     Due to the deflation policy on China’s real estate these years, many housing
construction plan had been dropped. The counterpart bait-system installation plan was not
able to be implemented accordingly. New buildings had to be identified for bait system
installation. Human province suffered this difficulty the most among three demonstration
provinces.

21.    Complicated procurement procedure and longer procurement period was also a
main difficulty for project implementation. Especially, the bait system procurement and
supplier selection resulted in the postponement of goods arrival and installation.

Performance evaluation of Bank and borrower

22.      Bank performance-Satisfactory. The Bank team played an active and effective
role in the supervision and quality control of the project during the whole implementation
progress, and proactively provided support to address implementation problems as they
arose, including procurement and disbursement isseus, technical support for IPM
demonstration etc. At least two supervision missions were undertaken each year by the
Bank for project implementation supervision and problem solving. A number of field
visits were undertaken to ensure compliance with safeguards, and to verify physical
progress and achievements.

23.     Chinese government performance-Satisfactory. The national implementing
agency, FECO played an active and effective role during the whole project management
and implementation; and provided administrative and technical support for the national
policy framework establishment, institutional capacity building, IPM demonstration,
eliminating the use and production of chlordane and mirex, disposal for closure of
chlordane and mirex production facility and contaminated site clean-up, project
monitoring and evaluation, the whole-process quality control. In addition, FECO’s wide
experience in collaborating effectively with numerous intergovernmental departments,
bilateral donors and enterprises helped harmonize interests and standpoints of different
agencies for project implementation.

24.     Local PIUs performance-Satisfactory. Three demonstrative provinces
demonstrated a strong commitment to meet the project development objectives and
provided adequate staff and inter-departments cooperation, which ensured the success of
project implementation. In addition, all provinces provided strong support for project
implementation and provided counterpart financial support.

Lessons learned



                                           59
25.    Inadequate investigation and information collection in early design stage.
Preliminary research for project design, especially the feasibility study, was inadequate,
causing frequent component adjustment during implementation and extension of project
implementation period at a later stage. Especially regarding the number of bait system, its
overestimation resulted in twice adjustments. In addition, the unused baits are another
issue as most of them have been expired. So, adequate research and consideration for
potential risks of project implementation should be paid more attention in the early
design stage for future new projects.

26.     Inadequate support from project participants. Good coordination and support by
local government is highly necessary for project implementation. Withdrawal of
Zhengjiang Province during the project preparation stage and Liyang Guanghua
Chemical CO. as the contaminated site for clean-up during the project implementation
stage highly impeded the project implementation progress and added additional workload.
Therefore, sufficient communication at the project preparation stage is quite important
among all stakeholders.

27.     Frequent change of management personnel. Both in the Bank and FECO,
frequent change of project management staff led to continuity problems of project
management. During the five-year project period, the position of project manager on
Bank side has been undertaken by four staff in turn and over ten people in FECO
participated in the project management. Instability of international and national
management personnel impacted on project implementation and working efficiency.

28.     Inadequate consideration of project evaluation. Project evaluation was
inadequately considered in the project design. Some project indicators were designed
without sufficient research and consideration. In addition, collection of some key data
lacked comprehensive planning and some important data were not collected, which
affected the accuracy of evaluation results.

Project sustainability

29.     Finance support. In the project implementation agreements signed between MEP
and the three selected provinces, the three provinces promised co-financing for the post-
project period to support continued monitoring of installed baiting systems. The three
provinces have assigned human resources as well as committed co-financing in kind and
in cash. To secure project sustainability, the provincial Departments of Housing and
Urban-rural Development, Environmental Protection and Financial Bureaus have issued
documents requiring all termite control stations involved to set aside co-financing from
the termite control fees each year according to the fund needs for post-stage project
operation.

30.    Institutional support. Project management for post-project period will be
incorporated into the routine sector administration function of the provincial authorities,
which are responsible for guiding and managing follow-up operation of the project.
Maintenance of installed bait systems or dusting systems will be included in routine daily



                                            60
  work of the termite control stations involved in the project.

  31.     Policy support. The Guidance on National Replication of IPM in Termite Control,
  as a joint effort of MEP and MOHURD, is planned to be officially issued in mid 2012.
  The Guidance will greatly promote replication of IPM concept and technologies in China
  and accelerate green transformation and upgrading of termite control in the 12th Five-
  Year-Plan period.

  32.    Technical support. Termite control stations in each demonstration area is required
  to maintain a stable technical team for monitoring and maintenance of installed bait or
  dusting systems and provide training for technicians regularly for the next ten years after
  the project. Workshops for experience exchange among these technicians will also be
  organized to maintain technical capacity in order to replicate termite IPM.

II.   Comments on Bank’s ICR

  33.     The ICR reflects objectively the achievements and deficiencies of the project, showcases
  the real workload and efforts performed by all stakeholders, and points out lessons learnt
  pertinently. We fully agree on the findings and conclusions in the ICR.
