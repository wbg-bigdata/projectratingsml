TO TilE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
BAiCO DE LA REPUBLICA
WITH THE GUARA4TEE OF
WITH. REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Banco de la Republica with the guarantee of the Republic of
Colombia for the equivalent of US$5.5 million to help finance a small-scale
industry project. The loan would have a term of 12 years, including 3-1/2
years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum. The proceeds of the
loan would be relent in pesos by the Banco de la Republica to the Corporacion
Financiera Popular (CFP) at 18.5 percent per annum on the equivalent of US$5.0
million to be made available for fixed-asset financing, and at 12 percent per
annum on the equivalent of US$0.5 million to be made available for technical
assistance financing. CFPt's on-lending rates to beneficiary firms would be
24 percent and 15 percent per annum, respectively. If beneficiary firms so
desired, they could receive fixed-asset sub-loans denominated in foreign
exchange and pay an interest rate of 13-1/2 percent; under this alternative,
the Banco de la Republica would make such funds available to CFP at 8-1/4 per-
cent interest.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.         The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Position and
Prospects of Colombia, 138-CO) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 18, 1973. A note on major developments in the economy since that
time is included in Annex I.
3.         The Colombian economy has shown impressive gains in the recent
past. The rate of economic growth has accelerated to more than 7 percent
per annum, and the expansion of non-traditional exports has been remarkable.
Such improvements are very much needed in order to accelerate employment
generation and to raise gross national product per capita, currently US$400,
one of the lowest in Latin America, to a more acceptable level. Colombia
also needs to spread the benefits from growth more widely in order to surmount
problems of poverty and population pressures in both rural and urban areas.
Concentration of land ownership, technical backwardness, and under-employment
characterize most rural areas. In urban areas, pressures of population
growth, compounded by heavy migration from the countryside, have generated
serious unemployment and a severe housing deficit. Prospects for coping
with these problems seem brighter as a result of the accelerated growth
upon which the Colombian economy has embarked in the past several years.
4.         Recent Government administrations have reacted to rural poverty
and urban unemployment in a more systematic fashion than in the past, but



- 2 -
much remains to be done. In spite of the passage of an Agrarian Reform
Law and the creation of the Agrarian Reform Institute (INCORA) in 1961,
only modest results have been achieved in alleviating rural poverty.
Additional legislation has been enacted which lays a better basis for land
reform but much remains to be done to raise income in rural areas. In
recognition of the problems of urban concentration and unemployment,
Colombia's previous Government placed greater emphasis on urban development,
particularly in the housing field, but despite such action unemployment
continued to increase in most of Colombia's major urban centers. Prelimi-
nary indications suggest that the new Government, which took office in
August 1974,will strive to sustain a high rate of economic growth while
simultaneously attempting to achieve a more equitable distribution of its
benefits, inter alia, through expansion of employment opportunities and
increased investment in education, health and agriculture. There is likely
to be more emphasis on the development of agriculture and industry, and less
reliance on the urban construction sector to provide a stimulus to economic
growth. Export diversification will continue to be a major component of
development strategy and the Government is currently rationalizing the export
promotion system. These development programs have necessitated and will
continue to require a strengthening of the fiscal effort.
5.         At the latest Consultative Group meeting held in June 1973, members
of the Group expressed the view that growing needs for public investment and
other public expenditures called for increases in domestic fiscal efforts.
While the Government then expressed the intention to further increase revenues
by new tax measures and by increasing the savings of public enterprises, little
progress was achieved, and the fiscal situation remained weak. To overcome
these problems, Colombia's new Government has instituted a comprehensive struc-
tural reform of the fiscal system which includes major modifications of the
sales and income taxes, and a strengthening of the fiscal contribution of
decentralized public enterprises. Discussions between the Government and the
Bank on fiscal issues are continuing.
6.         Colombia's efforts to expand exports have been amply rewarded in
recent years. Merchandise exports amounted to US$1,334 million in 1973, of
which over half came from non-coffee items. Allowing for price increases,
this represents a fourfold increase (representing an average annual real
growth of 24 percent) in non-traditional exports since 1965-67; flowers,
clothing, emeralds, cotton thread and cloth, chemical and pharmaceutical
products, sawwood, and wood products enjoyed particularly large gains, al-
though raw cotton, sugar, meat, and other agricultural products continued to
account for the greatest absolute amounts. Coffee receipts were up largely
as a result of high international prices as the volume of coffee exports has
increased relatively little in recent years.
7.         Rapidly expanding exports accompanied by more slowly rising imports,
despite progressive removal of import restrictions, have created substantial
balance of payments surpluses. Net foreign exchange reserves of the Banco de
la Republica reached at the end of February 1974 nearly US$600 million, or
the equivalent of about five months' imports of goods and non-factor services



- 3 -
at the 1973 rate. This compares favorably with the US$345 million and US$170
million held at the end of 1972 and 1971, respectively, and to the deficit
positions that were common prior to 1968. Since February, accelerated import
payments resulting from liberalization of import restrictions and lengthening
of the lag between export registrations and exchange surrender,together with
lower world prices for coffee, moved the current account of the balance of
payments from a surplus position in 1973 to a deficit for the first eight
months of last year. Sharply reduced external borrowing by the Government has
further lowered the inflow of foreign exchange, and reserves probablr
declined by about US$120 million during 1974. Care will have to be
exercised in foreign exchange reserve management since world coffee prices
may remain weak for some time and prices of several of Colombia's non-tradi-
tional agricultural exports appear to have peaked, while those of imports
are expected to continue to rise. The new Government is aware of the possi-
bility of some weakening in the balance of payments, and since taking office
in mid-August has more than doubled the rate of depreciation of the peso,
ahead of domestic price increases, in an effort to hold down the rapid growth
of imports and sUstain adequate incentives to exporters. A longer-term
problem is that, unless appropriate action is taken, Colombia will become a
sizable net importer of crude petroleum near the end of the decade, and the
pressure on the balance of payments from petroleum imports, should they
become necessary, could be considerable. A high-level Energy Council is
studying exploration incentives, taxation and foreign-exchange arrangements,
product pricing, and other aspects of this problem.
8.         The rapid growth of Colombia's GDP in 1972-73 was accompanied by
a sharply accelerated rate of price inflation. Consumer prices jumped 22
percent in 1973, as compared with 14 percent in 1972, 12 percent in 1971, and
an average of 7 percent yearly in 1967-70. Food prices, which have a weight
of about 50 percent in the cost of living index, increased by 30 percent in
1973. The authorities have taken a number of measures to dampen price pressures,
including liberalization of import controls, reduction of tariffs, and tighter
controls on public expenditure, but given the weak state of public finances,
inflation continued to be a problem throughout 1974 and is expected to have
reached 25 percent by year end. To deal with this situation, the new Govern-
ment has inmoked emergency economic powers and is moving forcefully to implement
a comprehensive fiscal and monetary reform aimed at strengthening public
finances and at producing a more balanced flow of resources through Colombia's
financial system and at providing the authorities with greater monetary control.
9.         Colombia's public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$2.6 billion at the end of 1973, or US$1.9 billion excluding
undisbursed commitments. The Bank's share of this external debt (disbursed
only) as of end 1973 was about 28 percent, but this share is expected to
decline to 25 percent in 1978 as Colombia relies to a greater extent on other
external borrowing. Service on this debt is modest (12 percent of foreign
exchange earnings in 1973) relative to other developing countries. Since
exports have risen more rapidly than debt service in recent years, there has
been a decrease in the debt service ratio at a time when economic growth has
accelerated. The debt service ratio is expected to rise moderately and peak



in the mid-1980s at about 18 percent as a result of greater capital inflows
associated with a high growth rate. The Bank's share of total debt service
is expected to peak at about 28 percent in 1975 and is likely to decline
thereafter. Should economic growth continue at a rapid pace, which appears
feasible, and should that growth be accompanied by a further strong expansion
of non-coffee exports and the maintenance of sound economic and financial
policies, Colombia should find it possible to secure the amounts of external
capital it needs and to service the indebtedness that this borrowing would
generate.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
10.        The proposed loara/--the fifty-seventh to be made to Colombia --
would bring the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,085.8 million
(net of cancellations). Of the foregoing amount, US$854.6 is now held by
the Bank. IDA has made one credit of US$19.5 million for highways in
Colombia in 1961.
11.        Disbursements have been completed on 33 loans and the one IDA
credit. IFC has made effective investments and underwriting commitments in
20 enterprises in Colombia, totalling about US$27 million of which IFC now
holds US$13 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
the IDA credit, and IFC investments as of September 30, 1974, and notes on
the execution of the 23 on-going projects.

12.        Since 1968, Bank lending in Colombia has become more diversified
than in earlier years.  All three loans in the education sector have been
made since then as were one-half of the eight agricultural loans, four of
the five loans in the water supply sector and four of the loans for industry.
/ The proposed loan is presented simultaneously with two other loans for a
Water Supply and Sewerage Project and for a Telecommunications Project.



-5-
This compares with six loans during these past five years in the sectors
where the Bank has been traditionally active, i.e., power and transport.
Bank efforts have been focused on production-oriented activities and activi-
ties which carry social as well as economic benefits. Projects being developed
will seek to combine the objectives of increasing output with maximum benefits
in terms of employment and improving the income of the poor, particularly in
rural areas.
13.        We expect over the next several years to make an increasing contri-
bution to the agricultural and industrial sectors, with particular emphasis
on projects involving small and medium size farmholdings and industrial enter-
prises. The other major focus of our activities would be in such social sectors
as education and water supply. We would continue to support projects in the
traditional sectors of Bank lending -- electric power and transportation -- in
those cases where support is required for necessary institutional development
Projects are currently in an advanced stage of preparation for rural settle-
ment and irrigation rehabilitation.
14.        the operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in Annex
I, pages 3-4. Wfiile IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about four-fifths of total
external financing to Colombia in the 1961-72 period, their share has de-
creased since then. The IDB has assisted projects in low-cost housing, uni-
versity education, agrarian reform, ports, electric power, water supply,
transportation, and industry. AID has shifted the emphasis of its lending in
recent years from program to sector loans, particularly for education, urban
development, and agriculture.
PART III: SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SCALE INDUSTRY IN COLOMBIA
15.        For many years, manufacturing has been a leading growth sector in
Colombia. It has made a substantial contribution to accelerating economic
growth which reached an estimated 7.3 percent in 1973, and to Colombia's
successful export diversification drive. Exports of manufactured goods rose
from US$64 million in 1967 to an estimated US$260 million last year. Small-
and medium-scale industry, accounting for 41 percent of labor and 24 percent
of value-added in manufacturing, however, has not grown as rapidly as large
industry. While it is difficult to identify any single constraint as being
critical to expansion of small- and medium-scale industry, two major con-
straints, which the proposed project would help to alleviate, are lack of
access to credit and insufficient technical assistance. Other factors have
been the inherent difficulties which are common to small- and medium-scale
industry in most developing countries, such as inadequate raw material supply,



- 6 -
obsolete machinery, crowded work shops, shortage of entrepreneurs and quali-
fied technicians and low capacity utilization in some branches. Government
policies and technical assistance by public and private institutions have
lacked coordination and long-term planning.
16.       Small- and medium-scale industry, defined as manufacturing units
with 5 to 99 workers, comprises 91 percent of manufacturing firms. Because
it requires less capital investment per job created, it is an effective means
to increase employment, as well as to build up entrepreneurial talent. More-
over, with unskilled workers forming 57 percent of its personnel compared to
40 percent for large-scale industry, it is an important training ground for
entrants to the industrial labor force.
17.       Colombia's mountainous terrain and widely distributed population
provide protection for decentralized small- and medium-scale enterprises in
thle form of high internal transport costs. Such firms enjoy a competitive
position vis-a-vis the more centrally-located large firms. Reflecting this,
over three-fourths of small- and medium-scale manufacturing firms are located
outside the Bogota area, serving local or regional markets. The average size
of such firms is small, nine-tenths having total assets under Col$5.0 million
(US$200,000).
18.       Until a few years ago import substitution was the principal goal
of Colombia's industrialization policy. A number of export promotion measures
have been added in recent years, with spectacular success, but with most of
the benefits flowing to larger firms. Moreover, the credit system has tradi-
tionally favored agriculture, housing, and the public sector, with the result
that industry and commerce have had to pay substantially higher interest rates
than other sectors and have faced frequent shortages of capital for both short-
and long-term purposes. Larger firms have been able to expand through internal
cash generation and by making use of institutional sources of medium- and
long-term credit, in the development of which the Bank has played a major role
since 1963. Such sources include (i) the Private Investment Fund, established
within the Banco de la Republica, which has attracted external resources main-
ly from the United States, the Netherlands, and the Inter-American Development
Bank, and (ii) seven investment companies (Financieras), which have served
as the channel for five Bank loans totalling US$162.5 million. On the other
hand, smaller firms have continued to rely to a great extent on the extra-bank
market and thus have found it more difficult and expensive to undertake neces-
sary borrowings.
19.       There are three public sources of credit for small- and medium-
scale industry: (i) the Fondo Financiero Industrial (FFI), a rediscount fund
operated by the Banco de la Republica; (ii) the Caja de Credito Agrario,
Industrial y Minero (CAJA); and (iii) the Corporacion Financiera Popular
(CFP). However, the FFI finances enterprises on average somewhat larger than
those served by CFP, while the CAJA operates chiefly in rural areas and
extends very small loans. Moreover, all three sources face constraints in
the amount of funds they have available for financing fixed investment. The



proposed loan would help to relieve the pressing shortage of long-term funds
by increasing the amount of such resources available to CFP, which is the
only institution that lends exclusively to small- and medium-scale industry.
20.        The cost of industrial credit varies greatly according to source.
The effective interest rate of short-term commercial bank lending ranges
from 24 to 32 percent per annum. On medium- to long-term loans the CAJA
offers rates of 13 to 14 percent, but the volume of such loans is small.
The FFI charges 18 to 24 percent, and CFP 22 percent on loans made from its
own resources. The FFI rates for small- and medium-sized industries are
22 to 24 percent when recipient firms are located in cities with over 900,000
inhabitants (the lower rate applying to firms with total assets not exceeding
Col$5 million), and 18 percent when the recipient firms are located in smaller
cities. Furthermore, to encourage decentralization of industry, in the case
of the smaller cities the FFI permits the intermediary banks to earn a 4 per-
centage point spread and to rediscount 80 percent of the loan, as opposed to
3 percentage points and 65 percent respectively in the case of the larger
cities. These are new rates for FFI loans adopted on November 12, 1974 in
response to recommendations made by the Bank. The new rates, while still
somewhat below the real cost of capital (at the current rate of inflation
of 22-25 percent per annum), are less likely than the much lower former rates
to bias factor proportions in favor of capital-intensive techniques.
21.        There are several institutions rendering technical assistance to
smaller firms, but their programs focus on general managerial and vocational
training and provide little specialized consulting to individual firms. By
far the most important and comprehensive programs are offered by the Servicio
Nacional de Aprendizaje (SENA), a Government institution charged with improv-
ing skills of workers and managerial competence of entrepeneurs. The Funda-
cion para el Fomento de la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (FICITEC) --
a semi-private non-profit consulting institution -- is providing commendable
managerial, marketing, planning, and production assistance to solve specific
problems of individual firms, but the volume of its assistance (about 25
companies a year) is small. The trade association for small entrepreneurs,
Asociacion Colombiana Popular de Industrias (ACOPI), organizes management
seminars for its 2,200 members, and several universities have developed
regional technical assistance programs in recent years. In connection with
their lending, CFP and the CAJA occasionally provide some limited direct
technical assistance but more often arrange for assistance by other institu-
tions.
22.        Colombia's development policies, concerned with creating increased
employment opportunities, give emphasis to industry, agriculture, export
promotion and more equal income distribution. Recently there has been an
increasing awareness of the role which industry must play in creating employ-
ment opportunities and furthering urban and regional development. Accordingly,
the Government has initiated a dialogue with Bank staff concerning its indus-
trial policies, and these discussions will include the specific needs of
smaller industries. This is important as continuing strong local demand for
manufactured goods should not only offer ample opportunities for further
import substitution in existing product lines but also permit introduction



- 8 -
of new lines. Enhanced by the prospects of the Andean Common Market, chances
are good for exports of manufactured goods to continue to rise at a healthy
pace. Consequently, the outlook for continuing high growth of industrial
investment and output are good. Scope and potential of small and medium
industry are considerablelbr meeting the demand for a large number of consumer
goods, as well as for providing inputs for other manufacturing industries,
particularly since despite all its handicaps small and medium industry in
many products is efficient and competitive with large industry.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
Background
23.        In the fall of 1972 CFP initiated discussions with the Bank con-
cerning a possible loan, and following receipts of a loan request endorsed
by the Government, a pre-appraisal mission visited CFP in June 1973 to assist
in project preparation. The project was appraised by a Bank mission in
November/December 1973 and in May 1974. Negotiations were held in Bogota
during September/October 1974 with a Colombian delegation led by Dr. Cristian
Mosquera, Director General of Public Credit, Ministry of Finance.
24.        A project appraisal report entitled "Colombia:   Small-scale Industry
Project" (No. 499-CO dated December 11, 1974) is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. The main features of the loan and the project
are summarized in Annex III hereto.
History and Objectives of CFP
25.        CFP was founded in 1967 by Banco Popular, a Government-owned commer-
cial bank. Its objectives are to contribute to the development of small- and
medium-scale industry, including manufacturing, agro-industry, and mining; to
encourage import subsitution and exports; and to stimulate local and foreign
investment.
Capital Structure and Resources
26.        Until recently CFP was wholly owned by Banco Popular and its sub-
sidiary, Corporacion de Ferias y Exposiciones. However, direct Government
investment in CFP accounted for 44.5 percent of the paid-in capital as of
September 30, 1974 and is expected to increase further in 1975. As of
December 31, 1973, CFP's equity constituted 23.3 percent of its total
resources of Col$ 417 million (US$16 million equivalent) and in addition it
had mobilized borrowings from FFI (25.6 percent), Banco Popular (16.0 percent),
Fondo Nacional de Ahorro (13.0 percent), Sociedades Capitalizadores(9.3 percent),
Banco de la Republica (4.4 percent), and other sources (8.4 percent). Most
of the borrowed funds have relatively short maturities.



-9-
Management and Organization
27.       CFP's Board is headed ex officio by the Minister of Development
and includes five other members of whom two are appointed by the President
of the Republic and three by Banco Popular. The Board meets weekly and
actively guides CFP's policies and operations. The Board-appointed Loan
Committee is empowered to approve operations between Col$350,000 and
Col$1 .0 million (US$1h,000 and US$0,000 equivalent). Proposals below
these limits can be approved by the managers of the Bogota and regional
offices, while larger proposals are referred by the Loan Committee to the
Board for a decision. In practice, about two-thirds of CFP's lending
volume comes before the Board.
28.       Following the accession of the new Government in August 1974,
CFP's management was replaced in early September. CFP's new General Manager
appears to have the experience and the capacity needed to carry out his role
successfully. He is supported by four sub-managers and six regional managers.
One of the sub-manager positions has recently been vacant, and the filling
of it would therefore be a condition of effectiveness. Of the 177 total
staff, 106 are professionals, of whom 34 are located at the head office in
BDgota and the others at nine regional offices. Composed largely of young
university graduates, the professional staff is highly motivated and
dedicated to the institution's goals.
29.       CFP's internal organization and management controls require streng-
thening if CFP is to successfully manage an expanding loan portfolio and
technical assistance program. For this reason, an organization study will
be carried out by consultants, and the conclusion of a contract for such a
study will be a condition of effectiveness. The project agreement would
reouire CFP to review the consultants' recommendations with the Bank and to
agree on a program for introduction of organizational reforms.
Policies and Procedures
30.       While CFP is sufficiently well-managed to aualify for a Bank loan,
CFP's management is\aware that there is much scope for strengthening the
institution's organizational and operational capability. The proposed loan
offers an excellent opportunity for the Bank to assist in building up a
relatively new and growing development institution which has not heretofore
gained access to international credit. In this connection, Bank staff
assisted CFP in drafting a Statement of Policies and Procedures which was
recently adopted by CFP's Board.
31.       To help insure against considerations of financial risk overshadow-
ing developmental objectives in CFP's selection and approval of sub-projects,
it was agreed that the composition of CFP's Board and Loan Committee would
be diversified. Accordingly, it would be a condition of effectiveness that
CFP's Statutes be amended to preclude Banco Popular's having majority represen-
tation on CFP's Board or Loan Committee.



- 10 -
32.        Project appraisal by CFP requires improvement.   Although compre-
hensive technical, financial, and economic evaluation of projects is not
feasible in the case of CFP's typically small loans, greater attention
should be paid to the long-term prospects of client firms, and to identi-
fying managerial, technical, and marketing obstacles to greater output
and efficiency. To strengthen its appraisal capability, CFP intends to
continue increasing its staff. In addition, a UNIDO project evaluation
expert joined CFP in July 1974 for a six-month assignment.
33.        Monitoring of client operations was introduced in 1972 when
arrears increased suddenly, but supervision is not yet commensurate with
the volume of operations. Agreement has been reached with CFP regarding the
steps it would take to improve this aspect of its activities (Section 2.08 of
draft Project Agreement and Schedule to this Agreement).
34.        Technical assistance to client firms is a necessary component of
small-business development which distinguishes it from other industrial
finance operations. CFP began a technical assistance program in 1971 with
training courses in which representatives of 546 client firms had partici-
pated up to December 31, 1973. In addition, CFP has arranged for direct
technical assistance to 44 firms, addressed to their specific problems.
The proposed loan would help CFP to expand its direct technical assistance
activities by providing funds to finance technical assistance credits on
somewhat concessional terms. Other resources for technical assistance will
be provided by AID and possibly under the British and German bilateral assist-
ance programs. A second UNIDO adviser is also assisting CFP for one year
in assessing its technical assistance work.
35.        The scope and quality of the work on CFP's accounts performed by
its present auditor does not meet the Bank's standards.   Hence, CFP has
agreed to contract for the service of an external auditor acceptable to the
Bank and to have the auditor prepare annually a full audit report following
the standard format for DFC's associated with the Bank group.
Past Operations
36.        Despite its still small size, CFP has made a valuable contribution
to the development of Colombian small and medium industry. Within six years,
CFP has made over 3,500 loans totalling Col$ 802 million to some 3,000 enter-
prises. Reflecting its rapid growth, almost two-thirds was lent during 1972
and 1973, when CFP provided an estimated one-fifth of institutional financing
to small and medium industry. Loan recipients represented a wide range of
industrial subsectors. Apparel and footwear (16 percent) and non-metallic
mineral products, metal working, and food processing (about 10 percent each)
received the most. These industrial lines are among the least protected
in Colombia.
37.        Given CFP's limited long-term resources,about 70 percent of its
loans have been extended for working capital. Relatively short maturities --
the average is about 2-1/2 year for working capital and 4 years for fixed



- 11 -
asset financing -- and tight collateral requirements reflect the conserva-
tive past policy of CFPts Loan Committee. Almost 90 percent of the boctiwEs
had total assets of less than Col$3 million and the average loan amount was
below Col$250,000, which shows that CFP has been successful in reaching
very small firnms. CFP was also able to penetrate virtually all of Colombia's
geographic regions. For each loan in Bogota, CFP's regional offices made
three o-;side_tbhe-capital-area. CFP estimates that its operations have
helped create some 24,000 new jobs.
38.        During 1969-73 CFP's total assets rose rapidly, from Col$ 51 mil-
lion to Col$ 417 million. To sustain this brisk development CFP relied after
1970 on heavy borrowings, and consequently its debt-equity ratio increased
from 0.4:1 in 1969 to 3.2:1 at year-end 1973. Considering the structure
of its borrowings and the risks inherent in financing small and medium indus-
try, CFP has proposed that its debt should not exceed four times equity.
The latter limit has been incorporated in CFP's Statement of Policies and
Procedures and in the Project Agreement (Section 3.04 of draft Project Agree-
ment).
39.        Since inception CFP has been modestly profitable.  Administrative
expenses, equivalent to 6.2 percent of average total assets in 1973, are
not excessive considering CFP's need to maintain an extensive network of
regional offices, to administer a large number of credits, and to perform
non-income-generating activities in support of small and medium industry.
For 1973 net profits amounted to Col$ 4.4 million and resulted in a return
on average equity of 5.4 percent. As a result of inflation, CFP's 1973
relatively low profitability resulted in an estimated 16 percent decrease
in net worth. Although as a public institution serving small entre-
preneurs CFP should not be expected to yield high returns, erosion of its
capital should be guarded against. This can be accomplished by insuring that
interest rates provide an adequate real return and, when they do not, by
replenishment of capital. The Government would make additional contributions
to CFP's equity as might be required to maintain the real value of its
capital (Section 2.02 (a) of draft Guarantee Agreement).
40.        Reflecting a sharp increase in the loan portfolio from Col$ 95
million to Col$ 365 million in 1970-73 and a rising average age of loans
outstanding, CFP's arrears have risen substantially. At year-end 1973, out
of CFP's 2,473 clients, 667 were in arrears, and of these, 186 were in
liquidation. Loan principal in arrears for more than three months amounted
to Col$ 20 million and accounted for 5.5 percent of total loan portfolio
(CFP's total exposure with clients in arrears reached 10.4 percent of total
loan portfolio). Though CFP's arrears situation is acceptable when compared
to other DFCs assisted by the Bank Group, there nevertheless is cause for
concern about loans in arrears over one year, which increased from Col$ 5
million in 1970 to Col$ 15 million at year-end 1973. As noted in Paragraph
33, agreement has been reached on measures which CFP would take to reduce
arrears, especially those above one year.
41.        Earlier this year CFP and its independent auditor carried out a
detailed review of its year-end 1973 portfolio. This showed that CFP's



- 12 -
losses on doubtful loans in that portfolio would probably amount to Col$ 12
million, but that this risk was sufficiently covered by provisions and port-
folio reserves which totalled Col$ 12.3 million and Col$ 7 million, respec-
tively, on June 30, 1974. However, since CFP does not yet have an adequate
provisions policy to cover itself against possible losses, CFP would annually
review its portfolio and compute, to the satisfaction of its auditors, the
necessary provisions to be deducted from equity when calculating its debt/equity
ratio (Sections 3.03 and 3.04 (d) of draft Project Agreement).
Projected Operations
42.        On the basis of a sample survey, and taking likely inflation into
account, it has been estimated that CFP's loan commitments would rise from
Col$278 million in 1973 to Col$658 million by the end of 1976. Approximately
60 percent of the demand would be for the financing of working capital and
40 percent for fixed investment. While CFP intends to increase its equity
investments, they would remain small relative to lending operations.
43.        To achieve the foregoing level of operations, CFP would need to
increase its borrowings by Col$ 728 million and its equity by Col$ 165 mil-
lion by the end of 1976. As to borrowings, CFP believes it can obtain
roughly half its requirements from its traditional sources. New local
sources would be expected to supply about one-quarter, while the remainder
would be sought in the form of foreign loans, including the presently pro-
posed loan and another of the equivalent of US$2.5 million which is under
negotiation with the German Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau. Assurances have
been obtained from the Government that CFP would be provided with sufficient
local resources to permit the carrying out of its lending and investment program
through 1977 (Section 2.02 of draft Guarantee Agreement). As to equity, an
increase of CFP's capital by Col$ 115 million has already taken place in 1974.
The Proposed Loan
44.        The proposed US$5.5 million loan would consist of three elements:
(i) a US$2.5 million first tranche for relending to small enterprises for
fixed investment; (ii) a US$2.5 million second tranche for the same purpose,
to be released only if a Bank review were to show that CFP's performance in
utilizing the first tranche had been satisfactory 1/ and provided also that
agreement were reached on the sub-loan interest rate to be charged on the
second tranche (Section 3.02 (a) (iv) of draft Loan Agreement); and (iii)
US$0.5 million which would be used to finance technical assistance to CFP
itself and for technical assistance lending by CFP to enterprises also
receiving credits for fixed investment.
1/    Such review would concentrate on: (a) satisfactory implementation of
CFP's program for reducing arrears in loan recovery; (b) introduction
and maintenance by CFP of adequate subproject appraisal standards; (c)
introduction and maintenance by CFP of a systematic loan supervision
system; and (d) progress in implementing the main recommendations of the
study on the organization of CFP.



- 13 -
45.        The loan would relieve the scarcity of long-term resources avail-
able to CFP and permit it to increase its financing of fixed investment by
small-scale industry. Since this would be CFP's first association with an
international agency, the loan would also permit the Bank to make an impor-
tant contribution to the improvement of the institution's organization and
procedures. The loan might also serve as a catalyst by facilitating CFP's
access to funds from other sources. Moreover, since this would be the Bank's
first loan in Latin America exclusively for small industry credit, it is
expected that new knowledge would be gained about the ways in which this
sub-sector can best be assisted.
46.        The sample survey of CFP's past clients indicated that the Bank's
US$5.5 million loan would help finance investment projects and technical
assistance aggregating US$10.2 million; about 30 percent of the financing
would be provided by CFP out of its own resources and about 15 percent by
the sub-borrowers themselves.
47.        The proposed loan would be made to the Banco de la Republica, which
would assume the foreign exchange risk on peso-denominated subloans. The
Banco de la Republica would make the peso equivalent available to CFP at 18.5
percent interest for the fixed-asset relending program and at 12 percent interest
for the technical assistance program. Interest rates to the ultimate borrower
would be 24 percent on peso-denominated fixed-asset subloans and 13.5 percent on
foreign exchange denominated fixed-asset subloans,i/ and 15 percent on technical-
assistance subloans (peso-denominated). The composite interest spread to the
Banco de la Republica, assuming that all subloans are taken in peso denominations,
would be on the order of 10 percent, which would be sufficient to cover the ex-
pected depreciation of the exchange rate, which has been running at approximately
8-1/2 percent per annum, and also to cover the Banco de la Republica's adminli-
strative costs. Subloans would have a maturity of between four and ten
years, with up to 3 years of grace. Should recent inflation rates in Colombia
continue, the proposed rate for fixed-asset lending would be slightly positive
in real terms, but the proposed rate for technical assistance lending would
be substantially negative. Given the promotional purpose of the proposed
loan, the relatively small subsidy inherent in the first rate seems justified;
as regards the second rate, while the subsidy may be large in percentage terms,
the amounts involved are small, and it must be recognized that fairly large
incentives for Colombia's small entrepreneurs will be needed in order to
broaden the application of more sophisticated techniques as will be promoted
by the technical assistance envisaged. As noted earlier, the relending rates
would be reviewed after the first half of Bank loan funds for fixed-asset
financing have been committed to determine whether the relending rate for
fixed-asset financing would be likely to remain slightly positive in real
terms and continue to provide an adequate spread to Banco de la Republica
and Corporacion Financiera Popular.
1/    In the latter case the Banco de la Republica would make the funds
available to CFP at 8-1/4 percent.



- 14 -
48.        The Bank loan would be repaid by Banco de la Republica in twelve
years, with 3-1/2 years of grace, and any difference between subloan repay-
ments to CFP and amortization of the loan received by CFP from the Banco
de la Republica would be freely available to CFP for its normal operations.
In the case of subloans denominated in foreign exchange, the Banco de la
Republica would also carry any exchange risk resulting from the foregoing
difference in amortization schedules. The commitment fee on the Bank loan
would be charged against the undisbursed portion of sub-loans which either
have been authorized by the Bank for withdrawals or have been approved by
CFP and submitted to the Banco de la Republica (Section 2.05 of draft Loan
Agreement). This slightly concessional treatment is considered justified
as CFP is still a young institution and has a low profitability.
49.        Eligibility for fixed-asset subloans would be limited to firms
with total assets not in excess of Col$ 10 million (the equivalent of
US$400,000) except for 25 percent of the loan proceeds which could be relent
to firms with total assets over Col$ 10 million but not exceeding Col$ 20
million (US$800,000 equivalent). The maximum relending under the loan to any
one firm would be Col$2.5 million (the equivalent of US$100,000), in the case of
firms with assets up to Col$10 million and Col$4 million (US$160,000) in the
case of the larger firms. We would expect about 200 fixed-investment subloans
averaging the equivalent of US$25,000 to be made by CFP under the project.
The typical recipient would be a firm with assets between Col$ 3 million and
Col$ 6 million, employing 20 to 50 workers. Under CFP's policies, no credit
could exceed 50 percent of the total investment in a new enterprise, or the
net worth of the firm in the case of an existing enterprise. Accepting CFP's
existing procedures, regional offices would be empowered to approve subloans
up to Col$ 350,000, while subloans of higher amounts would require the approval
of CFP's Loan Committee or Board of Directors. Subloans over Col$ 1.5 million
(the equivalent of US$60,000) would require prior Bank approval. Bank super-
vision missions would, of course, also review ex post a sample of subloans
approved by CFP under the free limit and would at the same time make suggestions
for improvements in CFP's appraisal practices.
Disbursement
50.        Disbursement of Bank funds would be made for 90 percent of expendi-
tures for specific fixed assets -- 100 percent of CIF cost whenever documen-
tation is available -- and 100 percent of the cost of consultants' technical
assistance services. On average, disbursements under this formula would be
equivalent to the estimated 54 percent foreign exchange component of the
project.
51.        CFP would apply for disbursements through the Banco de la Republica's
Department of Development Credit, which would monitor all applications.
Detailed documentation for expenditures would normally not be submitted to the
Bank but retained in Colombia for inspection by Bank supervision missions.



- 15 -
Economic Benefits and Justification
52.        Due to the varied nature and large number of sub-loans anticipated,
it would be difficult to calculate an economic rate of return for the project.
However, CFP's appraisal of sub-projects would help insure an adequate finan-
cial rate of return, which in most cases would be expected to exceed 15 per-
cent. Considering the substantial urban unemployment and the low rate of
protection enjoyed by many of CFP's clients, the economic rate of return on
most sub-projects would be higher than the financial rate of return.
53.        Most sub-projects would be for the expansion of capacity.    Foreign
exchange benefits would result from the increased output, much of which would
substitute for imports. In addition, about 25 percent of sub-projects could
be expected to produce some additional exports.
54.        With small industry requiring less capital investment per job than
large industry and in addition employing a large number of new entrants to
the industrial labor force, the project's employment benefits should be sub-
stantial and should assist in improving income distribution. An estimated
1,700 to 2,300 jobs would be created, about three-quarters outside Bogota.
In addition to helping to upgrade the skills of labor, the project would
encourage the development of entrepreneurship. Because Colombia's topography
causes high transportation costs, small industry is widely dispersed, and
hence the project would contribute to regional development and industrial
decentralization.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Banco de la
Republica,the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the Corporacion
Financiera Popular, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Features of the draft Agreement of special interest
are referred to in Part IV of this Report.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
56.         I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

COLOMBIA - MEMORANDUM ON RECENT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
A. Recent Economic Developments
Economic Growth
1.         The Colombian economy has performed impressively in a number of
important respects in the past several years. Real growth of gross domestic
product accelerated from an average of 4.7 percent in 1950-67 to an average
of 6.4 percent over the 1967-72 period. During the past two years, Colombia
has sustained even higher rates of growth, 7.1 percent in 1972 and 7.3 percent
in 1973, the highest rates of growth achieved in 25 years. Strong expansion
of the industrial, agricultural, and in 1973, construction sectors, rapid
growth of non-traditional exports, and favorable coffee prices were the key
factors in this achievement. Preliminary indications are that GDP growtn has
decelerated slightly in 1974 as a result of a slowdown in the construction
boom and a weakening of coffee prices. While industry continues to be the
leading growth sector, expanding by 10 percent in real terms in 1973 and
accounting for about 30 percent of growth of GDP, a boom in construction
generated an increase in value added by that sector of 12.6 percent. Despite
rapid growth of the labor-intensive construction sector, unemployment has
continued to increase in most of Colombia's major urban centers, in part as
a result of accelerated rural to urban migration. While the rate of growth
of agriculture (4.8 percent in 1973) was well above the historical average,
most of the growth was concentrated in agricultural commodities for export.
Lagging production for domestic consumption, insufficient to keep pace with
domestic demand has contributed to inflationary pressures. Mining production
has declined steadily for the past several years as a result of declining
petroleum production.
Inflation
2.         Inflation has become a serious problem in Colombia and seems likely
to persist for some time, despite a number of measures taken in recent months
to combat it. The cost-of-living index is expected to have risen by about 25 percent
in 1974 as compared to 22 percent last year, 14 percent in 1972, 12 percent
in 1971, and an average of 7 percent per year between 1967 and 1970. Accelera-
tion in the rate of inflation during 1973 and the first quarter of 1974 was
the result of a surge in the level of demand stemming from (a) the substantial
increase in the income of the export sector; (b) the large fiscal deficit in
the cash operations of the,public sector; and (c) continued strong private
investment.  Rising cost of imports, labor and credit, combined with tight
controls on imports and a decline in the output of agricultural production
for domestic consumption further aggravated inflationary pressures. Measures
adopted in late 1973 and early 1974 to limit the rate of expansion of aggregate
demand and increase aggregate supply have begun to take hold and the rate of



ANNEX I
Page 6 of 12
inflation has declined during the second and third quarters of 1974. However,
increasing pressure for substantial upward wage adjustments from organized
labor and the need to eliminate some subsidies and allow upward adjustment
in prices of a number of items which have been controlled for the past 12
months have caused some increase in the rate of inflation during recent
months. Progress in reducing the rate of inflation in 1975 will depend
heavily upon the Government's success in arresting the deterioration in
public finances which has taken place since 1972.
Balance of Payments
3.         Colombia's rapid growth in 1972-73 was sparked by strong growth of
coffee and most minor exports which permitted a large accumulation of foreign
exchange reserves. Coffee exports increased an estimated 34 percent to
US$630 million, largely as a result of continuation of the upsurge in world
coffee prices (an average of US$0.73 per pound in 1973 as compared to US$0.57
in 1972) which began in mid-1972 as Brazilian coffee production declined. Of
even more significance from the point of view of the long-term growth of the
Colombian economy was the continued strong performance of minor exports which
increased 48 percent to US$680 million. Price rises for these goods accounted
for a significant proportion of the increase, but volume exported also rose
by a substantial 15 percent. Despite the impressive 40 percent increase in
total export earnings which took place in 1973, Colombia continued throughout
most of the year to maintain tight controls on imports. As a consequence the
value of imports exceeded the 1972 level by only 22 percent, not substantially
more than the increase in import prices. The increased real availability of
imported goods accordingly did little to dampen domestic inflationary pressures.
Despite official measures to speed up import payments and to reduce foreign
exchange inflows to the Bank of the Republic arising from private borrowing
abroad, official reserves increased from US$345 million at end-1972 to US$524
million at end-1973.
4.         Export performance during the first seven months of 1974 was out-
standing. Higher world coffee prices and a 32 percent increase in the volume
shipped resulted in a 36 percent increase in coffee export registrations
during this period as compared to the same period of 1973. Registrations of
non-traditional exports increased 51.4 percent through July, an increase of
over 30 percent in real terms. Exports of manufactured products have been a
major element in the strong expansion of non-traditional exports with earnings
from textiles increasing three-fold, while those from chemicals and pharmaceuti-
cals, and metals and metal products, doubled. Import liberalization has led
to accelerated import payments and there has been a lengthening of the lag
between export registrations and exchange surrender. Thus, despite strong
export performance the current account of the balance of payments has shifted
from a surplus of over US$100 million during the first seven months of 1973
to a deficit of US$80 million during the same period of this year. Sharply
reduced external borrowing by the Government has further lowered the inflow
of foreign exchange, and reserves probably declined by about US$120 million
during 1974.



ANNEX I
Page 7 of 12
5.       The estimated decline in foreign exchange reserves of US$120 million for
1974 should not present any problem to Colombia since an appropriate cushion of
reserves, sufficient to cover about 4 months of imports, probably still existed
by year end. Foreign exchange reserve management over the next eighteen
months should aim at preventing further losses, since world coffee prices may
remain weak for some time, and prices of several of Colombia's non-traditional
agricultural exports appear to have peaked, while those of imports are expected
to continue rising. The new government is aware of the possibility of some
deterioration in the terms of trade and is attempting to sustain the high rate
of growth of non-traditional exports by accelerating devaluation of the peso
so as to compensate exporters for the differential between internal and ex-
ternal inflation. Since mid-August the rate of depreciation of the peso has
been substantially greater than the differential between domestic and world
inflation and the Government intends to continue this policy for the fore-
seeable future.
Public Finances
6.         Deterioration of Colombia's public finances since 1971 has made
it increasingly difficult for the authorities to manage aggregate demand so
as to contain inflation while maintaining a desirable pace of development.
Despite an average annual real rate of growth of GDP in excess of 7 percent,
National Government tax revenue has failed to show any significant increase
in real terms and, as a percentage of GDP, declined from the peak of 9.4 per-
cent in 1971 to an expected 7.4 percent in 1974. This weakening in domestic
resource mobilization through the tax system was, in 1972 and 1973, reflected
in increased Government recourse to general purpose external borrowing to
cover the Government's cash deficit, and in declining real levels of public
investment. In order to overcome these problems, the new Government has
initiated a comprehensive structural reform of the fiscal system which includes
major modification of the sales and income taxes, elimination of the wheat
subsidy, reduction of fiscal incentives for non-traditional exports, and
strengthening of the fiscal contribution of decentralized public enterprises.
The reform has not yet been fully put into effect, but it could, if fully
implemented and supplemented by an urban property tax and measures to eliminate
the subsidy of gasoline consumption, produce a substantial strengthening of
public finances.
B. Development Problems and Policy Requirements
7.         While Colombia's growth, and balance of payments performance has
been excellent in recent years, lagging performance in several important
areas could, if permitted to continue, jeopardize the country's development
effort. The key areas where policy action is required include improving
the performance of the petroleum sector, strengthening public finances and



ANNEX I
Page 8 of 12
investment, maintaining the appropriate balance in the flow of resources
through the financial system, further improving income distribution and the
employment situation, and assuring continued strong expansion of non-tradi-
tional exports.
Petroleum
8.         Colombia is fortunate in having sufficient crude petroleum supplies
to escape any immediate adverse balance of payments' effect of recent in-
creases in world oil prices. However, an unrealistic pricing policy has, in
recent years, encouraged excessive consumption and contributed to a decline
in output. While the internal reference price paid to producers for "new"
crude oil was increased to US$4 per barrel in February 1974, prices to
producers for petroleum flowing from existing fields as well as prices at
the refinery and consumer levels have not been changed since June 1971, and
are far below prices in international markets.
9.         Crude oil production has declined 20 percent since 1970, and crude
exports have stopped altogether. Creation of appropriate incentives for in-
creased exploitation of oil from fields already in production, and a modest
dampening of domestic demand by means of long-overdue price increases, would
permit Colombia to hold off crude oil imports until 1979-80. If decisive
action is taken in the months ahead to encourage exploration and drilling,
it is entirely possible that new oil, sufficient to meet domestic demand,
could become available in 5-6 years. Failure to act in the immediate future,
however, could, in the early 1980's, result in a heavy burden on Colombia's
balance of payments.
10.        Prices of petroleum products are controlled by the Government and
the retail price of gasoline is among the lowest in the world (regular
gasoline is US$0.12/gallon). Considering the country's supply and demand
situation, product prices to the consumer and at the different stages of
production should be increased so as to be more in line with international
prices. Such a price adjustment should be done as soon as possible since
low petroleum product prices have not only discouraged production of petroleum,
but have diverted attention from development of the abundant coal, natural
gas, and hydroelectric resources which Colombia possesses. Hydropower, coal,
and natural gas currently account for only 4 percent, 12 percent, and 17 percent,
respectively, of energy production and there is considerable scope for sub-
stituting these alternative energy sources for petroleum. To develop them
will, however, require careful planning and sizable capital outlays, as well
as proper pricing to encourage an appropriate energy balance. There is a
close relationship between petroleum pricing policy and the fiscal situation
since price increases of petroleum products would increase the Central Govern-
ment's fiscal resources through further improved finances of the State-owned
oil company, ECOPETROL, and through increased gasoline tax collections. This
would help to overcome the revenue shortfalls which hamper the investment
program and which limit the government's ability to reduce present inflationary
pressures.

Public Savings and Investment
11.        Notwithstanding the booming production and trade conditions of the
economy over the past few years, Colombia's public finance performance has
been disappointing. Largely because of poor tax collections in 1972 and 1973
(especially for the income tax) the real current surplus in both years was
below that in 1971. The real decline in income tax collections in 1973 oc-
curred despite a 7.3 percent increase in real GDP and reveals a serious
weakness in income tax administration. Real public investment spending in
1973, covered in part by severe compression of current outlays and by
US$80 million in Eurocurrency borrowing, fell sharply despite the continued
pressing need for expanded social and economic infrastructure. Preliminary
data for 1973 indicate that the decline in public investment has not been
offset by an increase in private investment and that the share of total
investment in GDP has fallen from an average 21.4 percent in the 1969-72
period to 19.3 percent in 1973. Without substantial strengthening of public
finances, public investment could continue to decline in real terms and the
expansion of the private sector could be constrained by lack of complementary
social and economic infrastructure.
12.        Reliable data are not yet available concerning Colombia's overall
public sector accounts for 1971-74, but enough is known to make it clear that
the decline in National Government investment during this period was not
offset by spending in the rest of the public sector. The new Government is
aware of the need for increased investment by decentralized public sector
agencies and is expected to move rapidly in the coming months to assure an
appropriate increase in the internally generated resources of these agencies.
Deficits of public enterprises in the electric power, water and sewerage,
and telecommunications sectors, with the exception of Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM),have risen in recent years as a result of lagging
tariffs. Three decentralized enterprises, Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos
(ECOPETROL), TELECOM and Empresa Colombiana de Puertos (COLPUERTOS), have in
the past few years accounted for 90 percent of the total current surplus of
the public enterprises. Dissaving of public enterprises was concentrated in
four enterprises; IDEMA (the Government's agricultural marketing agency), the
Railways (CNR), Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA), and Instituto Colombiano
de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA). In the rest of the public sector the tendency
has been for savings to decline also since 1969. As a result total public
savings fell from 7.0 percent of GDP in 1969 to 5.0 percent in 1973.
13.       The recently completed fiscal reform contains an impressive array
of measures aimed at (a) increasing tax revenue; (b) improving the progressivity
of the tax system by reducing the tax burden on the lowest income groups, increas-
ing taxes on the highest income groups, and by closing numerous loopholes which
have permitted high income groups to avoid paying taxes; (c) increasing the
elasticity of the tax system; and (d) improving tax administration. While it
will be several months before the revenue implications of the fiscal reform
become completely clear, preliminary estimates indicate that new tax revenue
of about Col$ 2.5 billion will be generated in 1975. In addition, elimination
of the wheat subsidy has reduced the need for transfers to IDEMA by an esti-
mated Col$ 1.2 billion in 1975.   The outlook for 1975 is for a sharply



ANNEX I
Page 10 of 12
reduced National Government deficit as the recent revenue generating measures
begin to take hold. The Central Government deficit should be reduced from
about 2% of GDP in 1971-72 to 0.2% in 1975; but it must be noted that this
is likely to be achieved only with the help of a further reduction in real
terms in investment expenditures by the National Government.
Reform of the Financial System
14.        In August 1974, the new administration introduced a series of execu-
tive decrees and resolutions aimed at domestic monetary reform. These measures
involve restructuring of interest rates, including establishment of a maximum
ceiling on the rate of monetary correction, a simplification of Colombia's
complex reserve requirement system, the elimination of numerous portfolio
requirements, the elimination of several rediscount facilities, and the
adoption of more stringent controls over existing facilities. In broad terms,
these measures should produce a more balanced flow of resources through
Colombia's financial system and provide the authorities with greater control
over the functioning of the monetary system.
Income Distribution and Employment
15.        Despite the paucity of suitable statistics it seems clear that tile
existing distribution of personal income is markedly unequal. The poorest
fifth of the population appears to be receiving 3 percent of total income,
while the richest fifth gets about 60 percent. Not much can be said about
changes over time, but since rural incomes seem to be more highly skewed than
urban incomes, the increasing demographic importance of the towns and cities
would seem to present a prima facie case for presuming a modest improvement
in the overall national income distribution. This conclusion is to some
extent supported by national income accounts data which indicate that the
share of wage and salary income of GDP increased from 36 percent in 1950
to 40 percent in 1970. Few Colombians would accept past rates of improvement
as adequate, however, and a great deal remains to be done in order to snr-!
the benefits of economic growth more widely. Rural land redistribution,
more effective taxation, higher public spending for education and health
services, and a vigorous effort to boost overall production and employment
growth are all needed, together with continuing efforts to prevent abuses
arising from monopoly power. Colombia's authorities have accelerated their
efforts to do all of these things in recent years.
16.        The employment goal is perhaps the most important of all the major
national objectives in the economic sPbere. Increasing and spreading employ-
ment opportunities is the single most effective way to raise the level and
improve the distribution of national income. Data on unemployment are sparse,
but the available figures for 1972 point to an improvement in Bogota accom-
panied by deterioration in Medellin, Barranquilla, and other urban centers.
If rough weights by city are applied, a slight overall deterioration seems
to have occurred. Since 1972 rural to urban migration appears to have
increased and as a result unemployment in Colombia's major urban centers has
increased. The one exception to this has been in Cali where accelerated
rural to urban migration has not been as pronounced because of its rich agri-
cultural hinterland and decentralized agro-industries located in a number of



ANNEX I
Page 11 of 12
smaller cities throughout the Departments of Valle and Cauca. The challenge
facing Colombia's authorities is to encourage and shape growth of employment
through the use of excise taxes, depreciation allowances, import tariffs and
general monetary/fiscal policies. Special incentives should be provided to
industries which are labour-intensive and to firms willing to undertake
multiple shifting as a means of increasing employment.
External Borrowing
17.        Available data indicate that Colombia's public external debt out-
standing at the end of 1973 came to US$2.6 billion, of which US$1.9 billion
had been disbursed. During 1973 contracts were signed to borrow US$421
million (of which US$305 million were project loans). The levels and composi-
tion of 1973 borrowing closely approximated the amounts set forth in the 1973
project list (as described in the May 1973 IBRD Economic Report net of expected
slippage and droppage). An estimated disbursement of US$340 million on public
external borrowing occurred in 1973, as compared to US$355 million in 1972 and
US$223 million in 1971. While disbursements on project loans increased 20
percent in 1973, a slowdown of such disbursements has taken place since late
1973, reflecting a scarcity of local counterpart funds stemming from the
deteriorating fiscal performance. However, the fiscal actions now being taken
by the Colombian Government, and those under consideration may to some extent
ameliorate this situation, and it is hoped that by the time of the 1975
Consultative Group Meeting sufficient action will have been taken to enable
the Group to proceed with consideration of a full assistance program for
1975-76.
C. The Growth Perspective and Capital Requirements
18.        Recent IBRD Economic Reports on Colombia have concluded that the
economy can sustain a 7 percent annual rate of growth over the long-term
without excessive foreign borrowing, provided that exports can be increased
at a reasonable rate. During 1972-73 this growth target was attained, and
it is likely that in 1974 real growth will again reach about 7 percent. These
high rates of growth were accompanied by a strong export and balance-of-payments
performance, which made possible a large build-up of foreign exchange re-
serves, and a decline in the debt service ratio. The long-term projection
made last year is being revised, to take into account recent developments and
new information on the outlook for commodity prices and world inflation.
19.       For the time being it seems safe to assume that the volume of coffee
exports will increase 1.5 percent annually from 1975 through the remainder of
the current decade and that export earnings from coffee in current prices will
increase an average 7.6 percent annually, until 1979. Growth in the volume of
other exports which include a wide range of manufactured and agricultural exports,
can be assumed on that basis to decline from 20 percent in 1975 to 10 percent
for 1979.  Total exports would increase in current prices at an average 14.3



ANNEX I
Page 12 of 12
per year from 1974 on. In real terms the growth rate of total exports may thus
be between 7% and 7.5%. Imports may be assumed to be about 15 percent of GDP
throughout the projection period provided that Colombia will not require sub-
stantial imports of crude oil. Under these assumptions Colombia will require
public external assistance disbursements totalling about US$3.5 billion during
the five-year period 1975-79. This level of external assistance implies new
commitments averaging US$700 million annually. These public external assistance
requirements imply only modest increases in real terms over recent levels.
20.       In the past the structure of Colombia's external debt has been strongly
influenced by the receipt of large amounts of development assistance from inter-
national development agencies. This, together with the successful export per-
formance, explains the low and relatively stable debt service ratio which Colombia
has experienced over the past decade. As a result of continuing rapid growth of
non-traditional exports and favorable coffee prices, the burden of debt service
on the balance of payments declined moderately in 1973. The debt service ratio
(principal and interest payments as a percentage of exports of goods and nonfactor
3ervices) amounted to a modest 12 percent in 1973 compared to 12.9 percent in 1972
and 14.3 percent in 1971. The debt service ratio is now lower than throughout,
most of the 1960s. Despite the expected shift away from external assistance
from international development agencies and the large increase in total external
borrowing (in current prices) which is foreseen at least until the end of the
current decade, the debt service ratio would remain well manageable during that
period. In these circumstances, and assuming that Colombia is able to sustain
its export expansion and avoid external borrowing on unfavorable terms to cover
fiscal shortfalls, the country should have little difficulty in obtaining the
required external capital and in servicing its external debt obligations.
However, some of this capital will have to finance local costs, if the
country is to cover its justifiable resource gap, since the foreign exchange
content of the projectizable portion of the investment program is likely to
be comparatively small.

C.    PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
1.         Summarized below is the current status of all loans signed but not
fully disbursed:
Ln No. 502 Irrigation (Atlantico I); US$9 million, June 1967.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1973;
current - December 31, 1974.
2.         While all physical works should be completed by the current clos-
ing date, final payments to contractors will not occur until March or April
1975. A further extension of closing date to June 30, 1975, is therefore
being considered. The delays in project execution have been occasioned by
poor selection of areas suitable for irrigation, technical problems in the
construction of irrigation and drainage works, and non-compliance by con-
tractors with established schedules. Agricultural development has also been
slow, due to poor project management and lack of adequate supporting services
to the farmer. However, INCORA has lnow appointed a very capable Project
Manager who has brought with him a competent agricultural team who, it is
believed, have the potential to develop the project satisfactorily under its
less than ideal circumstances. Citrus has now been abandoned as a project
crop. Rice is now proposed as a temporary irrigated crop in order to allow
the leaching of salts from the soil profile. The intensive cropping pattern
needed to justify the investment in irrigation facilities will be several
years in development.
Ln No. 536 Water Supply (Bogota I); US$14 million, June 1968.
Closing date: original - June 1972;
current - December 31, 1975.
3.         As of September 30, 1974, US$13.6 million or 97 percent of this
loan has been disbursed. Notwithstanding that the Project is essentially
completed, the Closing Date was extended because of delays in procurement
and to permit final payments to suppliers.
Ln No. 575 Electric Power (Interconnection): US$18 million, December 1968.
Closing date: December 31, 1974.
4.         The original project was completed and commercially operational
in 1971. The Bank agreed that an undisbursed balance could be used to fi-
nance a 220 kv transmission line, Guatape - Barrancabermeja, which would

strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

be completed in the first quarter of 1975, one year behind schedule. The
cost is estimated at US$7.2 million of which about US$4.1 million represents
the foreign currency component. The Bank is seriously concerned about ISA's
financial situation which is being discussed with the borrower and the Govern-
ment.
Ln No. 624 Agricultural Credit II, US$17 million, June 1969
Closing date: original - December 31, 1973;
current - June 30, 1975.
5.         After disappointing performance in the first three years, changes
in project management and organization and an increase in technical personnel
provided the basis in February 1973 for the Bank's agreeement to enlarge the
project area and include lending to small farmers under the project. As a
result, the project is now proceeding in a satisfactory manner. All project
funds are expected to be committed by end 1974.
Ln No. 625 Development Finance Companies III: US$25 million,
June 1969.
Closing date:  June 30, 1974
6.         The loan is fully committed to sub-projects.    The Bank will ascertain
whether the Borrower wishes the Closing Date postponed or the small undisbursecd
balance cancelled.
Ln No. 651 Livestock II; US$18.3 million, December 1969
Closing date: July 31, 1975
7.         After a disappointing performance during the first three years afLer
signing, 1970-72, CAJA's project administration was reorganized and the project
area was extended to cover the entire country. The project has, since early
1973, progressed satisfactorily. Demand for on-farm investments is high an,
disbursements have been accelerating. Ali loan funds are expected to be com-
mitted by end 1974 and disbursements might be completed before the original
closing date of July 31, 1975.
Ln No. 679 Education II; US$6.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - June 30, 1973;
current - December 31, 1974.
8.         Major civil works have been completed and all nine project schools
have been in operation since January 1973. However, operation of schools is
below the expected level because of inadequate organization and shortage
of local funds to meet current expenditures. Procurement of equipment and
furniture has been delayed. All contracts will be signed before the extended
closing date, but disbursements should continue later on. A further post-
ponement of the closing date is therefore planned.
Ln No. 680 Highway VI; US$32 million, June 1970
Closing date: original - November 30, 1974;
current - November 30, 1976.

9.         The largest component of the project, the paving program, has ex-
perienced considerable cost increases and is still experiencing delays. The
Ministry of Public Works has taken many steps (approved by the Bank) which
have reduced, although not avoided, delays and contractor bankruptcies. Due
to cost increases, the Bank's participation in the paving program has been
reduced to 15 percent. The status of the other components of the project
is more satisfactory.
Ln No. 681 Chivor Hidroelectric Power; US$52.8 million, June 1970.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
10.        The Chivor Hydroelectric Project is expected to be put into ser-
vice in June 1975, six months behind schedule. The project's foreign and
total costs are expected to be 35 percent higher than originally estimated.
Because the shareholders have not made their financial contribution to ISA
when due, ISA has not been able to pay its contractors on time. Another
problem facing ISA is the present ownership of its capital stock, which
permits three of the four shareholders holding individually more than 25
percent of the shares to block any resolution requiring a 75 percent majority.
The Bank is seriously concerned about ISA's financial situation. The
Government has now formulated a plan of near term action which is expected to
shortly restore ISA's financial viability.
Ln No. 682 Cali Water Supply and Sewerage; US$18.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - June 30, 1974;
current - December 31, 1975.
11.        As of September 30, 1974, about 42 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to a late project start, but the
entire project is under execution, and it is expected that construction
activities will be finished by June 1975.
Ln No. 738 Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage; US$2 million, May 1971.
Closing date: March 1, 1975.
12.        As of September 30, 1974, about 40 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to initial management and fiscal
problems. A financial crisis in early 1973 has now been resolved through
higher tariffs and tight budget control. Construction is expected to be
terminated in late 1975.
Ln No. 739 Land Settlement Caqueta I; US$8.1 million, May 1971.
Closing date: April 30, 1975.
13.        Because of considerable price increases and unexpectedly difficult
physical problems, project objectives were reduced to about 70 percent of
appraisal targets in August 1973, halfway through the project period. Since
then, the livestock credit program has picked up speed so that the revised
goal for this component should be achieved ahead of time. On the other hand,
the road construction program has fallen behind schedule so far that not

enough time remains to catch up, even with an accelerated work pace. Despite
these problems, the project is making a substantial contribution to the suc-
cessful colonization of the Caqueta area. A second-phase project was ap-
praised in February 1974.
Ln No. 740 Telecommunications II; US$15 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1975.
14.        Due to initial delays in the procuirement of project equipment, a
slippage of about one year in the completion date of some works on the
project is now anticipated.
Ln No. 741 Water Supply (Bogota II); US$88 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1978.
15.        Disbursements up to September 30, 1974 amounted to 17 percent of
this loan, only 42. percent of the appraisal estimate. Slow progress in the
construction of the vital palacio - Rio Blanco Tunnel is the main reason for
the project's delay; the nrevious foreign contractor has been replaced
by another firm. EAAB's financial situation was weak, but important mea-
sures to improve it have been taken by the Empresa.
Ln No. 742 Development Finance Companies IV: US$40 million, May 1971.
Closing date: December 31, 1974.
16.        This loan is fully committed.   Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
The Borrowers will soon request postponement of the Closing Date.
Ln No. 842 Development Program and Export Expansion Project; US$ 60 mil-lion,
June 1972. Closing date: December 31, 1974.
17.        The US$10 million DFC portion of this program loan is now almost
fully committed. The last subproject which will utilize the unallocated
balance of the loan (US$943,000) was presented to the Baic before the final date for sub-
project submission September 30, 1974, and is now under review. Disburse-
ments are proceeding satisfactorily and amounted to US$5.2 million as of
October 31, 1974.   However, itwill be necessary to extend the present clos-
ing date of December 31,' 1974 to allow commitments to be fully disbursed.
Ln No. 849 Irrigation (Atlantico II), US$5 million, June 1972.
Closing date: March 31, 1978.
18.        Construction of drainage facilities is lagging far behind schedule
primarily due to the poor performance of the contractor having the major re-
sponsibility for the drain construction financed under this loan. Steps are
being taken to either force compliance with the contract or replace the con-
tractor with another. With the high world prices of livestock products, it
appears that more of the project area will be devoted to combination cattle
feeding and milk production than was previously envisaged. The returns per
ha from such enterprises will not differ too much from the field crops
originally contemplated.

La No. 860 Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project;
US$9.1 million, October 1972. Closing date: September 30, 1976.
19.        As of September 30, 1974, about 6 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to initial serious management pro-
blems. Lower demand than estimated has prompted investment reprogramming and
it is expected that construction activities will not be finished until 1979.
Ln No. 874 Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project; US$56 million,
January 1973. Closing date: December 31, 1978.
20.        The progress of the work is generally satisfactory except for delays
in the resettlement of El Penol and Guatape villages, which will make it dif-
ficult to start filling the Santa Rita reservoir before mid-1977, two years
behind schedule. If filling of the reservoir does not begin in mid-1976,
an energy deficit in the interconnected system of at least 10 percent from
1978 to 1981 is expected. The revised project cost estimate (US$119.2 mil-
lion) is 21.3 percent above appraisal estimates, mainly due to higher costs
of the works at El Penol and Guatape. EPM has failed to achieve the 9 per-
cent rate of return required under the Loan Agreement and it has fallen
behind in its payments to ISA, thus contributing to the problems experienced
by the latter (see Loan 681). The Bank is seriously concerned about EPM's
financial situation which is expected to be adequately improved soon by a
substantial increase in EPM's electricity tariffs.
Ln No. 903 Development Finance Companies V; US$60 million, May 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
21.        Commitments of the loan were interrupted for several months this
year pending agreement on a revised interest rate. Commitments are proceeding
well, and it is expected that the balance of US$27.2 million unallocated at
October 31, 1974, will be fully committed early in 1975. Currently, loan
applications pending approval exceed the unallocated funds available. Disburse-
ments are still behind schedule, but in view of the rapid rate of commitment,
they should be completed by the closing date, June 30, 1977.
Ln No. 920 Education III; US$21.2 million, July 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
22.        This loan became effective on January 9, 1974.   Shortage of counter-
part funds delayed to September 1974 the opening of construction bids for the
first 22 project institutions. Construction works are expected to proceed
smoothly by April 1975. Procurement of teaching equipment has been progressing
satisfactorily and 60 percent of the purchase orders have been placed. Im-
plementation of the technical teacher training program is expected to commence
within the next six months. Various studies for the sector analysis are also
expected to begin within the next four months.

Lu No. 926 Sixth Railway Project; US$25 million, August 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1976.
23.        Implementation of CNR's Investment Plan is progressing satisfac-
torily; track rehabilitation and maintenance, together with workshop produc-
tion, continue to improve. Project objectives probably will have to be reduced
by 35 percent because of the large increase in the price of materials. CNR's
financial picture has continued to improve because of increased traffic and
tariffs. However, the Government's recent emergency program, which intends
to halt imports of wheat, will have a serious adverse impact on that traffic
between Santa Marta and Bogota. The Government's performance under the fi-
nancial provisions of the Guarantee Agreement was satisfactory to the end of
June but subsequently has been inadequate. The matter is currently under
review.
Ln No. 971 Preinvestment Studies Project; US$25 million, March 1974.
Closing date: December 31, 1978.
24.        This loan became effective on June 27, 1974.
