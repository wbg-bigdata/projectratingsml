MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT
1.     The following report on a proposed development credit to Kenya for'SDR
15.5 million (US$19.6 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
pr6posed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 yeErs and
made available as a grant to the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) to
help finance a National Agricultural Research Project. Other major
participating donors include: the United States Agency for International
Development (US$28.5 millio), the European Economic Community -(US$ 19.1 million
equivalent), the Overseas Development Administration of the United Kingdom,
(US$10.2 million equivalent), and the Netherlands (US$10.1 million equivalent).
Most of these funds would be provided on a parallel financing basis. In
addition, several other donors (Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Sweden and
UNDP/FAO) would support the project.
2.     Background. Agriculture is the dominant sector of Kenya's economy,
accounting for about 302 of the Gross Domestic Product. About 85Z of the
population is rural and 70Z is employed in agriculture. The sector produces
nearly all the nation's food and generates 682 (1986) of total export earnings
(primarily coffee and tea). Since Independence, population has grown rapidly
(recently 3.9? p.a.) and Kenya's agriculture has become increasingly
smallholder-dominated (average farm size is 2.3 ha.); smallholder-oriented
agricultural research is therefore crucial to increased production. The first
decade after Independence showed vigorous agricultural growth (4.7Z p.a.).
However, this slowed to an average 3.2? between 1972 and 1983, signalling a
trend towards decline in per capita production. Agricultural research,
supported by many donor interventions, grew considerably in size and complexity
in the 1960s and 1970s, but has not been able to meet the challenges brought
about by greater population pressure on land and increasing demands for food and
raw materials. The constraints have been both institutional (lack of
comprehensive and effective management systems) and structural (inappropriate
research orientation, inadequate long-term program formulation and little
producer participation in setting priorities). In mid-1986, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock Development prepared, with donor cooperation, a
comprehensive proposal to restructure and strengthen KARI and implement the
National Agricultural Research Project (NARP). The proposals were reviewed by
two Bank-led joint donor/Government missions, which endorsed their major thrust.
3.     Proiect Obiectives. The proposed proje:t is designed to: (i) focus
agricultural research on national priority research activities which have a
significant likelihood of high and early returns; (ii) develop technology for
increased productivity, particularly of smallholdings; (iii) intensify producer
participation in research program formulation; (iv) strengthen linkages between
research and other agricultural services, especially extension; and (v) improve
cooperation with other agricultural research institutions. Strengthened
coordination of donor support is an essential aspect of the project. The
strategy to achieve these objectives is to assist the Government in reorganizing
the various agricultural research establishments into the new KARI and to
support KARI in the implementation of the NARP.



4.     Project Description. The proposed project is a key element of the
Government's priority investment program in agriculture. It comprises
assistance for: (i) restructuring of KARI organization and management, including
establishment costs, construction of a headquarters building, training and
expert assis-tance to strengthen management and research as well as budgeting and
information systems; (ii) rehabilitation and provision of adequate equipment and
operating funds to Regional Research Centers which would undertake adaptive
research and would be closely linked to the extension system; and (iii) support
to key national crop, livestock, factor and disciplinary research programs. The
proposed project is a five-year time slice of a long-term agricultural research
development plan for which the Government has sought donor support. For that
reason, the appraisal report evaluates the whole NARP, not just the parts
financed by IDA. The IDA-assisted project includes funding for incremental non-
salary operating costs (on a declining basis), vehicles, equipment, civil works
for priority research infrastructure including research farm development, the
research information system, training and consultancy services. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$203.8 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$61.8 million (30X). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Kenya are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6794-KE dated August 21, 1987, is being distributed.
5.     Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Bank Group strategy for agriculture in
Kenya is oriented primarily towards intensification of smallholder production.
Strengthening key agricultural services (research, extension, credit, animal
health and input supply) is an important element in this strategy. This is
being done through organization of national programs, institution building,
training to upgrade technical and managerial skills and donor coordination in
each of the above activities. In recent years a proliferation of donor programs
has contributed to the deterioration of the performance of the Kenya
agricultural research syster. The proposed project fits the Bank Group's
strategy because it would support an essential agricultural service, upgrade
management and facilitate aid coordination in agricultural research. The
Project would complement the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation (Cr. 1717-
KE) and reinforce the National Extension Project (Cr. 1387-KE) by generating
profitable technologies for dissemination to farmers. The Bank Group's role in
assisting KARI to coordinate the donors supporting the overall NARP is of vital
importance.
6.     Agreed Actions. Actions sought are limited to the research program as
broader agricultural sector policy issues relevant to the project's success are
being addressed under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation, a credit for
which became effective March 30, 1987. The Government has already taken several
important decisions towards implementation of NARP: it has created the new KARI;
appointed the members of its Board, the KARI Director and two of the Deputy
Directors; and has begun introducing the new management systems required.
Priority areas of research have been established. A Government request for a
Project Preparation Facility advance of US$700,000 to assist in the preparation
of detailed proposals and research programs and to facilitate essential start-up
activities, has been approved by IDA. At negotiations, agreements were obtained
on: (i) implementation of improved KARI programming, budgetting and accounting
systems; (ii) provision of adequate budgets to fund priority requirements of
NARP; (iii) the project's Plan of Action and implementation timetable including



-3-
the phasing-in of key research programs and its annual review by IDA and other
donors; (iv) the undertaking of a mid-term review of the project; (v) a
structure of research/extension linkages that ensures technology dissemination
to farmers and feedback to research; and (vi) arrangements for donor
coordination including joint reviews at regular intervals and annual provision
to donors of i.RI's annual work program and budget.  Conditions of project
effectiveness are: (i) the appointment of KARI's Deputy Director for Finance,
Planning and Administration, Assistant Directors for Research, Research Station
Directors and other key staff; (ii) submission to IDA of the updated KARI
training plan; and (iii) KARI Board approval of the revised staff structure and
establishment.
-7.    Justification.  Kenya requires significant increases in agricultural
production in order to keep pace with population growth, provide a better
standard of living to its people and increase exports. Growth in agricultural
production must be at least 4Z per annum just to keep up with population growth.
There is already great pressure on the resource base of land and water.
Increased agricultural productivity which at the same time maintains or improves
the resource base is therefore essential. Thus, a highly efficient agricultural
research system is urgently needed, in addition to improvements in other
agricultural services. Government's recognition of these needs is recorded in
its Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 "Economic Management for Renewed Growth7; it
is also reflected in the preparation of the KARP which calls for a comprehensive
reform of the entire agricultural research system.
8.     Risks. The project's four main risks relate to: (i) effectiveness of the
reorganized KARI organization and management; (ii) adequacy of budgetary funding
levels and mechanisms; (iii) adherence to agreed priorities in research programs
and capacity to make sound adjustments as necessary; and (iv) relevance andlor
adoption of research findings. The project includes specific measures to
minimize the potentially adverse impact of such risks. For example, a
significant but reasonable level of external expert assistance and training
would be provided to strengthen KARI's organisation, management and research
capacity. The size of the proposed NARP reflects committed donor funds (mostly
on a grant basis) and a likely level of Government budgetary allocations. The
project includes detailed annual programming mechanisms and periodic research
reviews involving scientists outside KARI. In addition, supervision, monitoring
and evaluation would be conducted on a joint donor/Government basis and an
indepth review is scheduled after the first three years of the project.
9.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
