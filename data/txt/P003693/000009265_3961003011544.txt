EMEORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD ,0 THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUPLIC OF FIJI
FOR A SECOND ROAD UPGRADING PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum azd recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Fiji (Fiji) for the equivalent of US$15
million to help finance a Second Road Upgrading Project. The loan would be at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years,
including five years of grace. The project would be cofinanced on a parallel
basis by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) by a loan of US$18 million
equivalent for 25 years, including five years of grace, and the Export-Import
Bank of Japan (J-Eximbank) by a loan of US$6.5 million equivalent on their
standard terms.
2.   Background and Kev Issues.  With a population of about 750,000 and per
capita income of US$1,770 in 1990 and relatively good social indicators, Fiji
stands out among the small Pacific Island member countries in terms of size
and level of development. The economy is diversified and notable for its
internationally competitive smallholder sugar industry, tourism, manufacturing
and prospects for further development in forestry, fisheries and agriculture.
Military coups in 1987 interrupted a long period of political stability and
severely disrupted economic performance. Prompt stabilization and adjustment
measures led to a strong recovery in 1989 but GDP growth decelerated since and
investment has remained depressed. Sustained growth prospects are dependent
upon increasing the level and efficiency of investment, broadening the export
base and restoring normal political conditions.
3. The Government's broad objectives for the transport sector are to ensure
its contributions to the export growth strategy and to improved community
access, particularly in rural areas. In this context, land transport for
freight and passenger movements is vital. Since the existing road network
provides adequate coverage, the highest priorities within the subsector are
improving roads and bridges in line with traffic growth and improving
maintenance of the existing network in order to meet the challenges resulting
from the new economic policies. Firstly, many roads built in the 1970. are in
need of repair and/or upgrading. Secondly, it is increasingly important to
improve sector policies in order to help reduce transport costs in the
economy. Four areas merit particular attention: road maintenance; control of
road damage by heavy vehicles; restructuring of the road user charges; and
traffic safety.
4. The events of 1987 and their aftermath caused a sharp reduction of the
Government's resources and an exodus of local professionals and skilled staff.
This affected funding and institutional capabilities for road maintenance. To
help mitigate these problems, ADB initiated a Road Maintenance Sector Project
in 1988, financing a 3-year time-slice of expenditures to address the backlog
of periodic maintenance accumulated over many years of neglect. With this
project nearing completion, Government will now need to provide adequate
funding for maintenance from its own budgetary resources. In addition,
foreign technical assistance will be required, at least in the short term, for
strengthening the institutional capabilities. Concurrently, the training of
professionals and skilled staff needs to be intensified.



-2-
5.   While revenues collected from road users are significantly higher than
Government's road related expenditures, taxation of heavy vehicles covers less
than 502 of the coat of the wear and tear they impose on the road network.
This highlights the need, now recogni4ed by the Government, tot (i) make
progress on restructuring road user taxation to align it better with costs on
the road network and to provide incentives for truck operators to invest in
the type of vehicles which cause least damage to road pavements; (ii) bring
vehicle weights and axle load regulations in line with modern road and vehicle
design standards; and (iii) effectively enforce the existing limits.
6.   Traffic safety is a serious problem in Fiji with a fatality rate of
about eight times that recorded in developed countries. Accidents impose an
estimated annual cost of some F$10 million to the economy. The resources
presently being used to improve road safety need to be significantly increased
and efforts need to be coordinated among the many agencies involved.
7.  Lessons From Previous Bank Iuvolvement. Fiji has implemented two Bank-
financed road projects and a road related emergency project. The first road
project (Loan 771-FIJ of 1971) was completed at the end of 1977 with a 30S
time overrun. Also, due to excessive design standards, large increases in
construction quanU.ties (because of inadequate detign and soil exploration)
and much higher than expected price escalation (because of the oil crisis in
1973174), the final cost was about three times the appraisal estimate (65S
above revised estimate prepared the following year), but quality of works was
good. The emergency project (Loan 1921-FIJ of 1980) was successfully
implemented in terms of time and cost. The most recent Road Upgrading Project
(Loan 2871-FIJ of 1987) was completed at the end of 1991, after an extension
of six months. The performance of force account units of the Public Works
Department (PWD) has been good, although cost-effectiveness of construction
could most likely be improved through increased use of contracting under
competitive bidding arrangements. The performance of the single contractor
was slow, but quality of works is good. The main problems encountered were
weak institutions and lack of qualified staff in PWD, both of which relate to
the events of 1987. The proposed project includes measures to address these
problems.
8. Rationale for Bank Involvement - Bank Stratexv. The formulation and
implementation of improved sector policies to increase the efficiency and
utilization of road transport infrastructure requires careful preparation and
good coordination on the part of all concerned sector agencies. Sustained
commitment is also required for maintenance of assets to min:mize life cycle
costs. Bank involvement will ensure that, in addition to th, implementation
of a well balanced program of physical works, Government's a:tention will
remain focussed on these sectoral policy and O&M aspects. Moreover, the
Bank's support has beon instrumental in introducing private sector
participation in road construction and maintenance which will improve
efficiency in addition to enhancing the local capacity for execution of such
civil works.
9.   Pro1ect Objectives.  The principal aim of the project is to assist the
Government in promoting balanced economic development through improvements in
the efficiency of the land transport oystem. In order to enable the road
transport sector to better meet the needs of growing traffic between
agricultural areas, commercial centers and ports as well as from tourism
developments, in a cost-effective manner, the project specifically aims at:



-3-
(i) upgrading and iuproving the road networks (ii) improving road traffic
safety and traffic management; (iii) strengthening the capacity of road
authorities to manage the road networkt and (iv) improv&ng sector policies in
the key areas of maintenance practices and funding, control of road damage by
heavy vehicles, road user taxation, and increased construction efficiency
through the introduction of contracting of roadworks to the private sector on
a competitive basis,
10. Proiect Descrlptto5. The project has the follwing main components; (i)
upgradlug of 64 km of roads to be carried out by ICB contracts (US$25.1
million, of which the Bank would finance 28 km costing US$11.2 million); (ii)
upgrading of 32 km of roads to be carried out partly by LCB contracts and
partly by PWD force account units (US$6.5 million, of which the Bank would
finance 13 km costing US$4.4 million); (iii) upgrading of 83 km of roads to be
carried out by PWD force account units (US$16.2 million, of which the Bank
would finance 21 km costing $3.8 million); (iv) road safety improvement
(US$2.9 million, of which the Bank would finance US$0.6 million); (v) vehicle
weight enforcement (US$0.3 million); (vi) design and construction supervision
of ICB contracted roadworka (US$5.1 million); and (vii) strengthening of the
road administration and maintenance capacity through technical assistance
(US$6.1 million, financed by the Bank) and the provision of equipment (US$7.5
million). Details of project costs are shown in Schedule A.
11. Feasibility studies and some sector policy assessments supporting the
design of the project, have been financed by technical assistance grants from
ADB and carried out by international consultants. In accordance with existing
arrangements between the World Bank Group and ADB regarding cofinancing of
projects in the Pacific Island countries, the project was appraised by a team
from ADB with a Bank staff member participating. A timetable of key project
processing events is shown in Schedule C.
12. Proiect Financing. The project cost, estimated at US$71.0 million
(including land acquisition at US$1.4 million), will be cofinanced on a
parallel basis by the Bank (US$15.0 million), ADB (US$18.0 million), both of
which would finance civil works and consulting services, J-Eximbank (US$6.5
million) which would finance equipment only, and the Govertment (US$31.5
million). In addition, ADB would provide 8rant funding of about US$550,000
for advisory services (technical assistance) to prepare a National Transport
Sector Plan and develop a Road Safety and Traffic Management Program.
Retroactive financing of US$1.5 million equivalent is recommended for eligible
expenditures incurred after Fibruary 14, 1992 for urgently needed consulting
services and civil works. Details of the Financing Plan are also shown in
Schedule A.
13. Proiect Implementation. The Public Work. Department (PWD) of the
Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (MIPU) would be the Executing
Agency for the project. Some 53Z of works will be carried out through ICB
arrangements, up to 13S through LCB and the remainder by PWD force account.
Sector policy initiatives wvold require collaboration with other MIPU
departments and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. Details of
procurement and disbursement arrangements are shown in Schedule B. ADB
Appraisal Report, No. RRPsFIJ 22138, is being distributed separately.
14. Loan Administration. ADB will administer the loan during project
implementation under procedures to be set out in a Letter of Administration to



-4-
be signed between ADB and the Bank; this would include procurement, disburse-
ments, field supervision, review of audit reports and the preparation of a
completion report. The project is expected to be completed by December 31,
1996 and the Closing Date is June 30, 1997.
15. Proiect bustainability. Effective maintenance is key to the project's
sustainability. The project includes a component of technical advisory
services to consolidate and continue the assistance for project management and
road maintenance initiated under the first Road Upgrading Project and
continued under ADB's Road Maintenanc' Sector Project. The project also
includes a component for equipment la .œely for road maintenance. Also, the
Loan Agreement includes a covenant requiring the Government to provide
sufficient funds to adequately maintain the road network. Furthermore,
improvements that will be initiated in sector policies, such as in road user
taxation and enforcement of axle load regulaticns, will also contribute to the
long term sustainability of the project.
16. Environmental Aspects. The environmental impact of civil works will be
minimal as access is already adequate and design and construction measures
will be taken to reduce the probability of potential negative environmental
impacts such as slope failure and soil erosion. Upgrading of existing roads
from gravel to bitumen surface standard will reduce dust, traffic hazards and
noise; side and cross drainage will be improved. Increased traffic capacity
will reduce vehicular emission problems on road sections which are presently
significantly congested during peak hours.
17. Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
Government on: (a) adequate maintenance of the road network including the
provision of annual maintenance budgets; (b) assignment of qualified
counterpart staff to be trained in project and maintenance management; (c)
improved enforcement of existing limits for vehicle axle loads; (d)
establishment and adequate staffing of a Project Management Unit; and (e)
establishment of Road Construction Units to carry out civil works on a force
account basis. In addition, it was agreed that Government will discuss with
the Bank, on a regular basis, progress on: (a) the preparation and
implementation of revised and new traffic regulations; (b increased use of
contracting through competitive bidding for roadworks; and (c) adoption and
implementation of more appropriate road user charges for heavy vehicles.
Furthermore, an understanding was reached with Government on continued
discussions regarding already initiated actions to introduce for-hire rates of
PWD equipment that reflect actual owning and operating costs and on improved
equipment replacement policies.
18.  Condition of Effectiveness.  A condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan is that all conditions for effectiveness of the ADB loan are
met.
19. Protect Benefits. The project's main benefits would bes (i) a system-
wide reduction in road transport costs as a result of the upgrading works and
improved sector policies; and (ii) continued strengthening in the
institutional capability and technical competence of the Department of Public
Works through on-the-job training. The economic rate of return of the civil
works component of the project is estimated at 24S.



-5-
20. Risks. Engineering dseigns of the roads to be upgraded under the
project are uLderway but were not completed before appraisal as is usually
required for traditional Bank-financed highway projects. ADB does not have
such a requirement; cost estimates are therefore based on preliminary
engineering designs prepared for the feasibility studies. In order to address
the risk of underestimated costs, the physical contingencies for roadworks
have been uet at 152 instead of the usual 10.
21. This is the first road project in Fiji which aims to help the Government
improve sector policies. The main risk of the project is that insufficient
progress will be made in this area, This will be mitigated through the
exteneive technical assistance provided under the project for maintenance
management and other advisory services for transport sector planning and
traffic iafety, to be funded by additional grants from ADB.
22. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
