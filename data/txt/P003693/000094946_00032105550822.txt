3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Improvement in the efficiency of the land transport system, in order to assist the Government in
promoting balanced economic development.
For the road sub-sector to better meet growing traffic demand the project specifically aims at: (i)
upgrading and improving the road network; (ii) improving road traffic safety and traffic management; (iii)
strengthening the capacity of road authorities to manage the road network; and (iv) improving sector
policies in the key areas of maintenance practices and funding, control of road damage by heavy vehicles,
road user taxation, and increased construction efficiency through the introduction of contracting of road
works to the private sector on a competitive basis.
Assessment: The objectives were clear though the level of achievement was not firmly targeted. The
physical scope was within the capability of the Borrower, and of high priority. However, even the modest
institutional agenda proved to be too ambitious for the vehicle regulation aspects, and was achieved only
partially in road safety and road maintenance. The conditionalities on maintenance funding and reporting
proved to be of limited effectiveness. The incentives for institutional reform were light, with provision for
substantial strengthening and support of the public agencies and for substantial procurement of equipment
under a co-loan. This reflected the Borrower's priorities at the time of preparation, however the Project
provisions allowed flexibility for increasing the private sector participation from 18% to about 30% of the
locally-sourced works and proved to be a valuable stepping stone for encouraging more private sector
participation in the future. ADB provided parallel grant funding for institutional studies on transport sector
reform and road user charges, but these had only limited integration with the Project activities. The prior
attention to safeguard policies proved to be inadequate, with substantial delays and difficulties occurring in
land acquisition, and shortcomings in environmental management becoming a contributing cause to the
landslide damage that added $3 million (4%) to the Project costs - issues that had to be addressed during
supervision.

This design adequately reflected the physical objectives. It included road upgrading subprojects,
with fair to moderate economic returns ranging from 12 to 31%. It provided for the procurement of
works to be 38% by international competition, 8% by local competition and 54% by public force account.
The components omit the key institutional studies which were conducted separately under ADB grant
funding.
3.4 Revised Components:
Minor revisions of scope were made only in the civil works by force accountlNCB component. The
capacity expansion from 2- to 4-lanes on the congested Suva-Nausori Road was extended from 1.6 km
back to the 6.1 km length as had been originally evaluated and recommended during feasibility studies - the
Government absorbed all additional costs (F$15 million).
3.5 Quality at Entry:
N.A.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The key elements of the Project have achieved significant though modest improvements in the efficiency of
both the public and private sector of the road construction industry. The major upgrading subprojects
(King's Road Dama section on Viti Levu) and arterials on Vanua Levu have resulted in significant growth
(over double the national base growth) of both traffic and development along two key economic corridors
where poor access had constrained growth, and on the King's Road Suva section has reduced congestion
and improved safety in the country's worst blackspot. The outcome has been somewhat limited by the slow
growth of the national economy during the Project period (under 3% p.a.).
The strongest institutional outcome was the improvement in road safety - an active, broadly representative
national council, and reductions of 45% in the fatality rate, 41% in the casualty rate and 10% in the
accident rate during an 8-yr period when the vehicle population grew by 33%. Moderate impacts were
achieved in strengthening road maintenance in the public sector but sustainability is only partially likely,
dependent on a continued priority being given by Government to sustained funding and quality standards.
Achievements in other institutional areas were weak - long delays in revising vehicle regulations, load
limits, and oversight - which reduced and deferred the potential benefits until beyond the Project.
4.2 Outputs by components:
All the physical component outputs were fully achieved with generally satisfactory quality, but with high
cost increases - 94% in force account and LCB works, and 45% in ICB works.
(a)   ICB Works - The King's Road (Dama-Navalou section) was completed virtually on time despite the
contractor's insolvency. The IBRD-financed Nabouwalu road was completed satisfactorily after a 70%
extension of time caused by contractor disputes.
(b)    LCB and Force account works - The execution of works, design and supervision services by
national firms on 4 subprojects under LCB was successful and provided substantial stimulus to the increase
of private sector participation in the sector from the existing low level. The works and engineering for 8
subprojects were undertaken through the PWD design office and Road Construction Units (RCU) that were
established and equipped under the Project - these performed satisfactorily but with delays due to
inadequate capacity especially in the design office. There was one exception (Transinsular Road) where
inadequate attention to geotechnical risks and site management was one of the factors leading to the
extensive landslide damage during Cyclone Gavin and subsequent high repair costs of F$3 million. The
-3 -



repairs were complex but designed and executed exceptionally well under contract, showing a matured
response by PWD.
(c)    Road safety and Vehicle Regulation - The institutional initiatives for road safety were completed
generally successfully, resulting in the establishment of an effective National Road Safety Council, but the
implementation of new enforcement measures (on vehicle inspection, driver licensing, etc.) were
constrained by the delay in land transport legislation which limited their impact. The physical safety works
were only about 80% completed due to a bottleneck in PWD capacity. Establishment of the Land
Transport Authority only occurred in 1999 after the close of the Project, and the regulations on drivers,
vehicle weights and inspection, etc. need further revision and are still not in effect.
(d)    Plant and equipment - All plant items were procured and delivered successfully
(Japan-Exim-funded) including an additional lot made possible by low bid prices and appreciation of the
Exim loan amount. By the end of the Project, 70% of items were in good running condition, 29% in fair or
poor condition, and 1% written off.
(e)    Project management - The project management was fair initially but strengthened by mid-term to a
high standard. The technical specialists provided generally adequate support, although inadequate advice
and action may have contributed to the cost increases incurred due to geotechnical failures on Nadi Back
Road and Transinsular Road. The maintenance strengthening unit (IBRD-funded) was very effective at the
District and depot level, but less effective at the central level due to inadequate senior management
response.
(f)    LandAcquisition - The land acquisition and compensation was conducted under GoF and ADB
guidelines. The requirements (on the two ICB subprojects and Suva-Nausori road) were not large but had
not been completed before mobilization of the contractors. This led to minor delays regarding access for
the contractors on the two ICB subprojects, and to prolonged disputes and non-completion of the parts of
work in two locations on the King's Road (Suva-Nausori) section. At the end of the Project, the land
acquisition activities were concluded in accordance with ADB policies, as applied through the
Administration Agreement of the Project.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economic rates of return for the upgrading of gravel roads to paved national roads were fully achieved,
with 16-28% at EOP compared with 17-31% at appraisal, despite the average 68% increase in costs.
Improvement of the urban paved roads returned 37-46% compared with 21 % at appraisal, and the capacity
expansion in the Suva-Nausori corridor returned a conservatively estimated 12-15% without accounting for
unquantified indirect benefits from safety and time savings. Overall, the project works had a modest return
with a benefit/cost ratio of 1.72, i.e.,
* NPV = F$77.82 million at 12% discount rate;
*  NPV/C = 0.72             BCR= 1.72
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not assessed. Revenues from road users were not changed due to delayed legislation.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The Project's impact on the Public Works Department was supportive of technical skills through the
specialists under contract, and some technology transfer is evident from the strengthening of individuals in
technical middle management (engineer-level). However, staffing remains thin and highly prone to staff
losses, and PWD has retained further specialists for the succeeding ADB-funded Project. The delivery of
maintenance was strengthened very effectively at the local depot level, but a lack of senior management
action on formally establishing the road maintenance units, actively monitoring performance, and
incorporating actual needs into the programming and budgeting rendered the sustainability as only
partially likely. The prospects for institutional reform of PWD into a roads department and subsequently
- 4 -



independent authority (set out through the ADB-funded TA on transport sector reform) were stalled during
1998-99 but appear to be reviving in 2000. In respect of the Department of Road Traffic (DRT), the
Project came far short of its goals but laid the foundation for the Land Transport Authority which is now
being established and has the potential for improving the efficiency of road transport. Some of the resource
allocation and performance optimization issues will be addressed through the establishment of a Transport
Planning Unit under an IDF grant (TF 027552) due to close in December 2000.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency.
Pressure on budgets arising from the National Bank bankruptcy constrained Project spending to FJD 25
million p.a. and caused the Project period to be extended in order to absorb the increased costs.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Road maintenance budgets met targets in the first two years but declined subsequently despite warnings
from the Banks.
Legislation for amending the traffic acts was not given priority.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Strong Project management and PWD senior management support were responsible for the generally
successful implementation of force account works and improved efficiency of PWD units. Cyclone Gavin
in 1997 caused critical conditions and heavy damage to the Transinsular Road subproject before
completion, but much of the damage could have been reduced had the preventive measures been
implemented on time and with stronger supervision. In DRT, there was little progress on the critical
regulation and training issues due to weak leadership.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Construction costs increased by 94% on the locally-contracted and force account works, due to
under-estimation at the time of appraisal (25-40%), increase in scope (Suva-Nausori corridor (350%),
Nadi-Lautoka corridor) and major repairs (Transinsular Road, 100%). Costs increased by 45% on the
internationally-contracted works, due mainly to under-estimation at appraisal and higher bid prices. On the
equipment component, competitive pricing and exchange rate movements allowed additional inventory to be
procured under the proceeds of the co-loan (Japan ExIm). The overall Project cost increased by 47% from
US$ 78 million to US$ 114.5 million, due almost entirely to the increased cost of works. The Government
absorbed all the additional costs.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating.
The benefit of the civil works is expected to extend to at least 80% of their expected life given the
strengthening of maintenance at the local level and on-going support of a follow-on project. The PWD has
been actively pursuing reform in the water sector and is likely to make some progress on the road sector
during the next two years, though this is highly dependent on the evolving policies of the new Government
which until recently had opposed reforms. Progress is slow in the road transport subsector, but additional
impetus is being provided by the establishment of a Transport Planning Unit under IDF funding due to be
fully operational by end of 2000. The overall assessment of sustainability is likely, subject to continued
progress in sectoral reform and sustained budget support until effective road user-based financing is in
place.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
- 5 -



The recently established construction and maintenance units continue to operate in PWD, and contracting
procedures have been facilitated by the follow-on project. Improved planning and programming for road
maintenance is also being developed under the subsequent Project, which should strengthen the central
management of resources. ADB are overseeing continuation of the institutional reform agenda through the
subsequent project.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision.
Highly satisfactory. ADB conducted two supervision missions per year and reported regularly, maintaining
an excellent working relationship with the Borrower and with IBRD. IBRD participated in more than 50%
of the missions providing specialist technical input as well as administration, and through emphasis on
preventive measures helped to reduce the risk of damage to the Project assets.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Highly satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Generally satisfactory, with a good start to implementation but inadequate assistance and guidance on cost
estimation.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Generally satisfactory, satisfying most conditionalities and providing good assistance to supervision
missions, but weak in support for the institutional agenda, particularly road transport regulation, and for
road maintenance budget allocations.
7.6 Implementing Agency.
PWD performance was satisfactory, with generally responsive management. Initial problems over the
allocation of management responsibilities between line staff and Project staff reflected on the performance
and recurred occasionally. DRT performance was satisfactory regarding the road safety aspects but
generally weak in managing the road transport component.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
(a) Stronger attention needs to be given to cost estimation and economic evaluation during project
preparation in the Pacific through - (i) better preliminary engineering and geotechnical studies, detailed
engineering and quantity estimates; (ii) better use of regional comparators in addition to local estimates,
and (iii) the use of more advanced economic evaluation tools than used for the Project. These are necessary
to achieve more realistic assessments of the costs, viability and priorities of Project proposals.
(b) Land acquisition arrangements should be completed prior to the implementation of a subproject, should
be largely completed before Project appraisal to avoid delays, and should be administered under stronger
safeguard policies.
-6 -



(c) Road management by PWD would be improved by (i) regular monitoring of the network to identify
problem areas; (ii) basing periodic maintenance assessment on regular network-wide surveys; (iii)
providing incentives for efficiency beyond target output levels; (iv) inclusion of a specific allocation for
emergency works; and (v) improving contract documents and procedures to enhance out-sourcing of works.
(d) Environmental management needs to be greatly strengthened in future PWD and IFI-financed works,
especially ensuring that environmental, geotechnical and slope failure mitigation measures are adequately
addressed at the design stage of subprojects. The Codes of Environmental Practice introduced by IBRD in
Fiji in 1998 have proved effective and warrant wider implementation and application in other agencies.
(e) The achievement of progress on land transport policy development and reforms - on enforcement of
axle load limits, adequate maintenance programs, adequate maintenance funding, revision of traffic
regulations, restructuring of road user charges, efficient plant hire and replacement policies - requires a
stronger framework of commitment than is given by loan provisions alone.
(f Private sector participation in local works and services proved effective, and PWD should be
encouraged to expand the level of outsourcing because its capacity for implementing civil works and
services was inadequate for the pace of program under the Project.
(g) The parallel co-financing relationship, with ADB in the administrative capacity, worked well in this
instance for the preparation and the implementation period. Through the adoption of ADB procedures for
all procurement, disbursement and reporting for the implementation, there was an absence of several
controls in procurement, of stronger control over the timing and conduct of land acquisition, and of the
emphasis on sustainable development, local participation and outcomes that are inherent in IBRD
procedures. However, these procedural differences are changing with time and are unlikely to have
substantially affected the outcome of the Project. The Borrower has expressed strong preference for
uniform implementation procedures as a pre-condition of co-financing which makes subsequent
co-financing opportunities unlikely.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The Government's requests for approvals were handled promptly and the banks were helpful in providing
assistance, through staff consultants, to resolve technical issues such as slope stability, environment and
road safety. The staff of PWD and Government received training in ADB's disbursement, project
administration and implementation procedures. Specific comments on the PCR included the following:
*   The degree of non- and partial compliance with the loan covenants is noted and PWD believes that
whilst there were some particular issues, generally the loan covenants have been complied with.
*  The issue of inadequate maintenance funds is being addressed by the Government with a proposed
increase of $8 million to the current annual maintenance budget in the year 2000 budget.
*  Enforcement of overloaded axles is to be addressed by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) through
the enforcement of the new changes of the Traffic regulations.
(b) Cofinanciers:
The delays in loan signing at the start of the Project were due to coordination difficulties of the Government
rather than a specific failure in the performance of the banks. The banks reviewed the Project twice a year
until its completion. There has been excellent coordination between ADB and IBRD with jointly conducted
review missions and a high level of professional input to the Project. While prior invitation was extended
- 7 -



to Exim Bank it was not able to participate in any review mission.
