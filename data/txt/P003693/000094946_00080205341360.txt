I.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.    On 18 June 1992, the Asian Development Bank approved a loan for US$18.0 million
from its ordinary capital resources, for the Second Road Upgrading Project in the Fiji Islands.
The Project was cofinanced by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) and the Export-Import Bank of Japan (EXIMBANK). EXIMBANK and IBRD on 23
March 1993 and 9 June 1993 approved loans of US$15.0 million and US$6.5 million
respectively, for the Project. The primary objectives of the loans were to help the
Government (i) upgrade and improve the existing road network; (ii) improve road safety and
traffic management; (iii) strengthen the capacity of road authorities to manage the road
network; and (iv) improve sector policies in the key areas of maintenance practices and
funding, control of road damage by heavy vehicles, road user taxation, and increased
construction efficiency through the introduction of contracting of road works to the private
sector on a competitive basis.
2.    The Project was prepared under an ADB-financed technical assistance (TA)' that
helped the Government prioritize its roads for improvement. The Project as appraised
comprised of seven components intended to improve the efficiency of the land transport
system. Details of the project history are provided in Appendix 1.
II.   EVALUATION OF IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Project Components
1.    Road Works
3.    At appraisal, six road links totaling 104 km were to be upgraded from gravel-surfaced
to bitumen-surfaced standards and three existing bitumen-surfaced road links totaling 43 km
were to be improved for increased traffic capacity. Amongst the above roads, 64 km of
gravel-surfaced road were to be upgraded to bitumen-surfaced standards by international
competitive bidding (ICB) contracts and 51 km of gravel-surfaced roads were to be upgraded
to bitumen-surfaced by force account. Selected stretches of 32 km of existing bitumen-
surfaced roads were to be improved by local competitive bidding (LCB) contracts and force
account.
a.   International Competitive Bidding Contracts
4.    The Dama-Navalou section of Kings Road comprising 35.9 kilometers (km) and
Naravuka-Dreketi section of Nabouwalu Road comprising 28.2 km were upgraded to
bitumen-surfaced standards. The Dama-Navalou section of Kings Road was upgraded as
planned at appraisal and completed in April 1996. The 34.5 km upgraded length was 1.4 km
shorter than the appraisal length due to improvements of the road alignment. Despite
financial difficulties and replacement of the contractor, the work was generally of a high
standard with no significant defects developed in three years of subsequent use.
TA 1046-FIJ: Road Upgrading, for $250,000, approved on 3 January 1989.



2
5.    The upgrading of Nabouwalu Road was done in two stages. The first 3.9 km was
undertaken by the Public Works Department (PWD) through force account to provide better
access and faster haulage of pavement materials for the Transinsular Road (TIR). Although
the main International Competitive Bidding contract was approved in March 1995, the award
was deferred by one year due to the ceilings on the annual project budget allocation;
construction began only in April 1996. From the start, the contractor's rate of progress was
slow, and difficulties with meeting base-course specifications and the scarcity of suitable
materials resulted in further delays totaling 15 months beyond the original 21-month
contract. Minor road realignment in Dreketi to reduce environmental and land impacts, and
a pedestrian safety and traffic calming scheme were introduced.
b.    Local Competitive Bidding Contracts
6.    The upgrading of roads under LCB contracts involved four subprojects.  On
Wainikoro Road, in conjunction with the main works by PWD force account, the construction
of two bridges, including design of one, was done and completed on schedule by LCB
contract. On the Nadi Airport-Lautoka road, the Viseisei Bypass was extended to connect
with Saweni climbing lanes and was satisfactorily completed. On the Suva-Nausori Road,
two of four sections including design and supervision originally intended for upgrading by
force account were undertaken by domestic consultants and contractors. These included
Nabua Scheme dual carriageway of 0.7 km and Nabua to Khalsa Road 4-lane single
carriageway of 2.5 km length. Domestic consultants were engaged to design another three
sections of the road from Princes Road to Nabua Scheme, Khalsa Road to Daniva Road,
and Wainibuku Bridge to Rewa Bridge. The Wainibuku-Rewa Bridge section was judged to
have adequate capacity and was not upgraded.
c.    Force Account
7.    Road works by PWD force account were undertaken for eight subprojects through
the road construction units that were established and equipped under the Project. A total of
55.5 km were upgraded under force account. The implementation was generally satisfactory
apart from significant problems encountered on the TIR and Nadi Back Road. The
Nabouwalu Road junction, Lomolomo duplication, Lomolomo Bridge widening, and a
walkway on Sabeto Bridge, Cunningham, and Khalsa roads were all completed satisfactorily.
In regard to the pavement performance, however, the quality of seal on Lomolomo was
marginal and required early partial resealing by 1996. The Khalsa Road and TIR were
showing a small incidence of road-base defects after four years. The Nadi Back Road had
two concerns. Firstly, it encountered a slope failure in a cut near a hotel property during
construction, arising from inadequate attention to geotechnical aspects during the design
and this was resolved by realignment and construction of a retaining wall. Secondly, there
was a high incidence of accidents including fatalities, but the remedial response by PWD
was slow and still requires further attention. On the Wainikoro Road, PWD undertook the
design of two of the three bridges, built one, and supervised the construction of the bridges
including the upgrading of the road. On the Suva-Nausori Road, sections from Princes Road
to Nabua Scheme, Khalsa Road to Daniva Road, and Laqere Bridge to Wainibuku Bridge,
were satisfactorily completed. Only in the case of the TIR was the implementation by force
account unsatisfactory, involving inadequate site management of earthworks and inadequate
engineering response to slope failures. Resolution of these difficulties more than doubled
the construction cost and extended the construction period to more than five years.

2.    Road Safety and Traffic Management
8.    A comprehensive program of road safety and traffic management improvement was
provided in the project design and was enhanced further under the Fiji Road Safety Action
Plan (FRSAP).2 The Traffic and Road Safety Unit in PWD developed designs for blackspot
improvements, traffic calming schemes, pedestrian schemes, and traffic light controls. This
program, supported by advice from the road safety specialist over 24 months, was generally
very effective and can be credited with significant accident reductions and improvements of
most blackspots. However, several design details relating to median markings, raised
medians, and traffic management controls required review and revision during project
implementation. The unit's performance deteriorated following completion of the specialist's
services in April 1996, and the transfer of counterpart staff in 1997. Delays in traffic scheme
designs and the late award of contract for line markings led to 10 percent underspending.
3.    Vehicle Regulations
9.    The initiatives for vehicle regulations under the Project comprised a program of
activities to be undertaken by the Department of Road Transport (DRT) and advisory support
for 24 months by a senior road safety and regulations engineer provided under the Project.
The program was funded primarily through departmental appropriations under the FRSAP.
The achievements of this component were considerably delayed. Passage of legislation to
form the new Land Transport Authority (LTA), revised traffic act, and new traffic regulations
commenced before project appraisal, but was only partially achieved when the Land
Transport Act was passed by Parliament in October 1998. The revision of traffic regulations
progressed little after 1994 and still awaits establishment of LTA, expected in early 2000,
before being promulgated. Further public consultation to update the existing traffic
regulations will be necessary before promulgation of the act. Although the specialist support
was sound, the delays were largely the responsibility of the DRT. The adverse impact of
these delays on the enforcement of vehicle roadworthiness, axle overloading, emission
control and other traffic requirements has been considerable, and at project completion
representatives of the road transport industry were dissatisfied and calling for improved
enforcement. Considerable expectations are placed on the incoming LTA to transform this
situation. At project completion, 8 roadside vehicle-weighing sites were constructed and 18
portable weighing scales were procured, but had not been used.
4.    Plant, Equipment, and Vehicles
10.   The procurement of plant, equipment, and vehicles was performed through ICB,
international shopping, and LCB procedures. Delay of the EXIMBANK loan approval and
subsequent signing until June 1993 delayed the procurement of the first lot, which was
tendered in August 1992. Low bids for the first lot and strengthening of the yen against the
US dollar enabled a second lot to be procured under the one and a half year extension of
the loan. A total of 340 items were procured and distributed to the three divisions (103 in
Northern, 145 in Central/Eastern and 92 in Western). At project completion, three items
were written off due to accidents, two were broken down, 12 were in poor running condition,

84 were in fair running conditions, and the remaining 239 or 70 percent were in good running
condition. Appropriate actions have been taken by the Government to ensure year 2000
(Y2K) compliance with the computers. A list of equipment procured under the Project is
provided in Appendix 2.
5.   Institutional Support
11.   The Project provided institutional support for project management and road
maintenance management.  Under a previous project3, an institutional framework was
established for managing road maintenance, through objective condition assessment,
scheduling, costing, and monitoring accomplishments against targets, costs, and budgets.
As a result of staff turnovers, few PWD staff remained familiar with the system, and this
Project aimed to strengthen implementation of road maintenance management at the
operational level.  Consultants for the Road Maintenance Strengthening Unit (RMSU)
established road maintenance units in each division. Through regular training, production of
manuals, and an effective use of line sketches and work schedule charts, systematic
procedures were established for regular scheduling, reporting, and monitoring of the works.
At the divisional and depot levels the enhanced system was accepted despite initial
resistance. A regular use of the system as a basis for utilizing budget allocations and
accounting for resources used was operating satisfactorily.
12.   The support for road maintenance was less effective at the central level. PWD
headquarters staff were not very involved and were less concerned with either the
performance of the divisional road maintenance unit offices and staff, which have not in fact
ever been approved by the parent Ministry of Communication, Works and Energy, or in the
actual needs of the roads for maintenance.  Although regular divisional reports were
submitted, they were not thoroughly assessed at the national level.  The annual road
maintenance reports were not used as an effective tool for supporting maintenance budget
requests, and while related to outputs, the expenditures were not effectively related to
outcomes in terms of the impact on condition and the rate of deterioration of the network.
The slow pace of computerization, which was developed gradually over the first four years,
and only became usable in the last year or two, hindered the constructive use of road
maintenance reports. For these reasons, the evidence of an accelerating deterioration in
road condition, and the consequent justification for large increases in routine and periodic
maintenance and for rehabilitation of the main roads was muted and failed to reverse the
trend of reductions in annual budget allocation.
13.   Attempts were made to improve equipment and plant maintenance, supported by the
three RMSU mechanical engineers for three years and two for another one year, through on-
the-job training and the introduction of regular maintenance schedules and fleet maintenance
management software. Initial benefits were transitory, however, and the system was not
utilized. The Government's spare parts procurement system imposed high costs and long
delays, and the aging plant and equipment fleet experienced increasing down time. Internal
constraints and low unit costs for plant inhibited private plant hire even when required. PWD
took considerable time to review and increase the plant and vehicle hire rates, which were

only increased in January 1998 by 20 and 15 percent respectively. At the same time, the
operations of the mechanical section of PWD were also commercialized. Despite these
changes, the availability of equipment improved slightly, but remains below requirements.
14.   The institutional support to project management unit (PMU) included the provision of
a project management engineer, a road design engineer, a bridge engineer, a pavement
materials engineer, an accountant, and local clerical support staff. Under the professional
guidance of the PMU, the PWD design office undertook the designs of the project roads and
bridges satisfactorily.
6.    Consulting Services
15.         Consulting services were provided to assist PWD in the design, construction
supervision, and contract administration of the civil works of the two ICB road works
contracts. A firm of international consultants was engaged for the design and supervision of
the two ICB road works. A minimum design standard of 7.3 meters (m) carriageway with two
1.5 m wide shoulders for main roads was consistently applied. Alternatives for a reduced
width and pavement thickness were evaluated for Nabouwalu ICB Road in an attempt to
contain the increasing project costs, but these were subsequently rejected by PWD given the
heavy traffic and the need for a consistent standard for all trunk roads.
7.    Right-of-Way
16.   The land acquisition for road upgrading was not evaluated in detail at appraisal,
which had a significant adverse. impact during project implementation. The original concept
for upgrading the Suva-Nausori Road at Nabua consisted of a 4-lane bypass around the
existing shopping center. This scheme was submitted for planning permission in 1991 and
was provisionally approved in July 1992. Subsequent to this approval, however, new private
building projects were approved that encroached into the road reserve and required
amendments to the road scheme. Final planning approval was only granted in June 1996,
and the consideration of appeals was completed in December 1996. Only then were the land
acquisition purchase agreements completed for the commencement of construction works.
Complications with the implementation of the Nabouwalu Road regarding the contractor's
negotiation of access to Naua River gravel site were difficult and led to a further four-month
delay in contract award. Problems were also encountered on Nadi Back Road and the
Dama-Navalou Road, but were resolved through compulsory land purchase. The delay in the
latter led to contractual claims. The procedures for land acquisition and purchase
agreements led to excessive valuations and on occasion PWD refrained from paying
compensation.  This led to independent reevaluations, and the procedures for land
acquisition and purchase agreement were reviewed and revised accordingly. By project
completion, 96 hectares of land were acquired affecting 378 landowners.
B.    Project Implementation Arrangements
17.   PWD was the Executing Agency for the Project. PWD, with the assistance of the
PMU and the consultants was responsible for the planning, design, construction,
maintenance, and administration of road upgrading and road safety improvement
components. As a result of the reorganization of Government ministries, DRT was the
Implementing Agency for the vehicle weight enforcement and land transport act components



6
of the Project. Similarly, the FRSAP, which was initially coordinated and implemented by
PWD, was later centrally coordinated and implemented by the National Road Safety Council,
with the exception of the road safety civil works, which remained with PWD.
18.   The most significant change in implementation arrangements was the provision of
consulting services for the design of four sections of Suva-Nausori Road, which reflected the
pressing need to supplement PWD's limited capacity. Two of these sections and the Viseisei
Bypass were constructed by LCB contract instead of the force account envisaged at
appraisal. On the TIR, lack of expertise and complexity of the problems after the major slips
in early 1997 led to the design, construction, and supervision of the restoration of major slips
by contract.
C.    Project Costs
1.    Project Costs
19.   The estimated project cost at appraisal was US$78.0 million; and the actual cost is
estimated to be US$114.53 million, including value-added tax and interest during
construction costs, an increase of US$36.5 million or 47 percent higher than the appraisal
estimate. In addition, outside the project scope, PWD replaced the existing 2-lane Samabula
Bridge with a 4-lane bridge at a cost of approximately US$1.5 million on the upgraded 4-lane
section of the Suva-Nausori Road. The estimated costs by component at appraisal with the
actual costs are provided in Appendix 3.
20.   The actual cost of the road upgrading was high compared with the costs estimated at
appraisal. This caused some concern in the early project stages and in 1994 ADB asked
PWD for an analysis of the costs of upgrading the roads. Based on these costs, it became
apparent that the increase in costs was above the appraisal estimates for all subprojects
across the board. This situation led to a formal review of the Project during the April 1995
Midterm Review Mission (MTR). At MTR, the cost of the Project was estimated to be
US$92.7 million, an increase of 16 percent above the appraisal estimate. As the loan
amounts were fixed, the Government had to decide whether to reduce the scope of works or
to increase its contribution to proceed with the original scope. The Government indicated a
preference to proceed with the original scope of the work but within a budget envelope of
F$25 million per year. This required (i) the project implementation period and loan closing
dates to be extended to December 1998; and (ii) an adjustment to the percentage
reimbursement under the IBRD and ADB loans.
2.    Financing Plan
21          The project cost at appraisal was estimated at US$78.0 million equivalent.
The ADB loan of US$18.0 million represented 23 percent of the total financing requirement.
The IBRD and EXIMBANK loans of US$15.0 million and US$6.5 million represented 19
percent and 8 percent respectively, and the Government contribution represented 50 percent
of the total financing requirements. The banks and the Government were to finance 85
percent and 15 percent of the foreign exchange costs respectively. At the end of the Project,
the banks' financing remained fixed at US$39.5 million or 34 percent, whereas the
Government financed US$74.6 million or 66 percent of the total project costs to meet the
cost overruns of US$36.5 million. The original loan allocations were increased and ADB's



7
Loan agreement was amended to reduce the financing percentage from 56 percent to 50
percent for category 1A. Subsequent reallocations were also made from other categories.
However, the main reasons for the cost overruns are (i) a US$32.60 million increase in the
cost of civil works including changes in the project scope and restoration of slopes on the
TIR, (ii) introduction of the value-added tax soon after loan approval, (iii) and the declining F$
exchange rate and eventual devaluation by 20 percent since October 1998. Details of the
financing plan are provided in Appendix 4.
D.    Project Schedule
22.   The ADB loan was approved on 18 June 1992, signed on 2 May 1993, and became
effective on 7 June 1993, two months earlier than anticipated. The IBRD loan was approved
on 9 June 1993 and became effective on 13 August 1993. At appraisal, it was anticipated
that the Project would be physically completed in 58 months from loan approval. Significant
delays were encountered during implementation and the Project was completed by the end
of August 1999, 32 months (51 percent) later than expected at appraisal. Many factors
contributed to the delays. There was an initial minor delay (3 months) in appointing the
project management engineer because the selected consultant did not meet ADB's
requirements. The ICB Kings Road completion encountered a delay of 2.5 months when the
main contractor was placed in receivership. However, the major delays were (i) prolonged
time and procedures required for the planning approval of the Nabua scheme (36 months),
and additional 16 months involved in the acquisition of land, which led to judicial reviews for
approval; (ii) the Government's budgetary constraints that led to deferment of ICB
Nabouwalu Road by 12 months; (iii) insufficient design capacity of PWD roads section; (iv)
inadequacy of the appraisal estimates reviewed during project MTR and the Government's
decision to implement the full scope of the Project despite increase in costs under the
budget ceiling of F$25.0 million per annum; (v) the poor performance of the contractor in
completing Nabouwalu ICB road works (about 15 months); and (vi) extensive delay on the
part of the Government in finding cofinanciers. A final project schedule showing planned and
actual implementation of individual component is attached at Appendix 5.
E.    Engagement of Consultants, and Procurement of Goods and Services
23.  International and domestic consulting services were provided for the Project. All
consultants were recruited following ADB Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Under the
advance procurement action facility, PWD with the prior approval of ADB, directly engaged
the feasibility study consultants for the design and construction supervision of the two ICB
road works. This action was taken to enable immediate commencement of the designs for
the two ICB components. Two consulting firms were engaged to provide institutional support
for the PMU and RMSU. An individual consultant was engaged to head the PMU. Domestic
consultants were also engaged for design and supervision, but their services were funded
directly by Government.
24.   All goods, materials, and equipment for the Project were procured following ICB and
international shopping procedures in accordance with the Loan Agreement and ADB
Guidelines for Procurement. Prequalified contractors for civil works construction were hired
under ICB and LCB procedures in accordance with the Loan Agreement and ADB
Guidelines for Procurement.



8
F.    Performance of Consultants, Contractors, and Suppliers
25.   The RMSU consultants' performance was satisfactory and achieved many of the
objectives of the institutional component. They were effective in providing the skills for
performance of maintenance to depot staff. Implementation of the maintenance
management system was satisfactory under manual methods, but the computerization was
not fully completed or in operation and is to be replaced. The consultants submitted a
number of proposals to have the RMSU institutionalized and incorporated into the PWD
organization structure, with dedicated staff under specific duty statements. Few of these
proposals were accepted, however, and affected the sustainability of the road maintenance
management system. At an early stage, the RMSU plant supervisors identified the system
for procuring spare parts as possibly the greatest impediment to improving workshop
turnaround times. The consultants, who also occupied line management positions, were able
to exert considerable influence over the purchase of spare parts, and saved considerable
sums of money. However, after their departure, the procurement systems reverted to overly
bureaucratic procedures.
26.   The performance of the ICB design and supervision consultants was very
satisfactory. Their administration of the contracts, deliberation on technical engineering, and
well-kept documentary records were extremely useful in the arbitration award Dama-
Navolau ICB contract in favor of the Government. The performance of the consultants in
providing the institutional support to the PMU was generally satisfactory, but lacked in some
crucial aspects. They provided a pool of technical expertise, which the PWD was able to
use for advice on other activities outside the project scope. They were very effective in
bridge design, and facilitated the production of road designs in the early stages, but were
unable to mobilize PWD capacity to meet the full scope of design work. The PMU
specialists were slow to anticipate and resolve crucial and complex slope failures, especially
on the TIR and in the design improvements on Viseisei Bypass and Suva-Nausori Road. On
the TIR, the geotechnical problems were first identified by the ADB mission in 1994, but
substantive actions were not taken by PWD/PMU until 1996 after a special investigation and
delays in completing the remedial works led to the extensive failures in March 1997 under
Cyclone Gavin. The project was managed professionally by the project management
engineer, who was the focal point of communication with the banks. The performance of all
consultants recruited under Government funding was also satisfactory.
27.   The contractor for the Kings Road Dama-Navolau section proceeded very well
initially, and was four months ahead of schedule in November 1994 when he began to
experience cash-flow problems due to devaluation of the Papua New Guinea (PNG) kina,
which comprised 54 percent of his foreign currency payments. PWD assisted the contractor
by making payment for materials on-site, but the problems deepened and in June 1995 the
contractor was placed in receivership with the work 80 percent complete. The Guarantor
providing the Performance Bond undertook to complete the work, rather than have the bond
called, and work was resumed by another PNG contractor in late July 1995. The completion
certificate was awarded on 12 April 1996.
28.   The performance of the contractor for the Nabouwalu Road was disappointing.
Progress lagged well behind schedule from the early stages. The contractor had difficulties



9
were inadequate to meet production requirements. The completion certificate was issued on
9 August 1999, 15 months more than the official two-year contract period. The contractor
submitted claims for additional payment, claiming circumstances that were unforeseeable at
the tender stage. The engineer has rejected these claims, and the contractor was intending
to pursue his claims to arbitration.
29.   The performance of the contractor for the Viseisei Bypass component was
satisfactory for quality but progress was slow, due mainly to his poor financial condition that
led to four months delay. The contractors on the Suva-Nausori road generally performed well
and completed contracts on schedule. The local contractor competed with an international
contractor and generated very good results. The performance of the contractors on the two
bridges on Wainikoro Road and TIR slip restoration was also satisfactory.
30.   The performances of the suppliers of the plant, equipment, and vehicles were
satisfactory. The RMSU consultants found various shortcomings with some of the plant
procured under the Project because of its unsuitability for the construction works. For
example all construction machinery should have had rust-proofing as a standard; bulk
earthworks operations would also have been improved if compaction was carried out by
high-speed vibratory compactors rather than self-propelled or towed rollers. The plant for the
Project was generally supplied by well-respected manufacturers, but performance of the
Bomag and Aveling Barford vibratory rollers suffered through the poor support service
provided by their local agents. The serviceability of the Champion graders procured under
the Project was very disappointing. PWD also experienced difficulties with the cost of spare
parts and the back-up service. Good performance and back-up service was from Carptrac
Fiji for the Caterpillar equipment.
G.   Conditions and Covenants
31.   The Government generally complied with most loan covenants. A summary of
compliance with individual loan covenants is attached as Appendix 6. One serious exception
involved noncompliance with submission of audited financial statements for fiscal years
1992, 1993, and 1994. Noting no improvement in the submission of audited financial
statements, ADB suspended disbursements under all three loans from July 1994 to May
1995. Consequently, the three audited financial statements were received 17, 14, and 6
months respectively after scheduled deadlines. Since 1995, compliance with the submission
of audited financial statement was very satisfactory and the audit qualifications and
recommendations were adequately addressed by the Government and PWD.
32.   Two other major cases of noncompliance were noted; these included the inadequate
provision of funds for road maintenance, and lack of enforcement of legislation on vehicle
weights and axle loads. ADB missions had repeatedly brought these issues to the attention
of PWD and the Government. The Government, instead of increasing the road maintenance
funds, decreased them gradually during 1996-1997. However, in 1998 the allocations for
road maintenance where restored to 1995 levels, and in 2000 funds will be increased by 36
percent, still insufficient to effectively reduce the vehicle operating costs. While the revenue
collected from road users is significantly higher than the Government's road-related
expenditures, taxation of heavy vehicles covers less than 50 percent of the wear and tear
they impose on the road network. This has been further compounded with the slow progress
of legislation on vehicle weights and axle-loads for enforcement to bring the vehicle weights



10
and axle-load regulations in line with modern road and vehicle standards.  At project
completion, ADB was assisting the Government in establishing of an LTA that will bring
effective enforcement, and streamline vehicle standards and axle loads. Details on the
adverse impact of inadequate road maintenance funds and axle loads are summarized in
Appendix 7.
H.   Disbursements
33.   A project disbursement schedule was not included in the loan documents or in the
reports prepared by ADB's Inception Mission. A schedule of actual disbursements for three
loans is attached in Appendix 8. Disbursements commenced in the fourth quarter of 1993.
A cumulative disbursement of US$14.1 million was made under all three loans in 1995 partly
due to the suspension of disbursements (para. 31). All disbursements were made under
ADB's reimbursement procedure. The final disbursement date of the ADB loan was 9 March
1999 and that of the EXIMBANK loan 11 January 1996. The IBRD loan account remains
open to finalize the costs incurred under the Nabouwalu Road ICB contract.
I.    Environmental and Social Impact
34.   The appraisal identified no major environmental issues for the project, noting that the
minor realignments would avoid environmentally sensitive areas. It warned of the possibility
of slope failure and erosion, and of the risks associated with construction, and stated that
mitigating measures would be taken during design and construction. For nearly all works, the
PMU  provided adequate environmental protection.   Despite warnings from  ADB's
supervision missions, inadequate mitigating measures and control over spoil management
on the TIR works led to slope failures and extensive road damage during heavy rainfall.
Design weaknesses, particularly lack of geotechnical investigation prior to commencement of
construction works, further compounded the problems during the construction of the TIR.
The subsequent restoration added about 55 percent to the cost of the subproject, and
altered steep slopes and a stream bed in the vicinity of the road. Another slope failure, on
the Nadi Back Road, was due to an undetected geotechnical weakness. On the Dama-
Navolau ICB works, additional controls were requested by the ADB's supervision missions to
limit the deposition of spoil in and around mangroves on the coastal section of the road. For
both ICB contracts, a gravel extraction plan providing details of environmental controls for
rivers during the extraction of gravel was prepared and adhered to by the contractors.
However, several incidents indicated the need to greatly strengthen environmental
management in future works.  To this end, the Code of Environmental Practice was
developed under IBRD funding, and is being applied rigorously to minimize similar risks,
particularly for steep terrain and wherever slope failures may occur.
J.    Performance of the Borrower and the Executing Agency
35.   ADB's Fact-Finding Mission made the Government aware of the need to obtain
further loans from other cofinanciers to meet the project cost. Following the approval of the
ADB loan, the Government obtained loans from IBRD and EXIMBANK, 11 months and 21
months late respectively. This subsequently delayed the signing of the ADB loan. As a
result, all funds under retroactive financing were completely utilized earlier than anticipated,
and the resources were deployed elsewhere. The revision of project estimates at MTR
required the implementation period to be extended to enable the Government to provide
sufficient funds to meet the actual project costs.  This caused the change in project



1 1
sufficient funds to meet the actual project costs.  This caused the change in project
implementation arrangements, extending them by 2.5 years, the ADB Bank loan by one
year, and the EXIMBANK and the IBRD loans by 1.5 years.
36.   Overall, PWD has been supportive of the Project and made concerted efforts to meet
its obligations under the loan covenants with two major exceptions (Appendix 7). Its
performance in upgrading roads and in competing with private contractors proved generally
productive. Lack of PWD expertise was evident in undertaking road works in highly sensitive
soil and environmental conditions. Throughout the Project and despite the banks' attempts
to equally address the key policy issues in the road subsector, PWD focused primarily on
road upgrading. Little was done to ensure compliance with vehicle weights and axle loads
legislation. The Government did not allocate sufficient budget to maintain the road network,
and a serious situation has developed where sections of major sealed roads are in an
increasingly distressed condition. The appraisal report correctly identified the shortage of
engineers as the biggest problem facing PWD. PWD encountered difficulties in meeting all
the road design work and in appointing counterpart staff to the consultants.
K.    Performance of the Financing Banks
37.   The delays with loan signing at the start of the Project were due to coordination
difficulties of the Government rather than a specific failure in the performance of the banks.
The banks reviewed the Project twice a year until its completion. There has been excellent
coordination between ADB and IBRD with jointly conducted review missions and a high level
of professional input to the Project. While prior invitation was extended to EXIMBANK, it was
not able to participate in any review mission. The opportunity was taken at the MTR to
review the original cost estimates, and in light of this, the project scope was reconsidered.
This gave a new direction for the completion of the Project. The Government's requests for
approvals were handled promptly and the banks were helpful in providing assistance,
through staff consultants, to resolve technical issues such as slope instability, environment,
and road safety. The staff of PWD and Government received training in ADB's
disbursement, and project administration and implementation procedures.
Ill.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
38.  In conjunction with the Project, ADB approved two advisory technical assistance
grants.
A.   TA 1715-FIJ: National Transport Sector Plan
39.   This TA was designed to help the Government prepare an integrated multmodal
national transport sector plan, covering transport policy review and preparation of a transport
investment plan for the next 20 years. The TA was generally successful and contributed
significantly to the Government's investment program in the transport sector. Within this
context, a schedule of potential upgrading projects was drawn up for the roads sector,
including the next round of feasibility studies. The plan recommended a number of high-
priority land transport projects. As a result, 19 roads were identified and included in Fiji
Road Upgrading Project  Ill (FRUP 1II) for improvement.  Increased private sector
participation was supported and introduced under the Project for road construction and to a
lesser extent for road maintenance.



12
40.   The TA recommended that the Government should address various matters
pertaining to transport policy and planning. The TA was unable to achieve its objective of
establishing a suitably staffed Transport Planning Unit. Establishment of the unit, which was
originally to form an important output of the National Transport Sector Plan, was finally
agreed with the Government in early 1999 under IBRD grant funding. The Government did
not make any significant progress particularly with regard to vehicle weights and dimensions,
road user costs, cost recovery, and setting up a road fund. Overall the TA was generally
successful in identifying potential investment projects and providing directions for
implementation of various policies that are crucial for a sustainable and vibrant transport
sector in Fiji.
B.    Road Safety and Traffic Management
41.   The TA aimed at improving road safety and traffic management to reduce the high
incidence of traffic accidents that were prevalent on Fiji roads. Road fatalities were high,
accounting for over 80 deaths each year before TA Inception. A road safety strategy was
developed and the FRSAP was drawn up in 1993 and implemented between 1994 and 1998.
The FRSAP received budgetary support from line ministries and was approved by the
cabinet for implementation. In comparing the number of road deaths and accidents before
the commencement of the FRSAP, fatalities dropped by 34 percent in 1997 and a further 9
percent in 1998, reaching the lowest since the inception of the FRSAP. In conclusion, the
TA has generally been a success in that it has contributed to an improvement in the Fiji road
safety situation. The detail outputs of the TA and FRSAP are provided in Appendix 9.
IV.   EVALUATION OF INITIAL PERFORMANCE AND BENEFITS
A.   Financial and Economic Performance
42.   Financial evaluation is not presently appropriate for assessing project success. The
revenues from the various direct and indirect taxes and charges on road users are currently
treated in the same way as other tax revenues, being credited to the Government's general
account and helping to fund its general expenditure. The 1999 budget documents referred to
priority being given to establishing a better relationship between the costs incurred in the
provision of infrastructure and the benefits derived by users, but this strategy depends upon
the establishment of the Roads Authority and a road fund financed by road user charges.
43.   The main quantifiable economic benefits of the Project seen at appraisal were to
accrue from reductions in vehicle operating costs (VOC), which would increase the efficiency
of the transport system. Benefits would also arise through economic development and other
nonquantified benefits. The overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of upgrading the
project roads was estimated to be 24 percent, while the EIRRs of individual road links varied
from 17 to 34 percent; this was considered to be satisfactory.
44.   There have been considerable changes in the basic project data used for input to the
original economic evaluation, each has affected the level of costs and benefits accruing to
the Project. The considerable increase in construction costs has, however, been to some
extent offset by both delays in the project schedule and by the generally higher than



13
anticipated traffic growth. Again, to the extent that the increases in the project costs are the
result of inflation, this is remedied by the use of updated figures for road user costs.
45.   The initial results of the economic reevaluation conducted by the Project Completion
Report Mission generally indicate little change in the EIRRs for the upgrading of gravel roads
to sealed roads. These were calculated at 16-28 percent as against 17-31 percent at
appraisal, excluding the passenger time savings. Considerable increases of traffic along the
Cunningham and Khalsa roads have, however, led to EIRRs of 46 and 37 percent
respectively compared with 21 percent foreseen at appraisal. The reevaluation of the Suva-
Nausori Road was complicated by the considerable changes in scope made to increase the
number of traffic lanes, and the EIRR was estimated at 15 percent for the 4-lane section
between Princes-Daniva roads and 12 percent for the 3-lane section between Daniva-
Wainibuku. This compares with an EIRR of 28 percent estimated at appraisal. The EIRRs on
short stretches of roads upgraded between Nadi and Lautoka are now estimated at 11-16
percent. A description of the economic reevaluation is attached in Appendix 10.
46.   The economic reevaluation by the PCR Mission made use of the analysis of the
VOCs contained in the FRUP IlIl feasibility study and appraisal reports. The results were
obtained using the RTIM3 4model were generally in line with the price levels obtained during
the project period. VOCs were calculated for five major types of vehicles representing traffic
on the project roads, i.e., cars, light vehicles, medium goods, heavy goods, and buses.
B.    Attainment of Benefits
47.   From the results of the initial reevaluation, it appears that the project objectives have
been achieved. The project roads, which are important links in the main road network, have
been upgraded to international standards and demonstrate satisfactory economic rates of
return. In addition to reductions in road user costs, various nonquantified benefits will also
accrue from the Project. To this end, traffic accidents were a serious problem in the Fiji
Islands, and fatalities were about eight times higher per vehicle than in developed countries
and were estimated at about F$20 million per annum. It was appreciated that the increase in
operating speeds of traffic resulting from the proposed road improvements could have
adverse implications on road safety, and the proposed improvements to road safety and
traffic management contained in the FRSAP would improve the overall situation. It was
evident that the FRSAP had the desired effect. Road fatalities fell by 39 percent from 108 in
1991 to 66 in 1998, even though the number of licensed vehicles increased by 30 percent
over the same period. While no attempt was made to quantify the reduction in accident costs
in the economic reevaluation, clearly on a fatality basis the 40 percent reduction in aggregate
terms and 50 percent reduction in risk terms is a substantial benefit to the economy.
48.   In terms of access between markets and agricultural areas and to urban and
industrial centers, the project roads were almost invariably main roads forming important
links in the road network. There were no cases where access was particularly bad or where
4 The RTIM3 model calculates the savings arising from improvements to the existing roads for individual costs
components such as fuel, tire wear, depreciation, and vehicle maintenance. The estimates of financial VOCs
and construction costs were converted to economic values by applying the standard conversion factors used in
the FRUP Ill appraisal report.



14
specific underprivileged groups would benefit from the proposed road improvements. On
most project roads, the traffic included a considerable number of commercial vehicles,
mostly light trucks operating short-haul services between rural communities and market
centers and public passenger transport vehicles. The road upgrading has permitted
reductions in transport costs and more regular operations, and in consequence increased
accessibility for rural dwellers to amenities already easily accessible to the population in the
Suva/Nausori and Nadi/Lautoka urban areas.  Perhaps the most dramatic example of
change was the village of Lomaloma, which has moved about 3 km over mountainous
country to its new site along the TIR. At project completion, the new village has grown from
an initial three-house settlement when the roads started to the current 20 households; the
villagers now have better access to schools and medical facilities. On the Wainikoro Road,
upgrading was accompanied by the introduction of telephones and electricity; a police post
has subsequently been established with the result that the crime rate has dropped
dramatically.
49.   Most of the suitable land area served by the project roads was already being used for
small cash-crop farming, and no major change in land use is foreseen in the near future. The
project roads pass through land already exclusively devoted to sugar cane. Any future
expansion in these areas would only occur beyond the end points of the roads, and
expansion of production areas would therefore be limited. Particular examples of economic
development include activities along the Cunningham and Khalsa roads. The area is
densely populated, and vegetables are grown for sale in Suva and at roadside stalls. There
is firm potential for further residential housing development, demonstrated by the significant
subdivision that was implemented on the Khalsa Road since the road upgrading work was
completed. There is potential for tourism development on the Dama-Navolau Road and the
TIR now that they are upgraded.
50.   Generated traffic was more likely to arise because upgrading made road journeys
more attractive as a result of cost or time reduction rather than any major increases in
development. At appraisal, the Suva-Nausori Road was suffering from severe traffic
congestion, especially during peak periods. The section through Nabua was the busiest,
carrying 23,000 annual average daily traffic; it had long been a bottleneck for major
congestion. The new Nabua Scheme has eased the delays faced by road users, particularly
in peak periods, and has reduced the traffic backups, which often stretched for 5 km. Traffic
data for the project roads indicate that traffic has continued to grow strongly at a rate of 4 or
5 percent per year compared with 3 percent forecasted at appraisal. Of concern is that these
increases in traffic levels may not be sustained, as the other roads within the network are not
being properly maintained. In addition to the benefits accrued from road usage, the civil
works carried out under the project have increased economic activity in the areas served.
Actual records of the labor employed under the project have not been kept, but it is
estimated that 200-250 workers on average were employed during 1992-1999, with a peak
of 350 in 1997. On this basis, it is estimated that the Project generated some 2,000-2,500
person-years of employment.
51.   The improvements to the project roads have generally been upgraded along the
existing road alignments. Only the TIR with its slope failures during construction had a
negative environmental impact. In terms of positive environmental impacts, upgrading the
project roads to bitumen standard has eradicated the dust associated with gravel roads,
which was an inconvenience to roadside residents. In the urban areas, the increased



15
capacity between Suva-Nausori and Nadi-Lautoka reduced air pollution from vehicle
emissions on the sections of road that had previously experienced significant congestion
during peak hours. Clearly, these positive environmental impacts should not be dismissed,
even though they are difficult to quantify in monetary terms.
52.   For long-term sustainability of project benefits, it is critical that road sector policies
such as vehicle weights and axle-load regulations and user cost recovery be addressed
rigorously. Effective road maintenance and improved enforcement on axle overloading are
the two key elements. Qualified PWD staff have been trained on good project management
and road maintenance practices. In addition, a lot of equipment for road maintenance
procured under the Project is used for the operation and maintenance of the entire road
network. However, of concern is the aging plant and equipment, that are becoming
unproductive with no replacement policy. Out-sourcing from the private sector remains the
only alternate; this is being utilized effectively. Since 1996, insufficient road maintenance
funds have been of concern to adequately maintain the country's existing road network. The
PCR Mission took the view, however, that project benefits could be considered to be
sustained in the longer term given the establishment of LTA and the Government's
undertakings concerning road maintenance. At the same time, the sensitivity of the EIRR
estimates has taken account of both the existing roads as well as those upgraded under the
Project. The accelerating deterioration of roads not maintained would affect the older
existing roads more than those upgraded under the Project.
V.    CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.   Conclusions
53.   The project was the second road sector loan from ADB to the Fiji Islands. The project
was not implemented entirely in the manner conceived at the time of appraisal. It had some
deficient design relating to unsatisfactory appraisal estimates, changes in scope and
implementation arrangements, implementation delays, and noncompletion of some key
covenants. Changes were made to increase the scope of the works on the Suva-Nausori
Road, the most heavily trafficked road in the Fiji Islands, to provide sufficient capacity for
project traffic growth over the next 15-20 years. Despite these issues, almost all of the
project objectives were satisfactorily achieved.
54.   The actual project cost was high compared with the costs estimated at the time of
appraisal. The final project cost was estimated at about US$114.5 million, an increase of 47
percent above the appraisal cost of US$78 million. This increase was entirely accounted for
by the increase in civil works costs from those envisaged at appraisal. These increased by
about 47 percent overall, with individual components exceeding the original estimate by 50
percent for Cunningham Road, 138 percent for the Khalsa Road, 100 percent for the TIR
including cyclone restoration works, and 350 percent for Suva-Nausori road after the
changes in scope and design. The increase in costs was a major factor contributing to the
generally lower than expected rates of return for the Project.
55.   The Project was completed 32 months behind schedule. The time overrun was
mainly attributable to the (i) the delay between appraisal and loan signing; (ii) inadequate
appraisal estimates, which led to a revised financing plan; (iii) insufficient design capacity in



16
PWD; (iii) the long period taken to acquire planning permission for the Nabua section of
the Suva-Nausori road; (iv) problems associated with land acquisition and access to
gravel pits; and (v) poor performance of the ICB contractors. Although the performance
of the ICB contractors was slow, the quality of works was good. The cost-effectiveness
of the designs and construction was improved through competitive consulting inputs and
bidding processes.
56.   There is some underachievement of the project objectives relating to post-
construction road safety audits, vehicle regulations, institutional improvement, road
maintenance, and implementation of some key road sector policies. Notwithstanding
these detractions, the Project is assessed to be generally successful on the basis of the
core returns on civil works. The economic reevaluation analysis indicates satisfactory but
generally reduced EIRRs for the various upgrading schemes; the increases in costs, are
offset by higher than expected levels of traffic and traffic growth. In any event, the
project roads, all of which are important links in the main road network, have all been
upgraded to international standards and are demonstrating EIRRs, that are at or above
the discount rate of 12 percent used in economic evaluations.
57.   Various nonquantified benefits have also accrued from the project in addition to
the direct savings in vehicle costs. In particular, the improvements to road safety and
traffic management contained in the FRSAP are contributing to a significant
improvement in the number of road accidents and a reduction in accident costs. Since
the inception of the FRSAP in 1994, the number of road fatalities and total number of
accidents decreased by 25 percent (88 to 66) and 7.5 percent (2,916 to 2,698) in 1998
respectively, despite a 13 percent increase in licensed vehicles over the same period.
58.   The project's only shortcomings have been in the Government's attempt to
address the policy issues in the road subsector. In particular, the Government, although
generally supportive of the project, has done little to meet its obligations under the loan
covenants concerning vehicle weights and axle load legislation, and road maintenance
allocations. The costs attributable to the overloading of heavy vehic!es have been
thoroughly examined in various studies but the existing regulations are seldom enforced.
A new traffic act, in draft as early as 1987, was only passed by Parliament in October
1998; its implementation must await the establishment of the LTA, expected in early
2000.
59. The RMSU consultants demonstrated that more funds are required for funding
better road maintenance. The Government continued to not provide adequate funding to
meet the country's annual maintenance requirements. Overall maintenance spending in
1998 was at approximately the same level as in 1992 in real terms, whereas expenditure
on new construction and upgrading has increased considerably. This trend is likely to
continue with the implementation of (FRUP lll)5 despite an undertaking by the
Government to give priority to road maintenance during periods of budgetary constraint.
It is also evident that maintenance spending has been consistently below optimum levels
during the project period. It was estimated by the RMSU that PWD should be spending
some F$40 million on maintenance in 1999, nearly three times its actual budget, and the
annual cost to the economy of inadequate maintenance is now estimated to be more
than F$60 million.

B.    Recommendations
1.    Project Related
a.    For Future Monitoring
60.   ADB needs to carefully review the Government's investment policies in the road
subsector. Government assurances have not been met, and the Government continues
to extend its road network with inadequate attention to the need to effectively manage its
road assets. These practices are contrary to the Government's policy to increase
emphasis on maintenance and upgrading. While the Project addressed the needs for
upgrading, the Government failed to adequately maintain the entire road network in a
satisfactory condition and to prevent it from further deterioration. The aged pavements
are no longer able to withstand the uncontrolled axle-overloads and many of the sealed
roads are in need of reconstruction. While portable weighing scales and accessories
have been procured and roadside-weighing stations built, attempts have not been made
to conduct axle-load surveys.
b.    Covenants
61.   Funding for capital construction has increased significantly in recent years, but
there has not been a commensurate increase in the maintenance budget, particularly
periodic maintenance. It is recommended that more emphasis be placed on maintaining
the existing assets and that the Government should not continue to extend the road
network unless it is able to maintain existing roads in a satisfactory condition.
62.   The banks will need to reemphasize the importance of adequate funding for road
maintenance with the Government at every opportunity if the loan covenant regarding
road maintenance is to be fulfilled. There may be a tendency to defer appropriate action
on this topic under the guise of waiting for the road asset management system to come
online. A seriously deficient situation already exists, however, and immediate action is
required.
63.   The loan covenant requiring reports for the next five years from the date of final
withdrawals on the progress with a range of issues needs to be discussed with LTA.
PWD is unlikely to be much involved with the implementation of this action plan in the
near future because the responsibility for transport is now in a different ministry.
Although the new traffic act has been passed by Parliament, its promulgation and the
signing of the necessary traffic regulations needs to be rigorously pursued.
64.   The loan covenant requiring submission of reports on (i) estimates of resources
needed and detailed maintenance budgets, road maintenance activities, and associated
costs for current fiscal year; (ii) road maintenance activities and associated costs for the
previous fiscal year; and (iii) proposed budgetary allocations and planned operations for
the next five years after the closing date of the loan account must be rigorously followed
by ADB.
c.    Further Actions
65.   The contract for the ICB Naravuka-Dreketi section of Nabauwalu Road is
substantially complete, and the defects liability period for one year ends on 9 July 2000.
Most of the postconstruction safety audits of the roads are outstanding. The final survey



18
for land acquisition and compensation is incomplete for various road links. ADB will
continue to oversee project administration in parallel with ongoing FRUP Ill.
Implementation of road subsector policies needs to be rigorously pursued with the
Government and PWD. The backlog of safety audits on project roads requires attention
for completion, and a concentrated effort will be needed to improve the productivity of
TARSU, and provide for ongoing training to sustain the skills of unit staff.
d.    Timing of Project Performance Audit Report Preparation
66.   The project performance audit report should be prepared after August 2000, by
which time the warranty period under all contracts will have expired. This timing will
allow ADB to assess the effects of pavement behavior on the project roads after 2-5
years of traffic flow. It will also be able to assess the effects of maintenance and road
safety programs including the implementation of sector policies by the Government.
e.    Lessons Learned
67.   At the time of feasibility studies, more attention and emphasis should be placed
on geotechnical appraisals and investigations, and the quality of estimating road projects
where a very realistic bill of quantities is required. Good quality concept plans and
designs, and available unit rates would assist in improving the accuracy of estimates
rather than those obtained from sketchy outlines at the feasibility stage. This will ensue
more realistic financial and implementation planning of the projects. The problems with
acquisition of land should be advanced into the appraisal phase instead of during project
implementation to minimize delays.  Staff transfers should be minimized, and
counterpart staff should be provided and maintained throughout project implementation
to facilitate adequate transfer of technical skills.
68.   At present, no allocation has been made to meet the costs of flood or storm
damage or other emergency works. It is recommended that an additional sum, of about
5 percent of the annual routine and periodic maintenance budget, should be allocated to
a standard contingencies fund administered by PWD to cover any unforeseen
emergency cost. Road maintenance could be improved by enhancing (i) monitoring of
year-to-year trends by road and section location to identify problem sections, poor work,
or incipient failure; (ii) providing incentives for efficiency (beyond target output levels),
which need reference measures of outcome. e.g., trends in road conditions; (iii) using
network surveys for periodic maintenance assessment; and (iv) improving contract
documents and outsourcing road maintenance to the private sector by contract.
69.   For nearly all works, the construction  management provided  adequate
environmental protection.  However, several incidents indicate the need to greatly
strengthen environmental management in future works. Both PWD and ADB must
ensure that environmental, geotechnical, and slope failure mitigation measures are
adequately addressed in the designs. PWD should ensure that qualified engineering
and construction supervision staffs are provided for force account works in sensitive
environmental and geotechnical conditions. At project completion, the construction
under contract performed well under heavy axle loads, whereas some of the
construction under force account had failures in isolated areas. In addition, the roads
upgraded under force account were costly when compared with those completed by
contract. More outsourcing of the designs and construction of road works including road
maintenance is encouraged for future projects to improve road sector efficiency.



19
70.   At appraisal and during contract negotiations a number of assurances and
agreements were reached with the Government for land transport sector policies to (i)
improve enforcement of existing limits for vehicle axle loads, (ii) ensure adequate
maintenance of road network, and (iii) provide adequate maintenance funds, (iv) prepare
and implement revised and new traffic regulations, (v) adopt and implement more
appropriate road user charges for heavy vehicles, and (vi) introduce new hire rates for
PWD equipment that reflect actual owning and operating costs, and improved equipment
replacement policies. The Government not been able to honor all of these. ADB should
review the road transport sector policies in light of future assistance to the sector.
2.    General
a.    Project Appraisal
71.   The lending banks should make careful assessment of PWD's and the
Government's resources to carry out the design and construction of major road projects.
The Project identified a lot of roads to be designed and implemented by force account
when the PWD resources were scarce. As a result many designs and contracts were let
out to the private sector, under LCB procedures, which were productive in the end.
b.    Project Implementation
72.   PWD's contracting procedures for civil works are generally satisfactory.
Prequalification assessments should be improved by insisting that interested contractors
provide audited financial statements. The Fiji Islands' law does not require private
limited companies to prepare audited accounts. However, PWD should give reasonable
notice to the construction industry about the requirements for audited accounts for
prequalification. Contractors should also be requested to provide a tax clearance
demonstrating they do not have any arrears prior to contract award.  A more
professional assessment is required for the procurement of plant and equipment. PWD
should revisit its spare part procurement procedures where significant improvements can
be made to plant serviceability and cost reduction. There is a need to improve the
internal audit procedures as in the past these have caused unwarranted delays in the
auditing of the project accounts. It is recommended that consideration be given to
private companies carrying out this service.

LOAN COVENANTS
1     The Government has partially complied with the loan covenants for vehicle overloading
and allocation of adequate road maintenance budgets. The impacts of these covenants are
detailed here.
A.   Vehicle Overloading
2.    The Government's policy was to protect the investment in the road network "through
effective controls on vehicle overloading", although it was well-known that goods vehicles,
notably sugarcane, gravel, and timber trucks are substantially overloaded, and the existing
regulations are seldom enforced. The current axle and gross vehicle weight restrictions in the
Fiji Islands are relatively low by internationai standards for the range of heavy vehicles.
Currently, there are more than 2,000 heavy vehicles on Fiji roads operating on permits, which
exempt them from the current regulations. The draft legislation for a revised Traffic Act and
Regulations was prepared as early as 1986-1987, which would allow maximum loads of
10,000kg on a single axle and 16,000kg on a tandem axle and would increase the legal
maximum vehicle length from the current 11 meters to 17 m. However, the new legislation was
only passed by Parliament in October 1998. The act empowers the Minister of Transport to
issue regulations for vehicle weights and axle loads, but these have not yet been issued and
await the establishment of the Land Transport Authority, expected in late 1999. During this
period, it is expected that a further public consultation and updating of the traffic regulations will
take place to ensure it meets the practicality and requirements of the range of vehicles in the Fiji
Islands.
3.   In an effort to determine the extent of the overloading problem, weighing surveys were
conducted by Public Works Department (PWD) and Department of Road Transport (DRT) in
1993, and a paper on the topic was produced by PWD in 1994 (Vehicle Overloading Too Costly
to Ignore). It was concluded that there weren't any significant problems with buses or light
goods vehicles (LGV). However, overloading was endemic with medium goods vehicles (MGV),
which are the primary type of goods transport. The overloading of heavy goods vehicles (HGV)
was also found to be widespread and significant. It was also observed that overloading still
occurred on the larger articulated goods vehicles, but that they had a lower road damage
potential than the HGVs and MGVs. The data may be summarized as follows:
MGV         HGV

4.    The report also provided estimates of the overloading costs to the economy, particularly
in terms of the savings that could be derived by eradicating the problem. Taking account of
traffic volumes, it was estimated that the avoidable costs relating to the then overloading
situation amounted to more than F$19 million per annum (more than F$23 million at current



40                        Appendix 7, page 2
prices) which is even more than the recent total average annual expenditures of F$16 million on
maintenance and rehabilitation:
F$ million
Additional routine maintenance            0.4
Additional periodic maintenance           2.9

Total                                    19.3
It was pointed out that these costs were not complete and road safety costs due to overloading
were not included in the calculations.
5.   It was therefore considered that a strong case existed for controlling overloading and
preliminary consideration was given to the strategies required to ensure the effective
enforcement of weight regulations. The paper was given good publicity, and an awareness
campaign was carried out in 1995. Portable weigh scales were purchased and some roadside
weighing sites constructed but little or nothing has been done to ensure compliance with the
existing regulations on vehicle weights and axle loads during the Project pending the new
legislation. Clearly, it will still be necessary to control overweight axles when the new traffic
legislation has been implemented, and some further assistance may be needed from ADB in
introducting the new regulations. Achievements through effective enforcement are to be
obtained for the next five years as required by the loan covenant.
B.   Inadequate Road Maintenance Funds
6.    The past ADB missions have expressed their serious concern about the reduction in
road maintenance funds, which has taken place since 1995. While the RMSU consultants have
adequately demonstrated that more funds are required for better road maintenance, the
Government has not complied with the loan covenant. The Government again has committed
legally to provide adequate funding to meet the country's annual maintenance requirements with
its loan agreement with ADB for Third Fiji Road Upgrading Project (FRUP-II).
7.    Since the loan covenant requires the Government to make funds available to adequately
maintain roads and submit annual reports for the next five years after the closing date, i.e. to
December 2004, the Mission has requested urgent action on the Government's part to restore
maintenance funding in 1999 to at least 1995 levels in real terms, i.e., about F$19 million, and to
submit plans for raising this further to meet the needs projected by the Road Maintenance
Management System (RMMS).
8.    The trend of PWD expenditures on roads and bridges in the period since 1992 is shown

9.   The figures show that while there was a gradual increase in both routine and periodic
maintenance expenditures between 1992-1995, there has subsequently been a decline in
nominal terms and more in real terms. In 1993 and 1997, expenditures on periodic maintenance
were greatly affected by allocating of funds to repair the damage caused by Cyclone Kina and
Cyclone Gavin respectively. In 1998 the actual expenditures on road maintenance were about
F$15.3 million, or 23 percent less than in the previous year, despite increases in the gravel
royalty, quarry products, and the hire rates for plants and vehicles. Expenditures for routine and
periodic maintenance were F$10.5 million and F$4.8 million respectively, with an additional
F$1.9 million from the fuel levy being spent on "special" maintenance. The overall provision for
routine maintenance was about F$1.0 million or 8 percent less than that in 1995 in nominal
terms; by contrast, periodic maintenance was about F$600,000 or 16 percent above the 1995
levels. The estimates for 1999 show a further reduction in spending on both routine and periodic
maintenance as compared with 1998.
10.  In practice, however, the division between the two categories of maintenance is
somewhat blurred. Because the allocations are not sufficient to adequately meet maintenance
needs, and given that there is no regular budgetary provision for emergency works, funds tend
to be directed from the maintenance budget to cope with the emergency needs. In the event of
emergencies, the divisional depots regularly undertake repairs to restore the services using the
maintenance pool funds, which significantly drains out the set allocations and overall disrupts
the planried works programs. In some instances, road maintenance funds are expropriated for
other purposes. For example, of the 1997 budget of F$4.5 million allocated for periodic
maintenance, F$2.0 million was used to repair damaged roads hit by Cyclone Gavin, and a
further F$0.5 million allocated for water supply.
11.  In real terms, overall maintenance spending in 1998 was at approximately the same
level as in 1992, although the budget estimates for 1999 show a drop of 15 percent compared
with actual expenditures in 1998. At the same time, expenditure on new construction and
upgrading has increased considerably, and maintenance spending has fallen from about 47
percent of PWD's total expenditure in 1992-1993 to about 30 percent in 1999. In the 1999
budget, provisions have again been made for F$25.0 million for FRUP II & IlIl programs and this
trend is likely to continue for the next 4-5 years with the implementation of the FRUP l1l, despite
the Government's undertaking to give priority to maintenance over new road construction during
periods of reduced ability to pay for maintenance.
12.   The situation is to some extent worse than has been suggested so far. The reductions in
funding have essentially taken place in the routine maintenance component. The actual
expenditures in 1998 were 12 percent less than in 1992 in real terms and are budgeted to be 21



42                        Appendix 7, page 4
percent less in 1999. Still more disturbing is the fact that staff costs have continued to rise
during the period; which has had a major impact on the more essential component, the
purchase of goods and services. Thus, expenditures in this category fell by as much as 38
percent between 1992-1998 and are expected to fall by a further 18 percent in 1999. The result
is that goods and services account for no more than 35 percent of routine maintenance funds
compared with 54 percent of the total in 1992.
13.  It is also clear that the allocation of funds to road maintenance has been consistently
below the optimum level of expenditure. It is estimated by the RMSU that PWD should ideally
spending F$40 million on maintenance in 1999, nearly three times as much as its actual budget:
F$ million
Routine                              17.0
Periodic                             15.5
Contingency                           3.5
Administration                        4.0
Total                                40.0
14.   From this, it can be seen that current levels of spending are significantly below the
required needs. It is estimated that the shortfall is about 40 percent and 70 percent for routine
and periodic maintenance respectively. This is supported further by the study completed under
ADB-financed TA 2747-FIJ: Funding Better Road Maintenance, that the Government was
saving F$17.0 million per annum by underspending on its maintenance works, which increased
costs to road users to F$67.5 million per annum, resulting in an annual net loss to the economy
of F$50.5 million per annum. Taking the inflation into consideration, and given the subsequent
reduction in spending, the annual loss to the economy from inadequate maintenance in 1999 is
now estimated to be more than F$60 million. However, these figures do not take account of the
need to catch up on the backlog of maintenance works to restore the road conditions to deliver
the adequate levels of service.

ROAD SAFETY AND TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT
A.    Introduction
1.    The increasing death toll on the road network of the Fiji Islands was recognized as a
growing problem in the 1980s. The Asian Development Bank, while carrying out the feasibility
study of the proposed Second Fiji Road Upgrading Project (FRUP II) engaged a staff
consultant, road safety specialist in October 1989 to identify and recommend the highest priority
areas of road safety. The consultant identified a number of deficiencies in several sectors
affecting road safety. He recommended the development of an action plan to systematically
address the highest priority areas identified, including additional funds and equipment to cover
the costs of the urgent improvements. Between 1982 to 1991, the number of fatalities on the
roads nearly doubled from 55 in 1982 to 108 in 1991. To address the safety issues, the first
phase of the Fiji Road Safety Action Plan (FRSAP) was developed in 1992 with the assistance
of a road safety adviser recruited under the technical assistance (TA). The priorities of the
FRSAP focused on building institutional capability of various stakeholders in the following areas:
B.    Priority Areas
1.    Accident Data System
2.          The introduction of the Transport Research Laboratory's Microcomputer Accident
Analysis Package (MAAP) has transformed the country's capability to tackle its accident
problem in a systematic and scientific manner. The MAAP system has been instrumental in
providing the necessary information to appropriate agencies for the most effective use of their
respective resources. Data is now available to the Public Works Department (PWD) for the
identification and analysis of hazardous locations on the road network, to the police for planning
appropriate enforcement strategies, and to the National Road Safety Council (NRSC) for it's
road safety education and publicity programs. The Ministries of Education (MOE) and Health
(MOH) have also gained valuable data from the new system to assist with their programs. The
data system has therefore been a critical factor in the success of the road safety program. The
system has addressed the nature and characteristics of the safety problems and appropriate
interventions have been devised to address them accordingly.
2.    National Road Safety Council
3.    As a result of a concerted series of advertising campaigns early on in the FRSAP, NRSC
now enjoys a high public profile and is recognized by all agencies as the central coordinating
body for road safety. This has had the effect of focusing resources and enabled NRSC to use
these resources in the most effective manner by targeting the most at-risk groups of road users,
as determined from the MAAP accident analysis. NRSC has a full program of road safety
education covering both urban and rural areas, and also takes a proactive role in road safety
education in schools. It has been particularly successful in introducing road safety to the
community through its community based road safety officers in generating widespread
awareness of road safety.
3.    Infrastructure Improvements
4.    PWD, through it's Traffic and Road Safety Unit (TARSU) is now much better equipped to
improve road safety and to minimize the construction of unsafe road networks. It has
implemented an extensive series of road safety improvements on the existing road network.



-s                     Appendix 9, Page 2
This has improved isolated accident black spots; hazardous route sections, including
improvement of road sings to international standards; speed reduction measures in villages and
densely populated areas; and the application of mass action treatments at locations with
common problems, e.g., pedestrian and school crossings. The traffic management measures in
towns have also been improved. Before and after studies carried out at a number of the treated
sites have shown significant improvements in terms of road safety and this action plan has,
without doubt, contributed to the overall reduction in road accident casualties achieved over
recent years. TARSU is also responsible for safety audit procedures, and thereby reviews the
designs of new roads prior to construction.
4.    Land Transport Bill (LTB)
5.    The legislation in draft since 1987 was passed by Parliament in October 1998.
Specialist assistance was provided in the drafting of the LTB, which also includes the new traffic
act. The specialist also assisted in drafting the traffic regulations. The LTB amalgamates the
three existing independent statutory authorities comprising: the Principal Licensing Authority,
Central Traffic Authority, and Transport Control Board, into a new Land Transport Authority
(LTA). The creation of LTA is aimed at maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency in carrying
out of its functions. LTA is to be established in late 1999.
5.    Traffic Police Enforcement on National Roads
6.    The provision of patrol vehicles, police traffic enforcement equipment, and specialist
training has significantly enhanced the ability of the police in the area of enforcement. Two
highway patrol vehicles involved in accidents were written off.  The initial results from
breathalyzer and speed reduction exercises have been promising. However, recurring problems
concerning the overseas maintenance and certification of evidential equipment needs to be
addressed by establishing local repair and service to make this equipment readily available.
Successful joint exercises have been held with the Department of Road Transport (DRT) and
resulted in removal of large numbers of unroadworthy and unregistered vehicles, and
prosecution of unlicensed drivers. The revenue collected by the Government in fines and
payments of arrears has been several times more than the total cost of carrying out such
exercises.
6.    Road Safety Education and Publicity
7.    Specialist input under the FRSAP, combined with the active involvement of curriculum
development officers of MOE, has enabled the development and implementation of a
comprehensive program of road safety education, at the primary school level. Outputs from this
program have included a fully resourced ability of MOE to provide a continuing and long-term
input to road safety education. This is of particular significance as the input of resources at this
point is likely to be extremely cost-effective in developing a positive road safety attitude for
future road users. Teacher guides and materials for teaching road safety have been distributed
to all schools, and teachers have been trained to teach road safety to primary school children.
Agreements have been reached with MOE to include road safety as a syllabus for education in
secondary schools.
7.    Driver Training and Testing
8.    Specialist input has provided the basic ground rules and appropriate training for
implementation of an improved standard of driver training and testing. Guidelines and manuals



47                      Appendix 9, Page 3
were produced for the DRT driving examiners. Three staff from DRT were sent Australia and
attached to a sister organization for training. A number of driving instructors and driving
examiners were trained by the specialist to become defensive driving instructors.
8.    Vehicle Roadworthiness
9.    Specialist input has provided DRT staff with inspection manuals, techniques, and
procedures on the inspection of vehicles.  Eight roadside weighing sites were constructed
under the Project to undertake enforcement exercise for vehicle overloading and three sets of
new portable scales were procured. However, enforcement is pending until the promulgation of
the LTB by the minister of transport. DRT has also procured two sets of automated
computerized drive-in/drive-out vehicle inspection equipment. The Northern testing station was
flooded and all electronic gear is out of action and yet to be repaired. The Central testing station
is operational. The equipment has not been used for enforcement due partly to the pending
promulgation of the new traffic act and regulations, and the certification of the equipment by
Weights and Measurement Department.
9.    Emergency Rescue Services
10.   The implementation of the Pilot Ambulance Service materialized only in October 1998
after agreements were reached between MOH and St. John Ambulance of Fiji. An action plan
comprising six phases of services to be provided by the St John Ambulance with budget support
from MOH commenced in June 1998 and is targeted for completion by 30 June 2001. Phase
one, which comprised the services from Suva to Sigatoka, is fully operational and the
implementation of second phase from Suva-Nausori is in progress.
C.   Institutional Areas
1.    Traffic and Road Safety Unit
11.   TARSU, formed at the outset of the FRSAP, provides the main thrust of PWD's input to
road safety improvement works for the road network. In addition to continuous monitoring of the
existing network, TARSU is also responsible for the safety auditing of all PWD's major road
upgrading and new roadwork programs.
12.   TARSU staff have been allocated full-time by PWD to form this entirely new unit and
training has been provided in a continuous hands-on manner throughout the duration of the
FRSAP. In addition to specialist-provided on-the-job training for two years, three TARSU officers
and two other PWD officers have attended a three-month transport and road safety course at
the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. TARSU members have also presented
and/or contributed to conference papers in the People's Republic of China and Thailand, as well
as participating in study tours in Australia and New Zealand.
13.   Currently the members of the unit have a solid grasp of the basics of accident
investigation and the development of remedial measures. These basic skills now need to be
further developed to provide a greater depth of accident analysis through MAAP, exposure to a
broader range of traffic management measures and experience of the monitoring of
implemented schemes and evaluation of their effectiveness. The unit's performance was
hindered by staff turnover. This is to be strengthened further through overseas training under
FRSAP Phase 2.



48                       Appendix 9, Page 4
2.    Police Accident Unit
14.   A specialist unit was established within the Department of Police, with responsibility for
the collection and storage of all road accident data. This unit was also made responsible for
analysis of the data to the extent required for production of the annual police report on accident
statistics. specialist training was provided to the three staff who made up the unit. Excellent
progress was made by this unit in adopting new procedures involved, especially in chasing up
the flow of data from the field, entry of the much larger volume of accident data for the
production of a very professional annual traffic accident report. The unit staff needs further
training in the use of MAAP for accident analysis, particularly in connection with the use of data
for the targeting of enforcement exercises. Staff trained by the specialist has been transferred
to another branch and an early training session will probably be necessary in the next phase.
3.    National Road Safety Council
15.   NRSC, an entirely new body set up under the FRSAP, has been the most successful
component of the FRSAP. In it's two main functions as (i) coordinator of all road safety activity
and (ii) to undertake the major responsiblility for road safety education and publicity. It is largely
responsibile for the much improved accident statistics since its inception in 1994. The greatest
amount of credit for the success of NRSC can be attributed to the NRSC executive director who
has proven to have the correct personal and professional qualities to manage the NRSC. In this
regard, he was greatly assisted by the periodic advice and assistance received especially in the
early years from the expatriate safety specialists working with PWD. On three occasions, the
executive director was recruited by the World Bank to assist the Samoan Government in
drawing up their safety action plan.
16.   NRSC, a statutory body with funding provided largely through a levy on third party
insurance policies, undertook a proactive role since the inception of the FRSAP. With the MAAP
system accident analyses outputs to guide its activities, it has been able to allocate resources
effectively by targeting the most at-risk groups of road users. In addition to multimedia road
safety campaigns using newspapers, radio, and Television, NRSC takes its message out into
the rural areas and to schools via three fully equipped mobile units. NRSC is also responsible
for road safety education at the national level. Under its umbrella, a network of district road
safety councils (DRSC) has been established. The DRSCs supports NRSC in extending its
programs to rural communities.
D.    Equipment
17.   As recommended in the FRSAP, specialized equipment was procured directly financed
by the Government. The equipment was used to promote the safety education program to rural
community, strengthen police, DRT, and St. John Ambulance enforcement. In addition to
financing the equipment, Government financed the construction of the NRSC building. A list of
equipment procured under the FRSAP is provided in the following table:

E.            Conclusions
18.   It is recognized that there are elements of the first stage of the FRSAP, which are not yet
as fully developed as was intended. It is important that these areas of weakness are identified
and an early effort made to strengthen them before the main task of building up and extending
the current level of knowledge and ability.
19.    The areas that require particular attention include the following:
(i)    Accident Data. Accuracy of the accident data and, in particular, use of the
kilometer post system for the location of accidents on rural roads needs to be
addressed. In-depth analysis of accident "black spot" locations and "accidents on
a route" are difficult due to problems in this area. An extensive retraining program
is required; it will need to be extended at the divisional level to establish at least
one corporal or sergeant in each division as the local expert in this area.
(ii)   Infrastructure Improvements. The main problem here is lack of planning and
coordination with the divisional engineers work programs and the poor standards
of construction. The procedures are to be worked out at an early stage with the
divisional engineer's to establish priorities for road safety work, and for input and
supervision by TARSU staff during the construction stage. In particular, the
phasing of construction needs to be agreed to in advance, and adhered to, to
ensure that all appropriate signing and line-marking is provided in advance, or at
the same time   as the physical work involving major changes in traffic
movements.



50                       Appendix 9, Page 6
(iii)   Traffic Police Enforcement. Problems involving maintenance and certification
of evidential equipment needs to be addressed. Local maintenance and
certification capability needs to be established to deter police from frequently
taking equipment overseas for calibration and certification. Although the police
training specialist has provided instructions to take advantage of the MAAP
facilities to plan strategic enforcement exercises, they have not been brought into
practice. In addition, optimum use was not being made of highway patrol facilities
provided under the FRSAP, particularly in relation to the use of vehicles. An
improved recording procedure needs to be implemented and monitored on the
use of highway patrol vehicles.
(iv)   Vehicle roadworthiness. This will require revisiting in view of the new LTA
being established.
(v)    Driver Training and Testing. The main problem here is the lack of monitoring of
driving instructors and driving schools. A monitoring system needs to be
developed for implementation at an early stage of the second phase of the
FRSAP if an acceptable standard of driving instruction is to be achieved. In view
of the importance of driving instruction, this should be given a high priority in the
next phase.
(vi)   Year 2000. Although not a part of the first stage of the FRSAP, Year 2000
compliance is obviously a big issue and can be viewed as a potential weakness
in the MAAP system. It is understood that the Transport Research Laboratory
has already undertaken work in this area and does not see any major problems.
It is critical however, that this issue is faced at a very early point in the next
stage. Not only does the MAAP program have to be capable of dealing with
dates after 1/1/2000, but all existing data, which is based on a two-digit date
system, has to remain useable.
20.   Aside from these, the main conclusion, based on the reduction of fatal and hospitalized
casualties since inception of the TA, is that the FRSAP has been a resounding success. The
success is even more if the accidents are compared with 1991 figures, the year before the
inception of the strategy and the FRSAP were devised. The casualty figures for the period 1990
to 1998 are shown in Table A9.2.

21.   Despite the 13 percent increase in licensed vehicles on the roads since the inception of
the FRSAP, there has been a 28 percent reduction in total casualties, 25 percent reduction in
fatalities, and 7.5 percent reduction in total number of accidents. In early 1996, the traffic police



51                      Appendix 9, Page 7
responsibilities were decentralized and allocated to the divisional police commanders. The fatal
casualties fluctuated between 70-90 between 1992 to 1997 except for 1996. The 1996 peak
fatal casualties were due partly to the reduction in highway patrol on roads in the Western
Division and the patrol vehicles deployed to combat other crimes. At the same time new roads
were opened to traffic in the Western Division without prior attention to an effective driver and
road user education and enforcement program. The situation was reinstated in December 1996
when highway patrol duties were brought under the command of the traffic police at
headquarters; the trends in accidents returned to the downward path.
22.   The main task under the second phase of the FRSAP is to build on the success
achieved to date by consolidating and expanding the institutional capabilities of all stakeholder
agencies. A more consultative process approach will be taken to develop the second phase of
the FRSAP so that the agencies are in a strong position to continue and to generate their own
action plans in future.

ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
A.    Methodology
1.    The main quantifiable project benefits seen at appraisal were to accrue from
reductions in vehicle operating costs (VOC) on the upgraded roads, which would increase
the efficiency of the transport system and thereby assist economic development. The overall
returns of the Project roads as a whole were estimated at 24 percent economic internal rate
of return (EIRR), and the individual road links varied from 17 to 34 percent EIRR, which was
considered satisfactory. Unquantified benefits would accrue from improved road
maintenance practices, improved road safety and traffic management, and control of
overloaded vehicles. Benefits would also arise from training in project and road maintenance
management, and through improved access between markets and agricultural areas, and to
urban and industrial centers.
2.    The economic reevaluation of the upgrading of the project roads has generally
followed the methodology employed for the appraisal, which was based on the Road
Transport Investment Model (RTIM2) developed by the Transport Research Laboratory in the
United Kingdom (U.K.). For the economic reevaluation, the opportunity has been taken to
utilize the results of the FRUP IlIl project appraisals. These were obtained in 1995-1996 by
using the RTIM3 model (which is based closely on RTIM2) and are therefore appropriate for
use in this report. Vehicle Operating Costs (VOCs) are calculated directly by RTIM2 and
RTIM3 according to road type and condition parameters, and the characteristics of vehicles
and unit prices for cost components. The data necessary as input for RTIM2 and RTIM3 can
be grouped into four general categories: traffic projections, road conditions, construction and
maintenance activities, and VOCs.
B.   Traffic Projections
3.    Traffic volumes on the road links included under the project ranged from between 240
and 670 vehicles (veh)lday at appraisal in the rural areas, reflecting the relatively sparse
populations in the areas served. Traffic volumes in and near Suva and Nadi were much
higher, 7,500-23,000 and 6,600-9,400 veh/day respectively, reflecting extensive urban
commuting and commercial movements.
4.    Future growth for normal traffic on the project roads was estimated at appraisal to be
3 percent per annum throughout the evaluation period, based on past trends and other
economic indicators, such as population and income growth and likely economic
development in the areas served by the roads. This standard growth assumption of 3 percent
per year was also applied to all vehicle types in the FRUP IlIl project study. Additional traffic
may be generated or diverted because of cost and time savings on the upgraded roads, and
the FRUP Illi project, for example, provides for an additional 50 percent generated traffic of
cars and light vehicles, and 5 percent for other vehicle types. At appraisal however it was
envisaged that, because no large developments were expected in the influence areas of the
project roads and agricultural growth in the vicinity would only be realized from marginal
increases in yield and cultivated areas, any such increase in traffic should be included within
the normal growth in traffic.
5.    A program of traffic counts was conducted at stations on each of the project roads
every year since appraisal. The counts are, however, only carried out on a one-day 12-hour
period so the data are liable to significant errors. Allowances also have to be made for the
disruptions to traffic caused by the contractors' activities during the construction periods.

6.     The Suva-Nausori corridor is the most heavily trafficked road link in the Fiji Islands. At
appraisal it was estimated to be carrying volumes of 23,000 veh/day at Nabua, 17,000
veh/day at Samabula, and gradually reducing to 7,500 veh/day at the Nausori end. The
economic evaluation was based on an average traffic level of approximately 13,500 veh/day



54                    Appendix 10, Page 3
along the entire 15.7 kilometers (km) route. Subsequently, it appears that the disruptions
caused by construction work may have induced road users to use alternative routes, as
counts during the main construction years (1997 and 1998) are below trend but increase
significantly in 1999, the first year after completion. Disregarding the construction period, the
traffic on the project sections between Princes Road and Rewa has risen from an average of
14,500 veh/day in 1991 to 18,500 veh/day in 1999, or 3.1 percent per annum and virtually
identical to the appraisal projection.
7.    The Cunningham and Khalsa roads are short links providing connections between
Kings Road and Princes Road, which are the two alternative main roads running through the
Suva-Nausori corridor. Traffic growth has been substantial, averaging 5.5 and 15.9 percent
per annum in recent years. Most of this would be diverted traffic but there has also been
residential development adjacent to both roads, and there are firm prospects for more in the
future.
8.   In the Western Division, near the urban areas of Nadi and Lautoka, the traffic
volumes on the main road were between 6,600 and 9,400 veh/day respectively at appraisal.
On the Nadi Back Road, which bypasses Nadi Town for through traffic traveling between
Suva and Nadi Airport/Lautoka, the traffic volume has increased from 1,650 veh/day to about
5,000 veh/day in 1999, which shows that a substantial proportion of the traffic has diverted
from the original route, giving an apparent annual growth rate of 23.4 percent. Toward
Lautoka, the short length of dual carriageway at Lomolomo provides opportunities for
overtaking slow-moving cane trucks, while the Viseisei Bypass, which is realigned away from
a densely populated area, avoids accidents and fatalities in the Viseisei village and has
improved the traffic flow and capacity of the road. The present traffic volume on these two
short stretches is estimated to be between 6,000-7,000 veh/day, with traffic growth of about 4
percent per year.
9.    A large part of the Dama-Navalou section of Kings Road passes through sugarcane
fields; there is potential for tourism development, and it crucially reduces the 'missing link'
section of the northern coastal route to just 50 km of unpaved road, which is encouraging
more through traffic. The traffic volume has risen by about 4.6 percent per annum from about
550 veh/day at appraisal to 870 veh/day in 1998.
10.  In the Northern Division, the Transinsular Road forms a crucial link joining the
Labasa-Nabouwalu Road in the North and to the port of Savusavu in the South. Traffic
volume increased substantially by 10.6 percent per annum from 240 veh/day to about 400
veh/day following the upgrading work. The Nabouwalu and Wainikoro Roads pass through
farmland and respectively provide important links to the ferry port of Nabouwalu (a further 69
km to the west) and to the North Eastern part of the Division. Traffic volumes increased by
about 5 percent per annum on both roads.
11.   DRT statistics indicate that the number of licensed vehicles has increased at an
average rate of about 4 percent per year since 1992 and is provided in Table Al 0.2.
Table A10.2: DRT Statistics
Year       1992      1993     1994      1995     1996      1997      1998

The actual size of the vehicle fleet may be 15-20 percent greater than shown here,
depending on the assumptions made about the number of unlicensed vehicles. The traffic
growth rates generally reflect this increase in vehicle registrations.
12    For the purpose of the economic reevaluation, the following annual growth figures
were used for future normal traffic on the project roads, excluding further diverted traffic
benefits:
% per annum.

Nabouwalu, TIR and Wainikoro              5
These trends were applied to all vehicle classes, with the composition being based, to the
extent, possible on the PWD traffic counts for the year of opening or else on data for other
years. In line with the appraisal procedures, new traffic is assumed to be included in the
estimates for normal traffic. For Viseisei Bypass and Nadi Back Road, the new baseline
traffic includes the traffic diverted from the original roads to the new links.
13.   New road roughness measurements were made by PWD on the project roads in
March/April 1999 using a similar type of test vehicle and Bump Integrator Unit to those used
in the original feasibility study.
C.    Construction and Maintenance Costs
14.   Construction costs are based on the actual costs of the works. The estimated costs
were updated using the analysis data of the FRUP IlIl feasibility report in 1997. For the force
account projects, supervision costs and a nominal 3 percent of construction cost for the
design cost are included. For Nabouwalu Road, costs are based on estimates of the final
quantities and bill rates, excluding issues that are yet to be resolved in the on-going
contractual disputes. The appraisal cost estimates are compared with actual costs in Table
A10.3.

15.   The total cost of the road upgrading component increased by about 45 percent from
F$72.4 million estimated at appraisal to an actual cost of F$105.2 million. All subprojects
except two showed cost increases of 30-40 percent. Khalsa Road had a higher increase of
79 percent, which is not fully explained. The Transinsular Road had a base increase of 41
percent in line with other project roads, but the additional cost of restoration from cyclone
damage raised this to 107 percent for the full cost.
16.   The economic costs of construction used for the reevaluation were derived by
applying the standard conversion factors calculated in the FRUP IlIl update report, and using
the breakdowns from cost statements for force account work and engineer's certificates for
contract work, as provided in Table A10.4.

17.   At appraisal routine and periodic road maintenance requirements were estimated on
the basis of PWD's experience and unit costs were applied; savings under this head are
estimated to account for no more than 2 percent of total project benefits. For this
reevaluation, updated unit rates are applied, based on the information provided in the Special
Study on Operation and Maintenance of Project Facilities and Their Impact on Project
Sustainability.
D.    Traffic Capacity Evaluation
18.   The project feasibility study considered two options for upgrading Kings Road
between Suva-Nausori: the provision of either extra overtaking lanes or a 4-lane
carriageway, plus junction improvements. It was recommended in the study that (i) the road
be upgraded to 4-lanes from Princes Road to Daniva Road (6.1 km) at an estimated cost of
F$11.0 million (1989 prices), including widening of the Samabula Bridge at F$463,000; and



57                     Appendix 10, Page 6
(ii) upgrading of the remaining 9.6 km to Rewa Bridge should be deferred to the next
construction program, when 4-lanes would be justified.
19.   At appraisal, the estimated cost of the 6.1 km 4-lane section was F$17 million,
including contingencies; this was reduced to F$11.05 million by widening to 4-lanes on only
two short sections between Princes-Lakeba Junction and Grantham Junction-Mead Junction
(a total of about 1.6 km), widening to 3-lanes to provide overtaking/climbing lanes and
intersections in other places along the 15.7 km of road; and excluding the Samabula Bridge.
In 1996, the capacity was reviewed again, and it was decided to revert to the original
recommendation of 4-lanes between Princes Road and Daniva Road (6.1 km) to satisfy
capacity requirements for 15 years. The Government undertook to absorb the additional
costs (about F$15 million of the completion cost of F$26.5 million - an increase of 140
percent over appraisal estimates) and to replace the Samabula Bridge with a 4-lane dual
bridge structure (costing F $2.5 million) through annual budget appropriations.
20.   Reevaluation of the links between Nadi-Nadi Airport and Nadi Airport-Lautoka is also
complicated by the redefinition of the schemes during implementation. The sections of these
existing bitumen-surfaced stretches of the Queens Road, respectively 7.8 km and 20.6 km
long, to be upgraded had not been decided at appraisal, although tentatively short
realignments between Nadi-Nadi Airport (2.3 km) and Nadi Airport-Lautoka (1.5 km) were
being examined to shorten distances and avoid population centers. As implemented, the
Nadi-Nadi Airport subproject consisted of extending the existing Nadi Back Road bypass for
2.5 km over the Nadi River to join the Queens Road North of the town. The Nadi Airport-
Lautoka subproject consisted of widening the road to 4-lanes at Lomolomo (1.5 km) and
constructing a new bypass to the village at Viseisei (3.4 km).
21.   The VOCs were estimated at appraisal for four types of vehicles and standard
estimates of typical roughness levels (not directly measured). Savings on a typical road
upgrading varied from 43 to 53 percent according to vehicle class. Benefits from the time
savings for vehicle passengers and loads resulting from the higher speeds attained on
improved roads can be included in the RTIM calculations. This item was omitted at
appraisal, but has been included as an alternative in this reevaluation using the time-costs
per vehicle assumed in the FRUP IlIl feasibility study. It may be noted that the FRUP IlIl
approach is to include passenger time savings in the initial evaluation and then to remove
them as a sensitivity test. Examples of the results obtained for the economic reevaluation
using RTIM3 and five vehicle classes are provided in Table Al 0.5:

22.   The validity of the RTIM model is limited to the evaluation of rural roads carrying
relatively low traffic volumes in free-flow conditions. In the model, traffic speeds are affected
by width only for widths less than 5 m and are not affected by traffic volumes at all. Thus the
model is not directly applicable to evaluating the benefits of increased traffic capacity, which
result in reduced congestion (less speed-change cycles), increased traffic speeds, and
improved safety. The approach adopted for the reevaluation was the same as in the project
feasibility study, i.e., adopting an estimate of VOC savings achieved at various traffic
volume/capacity ratios of the carriageway before and after widening. The capacity increase
from 2-lane to 4-lane undivided has been assumed as a factor of 2.5, as shown in Table
A10.6.

23.   An alternative approach that could estimate speeds and congestion effects directly
would have involved use of the World Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards
Model (HDM), which benefits from considerably more research and field investigations and
has generally supplanted the RTIM for economic evaluations of road upgrading projects
during the 1990s. The HDM-111 model was, for example, used in the report Funding Better
Road Maintenance (TA 2747-FIJ) to estimate user costs under alternative road conditions.
For the purposes of the present exercise, it is important to note that the VOC savings
calculated in this way would be considerably less (e.g., 50-67 percent less) than indicated by
the RTIM, which has significant implications for any comparative analysis of road projects in
the Fiji Islands (Table A10.7). Furthermore, it is recommended that future analyses should

use the international standard for road roughness (International Roughness Index, m/km IRI)
rather than the Bump Integrator (mm/km BI) values used here.

Overall Economic Evaluation
24.   The overall EIRR of the project roads was estimated at appraisal to be 24 percent,
with the EIRRs of individual road links varying between 17-34 percent; this was considered to
be satisfactory given the discount rate of 12 percent used in economic evaluations in the Fiji
Islands.
25.   Since then there have been considerable changes in the basic project data for the
economic evaluation, each has affected the level of costs and benefits accruing to the
Project. The findings are summarized in Table A10.8 as follows:
(i)    The considerable increase in final costs was offset by the longer project period, by
the generally higher than anticipated growth in traffic, and the effect of inflation
reflected in the updated VOC data.
(ii)    There was a general reduction in EIRR for the upgrading of gravel roads to sealed
standard. For the Dama-Navalou Road, the EIRR is now estimated at about 18
percent excluding passenger time savings compared with 26 percent at appraisal,
and 21 percent including time savings. For the Northern Division roads, the EIRRs
have changed little since appraisal: 16-28 percent compared with 17-31 percent,
excluding passenger time savings.
(iii)   For Cunningham  and Khalsa roads, the considerable increases in traffic volumes
have actually led to much higher economic benefits than were originally foreseen;



60                     Appendix 10, Page 9

raising the EIRR from 21 percent at appraisal to 46 percent for Cunningham Road
and 37 percent for Khalsa Road. The inclusion of the passenger time savings
increases the estimated EIRR substantially to 53 percent and 49 percent respectively.
(iv)   For the capacity expansion of the Suva-Nausori Road, the near tripling of costs has
been partially offset by the continuing growth in traffic and updated VOC, but the
overall returns excluding time savings have decreased from 28 percent at appraisal to
15 percent for the Princes Road -Daniva Road section, and 12 percent for the Daniva
Road to Wainibuku section. The inclusion of passenger time savings, which is valid
in this case where traffic flows have been improved, increases the EIRR to about 21
percent and 17 percent respectively.
(v)   For the Nadi Back Road and the Lomolomo Duplication, the new EIRRs are about 11
percent excluding passenger time savings, and 13.5 percent including passenger
time savings. For the Viseisei Bypass, the new EIRRs are 16 and 24 percent with
and without passenger time savings. However, the scope of works again differs
somewhat from the appraisal case.
