ON A PROPOSED CRE)IT TO THE PEQPLE'S DfhOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF  UZROPIA
FOR A FAMILY IEALTH PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE)
for SDR 23.8 million (US$33 ml1lion equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity
and. together with UNICEF co-financing of US$0.5 million. would help finance
a family health project of US$43.86 million.
2.             .  At its current growth rate of 2.9%. Ethiopia's population
of 42 million will double in less than 25 years. In 1984 the crude death
rate was 18 per thousand and the crude birth rate was 47 per thousand. The
contraceptive prevalence rate is now about 2%. The institutional capacity
of the Ministry of Health (MOH) is relatively strong by sub-Saharan African
standards. However, health services, cover only a third of the population,
and are of low quality due to shortages of manpower, drugs. vehicles and
operating funds. Salaries are taking up an increasing proportion of the
recurrent health budget - nearly 70% in 1985/86. Nutrition status is poor
due mainly to poverty and repeated droughts. Foreign aid to the health
sector has been limited primarily to refugee relief. IDA identified the
major sectoral issues in 1985 in a PHN sector review which emphasized that
rapid population growth was a major contributor to poverty and poor health,
and that PDRE should develop multisectoral population policy and program to
reduce fertility. Since then, government has been actively working on the
development of a population policy and will include a chapter on population
policy and programs in the next five-year development plan. 1990-94. IDA's
strategy is to use this first project as an entry-point into both the
population and health subsectors. Regarding population. IDA will be
focusing on the strengthening of family planning (FP) services in the
context of basic health services; and on experimenting with community-based
distribution (CBD) of contraceptives, which will be needed to reach the
majority of the population. Regarding health. the major issues are
management. manpower, finance, and efficiency. This first project.
reinforced by sector work in the area of health financing, is addressing
these questions, and would hopefully be followed by assistance to
pharmaceutical formulation and consolidation of hospital services. The
project would also help develop implementation capabilities within MOH so as
to attract additional external assistance. In nutrition, IDA's main
contribution is likely to be in raising agricultural incomes through
agricultural policy improvements and related lending, although some
nutrition interventions form part of the health delivery package under the
proposed project.
3. Project Objectives. The project has three objectives: (i) to increase
the quality. coverage and cost-effectiveness of maternal and child health
(MCH) services; (ii) to increase the availability and use of FP services;
and (iii) to strengthen the institutional capacity of the MOH. The project
focuses on MCH services as the health interventions which will have the
maximum impact on the high mortality rates in Ethiopia. and as an
appropriate vehicle for the expansion of FP services.



-2-
4. Project Description. The proposed project has six components which
would address the above objectives by: (i) strengthening of the MCH/EP
services in the Shewa regions, through rehabilitation of facilities, and
provision of transport and equipment; (ii) improving the quality of health
managerial and paramedical staff, through rehabilitation of selected
training schools. and development of in-service training; (iii)
strengthening of the national pharmaceutical system through better supply
and demand forecasting; increasing the efficiency of the existing drug
manufacturing plant; and improving quality control, storage and
distribution; tiv) strengthening of the national health education (HE)
system through development of an overall strategy integrating the work of
different institutions; and development of a central capacity to manage and
evaluate health education. and produce materials and messages; (v)
institutional development through strengthening of key departments in MOH
including the architectural unit, the management information unit, the
procurement unit, and the MCH unit;and establishment of a new unit for
building. vehicle and equipment maintenance; (vi) a studies component
4onsisting of a review of options for the hospital sector, health finAncing
and organization and management issues of the MOH. The project, to bte
disbursed over nine years, provides funds for civil works; vehicles.
furniture and equipment; training. and limited technical assistance; and
incremental operating costs. IDA would finance incremental recurrent costs
on a declining basis. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$43.86 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$20.80
million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements. and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in
Ethiopia are given in Schedules C and D. respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report. No. 6742-ET dated May 12. 1988. is also attached.
5.   Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project is the first step
in the development of (a) a nation-wide PP program, whose success will
critically determine future living standards, and (b) a health sector
improvement program emphasizing prir-ary health care. quality and efficiency
of hospital services. and the generation of additional sources of health
revenue. Investment in FP is central to IDA's country strategy, in that
rapid population growth can negate the benefits, in per capita terms, of IDA
investment in other sectors. IDA efforts to develop the institutions, human
resources and financial base of the health sector over the medium and long-
term fill a gap left by other agencies. whose aid has mainly had a
short-term, emergency focus.
6.  Agreed Actions. During negotiations. Government agreed to exchange
views with IDA on its population policies. health financing alternatives,
measures to increase the non-salary expenditure for the health sector in the
Shewa regions, and on the measures it has introduced to improve the
effectiveness of community health workers, and other innovations such as
maternity villages. Government also agreed to carry out the project
according to an Action Plan focusing on site acquisition and architectural
services, staffing. and staff training for the health training schools.
Government also provided assurances on (a) the pace at which it would
experiment with delivery of contraceptives by community health workers in
the Shewa regions. (b) the training of adequate numbers of personnel. (c)



-3-
annual submission to IDA of project implementation plans and budgets. and
(d) the arrangements for project implementation and for mid-term evaluation.
Conditions of effectiveness for the proposed credit are the establishment of
a Health Education Department and a Pharmaceutical and Medical Supfly
Control Department within MOH. of a health education coordination committee.
and submission to IDA of a detailed implementation plan and budget for the
first year of project implementation.
7.   Justification.  About 55% of the population in the Shewa regions would
benefit directly from the project as a result of improvements in the
availability of MCH/FP services.  Wider acceptance of family planning (up
from 2 to 17% of eligible couples) would reduce fertility as well as infant
and maternal mortality. At the national level. benefits from the project
would include:  strengthened MOH capabilities in management of health
se-vices; improved procurement, distribution and quality control systems for
pharmaceuticals; development of new health education, informat-:n and
communication materials; establishment of a national capacity for manpower
planning. for post basic and management training. and for the planning and
evaluation of health training. The project would also indirectly benefit
regions other than Shewa when various innovations. developed and tested in
the area component, are applied in other parts of the country.
8.   Risks.  Possible riAis include the adequacy of implementation capacity
in MOH; the cultural acceptability of family planning; the low retention
rates of community health workers; and the adequacy of Government funding of
recurrent costs to implement and sustain the project. To minimize the first
risk, responsibility for implementing components of the project is divided
among different MOH departments, whose management capacity will be
strengthened through provision of technical assistance and training; a
project coordinating committee and one full time project coordinator would
integrate implementation of the different components. The second risk would
be addressed through production of health information and education messages
designed to promote the appropriateness of FP in the Ethiopian
cultural/economic context. To minimize the third risk the motivation of
community workers would be increased through better selection, training.
support and supervision. The fourth risk is being addressed through IDA's
dialogue with the Government on the development of new sources of health
financing. and related conditionality.
9.   Recoamendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
