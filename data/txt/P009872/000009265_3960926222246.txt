MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA FOR THE
TAMIL NADU URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to India in the amount of SDR 216.5 million (US$300.2 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with a 35 year maturity. It would help finance an urban
development project in the ten largest citiea of the state of Tamil Nadu.
2.      Background.  Tamil Nadu, with 48 million people, is among India's
most populous, densely populated (372 persons/km2) and urbanized States
(32%). Over half (54%) of the urban population is concentrated in 10 urban
areas. The population of these areas is growing at an average rate of 2.9%
per year, compared to the state average of 1.6%. Tamil Nadu is also one of
the poorest states, with a per capita income of US$160, well below the
national average. Demands for urban infrastructure and services and for
serviced land are growing rapidly but their provision and management are
inadequate, especially for the poor. Until recently, most housing units
developed by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board were beyond the reach of low income
households. In addition, the provisions for water supply and sanitation,
drainage, roads and solid waste collection do not meet even minimum
standards. In major cities, only about 55% of the population have public
water supply, and service levels are well below minimum levels of 90 and 30
litres per capita per day for house connections and standpipe supply.
Sewerage systems are less developed than water supply, with only about 23% of
the population having house connections and the rest depending on bucket
latrines, cesspit systems and public waterways and open spaces, which are a
threat to public health. Institutional arrangements and service conditions
in smaller cities are generally worse than in larger cities due to con-
straints on state and municipal management and investment resources.  In
addition, buses, the principal mode of urban transport, are extremely over-
crowded in Madras due to inadequate funds for fleet investment, as well as
road congestion and routing and scheduling inefficiencies.
3.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project would be the
fifth Bank Group-assisted project in the urban and water sectors in Tamil
Nadu. In general, physical execution of the projects and the meeting of
financial targets has taken longer than planned. Overall, however, the
projects have had a major impact on urban sector policies and have helped to
introduce replicable approaches to sites and services, slum improvement,
urban transport and other municipal services. The design of the proposed
project takes account of the lessons from the previous ones and has a number
of special features. First, it would have a major impact on the poor, by
making affordable and environmentally acceptable shelter available to about
580,000 people. Second, the project would continue recent efforts in India
to finance an urban program oriented toward all of the major cities in a
state, rather than just a single city. Third, the project would be the Bank
Group's first attempt in India to assist in developing financial inter-
mediaries which could coordinate urban sector investments over time. Fourth,
the project would place a major emphasis on increasing the efficiency of



-2-
existing investments, cost recovery, the self-financing of key activities,
and the operation along commercial lines of public sector enterprises.
Lastly, it would promote private sector involvement in shelter development
and a further rationalization of the roles of the public and private sectors
in urban activities. In the above ways, it will support the urban strategy
of India and Tamil Nadu and is consistent with the urban development strategy
of the Bank Group.
4.      Project Objectives.  The project would have three main objectives and
it would promote the realization of those objectives in the 10 largest cities
of Tamil Nadu. On the institutional side, the project would strengthen the
functioning of institutions involved with the programming and delivery of
urban services and the implementation of urban investments. In terms of
shelter, the project would aim at helping to improve the supply of legal and
environmentally-acceptable serviced land, especially for the poor, and stem
the growth of slums. Lastly, the project would help improve the efficiency
of the urban transportation system.
5.      Project Description.  The project would include the components noted
below.   a) Institutional.  The project would establish a new Municipal
Urban Development Fund to finance equipment and civil works and maintenance
and delivery of services provided by municipal governments. It would also
support the provision of technical assistance, training and related equipment
for the project coordinating and implementing agencies. These investments
should improve the Government of Tamil Nadu's capacity for efficient manage-
ment of urban development by: strengthening state-level urban financial and
functional intermediaries; substantially increasing municipal capacity for
urban management and investment programming and raising revenues for
services; and streamlining procurement and implementation powers.
(b) Shelter. The project would finance the construction of serviced
residential plots, core housing and community facilities and provision of
shelter loans for about 70,000 low-income households. It would also support
Guided Development--the public purchase of about 6,000 serviced plots from
private developers for resale with plot and home expansion loans to low
income families, and the provision of off-site infra-structure and community
facilities. It would assist slum improvement through the construction of on-
and off-site infrastructure and the provision of tenure and community
facilities to improve neighborhoods containing about 94,000 households on
public and private land. (c) Traffic Management and Transport. The project
would improve the identification and execution of cost-effective urban traf-
fic management schemes and provide highest priority to the movement of public
transport and people. Toward these aims, it would finance the construction
and improvement of roads, bridges, traffic signals and pedestrian facilities.
It would a1so support the Pallavan Transport Corporation's investment program
for Madras by financing procurement of about 1,000 buses and related civil
works and equipment, including depots, terminals, a major workshop and pas-
senger shelters. In addition, a Bus Fare Expert Committee has been estab-
lished to strengthen the mechanisms for revising bus fares and enhancing the
accountability and financial viability of the bus company. The project, to
be carried out over 7.5 years, provides funds for civil works, materials and
equipment, Home Expansion Loans, serviced Guided Development Plots, technical
assistance and training and the recurring costs of the Project Management
Group. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$443.7 million



-3-
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$23.4 million (5.3%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedule
C and D, respectively. Two maps (IBRD Map Nos. 20554 and 20555) are also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7152-IN dated May 18, 1988 is
being distributed separately.
6.      Agreed Actions.  In conjunction with the preparation of the proposed
project, the State of Tamil Nadu has created a state-level projec-t management
group; strengthened the staff of implementing agencies; created an Empowered
Committee and Bus Fare Expert Committee to expedite project implementation;
established the Municipal Urban Development Fund; approved property revalua-
tions in all municipalities to substantially increase property tax revenues;
and, increased to adequate levels the collections of plot charges from
households in improved slum neighborhoods. The Government of Tamil Nadu
agreed during negotiations that terms and conditions of lending to
municipalities by the Municipal Urban Development Fund would be acceptable to
IDA; sites and services schemes would be implemented only on sites which are
satisfactory to IDA; plans, layouts, engineering designs and standards and
development and building regulations applied in shelter schemes would be
acceptable to IDA; for all shelter schemes, all chargeable costs and terms
and conditions of leases and home improvement loans and beneficiary selection
procedures would be satisfactory to IDA; and, the Pallavan Transport Company
would maintain an average operating ratio of 0.98 and fund 20% of its invest-
ment program from internal cash generation. The Government of Tamil Nadu
would also carry out-the project in accordance with an Operational Action
Plan agreed during negotiations.
7.      Benefits.  On the institutional side, the project would spread state-
wide the more efficient and equitable urban development policies which have
previously been tested in Madras. It would also strengthen key agencies
throughout the state of Tamil Nadu which are involved in managing urban
development and help to create a new, self-sustaining Municipal Urban
Development Fund. The shelter component of the project would benefit about
880,000 people, mostly from poor families, through the provision of affor-
dable housing. In addition, it would help to arrest the growth in the
absolute number of families living in slums in the largest cities in Tamil
Nadu and help to reduce the cost of public and private supply of shelter
which can be purchased by the lower income groups. The transport component
would strengthen the efficiency of the existing urban transport system and of
public bus transport services. Overall, the project would also have a very
positive impact on the environment through slum improvement and the provision
of housing and related water and sanitation of an acceptable standard.
Without the project, the ten largest cities in Tamil Nadu would not be able
to adopt as rapidly urban development policies that encourage equity and
efficiency. The standards for financial performance of municipalities would
also be slower to improve.
8.      Risks.  The project faces four main risks.  The first concerns the
capacity of the agencies involved with project implementation to manage a
multi-component project in a number of cities and a new financial



-4-
intermediary. Offset against this risk is the successful experience of the
project implementing agencies under earlier IDA-funded projects, the early
establishment of project management institutions, and the development of
agreed criteria for managing the Municipal Urban Development Fund. Secondly,
there has also been souse difficulty in implementing cost recovery policies on
schedule and in making sound projections of the costs and revenues of key
project entities. In the shelter and bus transport components, the use of
conservative assumptions regarding revenues and costs and the establishment
of a new institution for revising bus fares on a systematic basis will help
to mitigate against this risk. Third, there could also be unforeseen
obstacles to implementing new shelter initiatives involving the private
sector. To reduce this risk, early contacts were initiated with private
parties, from whom favorable reactions have been obtained. Finally, many
urban projects have faced delays in acquiring land for sites and services
programs. In this case, however, 67% of the land for the sites and services
component has already been acquired.
9.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

1j IDA Credit amounts for SDR-denominated Credits are expressed in terms of their
US dollar equivalents, as established at the time of Credit negotiations and as
subsequently presented to the Board.
V   Undisbursed amounts for SDR-denominated IDA Credits are derived from cumulative
disbursements converted to their US dollar equivalents at the SDR/US dollar exchange
rate in effect on March 31, 1988, while original principal is based on the exchange
rate in effect at negotiations. This accounts for the fact that in some cases, the
undisbursed balance as shown in US$ equivalent is higher than the original principal.
