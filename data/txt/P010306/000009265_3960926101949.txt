MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAX DEVELOPKENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A THIRD TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (PANCHESWAR) PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to-the Kingdom of Nepal for SDR 10.6 million
(US$14.4 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help
finance a Third Technical Assistance (Pancheswar) Project. The Federal
Republic of Germany (FRG) through KfW would provide parallel cofinancing in
a grant totalling US$5.3 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  Nepal's hydroelectric potential has been estimated at
about 83,000 MW, of which about 25,000 MW have been investigated at
different level.s of detail and only 160 MW developed thus far. His
Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMG/N) and IDA view the exploitation of this
enormous resource as one of Nepal's most important economic priorities, and
the Power Subsector Review (Report No. 6879a-NEP dated January 15, 1988)
outlined a subsector development strategy and identified key studies, some
of which are to be supported through the proposed project. Efficient
development of the subsector would reduce the cost and improve the
availability of power to the domestic market for development purposes and
induce a shift away from fuelwooJ use. It would also enable the export of
power to India, which represents Nepal's most attractive long-term foreign
exchange-earning option. The prospects for implementing a hydropower-led
export strategy are particularly good in view of the Government of
India's (GOI's) estimates of India's load growth, which indicate the need
for an addition of more than 5,000 MW capacity per annum in the foreseeable
future, and economies of scale that can be realized by the development of
Nepalese projects in the 2,000 MW-plus range.
3.       Pancheswar Multipurese Project.  GOI, accordingly, has supported
the principle of joint investigation of sites in Nepal which appear
suitable for long-term development (after 2005) as regional power schemes,
and IDA is currently financing feasibility studies under the Karnali
Preparation Project Phase I (Cr. 1452-NEP) for a project on the Ka-nali
River which could have a total generation capacity of about 16,000 MW. The
proposed project's major component would assist HMG/N in conducting field
investigations of another large-scale scheme, the Pancheswstr Multipurpose
Project, on the Mahakali River bordering India and Western Nepal, which has
an estimated capacity of 2,000-3,000 MW, an estimated cost of about US$2
billion and a prospective commissioning date of 2010 (see map). India and
Nepal established a Joint Group of Experts (JGE) to oversee the studies of
the Pancheswar site. The two governments agreed in early 1984 that each
country would undertake field investigations on its own side of the river
as the basis for a subsequent project feasibility study; this credit would
enable HMG/N to fulfill its obligations.
4.       The project would also include studies related to the medium-term
development of the power subsector. In March 1987, HMG/N, supported by IDA
technical assistance funds and with the assistance of consultants,
completed a least-cost generation expansion plan (LCGEP) for 1986-2005.



- 2 -
This determined that the next addition of generating capacity should be the
402 MW Arun-3 Hydropower Project, for which a feasibility study has been
completed. Arun-3 would cater to internal power demand until 2005; it also
could enable Nepal to develop a bulk export market for electricity in
India. In this case, project implementation could be accelerated to
accommodate any economically beneficial export sales agreement. The
proposed credit would finance the consultancy services required for the
detailed engineering of the Arun.-3 project as well as other studies related
to its preparation. It would also finance a number of ancillary studies
necessary for the medium-term strengthening of the power subsector,
especially the institutional capacity of the Nepal Electricity Authority
(NEA), identified in the Power Subsector Report (PSR).
5.       The Arun-3 hydroelectric power project involves international
water rights issues. This project would use the water of the Arun River,
an international inland waterway that originates in Tibet, People's
Republic of China, and flows through Nepal to India. With regard to the
immediate downstream riparian, India, Nepal's right to use the water of the
Aren River is covered by an agreement between the Government of India and
HMG/N on the Kohsi Project dated April 25, 1954, as amended on December 19,
1966, which does not require formal notification regarding the project
component. The Government of China (GOC), the upstream riparian, raised no
objections in response to IDA's indication that it was considering
supporting development of the proposed Arun-3 Hyrdoelectric Project.
Although the field investigations of the proposed Pancheswar Multipurpose
Project would not involve any use or alteration of the flow regimes in the
border river, IDA has, nonetheless, notified (October 26, 1984) GOI of its
interest in supporting the investigations.
6.       In addition to supporting assistance to the power subsector, the
proposed project would extend IDA support to meet Nepal's need for studies
of priority investments in other infrastructure sectors begun under the
First and Second Technical Assistanice (TA) Projects (Crs. 659-NEP and
1379-NEP for US$3.0 and US$6.0 million equivalent, respectively). TA 1,
approved in 1976, primarily sc.pported the preparation of projects
subsequently financed by IDA, plus cartographic surveys; it is now fully
disbursed. TA 2 was approved in 1983 and is now fully committed. The
credits have been useful vehicles for identifying and preparing priority
projects in power and irrigation such as the Arun-3 Hydroelectric Project
and the Sunsari Morang Irrigation II Project (Cr. 1814-NEP). The proposed
credit includes US$5.0 million for assistance to be defined in detail by
December 31, 1989; this will, be used primarily to finance studies of high
priority subprojects in the agriculture, irrigation, power and other
infrastructure subsectors. These would assist HMG/N to address the
fundamental agricultural issue of poor productivity in the food grain are.-
by optimizing the development of irrigation. The studies would focus on
potential new irrigation schemes, improvement of existing projects and
issues, policies, technologies and institutional strengthening needed for
efficient irrigation development. Each study would be subject to prior
review and agreement by IDA.
7.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  HMG/N sought IDA's support for the
proposed project because of its experience in the power subsector and its
capacity as a multilateral agency to ensure the adequacy of technical
investigations and to coordinate donor support. The Pancheswar preparation
component would support IDA's strategy of promoting Nepalese power exports
and acting as a catalyst for and coordinator of external financing for



-3-
power development. IDA's participation would also be consistent with its
promotion of least-cost power development in India. Mobilizing the funds
required to develop schemes such as Pancheswar or Karnali constitutes a
major challenge, the success of which would depend on the production of
technically sound, objective studies. The Nepalese and Indian governments
view IDA's participation in the preparation, financing and construction of
such projects as helpful to bilateral cooperation and as a means of
ensuring that both parties' interests are adequately taken into account.
Also, the recently completed LCGEP and PSR identified a number of studies
necessary for the implementation of the medium-term power expansion plan.
Studies are also necessary to formulate an institutional development plan
for NEA to prepare the organization to cope with the increased
responsibilities that will result from the implementation of the expansion
plan which is estimated to account for approximately 20% of HKG/N's
investment program over the next 10 years. IDA's support for the proposed
studies would facilitate their timely execution and provide an opportunity
to strengthen IDA's dialogue with HMG/N on its sector development strategy.
Finally, the inclusion of a component oriented towards irrigated
agriculture studies is justified in view of HMG/N's emphasis in its Seventh
Development Plan on food production and its recently announced basic needs
initiative.
8.       Proiect Objectlyes.  The proposed project is designed to support
HMG/N's development strategy through: (a) assisting the Government to
secure the least-C. c supply of electricity for both domestic needs and
exports by financing preparation of specific priority projects; and (b)
financing high priority studies in agriculture, irrigation, power and other
infrastructure sectors.
9.       Prolect Description.  The project would provide the technical
assistance, equipment and exploratory works required for: (a) the
engineering, socio-economic, resettlement and environmental field
investigations on the Nepalese side of the border for the Pancheswar
Multipurpose Project; (b) detailed engineering for the Arun-3 Hydroelectric
Project and a resettlement and rehabilitation plan for the population
affected by the project; (c) study of evacuation of power from Arun-3,
including the technical aspects of Interconnection with India and detailed
engineering for the recommended facilities; (d) a 10-year master plan for
transmission and distribution of electricity in Nepal; (e) a long-run
marginal cost study and a plan to gradually adjust tariff structures and
levels to reflect the economic costs of supply; (f) the preparation of a
corporate consolidation and development plan for the Nepal Electricity
Authority (NEA); (g) the preparation of a strategy and ten-year plan for
rural electrification; and (h) other high priority studies or technical
assis:ance in agriculture, irrigation, power and other infrastructure
subsectors.
10.      The proposed project, to be carried out over 4 years, provides
funds for civil works, equipment, vehicles, materials and consultant
services. The project's total cost is estimated at US$21.9 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$16.8 million (77%). A
breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Nepal are shown in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The detailed engineering for
the Arun-3 Hydroelectric Project will be supported by the FRG under



parallel financing (estimated at US$5.3 million equivalent). A Staff
Appraisal Report has not been prepared; however, a technical annex is
attached as Schedule E.
11.      Agreed Actions.  HMG/N has agreed to the following:
(a) submission to IDA by December 31, 1989, of TORs for the studies and
technical assistance mentioned in para. 9(h); (b) informing the JGE of the
technical aspects of the work for Pancheswar to ensure that the studies to
be carried out in Nepal are consistent in nature and scope with
investigations already done by GOI; (c) TORs for all power-related studies
financed by IDA, a draft letter of invitation (including evaluation
criteria) for consultant selection and a schedule to expedite consultant
recruitment; (d) exchange views with IDA on the TORs and the short list of
consultants for the Arun-3 detailed engineering studies; and (e) provision
by NEA of appropriate counterpart staff and adequate administrative,
budgetary and logistical support for each of the studies. HMG/N and IDA
also agreed on short lists of consultants for: (a) the ten-year master plan
for transmission and distribution; (b) the study for power evacuation from
Arun-3; (c) the long-run marginal cost and tariff study; and (d) the rural
electrification plan. The selection of these consultants, the consultants
for NEA's institutional development plan, and the effectiveness of the
agreement for the FRG parallel cofinanctizg would be conditions of Credit
effectiveness.
12.      Benefits.  The field investigations for Pancheswar are justified
by findings from the reconnaissance work conducted by GOI, which indicate
the project's potential as a low-cost multipurpose hydropower facility.
The proposed investigations of the Pancheswar project are necessary to
develop the framework for a full feasibility study. Similarly the LCGEP
and the feasibility studies for the Arun-3 project indicate that unless
preparation of this project's final engineering is begun in mid-1988, Nepal
would experience power shortages after 1995. The proposed studies are
necessary to complement the LCGEP and to implement the recommendations of
the Power Subsector Review and would be building blocks for an integrated
strategy fur medium-term power sector development in Nepal. The
infrastructure studies, particularly for the agriculture sector, would
improve HMG/N's planning of sectoral investments in infrastructure to meet
key strategic targets.
13.      Risks.  The risk that the project would start slowly due to delays
in the selection of consultants has been minimized by agreements (a) and
(c) in para.11. The rationale and TOR for the studies have been reviewed
thoroughly and the counterpart arrangements agreed in detail to ensure that
effective uba will be made of the assistance to be provided.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

THIRD TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (PANCHESWAR) PROJECT
Technical Annex
A. Project Setting
1.       IDA has been supporting power subsector investments in Nepal since
1976, through the financing of Phase I of the Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project
(2x30 MW) commissloned in 1982 and the Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Project
(3x23 MW) which is presently under construction. IDA is also financing a
feasibility study for the Karnali Multipurpose Project (16,000 MW) in Western
Nepal, the main objective of which would be the long-term bulk export of
electricity to India beginning no earlier than 2005. The latest load forecast
prepared by HKMGN with the assistance of consultants in early 1987 indicates
that additional generating capacity would be required in 1995-96 to avoid power
shortages within Nepal. Furthermore, the development strategy of His Majesty's
Government of Nepal (HKG/N) is keyed to the optimal exploitation of its enormous
hydroelectric potential (83,000 MW) to meet both internal needs and export
requirements.
2.       Aware of these needs and opportunities, in early 1986 HMG/N asked IDA
to continue supporting the expansion of the power sector, particularly the
Government's efforts to formulate an export-oriented strategy. IDA financed the
consultancy services for the preparation of a least cost generation expansion
plan (LCGEP) for 1986-2005 to determine the most economical next capacity
addition to the system. In addition, IDA recently prepared a Power Subsector
Review (PSR) (Report No. 6879a-NEP dated January 15, 1988), which identified the
main factors constraining sector development. The proposed Third Technical
Assistance (Pancheswar) Project would provide assistance to HMG/N for carrying
out a number of studies for the power subsector identified in the LCGEP and PSR.
These studies are essential to implement a rational medium-term (1988-2005)
subsector development strategy. They would assist in the formulation of the
strategy for export of electricity, advance the engineering for the Arun-3
hydroelectric project (the next least-cost capacity addition to the system),
facilitate the institutional development of the Nepal Electricity Authority
(NEA), establish a strategy for the economic pricing of electricity and
mobilizing resources for the development of the power subsector, and advance the
studies of the export-oriented Pancheswar Multipurpose Project located on
Nepal s western border with India.
3.       Nepal's economy is largely dependent on agriculture, which contributes
about 60 percent of GDP, 75 percent of exports and 90 percent of employment.
The fundamental issue in the agriculture sector is poor productivity in the
foodgrain areas, which account for 70 percent of cultivated land and where
output is increasingly unable to support the country's rapidly growing
population. Over the past ten years the stagnation in foodgrain production (1%
increase per annum) relative to population growth (2.7% per annum) has resulted
in a decline in per capita food availability and exportable food surpluses.
IDA's review of Nepal's Seventh Plan and its 1985 Country Economic Memorandum



Schedule E
_-12 -                            Page 2 of 7
endorsed the paramount importance accorded by HMC/N to r;-,ing the yields of
foodcrops. Nepal, however, has abundant water resources but relatively little
good agricultural land, mainly in the Terai which is well-suited to irrigation.
Development of more efficient irrigation is therefore essential to optimize
production from the limited land base, meet basic food needs and raise incomes.
The proposed project would also include US$5.0 million to enable HMG/N to
undertake studies that would inter-alia focus on potential new irrigation
projects, improvement of existing projects and issues, policies, technologies,
and institutional strengthening needed for efficient, cost effective irrigation
development. These would include watershed assessment and
rehabilitation/protection as a component in the country's irrigation development
strategy. This project component could also be used in financing high priority
studies in power and other infrastructure subsectors.
B. Detailed Proiect DescriDtion
4.       The proposed project's components are discussed in this section.
Except for the Pancheswar component, terms of reference for the power-related
components are available in the project file and have been agreed with the
Government during negotiations. It is expected that the TOR for the Pancheswar
component will be agreed shortly, pending a review by HMG/N of available
information on the Indian side of the project site recently provided by the
Government of India.
Field Investigations for Pancheswar
S.       The Pancheswar Multipurpose Project would be located on the Mahakali
River which forms the western border of Nepal with India. The project was
initially studied at reconaissance level by Water and Power Development
Consultancy Services (WAPCO) under the Indian Government's auspices. The
studies indicated the possibility of developing a hydropower facility of 2,000-
3,000 MW capacity. The project might also yield additional benefits in
irrigation and river regulation. India and Nepal have agreed to continue
studies jointly for this project. The two governments have in particular agreed
that they will conduct, in their respective territories, the field
investigations to collect basic information necessary for a subsequent
feasibility study. India has fulfilled its obligation but Nepal has not because
of financial constraints.
6.       The field investigation for Pancheswar would include:  (a) review of
the existing data and information on the project site that would cover inter
alia geology, seismology, surveying and mapping, hydrology and sediments,
environmental impacts, resettlement issues, construction materials and soil
classes; (b) preparation of a plan to update and gather additional information
as needed for the subsequent feasibility study; and (c) implementation of the
plan through undertaking activities such as topographic mapping, hydrological
and sedimentology studies, geological and geophysical investigations, a
geomorphological study of the reservoir area, a construction material survey, a
geotechnical study and a socio-economic and environmental impact study. The



- 13 -Scdule
Page 3 of 7
proposed credit would finance the consultancy services, equipment and
exploratory works. It is estimated that this task would require about 70 staff-
months of consultants over a period of about 20 months.
Detailed Engineering for Arun-3
7.       According to the LCGEP the Arun-3 Hydroelectric project is the next
least-cost addition to the generation system. The feasibility study for this
project was completed in June 1987.  To commission the project in 1995-96 as
required, preparation of detailed engineering for the project needs to start in
mid-1988. This would include: (a) carrying out of the necessary confirmatory
field investigations for the detailed design; (b) preparation of bidding
drawings and documents; (c) development of a resettlement and rehabilitation
plan for the population affected by the project; and (d) the preparation of
quantities, cost estimates and a detailed implementation schedule for the
project. The consultancy input for this component is estimated at about 200
staff-months over a period of about 20 months.
Power Evacuation from Arun-3
8.       This study is required to determine the optimum power evacuation
facilities to transmit the generation of Arun-3 into Nepal's system and to
export the surpluses to India. It includes: (i) an analysis of the operation
mode for the Nepali and Indian systems (synchronous, isolated, dedicated units
and lines or back-to-back links); (ii) the possible interconnection routes and
voltages; (iii) the preparation of detailed engineering for the resulting
facilities; and (iv) the analytical studies including load flow, short circuit
and stability analysis. About 30 staff-months would be required to carry out
this study over a period of 15 months.
Ten-Year Master Plan for Transmission and Distributi
9.       The plan would determine the manner in which Nepal's high tension
transmission system would evolve after the commissioning of the Marsyangdi and
Arun-3 projects, in light of the LCGEP. The plan would also identify the
investments in transmission and distribution needed to minimize electricity
losses and extend service to new consumers at least cost. The plan would
identify the priority investments, their costs and sequence of implementation.
The consultants would also propose planning criteria and design standards for
distribution systems in Nepal. The estimated consultancy effort for this
component is 50 staff-months spread over 18 months.
Long-Run Marginal Cost and Tariff Study
10.      At present, NEA's average revenue per kWh is estimated to be 35% of
long-run marginal cost. The purpose of this study would be to determine the
economic cost of supply of electricity to different kinds of consumers. In
addition, the study would propose modifications to the existing tariffs to
reflect the economic costs of supply, meet HMG/N's social objectives and satisfy
NEA's financial requirements. The consultants would propose a realistic



_ 14 -                            Schedule E
Page 4 of 7
schedule of adjustments to achieve the proposed tariff structure and leiel
gradually. This study would require about 25 staff-months over a period of
12 months.
Corporate Consolidation and Development Plan for NEA
11.      NEA was created in August 1985 by amalgamating the Electricity
Department, the Nepal Electricity Corporation and other minor electricity
related organizations in Nepal. Despite HKG/N's efforts, NEA has not yet fully
succeeded in integrating staff and practices from diverse agencies into a
coherent institutional body. Furthermore, NEA needs assistance to establish
itself as an autonomous commercially-oriented organization with a clear
corporate development plan compatible with the increased responsibilities it has
to assume in the coming decade. The proposed credit would provide assistance
to: (a) streamline managerial policies and procedures; and (b) prepare a
corporate development plan. Moreover, the proposed credit would also provide
funding for assistance during the initial two years of implementation of the
corporate development plan. These tasks are expected to be achieved by NEA
entering into a "twinning" arrangement with a suitable utility. The amount of
consultancy input for this component would be about 100 staff-months over a
period of 36 months.
Ten-Year Rural Electrification Strategy and Plan
12.      At present, HMG/N does not have a clear strategy for rural
electrification in Nepal. This study would establish the broad criteria for
supplying electricity to the rural areas of Nepal. It would also formulate a
methodology to determine under which conditions electricity supply, either from
the main grid or from local sources, is more economical than other types of
energy. Based on such a methodology, the study would propose a ten-year rural
electrification plan and identify investment priorities with particular emphasis
on the detailed plan for the initial five years. The plan would propose annual
investment targets in accord with the funds available to the program and
identify the specific projects. The plan should also recommend a policy for
private sector participation, propose general service quality criteria and
design standards for the rural service and recommend cost recovery principles in
accord with the cost of supply and consumers' capacity to pay. The preparation
of this plan would require about 36 staff-months spread over approximately
18 months.
High Priority Infrastructure Studies
13.      Low agricultural productivity, particularly in food grains, is a
fundamental problem facing Nepal. In contrast to other Asian countries, per
capita food production in Nepal has fallen over the last two decades. To
reverse this decline, HMG/N's new Basic Needs Program gives a high priority to
increasing food producticn, especially through expansion of irrigation. The
proposed credit includes US$5.0 million to finance studies of high priority
infrastructure projects, primarily irrigation. The studies would focus on
potential new irrigation schemes, upgrading of existing schemes, and issues,
policies, technologies and institutional strengthening needed for more efficient



Schedul E
-15-                               Page 5 of 7
irrigation development. Assistance to be provided would be defined in detail by
December 31, 1989. Each study proposed would be of high priority to meet the
economic and social development needs of Nepal and subject to prior review by
IDA.
C. Progect Cost and Financing
14.      The project's cost has been estimated at US$21.9 million equivalent, of
which US$16.9 million (77*) are foreign exchange costs. The base costs were
*       estimated at mid-1987 price levels on the basis of recent quotations for
consultancy services in Nepal. The cost estimates include salaries, fringe
benefits and overheads of the consultants, equipment, instruments and vehicles
*        required for field exploration and engineering work, office equipment, computer
hardware and software, supplies required for the studies, and miscellaneous
reimbursable expenditures to be paid to the consultants. Necessary construction
work, such as temporary camp sites, exploration tunnels and temporary access
jeep tracks to the site at Pancheswar, is also included in the project costs.
(Construction of an access road to the Arun-3 site is being considered for
financing under a separate IDA project.) Physical contingencies for the project
are estimated at 10* of the base cost. Price contingencies over total cost are
provided at 10% for 1987/88, 7% for 1988/89 and 6% per annum thereafter for
local costs and 5.6% for 1987/88, 5.4% for 1998/89, -0.3% for 1989/90 and 1.2%
per annum thereafter for foreign costs.
15.      The proposed IDA credit of US$14.4 million equivalent would finance
66% of total project costs. Through an exchange of diplomatic notes, the
Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and Nepal agreed that FRG
would finance all foreign and local costs of the Arun-3 detailed engineering
component, except for duties and taxes. The remaining project costs
(US$2.2 million) would be provided by HMG.  The IDA credit would finance 100% of
the foreign exchange costs and 43% of the local costs (primarily miscellaneous
construction works) for all project components, except for the Arun-3 detailed
engineering component.
D. Project Administration and Implementation
Imp lemntation Arrangements
16.      The project is expected to be implemented over a period of about four
years and would be completed in December 1991. The Attachment to this Annex
indicates the implementation schedule for the power-related components.
17.      NEA would be responsible for the administration of all the identified
components of the project, except the Pancheswar field investigations.  The
Director in Chief, Planning, would be responsible for drv to day management of
the power subsector consultancy contracts and coordination of all activities
involving other government or private organizations (such as processing of
permits, licenses, supply of information, etc). He would also provide the
necessary logistic support to the consultants and serve as the liaison between



_ 16 -                            Schedule E
Page 6 of 7
the parties involved in the project. Arrangements for the provision by NEA of
administrative and logistical support to the consultants and the necessary
counterpart staff were agreed at negotiations.
18.      The field studies for the Pancheswar Multipurpose Project would be
managed by a special unit to be set up within the Ministry of Water Resources
(MWR) by March 31, 1988. The Ministry of Finarnce (MOF) would be responsible for
the administration of the "Other Studies" component; however, day-to-day
communications with IDA would be the responsibility of the concerned Executing
Agency for each study.
19.      Nepal and India have created a Joint Group of Experts (JGE) to oversee
the studies for Pancheswar. The first meeting of the JGE took place in April
1978, and three more meetings have taken place thereafter. HMG/N has agreed to
involve the JGE in the review of the technical aspects of the studies for
Pancheswar to ensure that the field investigations to be carried out under the
project on the Nepali side are consistent in scope, nature and degree of detail
with those already done by GOI.
Procurement
20.      The consultants for all the studies financed under the proposed credit,
except the detailed engineering for Arun-3 to be financed by FRG, would be
selected and retained in accordance with IDA guidelines for the use of
consultants. To encourage efficiencies in the conduct of the studies,
overlapping short lists of consultants would be used, as appropriate, possibly
enabling the same consultant to be selected for more than one study. For the
detailed engineering for Arun-3, HMG/N would employ consultants with suitable
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment. In view of
the specialized nature and the small amounts involved, equipment and parts
(except vehicles) required for the engineering work, to be financed by IDA,
would be procured by the consultants on a reimbursable basis on behalf of HMG/N
through international and local shopping. Other non-specialized goods such as
vehicles would be procured through local competitive bidding procedures which
are satisfactory to IDA since international competitive bidding is not justified
due to the nature of the works involved and their small size. All contracts for
goods of more than US$100,000 and civil works of more than US$200,000 would be
subject to prior approval by the Bank. All other procurement contracts would be
subject to ex-post review by the Bank.
Disbu&rsements
21.      The credit would be disbursed against: (a) 81% of civil works; (b) 100%
of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 65% of
expenditures for other items procured locally for equipment, vehicles and
materials; (c) 100% for consultant services; and (d) 100% for subprojects.
Itemized statements of expenditure (SOEs) would be used for civil works,
equipment, vehicles, materials, consultant services and subprojects less than
US$50,000 equivalent. Documentation supporting these SOEs would be retained by
NEA plus other executing agencies (MWR, MOF) and made available to IDA during
supervision missions. To facilitate disbursement, a special account with an



-17 -                             Schedule E
Page 7 of 7
initial allocation of SDR 1.0 million would be established in the Nepal Rastra
Bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The closing date of the
project would be June 30, 1992.
Project Accounts and Audit Reports
22.      The agencies responsible for the administration of the studies financed
under the proposed credit would maintain records and separate accounts
satisfactory to IDA of the resources and expenditures in respect to the
individual studies under the project. Furthermore, the agencies would have
these accounts audited each fiscal year by independent auditors satisfactory to
IDA and in accordance with auditing principles acceptable to the Bank.  The
agencies would furnish the Bank with certified copies of the audit reports
within 12 months after the end of each fiscal year and include in these reports
a separate opinion from the auditor as to whether the disbursements made on the
basis of SOEs pertained to expenditures incurred for the purposes of the
Project.
Project Monitoring
23.      HNG/N would be responsible for furnishing IDA with quarterly progress
reports on the studies, the content and format of which would be satisfactory to
IDA. The first quarterly report would be due on February 28, 1988.
