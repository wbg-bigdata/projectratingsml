INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR AN
IRRIGATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$3.15
million to the People's Republic of Bangladesh, on standard terms for project
preparation credits, to help finance an Irrigation Engineering Project. This
credit would replace (i) a US$0.8 million credit to the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan of December 1969 for the Dacca Southwest Irrigation Engineering
Project (Credit No. S-8 PAK) and (ii) a US$2.4 million credit to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan of June 1970 for the Karnafuli-Muhuri Irrigation Engi-
neering Project (Credit No. S-10 PAK) on the basis set out in paragraph 2
of my Report and Recommendation to the Executive Directors, dated September 15,
1972, on the Second Chandpur Irrigation Project (IDA/R72-77).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Reconstructing the Economy of Bangladesh"
was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 13, 1972 (R72-230).
A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
3.        The operations of the Bank Group in Bangladesh are described in
Part II of my Report and Recommendation referred to above. Since that report
was issued, credit agreements between Bangladesh and the Association have
been signed for a US$50 million reconstruction imports program credit, and
for five credits totalling US$62.3 million replacing amounts included in
previous credits to Pakistan for the same projects. Annex II gives the
status of Bank Group operations in Bangladesh.
PART III - THE PROJECT
Background
4.        Water control and irrigation are essential to the predominantly
agricultural economy of Bangladesh. During about half of the year, the
country is subjected to heavy rainfall and floods which cause extensive
damage. In the other half, there is a period of very little rainfall,



- 2 -
during which approximately 60 percent of the cultivated land is left fallow
because of insufficient irrigation water. These adverse water conditions,
combined with a low level of agricultural technology, have resulted in
cropping intensities substantially below those which the climate would
permit, and in crop yields only one-third to one-fourth of those in many
similarly situated countries. The Association intends to continue providing
assistance to Bangladesh in the development of the agriculture and water
sector. Since many projects in this sector involve complex agricultural
and water control problems, they require comprehensive preliminary engineering
studies to provide data for rational investment decisions.
Project History
5.        Before 1971, the Association had made three credits to help
finance consultant services in the agricultural sector of the then Province
of East Pakistan. Credit No. 136-PAK (US$2.0 million, fully disbursed)
of January 1969 provided general consultants to the East Pakistan Water and
Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA), which was in charge of coordinating
development and utilization of water and power resources in the Province.
Credit No. S-8 PAK (US$0.8 million) and Credit No. S-10 PAK (US$2.4 million)
were made in 1969 and 1970 respectively, to finance the foreign exchange costs
of consulting services to prepare two water control and agricultural develop-
ment projects, the Dacca Southwest Irrigation Project and the Karnafuli-Muhuri
Irrigation Project.
6.        Feasibility studies for these projects had been carried out
previously. Under the engineiering credits, these feasibility studies were
to be revised and completed to international financing standards; tender
documents and final designs for initial portions of the proposed construction
projects were to be prepared. For both projects, EPWAPDA was the executing
agency. The joint venture of Engineering Consultants Incorporated (ECI) of
the United States and Associated Consulting Engineers (ACE) of Karachi was
selected for the Dacca Southwest Project, and International Engineering Company
(IECO) of the United States and Rahman and Associates Ltd. (RAAL), a local
firm, for the Karnafuli-Muhuri Project.
7.        Dacca Southwest.   The Dacca Southwest Irrigation Project was to
provide irrigation, drainage, flood control, improved navigation for country
boats and agricultural inputs for an area of about 490,000 acres at the
confluence of the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna Rivers. The credit
was used to carry out a study to determine the economic soundness and technical
feasibility of constructing the project.
8.        The total cost of the engineering project was estimated at
US$1,430,000 equivalent. Of this amount, the local cost of US$630,000
equivalent was to be financed by the Government.
9.        The consultants, and an IDA mission which visited the area in
September 1970 to appraise a f'irst phase construction project, found that



-3-
hydrological problems of the region (e.g. the unstable courses of the major
rivers) were more complex than originally allowed for and that the project
might have a detrimental impact on local fisheries. Thus, the Dacca Southwest
Irrigation Project which would require a total investment of US$57.0 equiva-
lent, including US$37.0 equivalent of local costs, would involve considerable
investment risks and a relatively low return. The Association concluded that
it would be desirable to gain some experience with this type of project in
less difficult areas before proceeding with full development of the Dacca
Southwest area. Subsequent studies by the Government and the Association
identified other regions of the country with higher potential, particularly
in the Southeast. By mid-1971, the Dacca Southwest Irrigation Engineering
Project was considered completed. The Government, due to severe resource
constraints, is now concentrating its efforts on simple irrigation and drain-
age projects in more favorable areas, and is holding construction of the
Dacca Southwest Project in abeyance until some of these other projects have
been implemented.
10.       hThen disbursements from Credit No. S-8 PAK were suspended on
December 29, 1971, US$741,000 had been disbursed to cover the foreign
exchange costs of the project consultants. Total expenditures incurred
up to that time are estimated at US$1.20 million equivalent, including
US$800,000 in foreign exchange, the total amount of the credit. The pro-
posed credit would allow the Government to pay the consultants for foreign
exchange expenditures incurred prior to December 29, 1971 but not paid pre-
viously (about US$60,000).
11.       Karnafuli-Muhuri.   The Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project was to
prepare two construction projects:
(a) the Karnafuli Project, covering the flood plains of the
llalda and Ichamati Rivers, tributaries of the lower
Karnafuli River, consists of two subprojects, both
primarily providing for irrigation, drainage, flood control,
improvement of navigation for country boats and agricul-
tural inputs: (i) the Halda Unit, with an area of about
131,000 acres and (ii) the Ichamati Unit with an area of
16,000 acres;
(b) the Muhuri Project was to provide similar benefits for
an area of about 101,000 acres along the Muhuri River.
The feasibility studies for the Karnafuli and Muhuri projects were to cover
those aspects dealing with: (i) drainage facilities; (ii) improved methods
of irrigation distribution; (iii) project organization for provision of agri-
cultural inputs; and (iv) returns to and repayment capacity of the participating
farmers.
12.       In addition, the credit provided for a preliminary study of the
Dakatia-Muhuri Water Transfer Scheme. Under this scheme, water for irriga-
tion purposes was to be transferred over a distance of about 50 miles from



the Meghna River to the Muhuri River via the Dakatia River, the little Feni
River and several other segments of minor rivers and channels. The scheme
was primarily intended to increase the limited water available from the
Muhuri River, but it was also expected to help in the irrigation of about
half a million acres located in the Comilla-Noakhali and Little Feni areas.
13.       The total cost of the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project was
estimated at US$4.6 million equivalent, including local costs of about
US$2.2 million equivalent.
14.       The consultants prepared feasibility reports on the Halda,
Ichamati and Muhuri lower vaLleys, where low lift pump irrigation using
natural drainage channels is possible. To date no work has been carried
out on the studies originally planned for the upper valleys. Tender documents
for proposed major pumping plants in the Halda and Ichamati lower valleys
also were submitted to EPWAPDi. The consultants had also prepared and sub-
mitted to EP1.APDA a draft prefeasibility study for the Water Transfer Scheme
and have now nearly completed the planning report on the allocation of land
and water resources for the entire Comilla-Noakhali area. Since, in the
course of these planning studies, the Comilla-Noakhali area showed great
promise for development, prefeasibility studies were made for two low-lift
pump irrigation projects (covering about 110,000 acres) adjacent to the
Water Transfer Scheme.
15.       When disbursements from Credit No. S-10 PAK were suspended on
December 29, 1971, US$1.35 million had been disbursed against the foreign
exchange costs of the project consultants. Total expenditures incurred up
to that time are estimated at US$2.03 million equivalent, including US$1.39
million in foreign exchange. The proposed credit would allow the Government
to pay the consultants for foreign exchange expenditures incurred prior to
December 29, 1971, but not paid previously (about US$40,000), and to finance
the foreign exchange costs required to complete the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineer-
ing Project.
Project Reappraisal
16.       In May and June 1972, shortly after the Government had requested a
new IDA Credit to reactivate the Dacca Southwest and the Karnafuli-Muhuri
Engineering Credits, a mission visited Bangladesh to review the situation.
A Project Summary as well as a Technical Note describing the findings of the
mission are attached as Annexes III and IV respectively.
17.       The Swedish Interim Credit of US$11 million equivalent to Bangla-
desh, which was signed on June 1, 1972, included financing for urgent
expenditures incurred under the Karnafuli and Muhuri Irrigation Engineering
Project after January 1, 1972 and indeed enabled the consultants to resume
their work in early 1972. A memorandum describing arrangements under the
Swedish Interim Credit was considered by the Executive Directors on
April 18, 1972 (IDA/R72-74).



18.       The proposed Engineering Project would comprise the Dacca Southwest
Engineering Project which is already completed (except for some final payments
to the consultants), and the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project which would
remain fundamentally the same as the one which was financed under Credit
No. S-10 PAK (paragraphs 11 and 12 above), except for the following modifi-
cations: (i) Studies for the Karnafuli and Muhuri upper valleys would be
postponed indefinitely, since it was found that irrigation of the upper
valleys would have to be by conventional gravity canal systems supplied by
storage dams and reservoirs, a method of development which is costly and slow.
(ii) The study for one of the two low-lift pump irrigation projects in the
Comilla-Noakhali area would be upgraded from prefeasibility to feasibility
level, since this area offers much higher potential for the development of an
economical project which could be implemented rapidly; contrary to the situation
in the Karnafuli and Muhuri upper valleys, the Comilla-Noakhali area has
abundant water on a year-round basis, there is little flooding, and many canals
have already been constructed. The additional feasibility study for the
Comilla-Noakhali project would be similar in scope and detail to those for
the Karnafuli and Muhuri projects (described in paragraph 11). (iii) Tender
documents and final designs would be prepared only for project features pro-
posed for early implementation and not for all major works to be constructed
as originally planned. The Government places a high priority on the Karnafuli,
Muhuri, and Comilla-Noakhal7i projects which are expected to improve agriculture
in the Southeast region substantially, and to result in an increase in pro-
duction (primarily foodgrain) and corresponding savings in foreign exchange
from reducing food imports. The total cost of construction is estimated in
the neighborhood of US$25 million equivalent, including about US$15.0 million
in local costs.
19.       The estimated total cost of the new Engineering Project amalgamating
the Dacca Southwest and Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Projects is US$5.31 million
equivalent, including US$3.2 million in foreign exchange. The foreign exchange
costs would be the same as originally estimated, but local costs would be
roughly 25 percent less, primarily because detailed engineering for the
Dacca Southwest Project which was to have been done largely by the local
consultants, was not carried out as originally anticipated.
20.       Project costs were computed before the recent dollar devaluation
and at a time when the taka/US dollar exchange rate was 7.28. Since that
time, the dollar has been devalued and the taka/dollar exchange rate has
risen to 7.7. Because more than 90 percent of the remaining foreign exchange
costs of the project will be payable in US dollars to a US-based consulting
firm, the impact of the devaluation on the foreign exchange component will be
negligible. On the other hand, at the present exchange rate, the dollar value
of local costs would be reduced. It is difficult to quantify these changes
with precision at the present time, but since the proposed credit would be
used to finance foreign exchange expenditures only, which are not expected to
increase, financing for the full project cost seems assured and no increase
in the amount of the proposed credit appears necessary.
21.       The proposed credit of US$3.15 million would finance:    (i)
notional repayment of amounts previously disbursed under Credit No. S-8 PAK
(US$0.69 million; this amount is net of US$0.05 million, recently repaid by



Pakistan to the Association) and under Credit No. S-10 PAK (US$1.35 million),
thus debiting Bangladesh with these amounts; (ii) payment of outstanding
foreign exchange obligations for consulting services performed under Credit
No. S-8 PAK (US$0.06 million) and Credit No. S-10 PAK (US$0.04 million) before
December 29, 1971; and (iii) the additional foreign exchange costs needed to
complete the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project (US$1.01 million). The
last item includes reimbursernent to Sweden for such portion of SIDA's interim
credit that may have been disbursed for the project by the time the proposed
credit becomes effective (about US$0.24 million equivalent).
22.       The former executing agency, EPWAPDA, has recently been split
into the Water Development Board (BWDB) and the Power Development Board.
BWDB, which operates under the new Ministry of Flood Control and Water
Development, would be the executing agency for the proposed credit. B1WDB
has invited the consulting firms IECO and RAAL, which have continued their
work on the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project during 1972, to renegotiate
their contract.
23.       The proposed credit: would be refinanced out of the proceeds of
any IDA credit or credits ultimately made for the construction of the projects
to be engineered or studied.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
24.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of Bangladesh and the Association, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The provisions of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement conform substantially to the provisions of the prior
Development Credit Agreements; with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and
incorporate the relevant provisions of the Project Agreements with the then
Province of East Pakistan. T'here will not be a separate Project Agreement.
25.       A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be
that competent and experienced consultants be employed by BWDB to complete
the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Association.



26.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C. Projects in Execution
Cr. No. 339   Cyclone Area Reconstruction Project; $25.0 Million Credit
of October l, 1972; Closing Date June 30, 1976.
This Credit became effective on January 17, 1973. Implemen-
tation of the original project, financed under Credit No. 228-PAK of 1971,
did not commence prior to the suspension of disbursements.   The Government
has now set up the central organization for the project, and task forces
for the execution of the sub-projects are being assembled. Sites for cyclone
shelters are being selected, tenders for construction have been invited,
and the Project Coordinator is hopeful of completing sixty shelters
before the onset of the monsoon season.   On the primary roads sub-project,
surveyors are in the field determining alignments and making detailed
assessments of work quantities.  On the Cyclone Wgarning sub-project, the
sub-project manager is f:inalizing specifications of equipment which must
be imported to strengthen the meteorological stations serving the coastal
area. Other sub-projects (inland water transport, telecommunications,
feeder roads, and coastal fisheries) are less advanced. A supervision
mission now in the field is reviewing with Government the actions required
to expedite implementation of these sub-projects.
Cr. No. 340   Chandpur Irrigation II Project; $13.0 Million Credit of
October 18, 1972; Closing Date December 31, 1977.
This Credit became effective on January 17, 1973. When
work on the project, previously financed under Credit No. 184-PAK of
1970, was suspended in 1971, the major project civil works were about
half completed. The contractor manufacturing equipment for the regulators
had also made substantial progress. Interim financing by Sweden has allowed
reappointment of project consultants, resumption of construction and rene-
gotiation of the contract for manufacture and installation of the equipment
for the regulators.
Cr. No. 341   Tubewells Project; $14.0 Million Credit of November 6, 1972;
Closing Date December 31, 1976.
The project is also being assisted by a $6 million credit
from Sweden and a $6 million grant from Canada. The IDA and Swedish
eredits became effective on January 17, 1973. The project was originally
financed by IDA Credit No. 208-PAK of 1970 and credits from Sweden and
Canada. Bids for the dri:Lling of project wells had been received in
1971 but no contracts were awarded due to the disturbed conditions.
Interim financing from Sweden has permitted reappointment of project
consultants and retendering. Bids have been received for well drilling
and supply of pumps and engines for the wells, and contracts are expected
to be awarded in the next few weeks. Contracts have been awarded
for required vehicles and miscellaneous equipment.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in ececution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Cr. No. 343   Telecommunications Project; $7.3 million Credit of
November 15, 1972; Closing Date December 31, 1975.
Credit became effective January 17, 1973. The project
was originally financed as part of Credit No. 145-PAK of 1969, and
goods and services valued at about US$2.2 million were received in
Dacca prior to suspension of disbursements. Orders had also been
placed for the remaining equipment now to be financed under Credit
No. 343, and the suppliers are understood to be prepared to resume
work at the original contract prices.
Cr. No. 345   Reconstruction Imports Project; $50.0 million Credit
of November 30, 1972; Closing Date August 31, 1974.
Credit became effective January 30, 1973. The Govern-
ment has prepared a statement allocating the proceeds of the credit
among the various eligible categories of expenditure, taking into
account funds expected to be available from other sources of assistance.
Disbursements are expected to commence shortly.
Cr. No. 353   Small-Scale Industry Project; $3.0 million Credit of
January 19, 1973; Closing Date June 30, 1976.
Not yet effective. The project was originally financed
by IDA Credit No. 192-PAK of 1970.   By December 1971, when disbursements
were suspended, 28 sub-projects had been approved and $2.19 million had
been allocated to these projects. Work has now begun on reactivation
of the interrupted sub-projects and canvassing for new sub-projects.

IRRIGATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                People's Republic of Bangladesh
Amount:                  US$3.15 million equivalent
Terms:                   Standard for Project Preparation Credits:   Term
of ten years including two years grace.
Relending Terms:         Not applicable
Project Description:     An Engineering Project to replace two pre-
Bangladesh engineering projects: the Dacca
Southwest Engineering Project and the Karnafuli-
Muhuri Engineering Project, to provide technical
assistance in preparing the Dacca Southwest,
Karnafuli, Muhuri, and Comilla-Noakhali water
control and agriculture development projects.
The engineering services include planning,
prefeasibility and feasibility studies and
preparation of tender documents and final designs
for selected works to be proposed for construction.
The proposed credit would finance the foreign
exchange costs of the engineering services includ-
ing costs incurred previously under Engineering
Credits No. S-8 and No. S-10, net of US$0.05 million
repaid by Pakistan to the Association.
Project Authority:       The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB),
which operates under the new Ministry of Flood
Control and Water Development, would execute the
project in place of the Water and Power Develop-
ment Authority (WAPDA), the former executing
agency.

/1  Project costs were computed before the recent dollar devaluation and
at a time when the Taka/US dollar exchange rate was 7.28. Since that
time, the dollar has been devalued and the Taka/US dollar exchange rate
has risen to 7.7. Because more than 90 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of the project will be payable in U.S. dollars, the impact of the
devaluation on the foreign exchange component will be negligible. On
the other hand, at the present exchange rate, the dollar value of
local cost would be reduced. It is difficult to quantify these changes
with precision at the present time, but since the proposed credit would
be used to finance foreign exchange expenditures only, which in turn
are not expected to increase financing for the full project cost appears
assured and no increase in the amount of the proposed credit appears
necessary.
/2  Total amount was incurred prior to December 29, 1971; it includes an
amount of about US$60,000 incurred prior to that date but not paid
previously.
/3  Of this amount, about US$1.39 million was incurred prior to December 29,
1971, including about US$40,000 which has not yet been paid; the
balance of US$0.18 million was incurred between January 1, 1972 and
August 31, 1972.

TECHNICAL NOTE ON
IRRIGATION ENGINEERING PROJECr
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        This technical note is based on findings of a mission 1/ which
visited Bangladesh from May 28 to June 16, 1972, to reappraise the Dacca
Southwest and Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Projects. In December 1971, at
the time of the civil war, the Association, after consultation with the
Government of Pakistan, suspended disbursements under the Credits.
At that time, execution of the Dacca Southwest Engineering Credit (No. S-8
PAK, US$0.8 million, dated December 15, 1969) was complete but part of the
payment to the engineering consultants was still outstanding. Execution
of the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Credit (No. S-10 PAK, US$2.4 million,
dated June 15, 1970) was only partially completed.
2.        By June 1972, with conditions in the country returning to normal,
the Government of Bangladesh included the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Credit
among those on-going development projects for which Sweden provided interim
financial assistance. The Government has now requested a new credit from
the Association to complete this Engineering Project. Some changes in the
Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project have been made in light of experience
gained since the start of implementation (see Section C, below). However,
these changes do not alter the basic concept of the Project. The proposed
new credit of US$3.15 million would assist Bangladesh in completing the
Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project. It would also allow the Government
to pay the consultants for services performed previously under both
Engineering Credits (No. S-8 PAK and No. S-10 PAK).
B. BACKGROUND
3.        Bangladesh has a predominantly rural economy sustaining a per
capita income of about US$60 per year, one of the lowest in South Asia.
With a population of about 75 million growing at an annual rate of some 3%,
the country already has one of the highest population densities in the
world. At least 80% of the population is dependent on agriculture, mainly
the cultivation of rice and jute. And while population is increasing,
nearly all the suitable land is already under cultivation. Adverse water
conditions, combined with a low level of agricultural technology, have
resulted in cropping intensities in Bangladesh substantially below those
which the climate would permit and in crop yields only one-third to one-
fourth of those in many similarly situated countries.
1/   Mission consisted of Risto Harma, mission leader, and E. Hunting.

4.        The Dacca Southwest and the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Credits
were the first in a series intended to provide technical assistance in
preparing projects combining water control and improved agricultural
techniques in what is now Bangladesh. The unsettled conditions during the
past year imposed an almost total hiatus on the economy of the country,
and rapid progress in agricultural production now is crucial to help com-
pensate for the losses during the disturbances and to keep up with population
growth. Against this background, the Government has adopted a new policy
for land and water use, with emphasis on quick-yielding and widespread
development activities. The Dacca Southwest Project, which would be located
adjacent to major rivers and subiect to deep flooding would not fit this new
strategy, and thus the Government desires to hold its construction in
abeyance until after other projects are financed and implemented. On the
other hand, the Karnafuli, Muhuri and Comilla-Noakhali projects described
below, would fit the new strategy well. They would be located away from
unstable river courses, in an area where flooding is shallow and where low-lift
pumping can be developed quickly and economically.
History and Status of Dacca Southwest Irrigation Engineering Project
5.        The Dacca Southwest Irrigation Engineering Credit for US$800,000
(total estimated cost US$1.4 million equivalent) was appraised in November
1969 and the credit agreement was signed in December 1969 (IDA Credit
No. S-8 PAK). The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) 1/ was the
executing agency. The credit provided technical assistance in preparing,
to international financing standards, a water control and agriculture
development project in an area of about 400,000 acres southwest of Dacca
at the confluence of three major rivers: the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and
the Meghna Rivers. The work was carried out and completed by a joint venture
of two consulting firms, Engineering Consultants Incorporated (ECI) of the
USA and Associated Consulting Engineers (ACE) of Pakistan.
6.        In August 1970, the consultants completed a feasibility report
for a project combining flood protection, irrigation, drainage, and
agricultural inputs. In Septfsrber 1,970, an IDA mission visited Dacca to
appraise the project.   The appraisal mission found that the unstable
courses of the major rivers which border the project area, the severe
depths of flooding over much of it, and the complex drainage and water
supply problems in the project: area as documented by the consultants' studies,
would involve considerable investment risks and relatively low return. From
the environmental standpoint, the appraisal mission found that part of the
area is important for fish breeding purposes and that further study is needed
to determine the impact of project works on local fisheries, which provides
a livelihood for several hundred thousand local fishermen. Subsequent studies
by the Government and the Association identified other regions of the
1/   On May 31, 1972, WAPDA was split into a Water Development Board under
the Ministry of Flood Control and Water Resources and a Power Development
Board under the Ministry of Power and Telecommunications.

country with higher potential, particularly in the Southeast. The Government,
in light of severe resource constraint, is now initially concentrating its
efforts on simple irrigation and drainage projects in more favorable areas
(see para 4), and is holding construction of the Dacca Southwest Project in
abeyance until after some of these projects and programs have been financed
and implemented.
7.        When disbursements from Credit No. S-8 PAK were suspended on
December 29, 1971, US$741,000 had been disbursed to cover the foreign
exchange costs of the project consultants. Total expenditures incurred
up to that time are estimated at US$1.20 million equivalent, including
US$800,000 in foreign exchange, the total amount of the credit. The pro-
posed credit would allow the Government to pay the consultants for foreign
exchange expenditures incurred prior to December 29, 1971, but not paid pre-
viously (about US$60,000).
History and Status of the Karnafuli-Muhuri Irrigation Engineering Project
8.        The Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Credit for US$2.4 million (total
estimated cost US$4.6 million equivalent) was appraised in 1969/70 and was
signed in June 1970 (Credit No. S-10 PAK). WAPDA was the executing agency.
The Credit provided technical assistance in preparing to international
financing standards two water control and agriculture development projects
in the Chittagong Coastal Plain (see map) - the Karnafuli Project and the
Muhuri Project, including a scheme (the Water Transfer Scheme) to supplement
the supply of irrigation water for the Muhuri Project. The engineering
services included preparation of planning and feasibility studies, tender
documents and final designs for the following:
(a) The Karnafuli Project, which consists of two subprojects -
the Halda Unit (gross area 131,000 acres) and the Ichamati
Unit (gross area 16,000 acres) - to provide irrigation and
flood protection in the flood plains of the Halda and
Ichamati Rivers, tributaries to the lower Karnafuli River;
(b) The Muhuri Project (gross area 101,000 acres), one unit,
to provide irrigation and flood protection in the floodplain
of the Muhuri, Selonia, and Feni Rivers; and
(c) The Water Transfer Scheme, to divert water from the Meghna
River across the Southeast Region (Comilla and Noakhali
Districts) via the existing Dakatia and Little Feni river
channels.
The Water Transfer Scheme studies also included planning eventual use of
land and water resources for adjacent areas (hereafter referred to as the
Comilla-Noakhali area) in the Southeast Region bounded by the Gumti River
on the north, the Lower Meghna River on the west, the Bay of Bengal and
the Indian border (see map).

9.        Detailed terms of reference for the consultants were prepared by
WAPDA and agreed by the AssocLation which also approved the selection of a
joint venture between a San Francisco firm, International Engineering Co.
Inc. (IECO) and a local firm, Rahman and Associates Ltd. (RAAL). Key
personnel to be assigned by the consultants were also approved by the
Association.
10.       The consultants have prepared and submitted to WAPDA, for review,
draft feasibility reports for the Halda and Ichamati Units of the Karnafuli
Project and for the Muhuri Project. These cover the lower parts of the
Halda, Ichamati and Muhuri river valleys where low-lift pump irrigation using
the natural drainage channels is possible 1/. No work has yet been accomplished
on studies for the upper valleys.   Tender documents for proposed major pumping
plants in the lower Halda and Ichamati valleys were submitted to WAPDA. The
consultants have also prepared and submitted to WAPDA a draft prefeasibility
study for the Water' Transfer Scheme and have nearly completed the planning
report on the entire Comilla-Noakhali area. In the course of the planning
studies for the Comilla-Noakhali area, a portion adjacent to the water transfer
facilities showed such promise that prefeasibility studies were also made for
two additional low-lift pump :Lrrigation projects--the Dakatia Project (irrig-
able area 79,000 ac) and the Little Feni Project (irrigable area 33,000 ac)--
which would comprise pilot subprojects of a comprehensive water control pro-
ject (the Comilla-Noakhali Project) for the entire planning area.
11.       When disbursements Lrom Credit No. S-10 PAK were suspended on
December 29, 1971, US$1.35 million had been disbursed to cover foreign
exchange costs of the project consultants. Total expenditures to date are
estimated at US$2.69 million equivalent, including US$1.57 million of
foreign exchange. The proposed credit would allow the Government to pay
the consultants for foreign exchange expenditures incurred prior to
December 29, 1971, but not paiid previously (about US$40,000). Interim
financing by Sweden has permitted resumption of work in 1972.
C. THE PROJECT
12.       The Dacca Southwest Engineering Project was completed under Credit
No. S-8 PAK and no additional work is proposed for this Project (see para 4).
Additional work is required to complete the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering
Project, including planning and feasibility studies and preparation of
tender documents and detailed designs. The Project would remain fundamentally
the same as provided for under No. S-10 PAK (Appraisal Report No. PS-1 dated
May 15, 1970), except for the following modifications which have been discussed
and agreed with the Government:
1/   Gross areas of about 63,000 ac in the Halda Unit, 8,500 ac in the
Ichamati IJnit, and 55,000 ac in the Muhuri Project, or about 50% of
the gross project areas.



(a) Studies for the upper Karnafuli and Muhuri valleys
would be postponed indefinitely;
(b) The study for a portion of the Comilla-Noakhali Project
would be upgraded from prefeasibility to feasibility
level; and
Cc) Tender documents and final designs would be prepared only
for project features proposed for implementation in the
early part of construction (1974).
Postponement of Studies for the Upper Karnafuli and Muhuri Valleys
13.       According to studies by the consultants, irrigation in the upper
parts of the Halda, Ichamati and Muhuri valleys would have to be by con-
ventional gravity canal systems supplied by storage dams and reservoirs,
with possibly some groundwater development. The capital costs of this type
of development would be high and the development period lengthy. On the
other hand, the Comilla-Noakhali area offers much higher potential for an
economical project which could be implemented rapidly. A large part of the
Comilla-Noakhali area is far from unstable river courses, is not subject to
deep flooding and is laced extensively with natural and man-made channels.
Water is available in the adjacent Dakatia River on a year-round basis. In
contrast to the upper valleys, where a total of only about 62,000 acres would
ultimately be improved, more than 260,000 acres in the Comilla-Noakhali area
could be provided with irrigation from the Dakatia River. Consequently, the
Government has recommended that the studies originally proposed for the
upper valleys be postponed and instead emphasis be placed on early develop-
ment of the Comilla-Noakhali area.
Additional Feasibility Study in Comilla-Noakhali Area
14.       A feasibility study for the first stage of the Comilla-Noakhali
water control project (para 10), covering an area of about 20,000 acres along
the Dakatia River in the priority area discussed above (para 13) would be
included in the scope of work. Based on considerable project preparation
already completed in connection with the draft prefeasibility report for
this area (see para 10), the consultants would be able to complete this
feasibility study in about four months, thus making it possible to develop
the area two to three years ahead of the major project features and to
provide useful water management experience prior to full development. This
would be the initial stage of development to irrigate a large part of the
Comilla-Noakhali Project area by means of a large regulator and pumping plant
on the Dakatia River and low embankments along the river to maintain water
levels for diversion into tributary channels through small regulators at
the channel offtakes.  The 20,000 acres would be developed before the major
pumping plants and regulators on the Dakatia are completed by providing small
regulators on some of the channels tributary to the Dakatia River and small
floating primary pumping installations at each regulator to pump the water
into these channels, from which water would be delivered to the fields



- 6 -
by low-lift pumps. This first stage would also include support for agricul-
tural development following the Chandpur Project pattern. If studies for a
larger project give positive :results, major works would be constructed.
After completing such construction (possibly four years hence), BWT2B would
move the floating pumping plants to small scale irrigation schemes in other
areas.
Reduced Scope for Tender Documents and Final Designs
15.       Studies relating to the size and feasibility of project works for
the Karnafuli and Muhuri projects are still under way, including incremental
analysis to show separately the impact of principal irrigation and flood
protection features. This analysis requires completing studies of alternative
regulator and pumping capacities for project drainage and irrigation, field
surveys of the extent and effectiveness of present irrigation in the project
areas, further evaluation of agriculture yields and production costs under
future project conditions, and determining modifications and additions to
the proposed project works for maintaining and improving the existing
fisheries and water transport routes in the project area. The Government
has agreed that until the above studies have been completed and the size and
feasibility of project works have been fully established, further work will
not be performed on tender documents and final designs. With this in mind,
the Government has agreed thal: under this Engineering Credit, no tender docu-
ments of final designs for maijor works would be prepared. Thus, under the
proposed credit, tender documents and final designs would be prepared only
for those works which would be implemented in the early part of construction
(1974), including irrigation features such as the regulators and small float-
ing pumping plants for the Karnafuli Project and for the Ccmilla-Noakhali
Project and the regulator gates and electrical equipment for the Muhuri Proj-
ect. This work would proceed as soon as the size and feasibility of these
features have been fully established.
Timing
16.       The Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project would be completed in
about 15 months (see Chart).   The feasibility studies and tender documents
for the project features planned for early construction (see para 15) would
be ready for final review and printing in the Fall of 1973: by mid-August
for the Comilla-Noakhali Project, and by mid-October for the Karnafuli Project.
The final reports for the Karriafuli, Muhuri and Comilla-Noakhali Projects
would be completed by July 15, 1974. The planning report for the Comilla-
Noakhali area and the feasibility report for the Water Transfer Scheme
would be completed before November 1973.
Organization and Execution
17.       The Government of Bangladesh has made some changes in the agencies
responsible for the land and water sectors. The former executing agency for
the Engineering Credits, WAPDA, has been split into a Water Development
Board (BWDB) and a Power Development Board. BWDB, which operates under the



- 7 -
new Ministry of Flood Control and Water Development, would be the new
executing agency for this credit.
D. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
Man-month Requirements
18.       The Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project under the proposed credit
would require 550 foreign and 1,558 local man-months engineering of which
400 foreign and 986 local man-months were completed by August 1972. These
compare to a total of 464 foreign and 1,298 local man-months estimated under
the original credit. The increase is due to the effect of the 1971
disturbances and the civil war which interrupted the studies and to the
additional work proposed for the Comilla-Noakhali area. The total of
150 man-months' foreign assistance needed to complete the Project includes
about 70% for feasibility and planning studies, 12% for tender documents
and 18% for final designs.
Costs
19.       The estimated total cost of the Dacca Southwest and Karnafuli-
Muhuri engineering services is US$5.31 million equivalent (Tks 31.5 million
equivalent), including US$3.2 million foreign exchange. The foreign
exchange costs would be the same as originally estimated, but local costs
would be roughly 25% less, primarily because detailed engineering in pre-
paration for construction of the Dacca Southwest Project, to be done largely
by the local consultants, was not required as originally anticipated. Out
of the total foreign costs, about US$2.37 million already has been committed
through August 31, 1972, including roughly US$0.80 million for the Dacca
Southwest Engineering Project and US$1.57 million for the Karnafuli-Muhuri
Engineering Project.
20.       Completing the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Project, including
making up work lost in the disturbances, updating the pre-war estimates and
preparing the new project in the Comilla-Noakhali area, would cost an
estimated US$1.35 million equivalent (Tks 9.82 million equivalent), includ-
ing US$0.84 million foreign exchange. The estimates for completing the
engineering are based on the actual rate of expenditure to date and
escalation estimated at the rate of about 4% on foreign costs. An allowance
of 15 percent for contingencies is included based on prior experience under
Engineering Credits No. S-8 PAK and No. S-10 PAK. The estimates are given
below:

and the rate US$1 - Tks 7.28 for costs incurred after January 1, 1972. Since
September 1972, the dollar has been devalued and the taka/dollar exchange rate
has risen to 7.7. Because more than 90 percent of the foreign exchange cost of
the project will be payable in U.S. dollars, the impact of the devaluation on the
foreign exchange component will be negligible. However, the devaluation de-
creases the taka value of foreign costs and increases the dollar value of local
costs. While it is difficullt to quantify these changes with precision at the
present time they are expected to have only a negligible effect on project costs.

Financing
21.       The proposed Credit of US$3.15 million would finance (i) repayment
of amounts previously disbursed under Credit No. S-8 PAK (US$0.74 million
disbursed of which US$0.05 million was repaid by Pakistan to the Association,
leaving US$0.69 to be repaid) and No. S-10 PAK (US$1.35 million disbursed),
thus debiting Bangladesh with these amounts; (ii) payment of oustanding
amounts due for consulting services performed before suspension of disburse-
ments under Credit No. S-8 PAK (US$0.06 million outstanding) and No. S-10
PAK (US$0.04 million outstanding); and (iIi) the additional foreign exchange
costs needed to complete the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Projects which was
begun under Credit No. S-10 PAK (US$1.01 million additional of which US$0.18
million was incurred prior to September 1972). The last item includes
reimbursement to Sweden for that portion of SIDA's interim credit that will
have been disbursed under the Project between the time disbursements were
suspended and the time the proposed Association's credit becomes effective.
The period of disbursement for the credit would be from May 1, 1973, through
October 31, 1974, and the disbursement schedule would be as follows:
FY 1972/73            FY 1973/74             FY 1974/75

/2 Pmount net of US$50 thousand repaid by Pakistan to the Association.
/3 Includes all local costs incurred before April 1, 1973.
22.       The terms for the IDA credit would be ten years, including a two-
year grace period. The Borrower would be the Government of Bangladesh which
would make the proceeds available to the Water Development Board. The
Bangladesh Government has agreed to provide all the local currency require-
ments for completing the project.
1/   Because more than 90 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the project
will be payable in US dollars to a US-based consulting firm, the impact
of the devaluation on the foreign exchange component will be negligible.
Since the proposed credit would be used to finance foreign exchange
expenditures only, which in turn are not expected to increase, financing
for the full project costs appears assured and no increase in the amount
of the project appears necessary.

E. ENGAGEMENT OF CONSULTANTS
23.       In August 1972, the Bangladesh Water Development Board, (BWDB)
invited the firms International Engineering Co. Inc. (IECO) of the U.S. and
Rahman and Associates Ltd. (RAAL) of Bangladesh to renegotiate their
contract for engineering services to complete the Karnafuli-Muhuri Irrigation
Engineering Project. Detailed terms of reference for the consultants are
being prepared by BWDB whose officers have extensive experience in the use
and monitoring of consultants. The contract between BWDB and the consultants,
as well as key personnel to be assigned by the consultants, would be subject
to the approval of the Association. The employment of competent and
experienced consultants, for the completion of the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering
Project, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association would be a
condition of effectiveness for the proposed credit.
F. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
25.       The proposed credit of US$3.15 million is justified to provide
foreign assistance needed to prepare water control and agricultural development
projects in areas of Bangladesh subject to water shortages in the winter and
flooding in the summer. Provision of irrigation, improved drainage, and
flood protection would make possible the use of fertilizers and improved
varieties of rice (the principal crop) which might eventually result in nearly
doubling the use of the cultivable land in the project areas and roughly
tripling the present crop yields.
26.       The Karnafuli, Muhuri, and Comilla-Noakhali projects, which would
be among the first new water control projects in Bangladesh, are expected
to improve agriculture in the Southeast Region substantially, providing an
increase in production (primarily foodgrain) and corresponding savings in
foreign exchange for food imports.
27.       Based on the findingis of the prefeasibility report of the Water
Transfer Scheme and studies of the land and water resources of Bangladesh
prepared by Bank staff and consultants,1/ the highest potential for develop-
ment in the Southeast REgion is on the old Meghna floodplain area of
Comilla and Noakhali Districts. The planning included for the entire
Comilla-Noakhali portion of the Southeast Region (see para 6) now is
urgently needed for proper allocation of the land and water resources of
this high potential area where a number of water control projects are being
considered (see map).

G. RECOMMENDATIONS
28.       It is recommended that a development credit of US$3.15 million
equivalent be made to the Government of Bangladesh to finance foreign
assistance for the Dacca Southwest and the Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering
Projects.
29.       A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be:
that competent and experienced consultants for the completion of the
Karnafuli-Muhuri Engineering Projects, wou1d be employed on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association (see para 23).
30.       The proposed engineering services constitute a suitable basis
for an IDA credit of US$3.15 million for a term of ten years, including a
two-year grace period.
