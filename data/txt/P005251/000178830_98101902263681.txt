REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN FOR A FIRST DFC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$4.0 million to
the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on standard IDA terms, to help finance the
First DFC project. TY2 Government would relend US$3,675,000 of the proceeds
of the credit to the Industrial Development Bank of Jordan (IDB) for 18 years
with a grace period of 3 years, at 8.85 percent per annum. The balance of
the credit would be used as a grant to help finance IDB's small scale industry
and handicraft program and related study.
PART I - THE ECONOMY I/
2.        An economic mission visited Jordan in February 1976, and its report
entitled "Special Economic Report, Jordan, Review of the Five-Year Plan (1976-
80)" (Report No. 1144-JO dated May 24, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 27, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        The last decade has been an exceptionally difficult period for
Jordan. The 1967 war with Israel resulted in a severe dislocation of econo-
mic activities with the occupation of the West Bank, which accounted for some
35-40 percent of domestic production, and in a large influx of displaced per-
sons to the East Bank. The following years were marked by severe fighting
with Israel in the Jordan Valley, the internal disturbances of 1970 and 1971,
the closure of the Suez Canal for eight years, and of the Syrian and Iraqi
borders for over a year, and four alternate years of drought. As a result,
Jordan's (East Bank) per capita income in 1975, estimated at around US$590,
is probably somewhat lower in real terms than it was in 1966, when more than
a decade of sustained high levels of economic growth was disrupted by the war.
Despite these serious constraints, the Government was able to prevent a sub-
stantial decline in the standards of living of the population, now estimated
at some 2 million in the East Bank, and to progressively restore the effec-
tiveness of public economic policies, and of the use of foreign resources,
especially since 1971. As a result, the economy gradually recovered its pre-
vious vitality.
4.        Before the 1967 war, Jordan's real income grew at about 8 percent
per year. Price stability prevailed, and high levels of foreign assistance
permitted a sustained surplus in the balance of payments. Economic policy
was guided by the objective of phasing out budget support by the mid-1970's
so that foreign aid could be channeled exclusively to development projects.
On the eve of the war, firm budgetary control and resource mobilization ef-
forts appeared to be yielding positive results. In the immediate post-war

period, large budget support payments under the Khartoum Agreement encouraged
a rapid rise in military expenditures and somewhat lessened the pressures for
strict budgetary discipline. The emphasis of economic policy shifted to the
short-run aim of revitalizing the economy through high government expenditures;
government policy also stressed the support and encouragement of the private
sector and the maintenance of price stability by absorbing excess purchasing
power through easy access to imports. These policies shifted the burden of
economic stability on to the balance of payments and profoundly altered the
pattern of resource availability and use towards a greatly increased reliance
on imports. By the early 1970's, the critical task of short-run economic
management had been a-complished and, following the suspension of budget sup-
port from Libya and Kuwait in 1971, the Government began to focus once again
on medium and long-term economic policies. Late in 1971, the Jordan Devel-
opment Board was replaced by the National Planning Council, which was charged
with reactivating economic planning and drawing up a Three-Year Plan for Eco-
nomic Development (1973-75).
Recent Economic Events
5.        As a result of particularly poor agricultural conditions, as well
as slow growth in commerce and services in the wake of the October 1973 war,
economic growth during the Three-Year Plan period (1973-75) averaged around 3
percent per year. Over the same period, the rate of inflation is thought to
have exceeded 14 percent per year on average, compared to an average of about
5 percent per year during 1967-72, and under 2 percent per year for over a
decade prior to that. With sustained high levels of public investment, which
first exceeded private investment in 1974, the rate of capital formation in-
creased from around 16 percent of GDP in 1966 to around 28 percent in 1975
(both at current prices). Public consumption expenditure has also grown
faster than domestic production during this period. This has implied a very
high reliance on imports, both to maintain the pace of aggregate expenditure
growth and to curb inflationary pressures. As a result, the share of net
imports in total available resources increased from 20 percent in 1966 to 30
percent in 1975.
6.        Fiscal performance has been characterized in recent years by rapidly
growing domestic revenues combined with sharp increases in current expenditures
and capital outlays. The buoyancy in domestic revenues, which rose from about
16 percent of GDP prior to the 1967 war to over 25 percent in 1975, reflects
increases in both tax and non-tax revenues (particularly receipts from phos-
phate export royalties). The relative share of direct taxes has increased in
recent years (though still less than 16 percent of total tax receipts and only
10 percent of domestic revenues) primarily due to the expansion of the cor-
porate tax base and greater collection efforts by the authorities. The rapid
rise in current expenditures since 1971 has, to a significant extent, resulted
from the pay increases granted to Government employees to compensate for the
erosion in their real incomes due to the high inflation experienced in the
last few years. The growth of non-defense current expenditures, which com-
prised about 55 percent of current expenditures in 1975 compared to 36 percent
in 1970-71, has in recent years been higher than that of defense expenditures.
The current domestic deficit has remained fairly stable at about US$125 mil-
lion in the last four years, while the overall deficit has grown substantial-
ly. Increasing inflows of external grants (mostly from Arab countries) have
mitigated the need for increased reliance on domestic borrowings.



- 3 -
7.        Despite growing export receipts, expansionary fiscal policies aimed
at reviving the postwar economy and liberal trade policies coupled with peri-
odic supply shortfalls due to a poor harvest led to a gradual widening of
the trade deficit from a stable average level of around US$125 million prior
to the 1967 war and immediately thereafter to over US$570 million in 1975.
Exports of goods and non-factor services almost tripled during 1973-1975.
Commodities leading this growth are phosphate and fruits. Tourism became
again a major foreign exchange earner, accounting for 28 percent of exports
of goods and non-factor services in 1975. On the other hand, imports of goods
and non-factor services grew more than three times during the same period.
The increase in capital goods imports was in particular significant as a
result of the Three Year Plan investments. However, due to the sharp increase
in budget support from Saudi Arabia and other Arab governments in the wake of
the Rabat Conference and rising levels of workers' remittances, which exceeded
commodity export receipts in 1975, the balance of payments was in surplus in
1975 (over US$150 million) for the fourth successive year.
8.        On December 31, 1975, Jordan's external public debt amounted to
US$560 million, of which US$330 million was disbursed (for comparison, 1975
GNP was US$1,100 million). The bulk of the debt is on extremely conces-
sionary terms, with debt contracted during 1970-75 at 2.4 percent annual in-
terest, and 25 years maturity with 6 years grace, on average. The ratio of
debt service payments to exports of goods and non-factor services was 5.0
percent in 1975 and is expected to rise gradually but not exceed 10 percent
by 1980. External reserves at end 1975 amounted to US$530 million gross,
or US$486 million net, in comparison to merchandise imports of US$590 million
in 1975.
Development Planning
9.        The Three-Year Plan was the first Jordanian Plan to be executed
without revision or interruption. The first eighteen months of the Plan,
however, were spent on project formulation and preparation. Implementation,
which did not get started until the middle of the Plan period, suffered from
lack of adequate preparation, monitoring and follow-up, shortage of skilled
and managerial manpower, as well as delays in equipment deliveries and ris-
ing costs, which necessitated updating of feasibility studies and reappraisal
of project proposals. Consequently, the physical rate of implementation of
the Plan projects was low, even though financial disbursements on projects
were high. Nevertheless, the last few years saw the strong re-emergence of
longer-term considerations of economic development in public policies, and
with the considerable experience gained during this period, the stage was
set for the promulgation of the Five-Year Plan (1976-80).
10.       The Five-Year Plan has been drawn around a comprehensive list of
investment projects whiich have been the subject of discussion in Jordan for
a decade or more. Significantly, for the first time in Jordan, executing
ministries were formally involved in the preparation of the plan; and a high-
level ministerial committee deliberated on the setting of priorities. The



- 4 -
fundamental objectives and strategy of the Plan are much the same as those
prior to 1967, and are appropriate for Jordan. The long-term general devel-
opment objective is to phase out the reliance of the economy on budget sup-
port, to concentrate investment on economically justifiable projects that can
contribute to the growth of national income, and to allow increased taxation
and exports. The Plan adopts annual average growth targets for GDP of 12 per-
cent (agriculture, 7 percent; mining and manufacturing, 26.2 percent); mer-
chandise exports, 24.2 percent; with imports curtailed to 7.3 percent (elas-
ticity of 0.6 with respect to GNP). Total investments under the Plan are en-
visaged at JD 765 milion (US$2.3 billion), equivalent to an estimated JD 650
million (US$2.0 billion) at constant 1975 prices, of which 65 percent is al-
located to the public sector (including public investment in the mixed sector).
On these assumptions and with the budget support payments envisaged at JD 60
million per year (US$180 million), the Plan estimates gross foreign borrow-
ing requirements at JD 334 million (US$1.0 billion), of which JD 267 million
(US$810 million) represents public borrowing, while most of the remaining JD
67 million (US$200 million) for the private sector is to be covered by loans
and equity from foreign Arab investors.
11.       The agricultural strategy proposed in the Five-Year Plan is based
on a reassessment of the agricultural potential of the economy, and aims pri-
marily at stabilizing agricultural production and raising productivity, by
major investments in irrigation. It attaches primary emphasis to export-
oriented production, particularly for the growing Middle Eastern markets, of
high-value fruits and vegetables, where Jordan's comparative advantage lies.
12.       The Plan's industrial strategy is to exploit the country's phos-
phate resources, as rapidly as possible, while encouraging exploration for
other minerals; develop with active Government participation, an export-
oriented mineral-based industrial sector (particularly fertilizer and cement);
expand oil refining; and provide strong incentives to the private sector to
develop manufacturing towards import-substitution in the short-run, and ex-
ports in the medium-term. To do this, the Government has committed a large
part of the Five-Year Plan investment (around 30 percent) to the mining and
manufacturing sector, and almost half the increase in domestic output proj-
ected in the Plan is expected from this sector. In encouraging industrial
growth, the Government is conscious of promoting efficiency in resource al-
location, and industrial incentives are being reviewed to eliminate exces-
sive protection. In view of the emigration of Jordanian labor, the pressure
on domestic wages, and the absence of the clear comparative advantage in
labor-intensive production, the Government is increasingly adopting a cau-
tious strategy of higher capital-intensity in industrial production.
Prospects for Economic Growth
13.       With the Government's serious concern with development issues, and
a purposeful effort to restore the momentum of economic growth prevailing in
Jordan prior to the 1967 war, as evidenced in the preparation and adoption



of the Five-Year Plan and in efforts to strengthen planning institutions,
there are good prospects for rapid economic growth in the medium-term, bar-
ring adverse political developments. There is considerable Government con-
cern about the provision of an appropriate policy framework for the success-
ful implementation of Plan objectives and strategy. Even though the size of
the investment program envisaged may tax the physical, human, administrative
and financial resources of Jordan, the relative sectoral emphasis of the in-
vestment program seems well-placed and the bulk of the projects appear to be
at an advanced state of preparation and of high priority.
14.       While the JD 765 million is a target level of investment, the
Government is aware that actual investment may be lower, for a variety of
reasons. With low labor force participation rates, in addition to the high
emigration rate of Jordanian labor to neighboring Arab countries in response
to large wage differentials, the availability of manpower at all levels is
likely to be a major constraint. Rapidly rising government expenditures,
due to the size of the investment program, would exacerbate the already sub-
stantial inflationary pressures. To implement its investment program, Jordan
would require substantial financial assistance. In this connection, a meeting
of major donor countries has been called to present the objectives and require-
ments of the next Development Plan and will take place in Amman at the end of
May 1976. Assuming that the borrowing includes a substantial portion of
concessional aid as well as conventional loans, the debt service would not
represent an excessive burden on the balance of payments.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       Jordan has received twelve IDA credits totalling US$59.8 million
(net of cancellations). Four credits were made before 1967 - two for agri-
cultural credit and two for water supply - and are fully disbursed. Subse-
quently, war and local disturbances (see paragraph 3 above) adversely af-
fected the pace of economic activity and Bank Group lending only resumed in
mid-1971. IDA credits concentrated mainly on the financing of infrastruc-
ture projects such as education, highways, water supply, power and irriga-
tion. Performance under these projects is generally satisfactory. An en-
gineering credit of US$1.0 million to prepare a potash project was also pro-
vided in 1975. A US$6 million IDA credit for a tourism project to develop
the archeological sites of Petra and Jerash has recently been presented to
the Executive Directors. IFC has made two investments in Jordan consisting of
a US$244,000 equity participation and a US$1.6 million loan to Jordan Ceramic
Industries Limited (JCI) in 1974, and also a US$3.1 million equity participa-
tion in the promotion of a phosphatic fertilizer project in 1975. Annex II
contains a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investments as of April
30, 1976, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.



- 6 -
16.       At the Government's request the Bank Group assisted since 1974 in
formulating and mobilizing multilateral financing for a package of develop-
ment projects in the Jordan Valley which have since been included in the cur-
rent Five Year Plan (1976-1980). A large phosphate mining and integrated
transport project is under preparation for Bank Group financing and is ex-
pected to be presented to the Executive Directors in the second half of 1976.
Other large scale projects contemplated include projects in phosphate fertil-
izer and potash, as well as further development of the water resources in the
Jordan Valley. Further Bank projects together with the establishment of in-
dustrial zones and sw-porting services for light manufacturing aim at reduc-
ing the concentration of economic activity in the Amman-Zerka area which is
already suffering from overtaxing of its industrial infrastructure and severe
pollution. Preparatory studies are also underway for projects in rainfed
areas which would expand cereal and livestock production and reduce the
country's dependence on agricultural imports.
17.       The Bank was Executing Agency for a two-year UNDP Planning Assist-
ance Project based in the National Planning Council which was completed in
December 1975. The Bank is Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed study of the
manufacturing industry and industrial estates in Jordan. The first phase,
consisting of a study of the industrial sector, was completed in December
1975. The second phase, consisting of studies of specific industries and
proposals for the establishment of industrial estates during the next Plan
period, is expected to be completed by the second half of 1976.
18.       At the end of 1975, the Bank Group's share in Jordan's external
public debt was estimated at 13 percent, and its share in debt service was
1.4 percent. By 1980 the Bank Group's shares in debt outstanding and in debt
service are expected to be about 3 percent and 4 percent respectively.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
19.       Preliminary results from the 1975 industrial census indicate that
there were 7,478 mining and manufacturing enterprises in the East Bank of
Jordan in 1974, employing some 26,700 people. Value added by the sector
grew from JD 20 million (about US$61 million and 11 percent of GDP), in 1972,
to an estimated JD 45 million (US$136 million and 15.6 percent of GDP) in 1975.
Except during the 196' war and the 1970-71 domestic disturbances, the industrial
production index based on 15 major commodities has increased steadily in the
last decade by an average of about 6 percent per year. The increase was 6.1
percent in 1974, and 7.2 percent in 1975. Currently, industrial activity is
heavily concentrated in the Amman-Zerka area. Although the Three Year Plan
had called for better geographical distribution of industry, progress towards
attaining this goal has been slow as the availability of basic infrastructure
has remained a constraint.



- 7 -
20.       The 1974 employment survey indicated that the 36 largest enterprises
(employing 50 or more workers) accounted for 57 percent of total industrial
employment, and the 8 largest enterprises accounted for 38 percent. Medium
scale enterprises mostly produce non-durable consumer products and are prima-
rily oriented towards import substitution. In recent years, however, their
export role has steadily increased. Their principal products are clothing,
textile, footwear, metal products and food processing. Because of the com-
paratively tight labor market primarily due to emigration of Jordanian labor
to neighboring Arab countries, Jordanian industry is relatively sophisticated
and capital intensive, enabling it to become technologically advanced in
relation to competing industry in neighboring countries. The resulting higher
quality Jordanian products has enhanced their acceptability in these markets.
The small scale industrial sector defined as enterprises employing less than 5
workers comprises 90 percent of all industrial establishments and employs some
10,800 workers. Institutional support for this subsector has been lacking
until recently. This subsector is a mixture of very small scale industries,
handicrafts and household or "cottage" industries. Stone cutting and car-
pentry are typical examples of small scale industry in Amman, tailoring and
traditional embroidery are examples of Jordan's cottage industries while
pottery and wood carving are among the most popular handicrafts.
21.       The large scale enterprises in Jordan enjoy substantial Government
support and in many cases Government participation in ownership and the small
scale sector is beginning to attract attention from government agencies and IDB
because of its substantial economic potential. Incentives for industry are
provided under the Encouragement of Investment Law. Projects approved under
this law are exempted from income and social services tax for six years (nine
outside the Amman-Zerka area), from customs duties and other import charges on
fixed assets during project implementation, and building and land taxes for 5
years (seven outside the Amman-Zerka area). Projects located outside the
Amman-Zerka area may also be provided with free tracts of Government land.
Foreign capital is given similar privileges plus the freedom to repatriate
profits and interest earned on foreign investment, and salaries earned by
expatriate staff. Industrial projects must have fixed assets of at least JD
5,000 (US$15,200) excluding land to qualify for these incentives while tourism
projects must have fixed assets of at least JD 15,000 (US$45,500). Between
1972 and 1975, 105 projects with capital investment totalling JD 21 million
(US$64.1 million) were approved under this incentive scheme. Other incentives
include tariff protection, especially from competing imports from non-Arab
countries. Tariffs typically range from 10-30 percent; however, for a few
items particularly important in local manufacturing and based on local raw
materials such as confectionery, shoes, furniture, and tomato sauce, tariffs
exceed 50 percent. Imports from the Arab Common Market (Egypt, Syria, Iraq,
and Jordan) and imports under trade agreements with countries of the Council
of Arab Economic Unity compete with Jordan's industry without tariff barriers.
22.       Under the Licensing and Control of Industries Instructions of 1973
new industrial or tourist establishments are set up, modernized or expanded
only after a license has been obtained from the Ministry of Industry and Trade
or the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. Until about two years ago, the



- 8 -
Government attempted to avoid "wasteful" competition by restricting the number
of establishments in each field to what it felt the domestic market could
sustain. However, because of the limited domestic market, many enterprises
successfully turned to foreign markets. Encouraged by this trend, the Govern-
ment has adopted a more liberal approach in granting licenses. This liberal
approach has not led to excess capacity.
23.       The financial sector in Jordan consists of the Central Bank, 11 com-
mercial banks, 6 specialized credit institutions including IDB, and some 25
insurance companies and agencies. The Post Office began a savings funds in
September 1974.
24.       Commercial bank loans to industry accounted for only 12 percent of
total bank lending of JD 121.4 million (US$368 million) outstanding at the
end of 1975. In addition, commercial banks in Jordan are quite liquid with
Government bonds and deposits with the Central Bank constituting 11 percent
and 15 percent of total assets respectively, at the end of 1975. Commercial
bank loans to the industrial sector consist mainly of bill discounting, and
short-term loans and advances. Although commercial banks are reluctant to
commit substantial amounts for term lending to industry, they frequently roll
over their short-term advances for established clients. Commercial banks
rarely lend to the small scale industrial sector mainly because of lack of
security.
25.       The six specialized credit institutions for agriculture, housing,
industry and village development are each incorporated under a special law and
extend medium- and long-term credit for specific purposes in these sectors.
The insurance companies invest in real estate, Government securities and to a
limited extent in equities of large industrial enterprises. IDB is the only
major institutional source of long-term financing for the medium and small
scale industrial sectors.
26.       By 1975, inflation had caused term interest rates to become negative
and to fall out of line with trends in the international capital market. To
reverse this trend and encourage the channeling of private savings into the
banking system, the Central Bank, on January 1, 1976, raised the minimum
interest payable by commercial banks on savings and time deposits from 2.5-3.5
percent to 5-5.5 percent per annum. The commercial banks' prime lending rates
were also raised from 6.5 percent to at least 7.5 percent per annum. The re-
cent increase in the long-term lending rate of IDB from 8 percent to 9 percent
should be seen in the light of this general overhaul of the interest rate
structure in Jordan. There are currently clear signs that the inflation rate
is slowly moving downward and the Government believes that these increases
represent the maximum that is appropriate. In addition to the increase in
term interest rates, a 75 percent credit-deposit ratio was imposed on commer-
cial banks and the growth of credit for short-term loans and advances in the
first six months of 1976 was limited to 10 percent above the level extended in
the previous six months. Furthermore, effective March 1, 1976, commercial
banks were subjected to an additional 3 percent reserve requirement for all
overdrafts except on loans to joint stock industrial establishments. In
February 1976, the Government established a pension fund which is likely to
become an additional source of term financing for the industrial sector.



- 9 -
27.       The Five Year Plan (1976-80) calls for the industrial sector's
contribution to GDP to grow from 15.6 percent in 1975 to 28.3 percent by 1980.
Income from industry is expected to grow by 26.2 percent annually and total
investments during the Plan period is expected to reach JD 229 million (US$694
million) or about 30 percent of total planned investments. Most of the
planned industrial development would be concentrated in a few large-scale
projects such as phosphate mining and phosphate fertilizer, potash extraction,
expansion of the oil refinery and a new cement plant. The Government has
already started implementing several of these projects. It is expected that
the private sector would invest about JD 35 million (US$106 million) in medium
and small scale industries. In order to foster greater dispersion of industry,
the Plan calls for the establishment of several industrial estates around the
country.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The Industrial Development Bank of Jordan (IDB) was established in
1965 in accordance with a special Law which provides IDB with certain pri-
vileges and powers not available to other companies. The proposed credit
would constitute the first Bank Group financial assistance to IDB. The Proj-
ect was appraised in November 1975 and negotiations took place in Washington
in April 1976. The Jordanian delegation was headed by Mr. Ziyad Annab,
General Manager of IDB. An appraisal report on IDB (No. 1018a-JO) dated
June 3, 1976, is being distributed separately. A Credit and Project Summary
is attached as Annex III.
IDB's Objectives and Role in the Economy
29.       Since its inception in 1965 and under the leadership of its General
Manager, IDB has developed into a well-managed institution. IDB's invest-
ment decisions are generally based on sound financial, technical and economic
criteria. The IDB Law provides it with a mandate to finance private indus-
trial, tourism, and mining projects in Jordan, through loans, equity participa-
tions, underwriting and guarantees. IDB is also to assist in developing a stock
market and in encouraging the private ownership of shares and bonds, to provide
technical assistance, to promote new projects, and to help small industries.
30.        IDB has so far concentrated its efforts in making loans to indus-
trial and tourism projects and providing these clients with assistance in the
fields of financial management and project preparation in particular.     However,
in March 1975, IDB expanded its activities to assist very small entrepreneurs
through its small scale industry and handicraft program. IDB expects to
become active in promoting new projects during the Five Year Plan period. Its
overall activities are guided by a statement of investment policy which, to-
gether with provisions in IDB's Law, provide a satisfactory framework within
which IDB can carry out its operations.



- 10 -
Resoures of IDB
31.       IDB's subscribed share capital amounts to JD 2.24 million (US$6.8 mil-
lion), divided into JD 1.11 million (US$3.36 million) ordinary shares held by
by the Jordanian private sector and foreign investors. The IDB Law provides
that the preference shares carry a minimum 6 percent tax free dividend guar-
anteed by the Government and that their nominal value is guaranteed by the
Government in case of liquidation. Other than these provisions and the
voting procedures for the Board of Directors, the two classes of shares are
equal.
32.       Until 1974, IDB's resources were dominated by equity.     In recent
years, however, IDB has drawn heavily on. the Central Bank's discount facility
and on lines of credit from KfW and the Kuwait Fund. Its debt/equity ratio
rose from 0.2:1 at the end of 1972 to 1.3:1 at the end of 1975. The first KfW
loan of DM 3 million (US$1.2 million) was made in 1972. A second loan from
KfW of DM 5 million (US$2.0 million) was provided in 1974 and a third loan
totalling DM 10 million (US$4.0 million) is anticipated around the end of
1976. The first KfW loan is to be repaid in 20 years beginning in 1982 at 4.5
percent per annum. Two percent is paid to KfW; the remaining 2.5 percent (out
of the 4.5 percent interest payment) is retained in a special fund to be used
for mutually agreed purpose (See para. 36). The second KfW loan has similar
terms. The Kuwait Fund made its first loan of KD 1.0 million (US$3.3 million)
in 1974; a second loan of KD 2.5 million (US$8.5 million) was signed in May,
1976. The first Kuwait Fund loan is to be repaid in 12 years beginning in
1980 at 4 percent per annum. IDB is allowed an interest spread of 2.5 percent
and the difference of 2.5 percent (at IDB's current lending rate of 9 percent)
is also retained by IDB in a special fund to be used for purposes to be agreed
upon by IDB and the Kuwait Fund. The terms of the second Kuwait Fund loan are
not yet available. In spite of its foreign borrowing, IDB has had to use its
local currency resources to cover part of the foreign exchange needs of its
borrowers. It is the Government's and IDB's stated policy, however, that IDB
should use its local currency resources only to finance local purchases, rely-
ing on foreign borrowings to finance foreign purchases. IDB intends to follow
this policy as closely as possible in the future; the proposed credit would
allow it to do so at least through mid-1978 when the credit is expected to be
fully committed.
Operations
33.       The year-to-year trend in IDB's loan approvals reflects the changing
political situation. After a promising first full year of operation in 1966
(approvals totalled almost JD 1 million), business dropped drastically in 1967
to about half of the level the year before; and by 1969 had only recovered to
about 80 percent of the 1966 level. The internal disturbances in 1970 and
1971 led to another slump in business. Since 1972, however, loan approvals
have continually reached new yearly highs and totalled over JD 2.4 million
(US$7.3 million) in 1975. This reflects the political stabiliity within
Jordan and the resulting improved investment climate.



- 11 -
34.       From its inception in 1965 to December 1975, IDB approved 285 loans
for a total of JD 10.3 million (US$31 million) including 45 loans for tourism
projects for a total of JD 1.57 million (US$4.8 million). Major categories of
IDB's loans by amount were as follows: 22.5 percent for food, beverage, and
tobacco; 18.6 percent for chemicals, rubber, and plastic products; 15.2 per-
cent for tourism; 10.1 percent for leather; the remaining 33.6 percent was
distributed among several other industrial categories. Over half of the
loans-have been for amounts less than JD 20,000 (US$60,600). The average
size of the 285 loans approved by the end of 1975 was about JD 36,200
(US$109,700) with the average size of the 41 loans approved during 1975 being
JD 59,400 (US$180,000). In recent years most of IDB's loans have had a re-
payment period of between five and seven years plus a grace period of about
a year and a half. The enterprises assisted by IDB have been heavily con-
centrated in the Amman-Zerka area, reflecting the general pattern in Jordan.
35.       IDB's West Bank portfolio, frozen since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war,
consists of 56 loans for JD 481,000 (US$1.5 million), or about 9 percent of
outstanding portfolio on December 31, 1975. Forty-six loans for JD 225,000
(US$682,000) of the principal outstanding were made by IDB's predecessor,
the Industrial Development Fund, and were transferred to IDB as part of
the Government's equity contribution when IDB was first established. IDB
is considering asking the Government to reassume responsibility for these
loans. Most of the West Bank loans IDB made itself are for hotels in
Jerusalem and IDB considers these loans sound and collectible once a
political settlement is reached. Loans in arrears in the East Bank repre-
sented 5 percent of IDB's portfolio on December 31, 1975.
36.       IDB has recently expanded its activities to include assistance to
very small-enterprises, defined.as employing up to five people and using
manual production methods or simple machinery. Small service establishments
and traditional handicrafts are also included. This experimental small scale
industry and handicraft program is being funded by yearly grants of JD 100,000
(US$303,000) each from the Government and the Central Bank and by smaller
amounts available from the special funds to be established with the Kuwait
Fund second loan and KfW's first credit. For additional funds, if needed, IDB
can borrow from the Central Bank at a preferential interest rate of 4 percent
against the promissory notes of its small scale clients. The cost of operating
this program is to be accounted for separately from IDB's normal activities,
and those costs not covered by the 7 percent per annum interest rate charged
to borrowers under the program will be met-from the grant funds mentioned
above. The-7 percent interest rate is seen as a necessary encouragement for
these entrepreneur-s to approach IDB for funds to improve their operations.
Moreover these small scale clients presently do not benefit from substantial
investment incentives (para. 21) available to larger investors and the lower
interest rate may-be seen as a form of compensation for this exclusion.
37.       Since the program's inception in March, 1975 to the end of 1975,
129 loan applications had been-received by IDB. Of these 52 were approved,



- 12 -
totalling JD 72,200 (US$218,800). Nine loans were later cancelled, leaving a
net total of 43 loans amounting to JD 57,700 (US$174,800) or an average of JD
1,340 (US$4,100) per loan. IDB estimates that these 43 projects will create
71 new jobs at an average cost of about US$2,800 equivalent per job. IDB has
established some general criteria for this program, though at this early stage
flexibility is being stressed. The maximum size of loans granted under the
program is JD 2,000 (US$6,100); no minimum size has been set. Loans can be
granted for up to ten years and can be used only to finance machinery and
tools. In general, IDB will lend up to 80 percent of the cost of such equip-
ment, but no more than 75 percent of the total cost of the project. As
security, IDB will take a mortgage on real estate if any is available; other-
wise it will mortgage the machinery and accept personal guarantees.
38.       This is the first institutional effort in Jordan to reach small
entrepreneurs. IDB hopes to build its experience over the first 1-1/2 to 2
years of implementation of the program. The proposed credit contains a
US$300,000 component which the Government would pass on to IDB as a grant for
this program to be committed between July 1976 and June 1978. The IDA funds
would finance an estimated 20 percent of the program during this period.
These grant arrangements are based on the fact that the risks of the program's
portfolio are expected to be high because of simplified appraisal and supervi-
sion. Once the program's risk can be fully assessed in the light of the loan
repayment experience during the experimental phase, IDB could consider dif-
ferent methods of funding the program. Moreover, financing part of the
program with Bank Group funds would ensure that the Bank Group is intimately
involved with the program and gains with IDB, the maximum possible knowledge
of this subsector. The program will be closely monitored by the Bank Group
through extensive reporting and frequent visits to Jordan. A sample (every
tenth) of appraisal reports will be translated and sent to Washington for
review. Quarterly summary reports covering such areas as applications
received, approved and rejected, amounts disbursed, repayment experience,
problems detected, assistance provided and operating costs will be prepared
and sent to Washington. Disbursements will be made periodically and will
cover 20 percent of IDB's total disbursement under the program in line with
the proportion of funds to be provided by the Bank Group (Section 2.02 (a)
(ii) of the Development Credit Agreement). The foreign exchange component
of the loans under the program will certainly be well above the portion to be
financed from the proposed credit.
39.       The proposed credit also contains a US$25,000 component which would
be used by the Government to fund a special study of the small scale indus-
trial sector (Section 2.02(iii) of the Development Credit Agreement). The
study is intended to review the present and prospective markets available
to small scale entrepreneurs, their need for services such as water and power,
their impact on urban development, in particular. This study and the experi-
ence gained through IDB's small industries program are expected to lay the
basis for future Bank Group involvement with the small scale industrial
subsector. IDB and the Faculty of Economics and Commerce at the University of



- 13 -
Jordan have prepared a proposal for this study which has been reviewed and
agreed to by the Association.
Management and Organization
40.       IDB's Board of Directors has nine members.   Three represent the
Government, two represent shareholding commercial banks, one represents the
Chamber of Industries with the remaining three representing preference share-
holders other than commercial banks. The Board meets about 14 times a year.
It determines general policy and approves all loans over JD 10,000 (US$30,300)
and all equity in;estments. Approval of loans under JD 10,000 has been
delegated to a Loan Committee consisting of the General Manager, his deputy
and the four division heads.
41.       IDB's staff has grown substantially in recent years (from about 18,
including 8 professionals at the end of 1971 to 35, including 21 professionals
at the end of 1975), reflecting the growing volume of business. It is well
trained and highly motivated. Morale is excellent, reflecting the above-average
working conditions and remuneration and especially the open and participatory
style of management. The General Manager, Mr. Ziyad Annab, is experienced and
capable and has provided strong and effective leadership. His deputy and the
division heads are well qualified for their positions.
42.       IDB's appraisal procedures are generally satisfactory.   Recently,
IDB has begun to calculate the internal financial rate of return on projects,
and will soon begin also to calculate the internal economic rate of return.
It was agreed during negotiations that IDB would calculate the internal
economic rate of return on all projects above the free limit that it submits
to the Association for review unless it can convincingly demonstrate that this
calculation will not be materially different from the calculation of the in-
ternal financial rate of return which it calculated for the project. While
appraisal work has steadily improved in recent years, IDB's management is
aware that further improvements can be made. It anticipates that an asso-
ciation with the Bank Group will be helpful in this regard.
43.       IDB's supervision work, assigned to a separate division only in
1971, is still undergoing development and refinement. It is clear that IDB
recognizes the importance of this work and it is continually strengthening
its capabilities in this area. Again, its management is aware that more needs
to be done and hopes to utilize Bank Group assistance to improve its supervi-
sion work.
Interest Rates
44.       IDB's effective lending rate has been increased to 9 percent per
annum from the 8 percent per annum that has been in effect since its estab-
lishment. All IDB's loans are denominated in Jordanian Dinars; the Govern-
ment bears the foreign exchange risk.

Financial Results
45.       Net profits in 1975 represented a return of 5.3 percent on average
shareholders' equity, a relatively low figure but an improvement over prior
years since the average return was 4.8 percent between 1972 and 1975. This
is the result of IDB's low leverage and the fact that IDB realizes no income
from its West Bank portfolio, frozen since the 1967 war. With greater use of
borrowed funds in the future, return on equity is forecast to improve. Fi-
nancial expenses are increasing as IDB uses more borrowed funds to finance
its operations. The ratio of financial expenses to average total assets
increased from 0.6 percent in 1972 to 2.5 percent in 1975. Administrative
expense as a proportion of average total assets increased slightly from
1.5 percent in 1972 to 1.7 percent in 1975. Because of IDB's limited use of
borrowed funds its financial expenses are low, but its administrative expenses
are in line with those of other comparable DFC's.
46.        IDB's balance sheet indicates a healthy position.    With a debt/equity
ratio of only 1.3:1 at the end of 1975, IDB has the capacity to carry substan-
tially larger amounts of debt. Its current ratio has been maintained at
around 3:1 between 1971 and 1975. The overall picture reflects the rather
conservative approach taken during IDB's initial years when a solid basis was
being established for IDB's future growth.
Economic Impact of IDB's Operations
47.       During the last Three Year Plan (1973-1975), it is estimated that
projects financed by IDB accounted for 75 percent of private investment in
medium scale industry. Although only 15 percent of IDB's loans were made to
tourism projects during the Plan period, it is estimated that IDB was asso-
ciated with 90 percent of all investment in this sector during the Plan
period. The 28 industrial projects and 9 tourism projects assisted in 1974
accounted for the creation of 691 and 194 new jobs respectively. The average
cost per job created was JD 8,800 (US$26,700) for new projects and JD 7,300
(US$22,100) for expansion projects, which is not excessive given the relative
sophistication of Jordanian industrial sector. The economic impact of IDB's
existing small-scale industry and handicraft program is difficult to measure
at this early stage. However, it is expected to raise the skills, productiv-
ity and income level of small entrepreneurs.
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
48.        IDB's business prospects for the five years covered by its forecasts
are good. Applications under study at the end of October 1975 involved a po-.
tential investment of some JD 8 million (US$24 million). This is substantial
in relation to the Plan investment target for the entire Five Year Plan period
of JD 35 million (US$106 million) in medium and small scale industry. IDB
expects to commit a total of JD 18.7 million (US$57 million) over this period
and to disburse a total of JD 17.1 million (US$52 million) or about one-third
of the Plan target. This contribution would be proportional to that achieved
by IDB during the Three Year Plan.



- 15 -
49.       IDB expects to continue to rely on borrowing all of its local cur-
rency requirements from the Central Bank; however, all of its foreign currency
requirements would be borrowed from abroad. Its present uncommitted foreign
lines of credit and the anticipated second Kuwait Fund loan will cover its
foreign exchange needs through mid-1976.    During the two-year period starting
in July 1976, IDB expects to commit some-US$14.4 million in foreign exchange.
The uncommitted portion of the anticipated second Kuwait Fund loan and the
expected third KfW loan would cover almost US$11 million of this, leaving a
gap of about US$3.7 million which the proposed credit would fill.
50.       IDB's projected financial results indicate steady improvement in
profitability and a continuing sound financial position. The debt-equity
ratio is forecast to grow from 2.1:1 at the end of 1976 to 3.8:1 at the end of
1980; this is within the limit of 4:1 proposed in the credit documents (Sec-
tion 3.05 of the draft: Project Agreement). Interest coverage is expected
to be maintained at about 1.5 times. Total debt service coverage is forecast
to be satisfactory with loan collections exceeding by a substantial margin
repayments on borrowings.
Terms of the Proposed Credit
51.       The proposed US$4 million credit would be made available to the Gov-
ernment on standard IDA terms. The US$3,675,000 portion of the credit ear-
marked for IDB's normal lending to the medium scale industrial and tourism
sectors would be relent to IDB by the Government for 18 years, including 3 years
of grace, at 8.85 percent per annum, and would be utilized by IDB to meet the
foreign exchange cost of directly imported goods and services; IDB would
relend these proceeds at an interest rate of at least 9 percent per annum and
for a period of no longer than 15 years. The free limit would be US$150,000
and the aggregate free limit, US$1.8 million (Section 2.02(c) of the Develop-
ment Credit Agreement). The maximum amount of the credit to be used for a
single investment project would be US$500,000. The Government would bear the
foreign exchange risk and would be repaid by IDB in accordance with a fixed
amortization schedule. The US$300,000 portion earmarked for IDB's small scale
industries and handicraft program would be provided to IDB by the Government
as a grant and would be disbursed to cover 20 percent of the loan IDB makes to
these clients. The US$25,000 portion earmarked for the study of the small
scale industry subsector would be used by the Government to cover the local
and foreign costs of the study.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND'AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and IDB, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V



- 16 -
Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution
approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
53.       Features of the draft Development Credit and Project Agreements of
special interest are referred to in paragraphs 38, 39, 50 and 51 of this
Report. Otherwise, the draft agreements conform to the normal pattern of
Credits for development finance companies.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed devel-
opment credit.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Cr. No. 262:   Highway Project; US$6.0 Million Credit of June 28, 1971;
Date of Effectiveness: August 16, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project includes the construction of a highway from Amman to
Zerka and the financing of a study to determine the most suitable means of
distributing traffic from this new road within Amman. Completion of the
road construction works has been delayed for over two years from its original
date of September 1973, due mainly to implementation capacity of the local
contractor. Total construction costs have increased by about 15 percent due
to this delay, changes in specifications and local and world inflation. The
Closing Date, originally December 31, 1974, has been extended twice, to June
30, 1976.
Cr. No. 285:   Education Project; US$5.4 Million Credit of February 11, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: July 27, 1972;
Closing Date: April 30, 1977
The project includes construction and equipping of two comprehen-
sive secondary schools, a polytechnic and.trade training center, a teacher's
training college for preparatory and secondary schools, and extension of an
agricultural teacher training college and related technical assistance. All
contracts for civil works were awarded to local firms on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding. Contracts were signed in May 1974, and construc-
tion started in early June 1974. Following initial delays, construction is
progressing satisfactorily with implementation now scheduled for completion
by April 30, 1977; consequently the Closing Date was extended by one year to
April 30, 1977. Cost overruns are expected to be about 35 percent and will
be met by the Government. About 95 percent of equipment and all furniture
has been procured; however, installation has lagged behind due to lack of
central storage facilities and poor logistical planning.
Cr. No. 385:   Amman Wiater Supply and Sewerage Project; US$8.7 Million;
Credit of May 24, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project aims at alleviating serious water shortages and insuf-
ficiency of sewerage services in Amman, reducing the high percentage of unac-
counted for water, and developing the administrative structure of the entity
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

responsible for Amman's water supply and sewerage systems. The project is
progressing satisfactorily and procurement is on schedule. Total project
costs are still within appraisal estimates. The leak detection survey was
completed in March 1975 and some improvements have been achieved in reducing
the high unaccounted for water through repair of major leaks and improved
billing and collection procedures. Proposals for a revised tariff structure
have recently been completed and are being reviewed by the Government.
Cr. No. 386:  Power Project; US$10.2 Million Credit of May 24, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: August 21, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The Project is to help the conversion from diesel to steam powered
generation by adding two 33 MW steam generating units and one 12 MW gas tur-
bine, all to be installed at a new power station at Zerka, near Amman and by
providing management consultancy services to assit the Jordan Electricity
Authority in organizing and expanding its power generation and transmission
operations. Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily and, despite ini-
tial delays, the gas turbine unit was commissioned in May 1975. Project com-
pletion is expected by September 1977.
Cr. No. 498: Northeast Ghor Irrigation and Rural Development Project;
US$7.5 Million Credit of July 25, 1974; Date of Effectiveness:
August 1, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project is part of an overall development scheme for the East
Bank of the Jordan Valley, other parts of which will be financed by the German
Federal Republic, USAID, and the Kuwait Fund. The project consists of the
agricultural development of 7,700 ha net, of which 6,660 ha are already under
irrigation, and the provision of rural facilities for domestic water supply,
health, education, roads, and community development for a population of about
25,000. The Contract for the main irrigation works has been approved and
contracts for the supply of equipment for operations and maintenance and for
research and extension services have been awarded. The project is a year be-
hind schedule and progress in implementation has been unsatisfactory; on the
basis of bids received, a cost overrun of about 131 percent in total project
cost is expected. The Government has been requested to take steps to ensure
that additonal funds are available for the project. Recently, project manage-
ment and planning has improved through an increase in staff at the Jordan
Valley Commission, the executing agency.
Cr. No. 534: Second Education Project; US$6.0 Million Credit of March 12, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: June 16, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1981
The project is designed to expand vocational and technical education,
to promote quality improvements in secondary education by replacing uneconomic-
ally small, rented school buildings and providing schools with adequate work-
shops, and to support integrated rural development projects in the Jordan
Valley through a pilot scheme of non-formal basic education. The project



ANNEX II

includes construction, furniture and equipment for the following institu-
tions: a Polytechnic at Irbid; a training complex at Aqaba; a Hotel Training
School at Amman; three comprehensive secondary schools; extension of prepara-
tory and secondary schools (seven pre-vocational workshops; five science lab-
oratories, four women's craft centers); and a rural development center. Im-
plementation of the project is proceeding satisfactorily. Despite financial
constraints on UNDP, recruitment of experts and the awarding of fellowships
by UNDP and bilateral agencies is proceeding satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 570: Second Power Project; US$5.0 Million Credit of July 7, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: November 18, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
The project adds 32 megawatts to total generating capacity. It
also includes reconditioning of the diesel-electric power station at Marqa
and a Power Development Study for Southern Jordan. On the basis of bids re-
ceived, a cost overrun in total project cost of about 14 percent is expected;
implementation of all project components is proceeding satisfactorily.
Cr. No. S-19: Potash Engineering Credit; US$1.0 Million of July 7, 1975;
Not Yet Effective; Closing Date: July 31, 1977
The credit will help meet part of the cost of a feasibility study,
estimated at US$10.0 million, for the construction of trial dikes for the
production of potash from Dead Sea brine via solar evaporation. USAID is
providing US$6.0 million and the Arab Potash Company (APC), the executing
agency, is providing US$3.0 million from equity funds. The USAID loan was
signed in March 1976 but is not yet effective because of a delayed selection
of a contractor to undertake the civil works. The effectiveness of the
Association credit is contingent upon effectiveness of the USAID loan.
