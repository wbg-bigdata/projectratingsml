OBJECTIVES OF RESETTLE MENT PLAN AND DEFINITION OF RESETTLEMENT
TERMINOLOGY
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is prepared according to the Laws and Regulations
of PRC and locat government, as well as the policy of Non-Voluntary Resettlement,
Operational Policy OP/BP 4.12 of the World Bank. The purpose of this document is to set out
an action plan for the Resettlement and Rehabilitation of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs)
to ensure that they will benefit from the project and their standards of living will improve or at
least be restored after the project impact.
Acquisition of land and other assets for the project will adversely affect the livelihood of
persons who live, work or earn their living on the land. PAPs are defined as those persons
whose income or livelihoods will be adversely affected by land acquisition for the project.
PAPs include the following categories:
a) persons who have a title, right and interest, in structures (houses, shelters,
enterprises or public buildings), land (including residential, public infrastructure, agricultural,
forest, grazing and sideline land) or any other asset acquired or possessed, in full or in part,
permanently or temporarily;
b) persons who use the structures, land or assets described above; or persons whose
business, occupation, work, place of residence or habitat adversely affected; or
c) persons whose standard of living is adversely affected as a consequence of land
acquisition and/or resettlement activities.
Therefore all such persons who are affected will need to considered and recorded as
PAPs, regardless of their legal connection to assets, land or location.
All PAPs are entitled to the improvement or at least restoration of their standards of living,
and compensation for the material losses they suffer. Compensation for assets will cover
replacement cost. No deductions or discounts will be applied to the compensation amount for
depreciation or other reasons. All PAPs deriving an economic benefit from the affected land
and property are entitled to receive rehabilitation benefits in addition to the compensation for
their assets lost. Those PAPs without title, authorization or legal permission to reside,
conduct business, cultivate land or construct structures are eligible for rehabilitation of their
livelihoods and compensation for their assets on an equal footing with those with formal legal
title, authorization or permission to the assets.
The term RESETTLEMENT includes:
RESETTLEMENT and REHABILITATION means: the resettlement of PAPs' productive
activities or lifestyles and the restoration of the PAPs' resource capacity to continue with
productive activities or lifestyles at a level higher or at least equal to that before the project, it
includs:
a) Relocation of living area;
b) finding acceptable new employment for those whose jobs are affected;
c) restoration (or compensation) of affected productive resources such as land,
workplaces, trees and infrastructure;
d) restoration of other adverse effects (such as pollution and harmfall gas) on PAPs'
living standards (quality of life) through land acquisition and relocation;
e) restoration of or compensation for affected private and public enterprises;
f) restoration of adversely affected on cultural or common property.
I



The objective of this RAP is to provide a plan for the resettlement and rehabilitation of the
PAPs so that their losses will be compensated and their standards of living will be improved
or at least restored to the pre-project levels in a sustainable manner. In order to reach this
goal, the plan offers the restoration measure so that the income of project affected persons
will be restored to the pre-project levels in a sustainable manner. In addition, the affected
business and production resource (including shop and enterprise), public facilities,
infrastructure and cultural facilities will be improved or at least restored to their pre-project
levels.

1.1 Project Background
1.1.1 Existing conditions
The Zhe-Gan Railway runs within Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, starting in the
east from Hangzhou, Yiwu, Jinhua, Shangrao, Hengfeng, Guixi, Yingtan, Xiangtang,
Pingxiang to Zhuzhou in the west, totally 942.648km long. This railway connects the Hu-Hang
Railway, Xuan-Hang Railway and Xiao-Yong Railway at its east end, and links the
Jing-Guang Railway and Xiang-Qian Railway at its west end. It runs across the Jing-Jiu,
Ying-Xia, Wan-Gan, Heng-Nan and Jin-Wen railways. The Zhe-Gan Railway serves for
passengers and goods transportation between the East China Region, South China Region
and Southwest China Region, and is the busiest railway trunk connecting the east and west of
China and the important component of the "8 -Longitudinal-plus-8-Transverse Railway
Network" and the "4-Longitudinal- plus-4-Transverse Express Railway Network" of China.
The Railway is under the jurisdiction of three railway bureaus, i.e., Shanghai, Nanchang
and Guangtie Railway Group, respectively managing the railway section KO+000-
K324+531.59 (324.634km long, by Hangzhou Branch of Shanghai Railway Bureau), railway
section K324+531.59-K889+670 (563.138km long, by Nanchang Railway Bureau) and
railway section K889+670-K944+546 (54.876km long, by Changsha Company of Guantie
Group).
From Hangzhou to Zhuzhou, the Zhe-Gan Railway has 111 railway stations (including six
complex railway stations at Hangzhou, five at Yingtan, four at Nanchang and two at Zhuzhou),
42 railway stations under the management of Shanghai Bureau, 62 under Nanchang Bureau
and 7 under Guantie Group. Along the railway length, there are four key passenger stations
(i.e., Hangzhou, Jinhuaxi, Yingtan, and Zhuzhou), two marshalling stations (i.e., Yingtandong
and Xiangtangxi) and one regional station (Jinhuadong).
1.1.2 Necessity of of railway electrification
The traveling speed-raising of the Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification has great profound
significance not only in the state's energy policy adjustment and energy source restructuring,
lowering of environmental pollution, improving environmental quality, but also in
self-development of railway transprtation industry, enhancing the capability of trunk railway in
the network, increasing trunk railway quality, raising train traveling speed, updating the
service level, strengthening the competitiveness in transportation market, decreasing the
operation cost, increasing the benefit of railway transportation and realizing the sustainable
development of the railway transportation industry. At the same time, the scientific and
technological level in railway transportation industry can be heightened and modernization of
railway service can be promoted. Therefore, it is of great importance to raise the
transportation speed of the Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification.
A. Necessary for state's energy policy adjustment and energy source restructuring
energy utilization
Taking electricity as driving power can facilitate using of wide range of natural resources,
which enable the state to use the energy in an economically rational way, and is favorable to
realize common-sharing of resources and optimum distribution of resources. This can avoid
additional long-distance transportation cost caused by oil consumption of railway itself, avoid
the non-normal oil loss in storage and transportation, thus, reducing the operational cost of
railway operation. This will safeguard the energy supply and prevents the impact of oil price
rise caused by the international oil price escalation, thus, getting rid of the impact of oil crisis
and obviating the risk. This is also beneficial in take the full advantages of the electric
facilities along the railway route and in solving the environmental pollution caused by burning
of diesel oil, thus, promoting the environment-friendly development of energy industry.
Therefore, rebuilding of the Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification fully reflects the state's energy
3



policy, coincides with the state's orientation in energy development, benefit the
implementation of sustainable development strategy of the country. It is the need for state's
energy policy adjustment and energy source restructuring energy utilization.
B. Favorable to rational distribution of electrified railways
The China's Main Technical Policy for Railways points out that electric power driving
method should be adopted along the main busy trunk railways, express railway, specific
coal-transporting railways, and railways on long inclined slopes and in long tunnels. As a key
trunk railway, the electrification of Zhe-Gan Railway will contribute to realizing of electrified
railway network in Each China.
C. Necessary for improving operational conditions and shooting at even greater
market shares
The rebuilding of Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification will be favorable to raising the
passenger train traveling speed, and arranging passenger trains arriving destinations with a
half day, and will improve the service condition to a great extent by which the passengers and
cargo owner can be satisfied in traveling speed requirement, cosiness, quickness and
keeping on schedule, thus, well positioning the railway service in the future transportation
market.
D. Necessary for raising traveling speed, lowering operation cost and increasing
benefits
The Zhe-Gan Railway will not only increase the traveling speed, greatly improve the
conditions of attracting passengers, satisfy the demand of transportation volume and
enhance the competitiveness in transportation market, but also expedite the circulation of the
locomotives and compartments, thus, lowering the operation cost and the benefit of the
railway utilization.
E. Favorable for reducing pullution to environment and improving environmental
conditions
After electrification of the railway, except few internal-combustion engine locomotives
which will be used for local branch railways, the Zhe-Gan Railway will totally adopt
electric-power driven locomotives, which will greatly reduce the pollutant emmision volume. It
is estimated that the quantity of emitted smoke volume will be reduced by 38.6%, S02 by
26.7%, NOX by 87% and CO by 48.5%. The energy consumption will be reduced by 250500
tons, and the local environment along the railway routes and around the machine repair spots
will be definitely improved.
1.1.3 Significance of the project
The Zhe-Gan Railway is the core section of the Shanghai - Kunming Passage, and
serves for most of passengers and goods exchange between the East China Region, South
China Region and Southwest China Region. The southwestern China has abundant unique
resources and is a labor souse concentrated area, thus, having strong economic
complementary effect with the East China Region. Along with implementation of
Western-Development Strategy, the social and economic deveopment in the western China
has geared up on quick track, the communication between the east and west will be more and
more tightend and frequent. The Zhe-Gan and Jing-Jiu railways will jointly provide a simpliest
and quickest in-land passage between the Yangtze River Delta and Zhujian River Delta, and
will provide a good condition for enhancing the connection between the two major economic
developed areas. Meanwhile, the Zhe-Gan Railway is also one of the key passages in the
East China Region. Therefore, the Zhe-Gan Railway plays an important role in connecting the
eastern and western and southern China as well as the internal connection of East China
Region, promoting the economic development in the areas along the railway routes, and
implementing Western-Development Strategy and shortening the gaps between the eastern
and western China.
4



The Zhe-Gan Railway is the important component of the "8-Longitudinal-plus
-8-Transverse Railway Network" and the "4-Longitudinal- plus-4-Transverse Express Railway
Network" of China. It connects quite a few of trunk and branch railways and is the most
important busy railway running across the eastern and western China on the south of the
Yangtze River, playing an important role in communicating the East China with Mid China
Region, South China Region and Southwest China Region. The Zhejiang Section of the
Zhe-Gan Railway is the only railway passage of Zhejiang Province to Fujian Province and
Jiangxi Province as well as to the Mid-China Region and Southwest China Region. It is also
the key component of the City-to-City Express Railway Network in the Yangtze River Delta.
Upon completion of the electrification of Zhe-Gan Railway the traveling speed and cargo
capacity of the Railway will be greatly increased. The project is in coincident with the state's
policy of energy restructuring and sustainable development strategy, and will promote the
social and economic development of Zhejiang Province.
1.2 Project Design and Design Approval
The feasibility study report of the project had been completed by March 2002 and was
examined at mid March same year by Planning Department and Engineering Appraisal
Center of Ministry of Railways. The railway route measurement was completed in mid
February - mid May in 2002. The preliminary design of the project by No.2 Railway
Investigation and Design Institute (herein after referred to as No. Institute) was completed
from April 15t 2002 to end of June same year based on the (draft) examination comments to
the feasibility study report, which was examined at mid July in Beijing by the Engineering
Appraisal Center of Ministry of Railways. According to the examination comments to the
feasibility study report and pre-examination comments to preliminary design of speed-raising
project, the preliminary design for expanding capacity and electrification for speed raising

1.4 Project Impacts
The Zhejiang Section of the Zhe-Gan Railway (K30+400- K324+531.59km) runs through
10 counties/cities/districts, including Xiaoshan district, Zhuji city, Pujiang county, Yiwu city,
Wucheng and Jindong district in Jinhua city, Longyou county, Qujiang and Kecheng district in
Quzhou city, and Jiangshan city, and enters the border of Jiangxi province near Xintang
railway station. The project land requisition and house relocation will affect 273 administrative
villages (neighborhood committees) in 51 towns/townships/ street communities, farms and
development zones. A total of 12121.2 mu of various kinds of lands will be requisitioned,
including 8632.7 mu of farmland, 418.3 mu of garden plot, 1169.0 mu of woodlands, 1761.6
mu of building lands, 139.6 mu of unused lands. The project will temporarily ocuupy
2433.4mu lands, including 2041.8 mu of farmland, 84.9 mu of garden land, 163.7 mu
woodlands, 106.0 mu of building lands and 37.0 mu of unused lands. A total of 333709m2
houses will be relocated, they belong to 3639 PAPs of 1108 households in 1 08 administrative
villages of 39 towns (townships/ street communities/ farms/ development zones), including
227777m2 of brick-concrete houses, 98535m2 of brick-wood houses, 1285m2 of clay-wood
houses and 6112m2of simple houses. In addition, the project will also affect 105179 trees
scattered in the project affected areas and a few sppecial items.
1.5Measures To Alleviate Project Impacts
1.5.1 In project planning and design stage
The project construction will certainly cause land requisition, house relocation and
inhabitant displacement, and will unavoidably affect the existing living and production
conditions of the local inhabitants. During project planning and design stage, the designer
and project owner have envisaged some measures to alleviate project impacts to local social
and economic conditions, including:
A. In design scheme optimization and comparison, due considerations have been made
in project impacts to local social and economic conditions and the project impacts were taken
as key factors in the optimization and comparison of the design scheme.
B. In order to reduce the quantity of requisitioned land and number of displaced
inhabitants, the designer follows the principle of "keeping the prject site away from the
densely populated area and reduce quantity of house relocation where possible, and
minimizing the area of requisitioned land and farmland as well".
C. Efforts were made to optimize the construction design, shorten the construction period,
and reasonably schedule the house demolishing and rebuilding and construction time.
1.5.2 In project implementation stage
A. Enhance the public participation mechanism. Before project construction, public
notices were distributed, stating the construction commencement date, and planned
construction schedules, and publicizing the compensation criteria for resettlement, house
relocation and land reuisition. This is aiming at receiving the public supervision of the project
affected sites.
7



B. Adopt dust-reducing measures. In order to keep the project construction sites in a
clean and neat environment condition and to reduce the impact of construction on the
surroundings, water spraying for preventing dusts from the construction access in the
population densed areas in those days with fine weather and wind. The contractors are
required to timely remove the excavated soil and rock through the well-planned mucking
routes, prevent overloading of the vehicles and adopt measures to avoid rock and soil spilling
out of the vehicles along the access.
C. Treatment of wastes produced at construction sites. As the project construction period
is long, there will be a large number of construction staff and workers, and a large quantity of
living rubbish and wastes of various kinds will be produced at the construction sites, the
project owner and contractors should timely clean off the rubish and wastes according to the
local environmental and sanitation authorities so as to keep the sites clean and prevent
epidemics.
D. During project construction, the local construction materials should be first adopted
and the local transportation service and labors should be used first so far as technically
feasible, so that the PAPs can be benefited from the project construction.
1.5.3 In resettlement action planning and implementation stage
In case when the house relocation and land requisition are unavoidable, the following
measures should be adopted to reduce the project impact on the local conditions.
A. Strengthening the basic date collection, in-depth analysis on the existing and future
development of the local social and economic conditions, and an operatable RAP should be
worked out with due consideration of the local reality, so as to safeguard that the living
standard of the PAPs will not be lowered as a result of the project construction.
B. Enhance the internal and external monitoring and establish the effective message
feedback mechanism and channels. Efforts should be made to shorten the information
handling circle to ensure the problems encountered to be handled in time.
C. Effective measures should be adopted by the contractors to minimize the project
construction impact on the local production system.
1.6 Project Schedule
According to the general project schedule, the project construction commenced on
Feb.28th 2004. The planned construction period is about four years, in which 20 months will
be for the speed-raising works (completed in Oct. 2005) and 14 months for electrification
works (completed in Dec. 2006). According to the general project schedule, the preparatory
work for resettlement implementation has been completed and the Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) prepared in the light of the World Bank guideline will be submitted in March 2004 to the
World Bank for appraisal. The resettlement implementation started in Feb. 2004. The official
formalities for land requisition, house relocation and inhabitant displacement are underway
now and the resettlement work are planned to complete before Jun. 2005, and the monitoring
and evaluation on the land requisition, house relocation and inhabitant displacement will be
followed according to the World Bank requirements.
1.7 Preparation for Resettlement, Monitoring and Evaluation
1.7.1 Breakdown of affected inventories and supplementary survey
In Jan. - Mar. 2004, under the leadership of Ministry of Railways, Shanghai Railway
Bureau and leading group of Zhejiang province key project, the Project Investigation Working
Group was established, which is staffed by the persons from the Zhe-Gan Railway Project
Command Offices of Shanghai Railway Bureau, resettlement advisory unit, local government
departments at different levels and relevant organizations along the railway (Zhejiang
Section). With the technical guidance of East China Investigation and Design Institute (the
resettlement advisory unit of the Project) the Working Group broke down the affected
8



inventory indexes provided by No.2 Institute in Oct. 2003, which resulted from the survey
within the scope of land requisition and resettlement as determined in the revised preliminary
design, and carried out supplementary survey. In addition, based on the survey into the social
and economic conditions and environmental capacity for resettlement in the project-affected
areas, the resettlement advasory unit provided the technical guidance and consultation in
analysis on environmental capacity for resettlement and formulation of the plans of land
requisition, house relocation and inhabitant displacement. The work in these two months was
actively supported by the local governments at all levels as well as the village (neighborhood)
committees and the PAPs. Inventory breakdown and supplementary survey cover different
affected objectives including various types of requisitioned land, affected population,
relocated houses and annexes, fruit trees and woods and relocated special items, etc.
1.7.2.Social and economic survey
In order to analyze the project impact and formulate a feasible PAR, the project
command offices of Shanghai Railway Bureau, resettlement consulting unit, local
governments and relevant units along the railway, conducted detailed social and economic
survey at the project affected areas and host sites. The survey covered the land resources,
industrial structures, economic level, income and expense condition, population, living mode,
culture and custom, traffic condition, natural resources and possible future development, etc.
The survey was carried out by data collection and sampling, and based on the data and
information obtained, the existing local social and economic conditions and actual living and
production conditions were analyzed.
1.7.3 Resettlement plan
The resettlement planning of the project was carried out under the leadship of the local
county (city,district) governments, which was based on the project affected scope, and
quantity of the affected inventory. The plan was prepared based on the opinions of the
villagers and resettlers and the actual conditions of the affected townships, (towns, farms,
development districts) and villages. The main measures to be adopted in the resettlement are
re-allocating the land within the original villages and village groups, improving the
infrastructures, developing the secondary and tertiary industies, economic compensation and
procuring endowment insurance. It is to carry out the principle of production-developable
resettlement so as to ensure that the host sites possess the basic materially living conditions
and the potential for future development, and to combine the resettlement with the regional
economic development so that the PAPs can restore their living standard or even better than
that before resettlement.
11.7.4Preparation of resettlement monitoring and evaluation
The project owner has entrusted Importing and exploiting Researching Office of Xinan
Jiaotong University to carry out the independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation for
the project. The preparation of resettlement plan was organized by the project owner and
participated by the project design unit, monitoring and evaluation unit and local governments
at all levels. The monitoring and evaluation unit provided the technical consulting service, the
design unit defined the resettlement scope and the local governments were responsible for
formulating the specific schemes for land requisition and house relocation and inhabitant
resettlement. Since March 2003, a great deal of work has been completed, including
successive establishment of resettlement organizations, determination of project affected
scope, work outline of the the RAP, survey of the project affected inventories, social and
economic survey, research work for policy adoption, formulation of the resettlement schemes,
cost estimate for resettlement compensation, etc.. The RAP of the project was finalized and
preparation for resettlement monitoring and evaluation was completed.

2 Natural Social and Economic Conditions of Project-Affected Provinces
2.1 Natural Conditions
Zhejiang Province is located at the south wing of the Yangtze River Delta along the
southeast coast, which is named after the largest river called Qiantang (or Zhejiang) River.
There are two cities at sub-province level, nine cities at prefecture level, 36 counties, 22 cities
at county level and 32 districts under the jurisdiction of cities. This province is famous as
called "a land of fish and rice, home of silk and tea leave, country of historic relics and scenic
area for tourist".
The province is one of the smallest province, having a total land of 101800 sq. km,
accounting to 1.06% of the country. Among the whole land, hills and knaps account to 70.4%,
plains and basins account to 23.2% and rivers and lakes to 6.4%. Zhejiang Province has a
vast sea area densely dotted with islands, the coast line of the province is totally some
6400km, ranking the top of the country. There are 3061 islands which has land area over 500
sq.m., ranking the top of the country. The province can be divided into six topographical
zones, i.e., North Zhejiang Plain, West-Mid Zhejiang Hilly Land, Jinya Basin in Mid Zhejiang,
South Zhejiang Mountainous Zone, Southeast Coastal Zone and Island Zone. The coast line
in Zhejiang Province zigzags along the sea shore, which forms a number of bays, such as
Hangzhou Bay, Xiangshan Bay, Sanmen Bay and Taizhou Bay, Wenzhou Bay, Leqing Bay,
etc. .The Hangzhou Bay is the largest of all, where the horn-shape Qiantang River estuary
runs into the sea. The tidal effect at the estuary causes the famous Qiantang Bores at Haining
County. There are many rivers running in the province, forming eight major river systems,
they are Qiantang, Oujiang, Lingjiang, Tiaoxi, Nanjiang, FeiyunJiang, Aojiang and Cao'ejiang
river system. The Qiantang River is about 605km long and is the longest one in the province.
Besides, the Grand Canal starts from Hangzhou and runs 129km distance in the province,
and it flows across the middle part of the Hang-Jia-Hu Plain. The West Lake in Hangzhou,
East Lake in Shaoxing, South Lake in Jiaxing and Dongqian Lake in Yinxian County are the
four most famous lakes of the province.
The sub-tropic climate prevails over the Provice, where the four seasons are clearly
divided and sunshine is sufficient. At the main cities, the annual average temperature is 18 C,
there is plenty of rainfall with an annual precipitation of 1762mm. The forest coverage is
54.6% of the provincial land, ranking the forefront of the whole coutry. The province has
beautiful mountains and rivers which provide unique sceneries and rich tourist resources. The
natural sceneries and humanistic lalndscapes reflect each other and present unique features,
which are well known in the country. There are some 800 locations where have typical
physiognomical landscapes, some 200 locations with waterland scenery, some 100 locations
with biological scenery and some 100 locations with humanistic scenery.
Natural conditions of project affected counties (city or district) are as follows:
(1) Xiaoshan district of Hangzhou city
Topography and geomorphy: Xiaoshan district locates in the north of Zhejiang province
and at the south side of Qiantang river, and belongs to Hangzhou city. It faces to Westlake,
Jianggan district and Haining city over Qiantang river, with the geography coordinate of 120
04' -120° 43' in the east longitude and 29° 50' -30° 23' in the northern latitude. It
has the total area of 1420 kM2, 57.2 km wide from east to west and 59.4 km long from south to
north. It is bounded by Shaoxing city in the east, Zhuji city in the south, Fuyang city in the
west, Binjiang district in the northwest, and Qiantang river in the north. Xiaoshan is at the
north of hilly area in the East Zhejiang, and south of North Zhejing plain. It is high in the south
and low in the north for the topographical feature, and inclines from southwest to northeast,
and has low-lying land in the middle section. The character of topographical zoning is
relatively obvious: the south has low mountains and hills with small pieces of valley plain, and
the middle and north has plain with hills. The plain area is accounting to 66%, hilly land of
17% and water surface of 17%.
12



Hydrology and meteorology: The rivers in Xiaoshan district, according to topography and
flow direction, are divided into three small independent water systems but connection, and
belong to the water system of Qiantang river. Qiantang river comes this district from Fuyang
Changlingtou. The river in this district is the tidal section, with max. tidal level of 9.58m and
min. 2.31m in the history record. Three water systems are: (1) south water system is at the
south and southwest hills and valley plain, and is the river network system with the
Pujiangyang river as main distributing in branch type; (2) Middle water system is the river and
lake watery system in the reticular type distributing over the middle plain in the east to
Xijiangtang and south to Beihaitang; (3) north water system is the artificial river system in
the reclaiming area and Nansha area to the north of Beihaitang.
Xiaoshan locates in the south border of the monsoon wind area in north subtropical zone.
The climate features are that: it is long for winter and summer and short for spring and
autumn, there are four seasons clearly, sunshine is adequate, it has plentiful rainfall and is
warm and moist, the cold air enters easily and goes out difficulty, there are much calamity
weather, and the regional difference in sunshine, temperature and water is clearly. Mean
annual temperature is 16.3 C and annual ground temperature is 18.3°C. The mean annual
precipitation is 1439.2 mm. The mean annul sunshine is 1870.5h and mean annual frost-free
period of 248 days. The catastrophic weather is as follows: cold wave, low temperature, storm,
typhoon, hail, etc..
Soil and vegetation: within the boundary, there are 6 kinds of soils such as red loam,
yellow loam, rocky earth, moisture soil, saline soil, and paddy soil. The red loam distributes
over hills below the sea level of 600m, where has been developed for the forest land and
orchard plot, and tea and mulberry land. The yellow loam scatters over the peaks above sea
level of 600m in the south. The rocky soil scatters over a few hills in Yongxing, Punan and
Zheshan, where are the scattered forest and wasteland or has been developed for the dry
land. The moisture soil includes two kind of moisture and calcareous one and mainly
distributes over the accumulation plain of middle gulf, where has been developed for
economic crops of cotton and flax mainly. The paddy soil mainly distributes over the valley
plain and water network plain at both sides of Xixia river, Puyang river and Xianghu river,
where has been planted with the grain crop mainly.
Xiaoshan district is in the vegetation district of evergreen broad-leaved forest in middle
subtropical zone, and is rich in the plant resources, with the forest coverage rate up to 21.3%.
At hills and mountainous regions below the sea level 500m, the secondary mixed forest with
the evergreen broad-leaved trees mainly has the better natural vegetation, grown with the
evergreen broad-leaved trees such as Cheng et T. hong, bitter oak, camphor trees, nanmu,
schima, sweet oak, etc., and deciduous and broad-leaved trees of white oak, maple, C.
sclerophylla Schott as well as masson pine, bamboo, planted fir, tee trees, mulberry and fruit
trees on a part of hills. The area at the sea level of 500 - 800m, it has the mixed forest of the
evergreen deciduous and broad-leaved trees, evergreen coniferous forest and bamboo.
Xiaoshan is the comprehensive agricultural district with crops of grain, cotton and flax
and other economic crops. The main grain crops are paddy, wheat and bean, and the main
economic crops are cotton, flax, rapeseed, watermelon, peanut, vegetable etc.. It is the state
key production area for flax and cotton, which has yearly output in the first and second level of
the whole province, respectively. The cultivation system of double cropping of rice is carried
out at the hill and valley plain area (green manure - continuous planting paddy in the first year,
rape - continuous planting paddy in the second year, and barley or wheat-continuous planting
paddy in the third year). The area for the dry crop is less, in addition, the area is planted with
vegetable and non-staple food production, therefore the area has the two-harvest systems or
three-harvest system with intercropping at hilly area.
(2) Zhuji city

Soil and vegetation: within the boundary, there are 88 soil species, 46 earth families, 12
subclasses in 5 kinds of soils such as red loam, yellow loam, rocky earth, moisture soil and
paddy soil. In which it is mainly of the red loam (accounting to 55.6%) in hills and paddy soil
(accounting to 28.64%) in valley plain.
Zhuji city is rich in forest resources, within the boundary, it has the cultivated vegetation
of bitter oak forest and Cheng et T. Hong vegetation of Zhewan mountains, hilly vegetation of
Tianmu mountain, etc.. The vegetation type belongs to Huadong one of Asiatic flora,
mainly of the mixed forest with coniferous and evergreen deciduous broad-leaved trees. The
coniferous forest mainly distributes over the mountainous region below sea level of 800m and
belongs secondary vegetation formed after damage of native vegetation. The vegetation is
consisted of families of Pine, China fir, camellia, rose, leguminosae, etc.
Major crops and cultivation system: The grain planting is main production in Zhuji city,
including cereal as well as potato and beans. The crops are paddy, barley, wheat, corn,
buckwheat for grain, sweet potato and potato for potato type, and soybean, broad bean, pea,
mung bean, red bean, and cowpea for bean type.
Main crops and cultivation system: since 1985 after the adjustment of industrial structure,
the double cropping of rice has been carried out at hilly area and paddy field of valley plain.
As the area for dry crops is less and is planted with vegetable and non-staple food, it has
two-harvest at Hufan area, and three-harvest of wheat-corn-sweet potato or bean at the

2.3 Basic Conditions of Project Affected Households
In order to further understand the basic conditions of the resettlement households in the
project affected areas and analyze the project impacts to the PAPs, the project survey
working group conducted survey by random sampling into the basic living and production
conditions of the project affected households within the project affected areas in Feb.-March,
2004.
26



A. Selection of samples
The project affected households were randomly sampled, and totally 148 sample
households were taken and investigated into their basic living and production status in detail.
The samples covered all areas within the project affected scope, and had the
representativeness of all affected households. The distribution of the samples are as shown
in Table 2-1.
Distribution of Samples
Table 2-1

10        Jiangshan         14              9.5
Total          148             100
B Survey results
According to the on-sopt survey, the project affected areas in Zhejiang Province are
mostly the economic developed places of the individual counties (cities, districts), and the
resettlers will have more chances to find job in the secondary or tertiary industries and their
living standard is also rather high. The statistics of sampling survey results show that the per
capita net household income of the 148 sample households is 4611 Yuan. 59.5% of the labors
of the sample households are working in the non-agricultural production, of which 34.3% work
in industrial enterprises and 22.4% in commercial and trading field and food service field.
Most of these households are by the sides of the towns and their income is rather higher. The
annual gross income of these households includes 13.1% from farming, forestry, husbandry,
and 86.9 from industry, commercial and trading and food service. It can be seen that the
agricultural production is not the main source of the income and the the farmers are little living
on farming. Therefore, after land requisition and house relocation, the adverse impact of the
project to the local rural economy can be alleviated by rational use of the land compensation
and adoption of proper resettlement measures. The statistics of basic living and production
conditions of the project affected households is detailed in Table 2-2.

3 Project Impacts
3.1 Confirmation of the scope of project impacts
The scope of project impacts is confirmed according to the revised preliminary design
report provided by project design unit, No. 2 Design Institute of Ministry of Railways in Oct.
2003 including route change, passenger and freight transport station and its nearby traction
substation, work area and subarea of contact system.
3.1.1 Land acquisition for the project
The scope of land acquisition for the project is determined on the basis of the revised
preliminary design provided by the project design unit, No. 2 Design Institute of Ministry of
Railways in Oct. 2003. Land requistion for the project includes roadbed of rebuilding route,
drainage ditch, bridge and culvert, station and its nearby traction substation, work area and
subarea of contact system.
3.1.2 Temporary land for construction
Based on the revised preliminary design report provided by the project design unit, No.2
Design Institute of Ministry of Railways, in Oct. 2003, the scope of temporary land for the
project is determined. The temporary land for the project includes land occupation of stocking
ground, excavation waste dump, production and living area during construction and
temporary road for construction, etc..
3.2 Investigation of project impacts
In order to find out the object and quantity of project resettlement and land acquisition,
under the leadership of Ministry of Railways, Shanghai Railroad Bureau and Zhejiang
Provincial Major Construction leading group office, a project investigation working group was
formed which is composed of the construction Headquarters of Zhe-Gan-railway electrization
rebuilding of the relevant railroad bureaus, project resettlement consultation unit and the local
people's governments at all levels along the Zhe-Gan Railway (Zhejiang section). The project
resettlement consultation unit, East China Investigation & Design Institute is responsible for
the technology. From January to March 2004 , on the basis of the revised report on scope of
land acquisition and relocation and material index in preliminary design stage supplied by the
project design unit, No. 2 Design Institute of Ministry of Railways, in Oct. 2003, decomposition
and supplementary investigation was made for the material index of different affected objects
such as population, building, land and speical facilities influenced by the project.
The investigation method of population, land, building and its appurtenant works,
scattered trees and special facilities is as follows: with reference to the revised 1/2000 route
plan in preliminary stage furnished by No. 2 Design Institute of Ministry of Railways, on the
basis of right limit for site division of county( city and district ), township( town, street, farm and
development district) and village ( neighborhood committee) , in combination with the revised
investigation results of all kinds of material index in preliminary design stage supplied by
design unit in Oct. 2003, the buildings and their auxiliary facilities are decomposed to detailed
villages and households and supplementary investigation is made to the population quantities
involved in house relocation, land is decomposed to detailed villages (neighborhood
committees) and supplementary investigation for other kinds is made, and the special
facilities are decomposed to detailed counties(city or district).
Owing to the particularity of construction of this project and some modification comments
and requirements for the revised preliminary design results the local people's governments at
all levels along with the railway and resettlers put forward, the construction unit and design
unit of the project and local people's governments are at present   negotiating,
communicating and linking up. The design unit is also revising the design schemes to result in
corresponding changes in the scope of land acquisition therefore and moreover pile-fixing
31



and lofting hasn't been made on-situ for most of scope of land acquisition.Accordingly, there
will be some changes to certain extent for the material index of project impact in
impelementation stage based on the revised preliminary design results. To confirm accurately
each material index of project impacts, in next stage the building unit, construction unit, the
liability unit appointed by the governments along with the railway and the objects (village and
household) whose land will be requisitioned and resettled will be organzied to jointly take part
in field measurementand checking of all material index of land quantities of all kinds and
relocated structures in the scope of land acquisition and it is necessary for all parties to sign
and approve.
3.3 Material index of project impacts
The land requisition for the project (in Zhejiang section) will involve 273 administrative
villages (neighorhood committee) in 52 towns (township, street, farm and development district)
of 10 counties (city and district) and 3639 resettlers of 1108 households (2637 persons of 798
households involved in the land requisition for line and 1002 persons of 310 households
involved in the land requisition for farmland). The land acquisition of all kinds for this project is
12121.2 mu totally (including 9767.7 mu of farmland and 2353.4 mu of station yard), and
temporary land occupation of all kinds is 2433.4 mu , among them 1851.9mu is for route and
581.6 mu for the station yard. The total relocation building area of all kinds of housing is
333709m2 (254445m2 for route and 9264m2 for the station yard). in addition, 105179 sporadic
trees and a few special facilities are affected.
3.3.1 Land Acquisition/occupation
3.3.1.1 Permanent land Acquisition for the project
The gross land area of all kinds required to be requisitioned for this project is 12121.2 mu
(among them 9767.7 mu for route, and 2353.4 mu for station yard), including farmland area
8632.7 mu (among which 6489.6 mu for route and 2143.Omu for station yard, gardenplot area
of 418.3 mu (all for route), woodland area 11 69.Omu (among them 1164.0 mu for route and
5.0 mu for station yard) , construction land 1761.6 mu (among them 1556.2 mu for route and
205.4 mu for station yard) , unused land 139.6mu (all for route) . The investigation results
of land acquisition quantiites of all kinds of county(city or district) and town(township, street,
farm and development district) are shown respectively in Table 3-1 and Table 3-3.

first is the actual affected population, which includes those to be affected directly by
house relocation, land requisition, the second is theory number calculated based on the
State Land Law, call population needing production rearrangement.
Based on the data from the design institute, the actual survey shows that, the
population affected by house relocation is 1108 households with 3639 persons ( in
which 798 households with 2637 persons will be affected by railway line and 310
households with 1002 persons will be affected by railway station).
According to Art. 47 in the Land Law, calculation based on villages, a population of
13649 persons requires production rearrangement. Viz:

3.3.7 The affected facilities for production and living
The rural production and living facilities affected by the project construction mainly
include road of tractors, sidewalk and acequia, etc.. It has been considered in project
design to take palliation and rehabititation measures, therefore, their affected

conditions won't be investigated and counted. In the course of implementation, if other
impacts happen, the relevant material index and treatment measures will be confirmed
with the same principles and methods as this RAP.
3.4 Analysis of impacts of land acquisition on regional social economy
Land acquisition of the whole Zhe-Gan Railway invovles 270 administrative villages
(residents' committees), 51 townships (towns, streets, farms or development districts)
of 1 0 counties(cities or districts) in Zhejiang. To analyse the impacts of land acquisition
of the project on the local areas, the people concerned in the project investigation group
make a thorough investigation for the existing land resources of the affected townships
(towns, streets) and administrative villages and make detailed analysis for the affected
extent of each village and group on the basis of material index of project impacts(for
details, see the appendix). It is observed after analysis that among the 258
administrative villages affected by land acquisition by this project, there are 210 villages
in all whose farmland decreases below 10%. The project exerts few influences on the
agricultural production of these villages. But for 12 administrative villages, their
farmland decreses beyond 25%. The farmland per capita after land acquisition of 8
villages is more than average level in that township (town or street), and 16 villages is
less than average level in that county but more than 0.5 mu. The basic grain ration of
each resident in the 24 villages can be guranteed. The impacts caused by land
acquisition on them is less.

The cultivated land per capita of 24 villages is lower than the average level of
county (town or street) of 0.5 mu, see detais for affect of land requisition on those
villages in Table 3 - 16. From tables, it shows that those affected villages mainly
centralize in Yiwu and Zhuji, the most economic developed areas. The people in those
area mostly engage in the second and tertiary industry and have less the dependence
on the land, and their family economic income is mainly from non-agriculture. For
instance, Hutang village, which has the cultivated land greatly reduced, according to
information of annual report, has the agricultural labor of 49 persons, accounting to
16.6% of the village, and the total agricultural economic income of 5.30 million Yuan ( in
which agricultural income is 0.266 million Yuan, only being 5%). Additionally, from the
site survey, the greatly impacted villages are around the town, in last few years the
step of the town construction accelerates and development of local economy is fast,
that have attracted the most of local rural labours to engage in the second and tertiary
industry. Farmers have not high enthusiasm in farming. For example some farmers in
Paitou town of Zhuji city only plant one season of crops, and most of land is unused.
The land requisition will have some unfavourable influences on the agricultural
production of these villages and agricultural income decreased, but have less impact on
the total economic income of villages or households. Besides that, the local developed
second and tertiary industry will offer much employment opportunities for the affected
persons, thus the affect on the production and living level of resettlers will be tiny.

5 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
The resettlement plan for Electrification Project of Zhe-Gan Railway was prepared jointly by
project command offices of Shanghai Railway Bureau, the people's governments at all levels
along the railway route, as well as East China Investigation and Design Institute. The above
organizations established a joint resettlement working team to plan for the project resettlement
work on the basis of the survey results of project affected inventories and according to the
current policies, laws and statutes and the World Bank's resettlement requirements as well as
the local actual conditions.
5.1 Objectives and Tasks
5.1.1 Resettlement target
The goal of resettlement plan is that: there shall be way out for resettlers' production,
reasonably resettlemenf or labors, ithe production and living level improved or not lower than
the original level at least.
As the project affected places are in the areas where the traffic condition is good and the
economy is developed, particularly, the individual business households and family-based
enterprises are very popular. The farmers there do not take farming as their main living means
but mainly live on trading, running their own business and providing labor service. The grain
production level cannot be taken as the base for determining the resettlement planning
schemes. Therefore, the objective of resettlement for this project is set as follows.
(1) The income per capita shall be recovered to the standard before resettement.
(2) The public infrastructures, school, hospitalize, social welfare level, natural
environment and traffic condition etc. shall be improved after resettlement. The rate of child to
school and basic medical treatment coverage shall be kept in the original level.
5.1.2 Resettlement Task
Based on the inventory survey and anayles, there arel 5045 persons affected by the project,
in which 3639 persons of 1108 households will need house relocation, and 13649 persons will
need the production resettlement.
5.2 Resettlement Guideline and Principle
5.2.1 Resettlement Guideline
The resettlement work for this project should stick on the policy that: Esteem and care for
the living and production habits of the local PAPs, take full consideration of the willings of the
PAPs; with due consideration of the actual conditions in the original townships (town,
neighborhood committees) and villages (neighborhood committes), the rural resettlers resettled
on land basis without changing the agricultural status if land is available for resettlement; based
on developing the traditional crop farming and guaranteeing the basic material survival
conditions of the resettlers, guide and assist the resettlers to develop the secondary and tertiary
industries and to restore, improve and raise the living and production levels of the resettlers,
and reach the target of prolonged social stability.
5.2.2 Resettlement Principle
(1) The resettlement plan will be based on detailed inventory for land acquisition and
houses demolition, and adopted compensation standards and subsidies.
(2) The resettlement shall be combined with the local development, resource utilization
and economic growth as well as environment protection. Considering the local conditions, a
practical and feasible resettlement plan should be developed to restore and improve their
economic production and create basic conditions for long-term development.
117



(3) The resettlement plan should be based on the principle "Beneficial to the production
and convenient for living".
(4) The re-construction standard and scale shall be based with the principle of recovery to
the original standard and original scale. Combining the local development, the cost for enlarging
the scale, raising standard and future plan shall be solved independently by local government
and relevant department.
(5) Making overall plans and taking all factors into consideration, correctly handling the
relations between the state, collective and individual.
(6) Fully utilize local natural resource, build water conservancy facility, develop new
farmland, improve land quality, and strengthen agricultural strength and make the resettler'
living standard reach or exceed the original level step by step.
5.3 Overall Resettlement Scheme
Construction of the project will affect a small amount of houses and land along the railway,
which will not impose big impact to the original living and production system in the existing
villages. Consultation meeting have been held in the affected towns, townships and villages to
discuss the resettlement scheme. According to the resettler's opinions and actual situation of
the project affected places, it is determined the the resettler's in the project affected places will
be displaced in their original villages and communities. This can ensure that the resettlers will
keep their original living and production habits, keep their custom and social relationship as
before resettlement, and the resettlers can comparatively easily restore and improve their living
and production level after resettlement. In order to minimize the project impact to their living and
production conditions, all old houses will be demolished after construction of new houses are
completed. The rural households whose houses will be relocated will be resettled in their
original villages, mainly on the land base and supplemeted by production development in
secondary and tertiary industries. After the economic compensation is paid to the village, the
land of the village (neighborhood committees) and village groups will be re-allocated at the
willing of the villagers. The resettlement will be carried out on land base, and for some village
groups which are comparatively serious affected by the land requisition, the basic livelihood
guarantee system will be established for the farmers according to the relevant local policies so
as to ensure the basic living condition of the farmers whose lands are requisitioned.
5.4 Analysis on Carrying Capacity for Resettlement
5.4.1 Natural conditions and land resources
Since the project affected population will be resettled in their orginal villages and
communities, the natural conditions will not be the restricting factor of carrying capacity for
resettlement.
The carrying capacity analysis is based on detailed village to village survey. During Jan. -
Mar., 2004, arranged by Ministry of Railways, the project command offices of the Shanghai
Railway Bureau, and Project Consluting unit organized relevant staff to carry out a village to
village survey. Through collection of local social and economic data, land use survey results,
annual statistical report, and adjustable farmland possibilities among each affected village
group, and verification of their current land resources, population, agricultural production,
infrastructure, culture, education and sanitation, detailed carrying capacity analysis has been
carried out. Based on the principles of using same dialects, having similar ethnic costumes,
faciliating traffic, providing complete cultural, educational, medical and sanitary infrastructures
and esteeming the resttlers' wilings, it was determined that all the population affected by the
project will be resettled in their original village by moving back through adjusting land allocation
and monitized compensation. After the determination was made, the Project Management
Offices carried out, together with the leaders of the local townships (towns) and villages,
in-depth analysis on the actual land conditions.
118



5.4.2 Resettlers' characteristics and relationships
Among the project affected areas, the majority of affected people are Han nationality. In
order that the custom of the resettlers, original personal and social relationship will not be
affected to a possible ectent, and the existing distance to farmland will not be increased, the
resettlers of affected villages are planned to resettled within the original villages and
communities.
5.4.3 Basic Infrastructure Conditions for Production and Living
(1) Traffic Condition
Construction of the project will certainly affect the original traffic mode somewhat, thus,
some corresponding engineering measures have been considered in the project design, which
include building overpasses and intersections at main rural roads, building pedestrian
overpasses or underpasses near the main road of the villages, schools, hospitals and other
crowd area in order to ensure safty for people and animals. Construction of the Project will not
only improve the travel of the local residents, but also enhance the circulation of freight and
personnel, and accelerate the development of local economy. The living envoirnment and the
infrastructures of local resettlers will be upgraded after resettlement. Therefore, the traffic
condition will not be a constraint factor for carrying capacity.
(2) Water Supply Condition
The project is located in the plain and hilly areas of Southeast China Region, where the
economic and natural contions are rather good. Most of the rural residents are mainly using tap
water some are using water from wells dug by themselves. As rivers run zigzag in the area and
there is plenty of rainfall, water is easily available for living and production and the project
construction will not affect the water use of the local residents. The water source and water
quantity will not be a constraint factor to the carrying capacity. Along with the economic
development in the project affected areas, the living and production conditions will be gradually
improved.
(3) Electric Power Supply Condition
All electric power supply facilities affected by the project will be re-constructed based on
the orginal standard before the project construction, so the electric power supply condition of
the residents will not be affected.
(4) Medical & Education Condition
The medical and educational service facilities in the project affected areas will be restored
based on the orginal standard before the project construction. The existing facilities in affected
townships and villages could still be used. Access paths will be constructed by the Project to
ensure that no any inconvenience will be created for the local people.
(5) Fuel Supply
The main fuel supply of the local residents is firewood collected from the nearby hills. The
project land requisition will impose little impact to fuel supply of the local villages and townships .
Along with construction of the project and improvement of the traffic condition, purchasing coal
and other types of fuels will be more and more easy.
5.4.4 Economic Development Potential of the Affected Area
In the rural areas affected by the project, farming is generally not take as the main living
means, and the secondary and tertiary industries are developed and it is rich in land reserve,
which leave a big development potential. In future, with improvement of transportation condition,
the resource advantage and good accessibility of local areas should be fully utilized. According
to local conditions, various income generation opportunities should be developed by increasing
input of science and improving production technical level of the masses in order to promote
119



overall development of agriculture, forestry, sideline activities, as well as industrial, trade and
transportation. So that the production and living level of resettlers will be raised.
5.5 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
5.5.1 Production Rehabilitation Plan
During project impact survey and resettlement planning, the project owner organized the
relevant units involved in the project development to hold consulting meetings with the
representatives of PAPs, cardres and villagers of the project affected arears for discussing the
resettlement scheme. According to the resettlement policies of the states and the three
provinces as well as the World Bank requirements, and through the analysis on the carrying
capacity for resettlement after land requisition for the project, it is determined that the PAPs will
be resettled within their original village groups so that they can keep their original living and
production ways and their social relationship will not be affected after resettlement. It is to
encourage the resettlers to carry on their original job and to create conditions for developing
local secondary and tertiary industries.
The impact project land requisition varies with different village groups. The resettlement
planning team, together with the competent departments of local governments and the
resettlers worked out the production resettlement and restoration plan in light of the actual
conditions of each affected village. The plans for each county (city or district) can be summaried
as follows.
(1)    Xiaoshan district
The district impacted by the land requisition is the economic developed area in Xiaoshan. It
not only has perfect infrastructure, but also is the local economic pillar as its economy developed
quickly by taking advantages of Xiaoshan economic industrial zone and close to Hangzhou, the
provincial capital. Therefore, the local labor resource can not satisfy the labor demanded by the local
economic development, the outside labors in the local individual and privately owned enterprises and
industry and commercial enterprises are in a certain proportion. In general, the affect of the land
requisition to production and living of local rural resettlers is less.
The land requisition for the project construction will have impact on 27 villages of 3 towns in
Xiaoshan district. In which, 2 villagers, Xinzhatou village and Banlichen village of Jinhua town, will be
greatly impacted (the cultivated land decreased up to 10%), the actual land requisition decreased
over 30%. According to the actual conditions of Xiaoshan district and impact of the land requisition as
well as the introduction of villages' cadres, the production restoring plans for the resettlers impacted
by the land requisition are mainly as following two:
A.   It is to carry out the land adjustment within the village or group. For example, Qiujiawu
village in Linpu town and Xinzhatou village in Jinhua town, except that the compensation cost for the
young crops is directly paid to the land contractor, the land compensation and resettlement subsidy is
under the control of collective of the village and group and is used to establish the basic livelihood
guarantee system for resettlers. The specific use scheme of compensation shall be discussed after
soliciting the opinions of resettlers and approved through the villagers' representative meeting.
B.   If it is difficulty to re-allot the land in the whole village and group and working quantity
for the land re-allotting is great, (for example, a part of villages in Puyang town), no land
adjustment will be carried out and every kind of compensation will be paid to resettled households
(the monetized resettlement), but this shall be discussed after soliciting opinion of resettlers and
approved through the villagers' representative meeting.

the equipment production base of environmental protection in Paitou town, and shoes industry in
Zhibu town. Therefore, the local labor resource can not satisfy the labor demanded by the local
economic development, the outside labors in the local individual and privately owned enterprises and
industry and commercial enterprises are in a certain proportion. Among the most of rural households
in the project affected area, only a few of old persons engage in the agricultural production at home,

Shiwufang village in Wangjiajing town, and Kengtangxia village and Dazhong village in Paitou town),
it is to adjust the land within the villager or group. Except that the compensation cost for the young
crops is directly paid to the land contractor, the land compensation and resettlement subsidy is under
the control of collective of the village and group and is used to improve the infrastructure, develop the
secondary and tertiary industry, establish the basic livelihood guarantee system for resettlers or allot
to each villager of village or group in average. The specific use scheme of compensation shall be
discussed after soliciting the opinions of resettlers and approved through the villagers' representative
meeting.
B.   For those villages with less land requisitioned or most of land requisitioned being
non-cultivated one, the resettlement scheme shall be discussed after soliciting opinions of resettlers
and approved through the villagers' representative meeting. In general, no land adjustment is carried

10 Monitoring & Evaluation
In order to guarantee that the RAP can be smoothly implemented and the resettlement
target suitably realized, the follow-on fact finding and monitoring will be carried out throughout
the whole process. Monitoring on the resettlement will be divided into two parts, i.e., internal
monitoring (by the resettlement offices) and the external independent monitoring.
10.1 Internal Monitoring
10.1.1 Target and Task
The target of internal monitoring is to maintain supervision responsibility of the
resettlement organs as specified in the RAP during implementation, and ensure that the
project can be constructed smoothly and the resettlers' legal rights will not be impaired. The
auditing department at different level will independently exercise the auditing monitoring
function over concerning units under its jurisdiction in accordance with the laws and
regulations. The superior units assume the responsibilities for monitoring their subordinates
so that the RAP principle and schedule can be followed.
10.1.2 Institution and Staff
The internal monitoring for land acquisition and resettlement will be held by the project
resettlement office, and be performed by local county (city or district) Resettlement Offices,
and villages. To make the internal monitoring effective, full-time professionals will be
assigned within all the resettlement offices at all levels. All of them have participated in the
compilation and implementation of the RAP, and they will carry out the internal monitoring
control in the processes of the work. The responsible institutes and persons for internal
monitoring and data processing are shown in Table 10-1.

the survey design institution and resettlement implementation institutions. With an overall
understanding of the situation, the evaluation will be performed by sample survey, key
informant interviews and rapid rural appraisal techniques. Typical samples, including
resettled households, affected villages and Townships will be selected to establish evaluation
index system for different types of PAPs. Experienced experts will be invited to decide in a
back-to-back way the weights for different indexes. Referring to the updated research output
on living quality both in China and abroad, the indexes will be non-dimensionally treated, and
the survey results will be analyzed and the computation results evaluated and compared.
Generally, the external monitoring and evaluation institution will carry out the following
work.
A. Survey of resettlers' living standards
A base-line survey will be conducted for this project, including the collection of selected
samples of the base-line living standards of the resettlers. (The preliminary samples will be
randomly collected). The living standard will be investigated once or twice a year to monitor
the variation in the resettlers' living standards. The necessary data can be obtained by
periodical survey, random interview and site visit, based on which statistical analysis and
evaluation are performed. There will also be targeted survey of vulnerable groups.
The survey comprises various indicators of living standards. Some of the indicators will
be used for weighing the dynamic variation of living standards before and after the land
requisition and resettlement. The selected indicators will be checked to see whether they are
reasonable in reflecting the actual production and living levels in the base-line survey and are
subject to modification according to the actual conditions, so as to guarantee the message
obtained reflects the quality and quantity of the real situation.
Sampling scale: resettlers: 5%, sample villages by land requisition: 10%, enterprises or
self-employees: 20%.
B. Holding Public Consultation

The persons in the meeting know that this project is state key project and the
construction of the project will be started soon, and express their supporting the
construction of the project. They say that the construction of project will promote the
development of Zhuji city as well as Taozhu residential area, at the same time, it will
be convenience for the communication of people. Therefore the construction of project
is very necessary.
Though the construction of project will have so much benefits, resettler's
representatives have proposed some un-favourable effects of the project construction.
For example, railway will go through the village, the removing quantity is great, the
original production and living facility in this village will be destroyed after construction
of the railway. Therefore they hope that the government shall take an account of the
personal benefit of local farmers during the project construction.
About the compensation for the land requisition, they say that it shall be carried
out according to the relevant policies of state, province and city, and hope that it shall
be carried out in "Fair, Equity and Publicity, and it is better that the compensation shall
be directly paid to the collective of village and group or individual by the Owner with the
intermediate link reduced as far as possible so as to avoid the compensation being
held back or deducted.
About the production resettlement, they say that the village is rich in the land
resource, with the cultivated land up to 0.9mu per capita, at the same time, most
labors in the village engage in secondary and tertiary industry mainly, family major
income is from the non-agriculture, thus the land requisition will not have great impact
on their income. The specific use of land compensation shall be discussed through the
villagers' representative meeting. The resettled households hope that the land
compensation is used for the endowment insurance or the construction of village
communal facility.
About the living resettlement, the resettlers who have house removed hope that
resettlement organization can, according to the actual conditions of resettlers, solicit
the opinions of resettlers as far as possible for selection of the house plot and
construction of new houses. And they also hope that the government can help to carry
out every procedure for the construction of houses.

The resettlers' representatives proposed that the railway will be in full enclosed
management after the completing, which will cause the damage on the original
production and living facility of the village. Therefore they hope that government can

Shishuanrong, male, 50 year-old, Han nationality, graduated form junior middle school
Address:Fucunban village in Taozhu of Zhuji city
Time:      Feb.15, 2004
There are 7 persons in his family, couple, two sons (married), and one grandson.
His family has 5.6mu (0.8mu per capita) land, and the houses of two floors with
brick-concrete structure (built in 1990) and with the area of 122m2.
The incomes of the family are that: One is from the tractor transportation (18
years), with yearly income about 10000 RMB yuan. The second one is from the
vegetable (which is sold to Zhuji city), with the yearly income of 6000 RMB yuan. The
third one is the income of 2 sons (the income of sons and parents is separated), the
elder son works in the machinery plant and the young son contracts 14 sets of weaving
machine from the towel factory in the village, and the elder and young
daughter-in-laws do business in the city. Now, the family does not rely on the land for
any long, and planting is only for their grain.
Their house will not be removed during the construction of railway and only a few
of land requisitioned. Therefore the project construction will not effect their production
and living greatly. He hopes that the compensation scheme of government will be fair
and reasonable and operable. So that the public will support the construction of state.
The key point is that: cost must be guaranteed to set down and account will be
publicized.
