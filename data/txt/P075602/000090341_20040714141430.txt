OBJECTIVES OF RESETTLEMENT PLAN AND
DEFINITION OF RESETTLEMENT TERMINOLOGY
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is prepared according to the Laws and
Regulations of PRC and the resettlement policy of ((Involuntary resettlement))
OP4.12/BP4.12 of the World Bank. The purpose of this document is to set out an
action plan for the Resettlement and Rehabilitation of the Project Affected Persons
(PAPs) to ensure that they will benefit from the project and their standards of living will
improve or at least be restored after the project impact.
Acquisition of land and other assets for the project will adversely affect the
livelihood of persons who live, work or earn their living on the land that will be
acquired for the project. PAPs are defined as those persons whose income or
livelihoods will be adversely affected by land acquisition for the project. PAPs include
the following categories:
a) persons who have a title, right, interest, in structures (houses, enterprises,
shelters, or public buildings), land (including residential, agricultural, and grazing land)
or any other asset acquired or possessed, in full or in part, permanently or temporarily;
b) persons who use the structures, land or assets described above; or persons
whose business, occupation, work, place of residence or habitat adversely affected;
or
c) persons whose standard of living is adversely affected as a consequence of
land acquisition and/or resettlement activities.
Therefore, all these people who is affected will be considered and recorded
without considering its condition of property, land or location.
All PAPs are entitled to the improvement or at least restoration of their standards
of living, and compensation for the material losses they suffer. Compensation for
assets will cover replacement cost. No deductions or discounts will be applied to the
compensation amount for depreciation or other reasons. All PAPs deriving an
economic benefit from the affected land and property are entitled to receive
rehabilitation benefits in addition to the compensation for their assets lost. Those
PAPs without title, authorization or legal permission to reside, conduct business,
cultivate land or construct structures are eligible for rehabilitation of their livelihoods
I



and compensation for their assets on an equal footing with those with formal legal title,
authorization or permission to the assets.
The term of Resettlement and Rehabilitation:
Resettlement and Rehabilitation means: the arrangement of production and
living of project affected person, the restoration of the PAPs' resource capacity to
continue with productive activities or lifestyles at a level higher or at least equal to that
before the project.
a) the relocation of living quarters;
b) finding acceptable new employment for those whose jobs are lost or severely
affected;
c) restoration (or compensation) of affected productive resources such as land,
workplaces, trees and infrastructure;
d) restoration of other adverse effects on PAPs' living standards (quality of life)
through land acquisition, indirect resettlement impacts or other project impacts(as
harmful gas by pollution,etc.);
e) restoration of or compensation for affected private and public enterprises;
f) restoration of adversely affected on cultural or common property.
The objective of this RAP is to provide a plan for the resettlement and
rehabilitation of the PAPs so that their losses will be compensated and their standards
of living will be improved or at least restored to the pre-project levels in a sustainable
manner. Affected productive resources of businesses, enterprises (including shops)
and public facilities will also be improved or at least restored to their pre-project levels.

1. Generals
1.1 Project Background
1.1.1 Existing conditions
The Zhe-Gan Railway runs within Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan provinces,
starting in the east from Hangzhou, Yiwu, Jinhua, Shangrao, Hengfeng, Guixi, Yingtan,
Xiangtang, Pingxiang to Zhuzhou in the west, totally 942.648km long. This railway
connects the Hu-Hang Railway, Xuan-Hang Railway and Xiao-Yong Railway at its
east end, and links the Jing-Guang Railway and Xiang-Qian Railway at its west end. It
runs across the Jing-Jiu, Ying-Xia, Wan-Gan, Heng-Nan and Jin-Wen railways. The
Zhe-Gan Railway serves for passengers and goods transportation between the East
China Region, South China Region and Southwest China Region, and is the busiest
railway trunk connecting the east and west of China and the important component of
the "8 -Longitudinal-plus-8-Transverse Railway Network" and the "4-Longitudinal-
plus-4-Transverse Express Railway Network" of China.
The Railway is under the jurisdiction of three railway bureaus, i.e., Shanghai,
Nanchang and Guangtie Railway Group, respectively managing the railway section
KO+000- K324+531.59 (324.634km long, by Hangzhou Branch of Shanghai Railway
Bureau), railway section K324+531.59-K889+670 (563.138km long, by Nanchang
Railway Bureau) and railway section K889+670-K944+546 (54.876km long, by
Changsha Company of Guantie Group).
From Hangzhou to Zhuzhou, the Zhe-Gan Railway has 111 railway stations
(including six complex railway stations at Hangzhou, five at Yingtan, and two at
Zhuzhou), 42 railway stations under the management of Shanghai Bureau, 62 under
Nanchang Bureau and 7 under Guantie Group. Along the railway length, there are
four key passenger stations (i.e., Hangzhou, Jinhuaxi, Yingtan, and Zhuzhou), two
marshalling stations (i.e., Yingtandong and Xiangtangxi) and one regional station
(Jinhuadong).
1.1.2 Necessity of of railway electrification
The traveling speed-raising of the Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification has great
profound significance not only in the state's energy policy adjustment and energy
source restructuring, lowering of environmental pollution, improving environmental
quality, but also in self-development of railway transprtation industry, enhancing the
3



capability of trunk railway in the network, increasing trunk railway quality, raising train
traveling speed, updating the service level, strengthening the competitiveness in
transportation market, decreasing the operation cost, increasing the benefit of railway
transportation and realizing the sustainable development of the railway transportation
industry. At the same time, the scientific and technological level in railway
transportation industry can be heightened and modernization of railway service can
be promoted. Therefore, it is of great importance to raise the transportation speed of
the Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification.
A. Necessary for state's energy policy adjustment and energy source
restructuring energy utilization
Taking electricity as driving power can facilitate using of wide range of natural
resources, which enable the state to use the energy in an economically rational way,
and is favorable to realize common-sharing of resources and optimum distribution of
resources. This can avoid additional long-distance transportation cost caused by oil
consumption of railway itself, avoid the non-normal oil loss in storage and
transportation, thus, reducing the operational cost of railway operation. This will
safeguard the energy supply and prevents the impact of oil price rise caused by the
international oil price escalation, thus, getting rid of the impact of oil crisis and
obviating the risk. This is also beneficial in take the full advantages of the electric
facilities along the railway route and in solving the environmental pollution caused by
burning of diesel oil, thus, promoting the environment-friendly development of energy
industry. Therefore, rebuilding of the Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification fully reflects
the state's energy policy, coincides with the state's orientation in energy development,
benefit the implementation of sustainable development strategy of the country. It is
the need for state's energy policy adjustment and energy source restructuring energy
utilization.
B. Favorable to rational distribution of electrified railways
The China's Main Technical Policy for Railways points out that electric power
driving method should be adopted along the main busy trunk railways, express
railway, specific coal-transporting railways, and railways on long inclined slopes and
in long tunnels. As a key trunk railway, the electrification of Zhe-Gan Railway will
contribute to realizing of electrified railway network in Each China.
4



C. Necessary for improving operational conditions and shooting at even
greater market shares
The rebuilding of Zhe-Gan Railway by electrification will be favorable to raising
the passenger train traveling speed, and arranging passenger trains arriving
destinations with a half day, and will improve the service condition to a great extent by
which the passengers and cargo owner can be satisfied in traveling speed
requirement, cosiness, quickness and keeping on schedule, thus, well positioning the
railway service in the future transportation market.
D. Necessary for raising traveling speed, lowering operation cost and
increasing benefits
The Zhe-Gan Railway will not only increase the traveling speed, greatly improve
the conditions of attracting passengers, satisfy the demand of transportation volume
and enhance the competitiveness in transportation market, but also expedite the
circulation of the locomotives and compartments, thus, lowering the operation cost
and the benefit of the railway utilization.
E. Favorable for reducing pullution to environment and improving
environmental conditions
After electrification of the railway, except few internal-combustion engine
locomotiveswhich will be used for local branch railways, the Zhe-Gan Railway will
totally adopt electric-power driven locomotives, which will greatly reduce the pollutant
emmision volume. It is estimated that the quantity of emitted smoke volume will be
reduced by 38.6%, S02 by 26.7%, NOX by 87% and CO by 48.5%. The energy
consumption will be reduced by 250500 tons, and the local environment along the
railway routes and around the machine repair spots will be definitely improved.
1.1.3 Significance of the project
The Zhe-Gan Railway is the core section of the Shanghai - Kunming Passage,
and serves for most of passengers and goods exchange between the East China
Region, South China Region and Southwest China Region. The southwestem China
has abundant unique resources and is a labor souse concentrated area, thus, having
strong economic complementary effect with the East China Region. Along with
implementation of Western-Development Strategy, the social and economic
deveopment in the western China has geared up on quick track, the connection
between the east and west will be more and more tightend and frequent. The
5



Zhe-Gan and Jing-Jiu railways will jointly provide a simpliest and quickest in-land
passage between the Yangtze River Delta and Zhujian River Delta, and will provide a
good condition for enhancing the connection between the two major economic
developed areas. Meanwhile, the Zhe-Gan Railway is also one of the key passages in
the East China Region. Therefore, the Zhe-Gan Railway plays an important role in
connecting the eastern and western and southern China as well as the internal
connection of East China Region, promoting the economic development in the areas
along the railway routes, and implementing Westem-Development Strategy and
shortening the gaps between the eastern and western China.
The Zhe-Gan Railway is the important component of the "8-Longitudinal-plus
-8-Transverse Railway Network" and the "4-Longitudinal- plus-4-Transverse Express
Railway Network" of China. It connects quite a few of trunk and branch railways and is
the most important busy railway running across the eastern and western China on the
south of the Yangtze River, playing an important role in communicating the East
China with Mid China Region, South China Region and Southwest China Region. The
Zhejiang Section of the Zhe-Gan Railway is the only railway passage of Zhejiang
Province to Fujian Province and Jiangxi Province as well as to the Mid-China Region
and Southwest China Region. It is also the key component of the City-to-City Express
Railway Network in the Yangtze River Delta. Upon completion of the electrification of
Zhe-Gan Railway the traveling speed and cargo capacity of the Railway will be greatly
increased. The project is in coincident with the state's policy of energy restructuring
and sustainable development strategy, and will promote the social and economic
development of Zhejiang Province.
1.2 Project Design and Design Approval
The feasibility study report of the project had been completed by March 2002 and
was examined at mid March same year by Planning Department and Engineering
Appraisal Center of Ministry of Railways. The railway route measurement was
completed in mid February - mid May in 2002. The preliminary design of the project
by No.2 Railway Investigation and Design Institute (herein after referred to as No.
Institute) was completed from April 1st 2002 to end of June same year based on the
(draft) examination comments to the feasibility study report, which was examined at
mid July in Beijing by the Engineering Appraisal Center of Ministry of Railways.
According to the examination comments to the feasibility study report and
6



pre-examination comments to preliminary design of speed-raising project, the

1.4 Project Impacts
The Jiangxi Section of the Zhe-Gan Railway (K324+500- K887+950km) runs
through 22 counties/cities/districts, including Yushan, Guangfeng, Xinzhou district of
Shangrao city, Shangrao, Hengfeng, Yiyang, Guixi, Yuehu District of Yingtan city,
Yujiang, Dongxiang, Jinxian, Nanchang, Fengcheng, Zhangshu, Yushui, Xiannuhe
District, Fenyi, Yuanzhou District of Yichun city, Luxi, Anyuan Econoimc District,
Anyuan and Xiangdong districts of Pingxiang city. The project land requisition and
house relocation will affect 252 administrative villages (neighborhood committees) in
71 towns/townships/ street communities, farms and development zones. A total of
12187.9 mu of various kinds of lands will be requisitioned, including 8600.5 mu of
farmland, 2218.9 mu of woodlands, 1300.8 mu of building lands, 69.9 mu of unused
lands. The project will temporarily ocuupy 3177.2mu lands, including 2276.6 mu of
farmland, 614.8 mu of woodlands, 276.3 mu f building lands and 9.5 mu of unused
lands. A total of 422017m2 houses will be relocated, they belong to 5277 PAPs of
1421 households in 70 administrative villages of 46 towns (townships/ street
communities/ farms/ development zones), including 262491 m2 of brick-concrete
9



houses, 1 45806m2 of brick-wood houses, 1 3529m2 of clay-wood houses and 191 m2 of
simple houses. In addition, the project will also affect 87137 trees scattered in the
project affected areas and a few sppecial items.
1.5 Measures To Alleviate Project Impacts
1.5.1 In project planning and design stage
The project construction will certainly cause land requisition, house relocation
and inhabitant displacement, and will unavoidably affect the existing living and
production conditions of the local inhabitants. During project planning and design
stage, the designer and project owner have envisaged some measures to alleviate
project impacts to local social and economic conditions, including:
A. In design scheme optimization and comparison, due considerations have been
made in project impacts to local social and economic conditions and the project
impacts were taken as key factors in the optimization and comparison of the design
scheme.
B. In order to reduce the quantity of requisitioned land and number of displaced
inhabitants, the designer follows the principle of "keeping the prject site away from the
densely populated area and reduce quantity of house relocation where possible, and
minimizing the area of requisitioned land and farmland as well".
C. Efforts were made to optimize the construction design, shorten the
construction period, and reasonably schedule the house demolishing and rebuilding
and construction time.
1.5.2 In project implementation stage
A. Enhance the public participation mechanism. Before project construction,
public notices were distributed, stating the construction commencement date, and
planned construction schedules, and publicizing the compensation criteria for
resettlement, house relocation and land reuisition. This is aiming at receiving the
public supervision of the project affected sites.
B. Adopt dust-reducing measures. In order to keep the project construction sites
in a clean and neat environment condition and to reduce the impact of construction ot
the surroundings, water spraying for preventing dusts from the construction access
roads in the population densed areas in those days with fine weather and wind. The
The contractors are required to timely remove the excavated soil and rock through the
10



well-planned mucking routes, prevent overloading of the vehicles and adopt
measures to avoid rock and soil spilling out of the vehicles along the access roads.
C. Treatment of wastes produced at construction sites. As the project
construction period is long, there will be a large number of construction staff and
workers, and a large quantity of living rubbish and wastes of various kinds will be
produced at the construction sites, the project owner and contractors should timely
clean off the rubish and wastes according to the local environmental and sanitation
authorities so as to keep the sites clean and prevent epidemics.
D. During project construction, the local construction materials should be first
adopted and the local transportation service and labors should be used first so far as
technically feasible, so that the PAPs can be benefited from the project construction.
1.5.3 In resettlement action planning and implementation stage
In case when the house relocation and land requisition are unavoidable, the
following measures should be adopted to reduce the project impact ot the local
conditions.
A. Strengthening the basic date collection, in-depth analysis on the existing and
future development of the local social and economic conditions, and an operatable
RAP should be worked out with due consideration of the local reality, so as to
safeguard that the living standard of the PAPs will not be lowered as a result of the
project construction.
B. Enhance the intemal and external monitoring and establish the effective
message feedback mechanism and channels. Efforts should be made to shorten the
information handling circle to ensure the problems encountered to be handled in time.
C. Effective measures should be adopted by the contractors to minimize the
project construction ot the local production system.
1.6 Project Schedule
According to the general project schedule, the project construction commenced
on Feb.28th 2004. The planned construction period is about four years, in which 20
months will be for the speed-raising works (completed in Oct. 2005) and 14 months for
electrification works (completed in Dec. 2006). According to the general project
schedule, the preparatory work for resettlement implementation has been completed
and the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) prepared in the light of the World Bank
guideline will be submitted in March 2004 to the World Bank for appraisal. The
]]



resettlement implementation started in Feb. 2004. The official formalities for land
requisition, house relocation and inhabitant displacement are underway now and the
resettlement work are planned to complete before Jun. 2005, and the monitoring and
evaluation on the land requisition, house relocation and inhabitant displacement will
be followed according to the World Bank requirements.
1.7 Preparation for Resettlement, Monitoring and Evaluation
1.7.1 Breakdown of affected inventories and supplementary survey
In Jan. - Mar. 2004, under the leadership of Ministry of Railways and Nanchang
Railway Bureau, the Project Investigation Working Group was established, which is
staffed by the persons from the Zhe-Gan Railway Project Command Office of
Nanchang Railway Bureau, resettlement advisory unit, local government departments
at different levels and relevant organizations along the railway (Jiangxi Section). With
the technical guidance of East China Investigation and Design Institute (the
resettlement advisory unit of the Project) the Working Group broke down the affected
inventory indexes provided by No.2 Institute in Oct. 2003, which resulted from the
survey within the scope of land requisition and resettlement as determined in the
revised preliminary design, and carried out supplementary survey. In addition, based
on the survey into the social and economic conditions and environmental capacity for
resettlement in the project-afected areas, the resettlement advasory unit provided the
technical guidance and consultation in analysis on environmental capacity for
resettlement and formulation of the plans of land requisition, house relocation and
inhabitant displacement. The work in these two months was actively supported by the
local governments at all levels as well as the village (neighborhood) committees and
the PAPs. Inventory breakdown and supplementary survey cover different affected
objectives including various types of requisitioned land, affected population, relocated
houses and annexes, fruit trees and woods and relocated special items, etc.
1.7.2 Social and economic survey
In order to analyze the project impact and formulate a feasible PAR, the project
command offices of Shanghai Railway Bureau, Nanchang Railway Bureau and
Gunagtie Company, resettlement consulting unit, local governments, and relevant
units along the railway, conducted detailed social and economic survey at the project
affected areas and host sites. The survey covered the land resources, industrial
structures, economic level, income and expense condition, population, living mode,
12



culture and custom, traffic condition, natural resources and possible future
development, etc. The survey was carried out by data collectin and sampling, and
based on the data and information obtained, the existing local social and economic
conditions and actual living and production conditions were analyzed.
1.7.3 Resettlement plan
The resettlement planning of the project was carried out under the leadship of the
local county (city,district) govemments, which was based on the project affected
scope, and quantity of the affected inventory. The plan was prepared based on the
opinions of the villagers and resettlers and the actual conditions of the affected
townships, (towns, farms, development districts) and villages. The main measures to
be adopted in the resettlement are re-allocating the land within the original villages
and village groups, improving the infrastructures, developing the secondary and
tertiary industies, economic compensation and procuring endowment insurance. It is
to carry out the principle of production-developable reseettlement so as to ensure that
the host sites possess the basic materially living conditions and the potential for future
development, and to combine the resettlement with the regional economic
development so that the PAPs can restore their living standard or PAPs life can be
even better than that before resettlement.
1.7.4 Preparation of resettlement monitoring and evaluation
The project owner has entrusted Importing and exploiting Researching Office of
Xinan Jiaotong University to carry out the independent resettlement monitoring and
evaluation for the project. The preparation of resettlement plan was organized by the
project owner and participated by the project design unit, monitoring and evaluation
unit and local governments at all levels. The monitoring and evaluation unit provided
the technical consulting service, the design unit defined the resettlement scope and
the local governments were responsible for formulating the specific schemes for land
requisition and house relocation and inhabitant resettlement. Since March 2004, a
great deal of work has been completed, including successive estaablishment of
resettlement organizations, determination of project affected scope, work outline of
the the RAP, survey of the project affected inventories, social and economic survey,
research work for policy adoption, formulation of the resettlement schemes, cost
estimate for resettlement compensation, etc.. The RAP of the project (Jiangxi Section)
13



was finalized and preparation for resettlement monitoring and evaluation was
completed.

lengths, the largest ones are Ganjiang, Fuhe, Xijiang, Xiuhe and Raohe. The Poyang
Lake is the largest fresh water lake of China and the largest habitat for migrating birds
of the world. The province is close to the tropic of cancer, where the climate is warm
with plenty of rainfall. The annual average precipitation is 1341mm to 1940 mm. The
frost-free period is long and sub-tropical wet climate prevails, which is quite favorable
for the growth of crops. The ecological environment of the province is good, the forest
coverage is 59.7%, ranking the forefront of the country. The province has rich mineral
reserves, including copper, tungsten, uranium, tantalum, rare-earth material, gold and

2.2 Natural, Social and Economic Conditions at Project-affected Counties
(Cities, Districts)
(1) Yushan County
Yushan County lies in the northeast of Jiangxi Province, which enjoys the fame of
"key of two rivers and thoroughfare to eight provinces" since ancient time. It is
bounded on the east by Kaihua, Changshan and Jiangshan counties of Zhejiang
Province, on the south by Guangfeng, on the southwest by Xinzhou District and on
the north by Dexing with Zhe-Gan Railway, 320 national highway and Li-Wen
Expressway running through from east to west.
Natural conditions: It covers a total land area of 1728 km2. Its normal geomorphy
is mainly of monutain and hill and the climate is warm and humid all the year round
with mean annual temperature about 18°C and mean annual precipitation 2211.4mm.
Average annual frost-free period is 260 days and mean annual sunlight 1421.3 hours.
It has 18 townships (towns), 3 reservoir management bureaus and 274
administrative villages under its jurisdiction. By the end of 2002, its total population
has amounted to 540121, including agricultural population of 467258 accounting for
86.5% of the total. The population density is 312 persons/ km2 and natural population
growth rate 6.96%o. The actual rural labour is 169655 people accounting for 31.4% of
the total population, among them the labours engaged in agriculture accounting for
55.5% of the total labour and the labours staying away for jobs is 85751 accounting
for 50.5% of the total.
The agricultural products of the whole county mainly include paddy rice, rape,
potato and vegetable, etc.. Wild pigs, ibexs, muntjaks and monkeys appear and
disappear in groups and tigers, leopards, bears and wolves can be seen occasionally.
Wild southland spotted deer, fish with four feet, partridge, monkey and bear, etc. are
treasures in the mountains. The rivers in the county which give priority to Jingsha
Stream and Wangya Stream have steep slopes and high drop with abundant water
power resources. For its underground mineral deposits, limestone amounts to 3300
million tons ranking first in Jiangxi, stone coal reserve is 3200 million tons ranking the
second in Jiangxi. The rib inkstone in Huaiyu Mountain is praised as "blue body with
white, fine veins and clear grains" . Blind coal, iron, copper, phosphor, fluorite, crystal,
bentonite and so on all have mining value.
18



By the end of 2002, the whole county's existing farmland is 282021 mu including
paddy fields 264173 mu and dry land 17848 mu with gross annual grain output
164325 tons. Farmland per capita of agricultural population is 0.6 mu, grain quantity
per capita is 352 kg and mean rain output per mu is 583 kg. From the whole county's
overall economic situation, national economy develops sustainablely and rapidly and
keeps steady and healthy development with a stable increase in gross economic
amounts. The proportion of the tertiary industry increases continuously and the
structures of tertiary industries tend to be reasonable gradually. Gross domestic

structures still exist. The agricultural industrilization is in a low level with little scientific
content. There are few iindustrial enterprises with scale and there lacks the leading
enterprises to propel the whole county's economic growth. It is difficult for peasants to
increase their revenues and social secuity system needs to be perfected. Agricultural
production develops smoothly and agricultural and industrial structures are further
adjusted with decrease in cultivation area of traditional crops and increase in growing
crops with high economic value. Gross output value of industry and agriculture of the
whole county is 1615.73 million Yuan, among them gross output value of agriculture
719.39 million Yuan with an increase of 2.01% over last year and gross output value
of industry 896.34 million Yuan with a growth of 12.8% over last year and industry
accounting for 55.5% and agriculture 44.5% and gross output value of industry and
agriculture per capita 2991 Yuan. Rural residents' pure income per capita of the

primary schools. There are 37175 students in ordinary schools with a growth of 13.87
over last year. There are totally 18 broadcasting and TV sations, 56 CATV systems,
134 ground satellite receiving stations and 52 TV translator stations. Percentage of
19



CATV coverage reaches 89% and TV coverage rate 93%. Health facilities are further
strengthened and medical care conditions are much more improved. By the end of the
year, there are 1686 medical service organizations in all in the whole county with 1660
sickbeds and 3738 health personnels.

2.3 Basic Living and Production Conditions of Households Affected by
Land Requisition and House Relocation
In order to further understand the basic conditions of the households in the
project affected areas and analyze the project impacts to the PAPs, the project survey
working group conducted in Feb.-Mar. 2003 survey by random sampling into the
basic living and production conditions of the project affected households within the
project affected areas.
A. Selection of samples
The project affected households were randomly sampled, and totally 165 sample
households were taken and investigated into their basic living and production status in
detail. The samples covered all areas within the project affected scope, and had the
representativeness of all affected households. The distribution of the samples are as

B. Survey results
According to the on-sopt survey, the project affected areas in Zhejiang Province
are mostly the economic developed places of the individual counties (cities, districts),
and the resettlers will have more chances to find job in the secondary or tertiary
industries and their living standard is also rather high. The statistics of sampling
survey results show that the per capita net household income of the 165 sample
households is 2424 Yuan. 26.3% of the labors of the sample households are working
in the non-agricultural industries, of which 80% work in industrial enterprises and
8.2% in building industry. Most of these households are by the sides of the towns and
their income is rather higher the provinvcial average, (the provincial average of the
farmer in 2002 was 2334 Yuan). The annual gross income of these households
includes 41.3% from farming, forestry, husbandry, 14.9% from industry, commercial
and trading and food service, and 41.2% from labor service outsid their original places.
The agricultural production accounts to large percentage in the local economy. At
present, except the elderly persons who are comparatively living on the land, the
young labors are sucessively working outside of their original place and gradually get
rid of the restriction of the land, thus, less and less reliance on land can be seen. As
the project of linear nature has large impact scope but the impact is not too much
serious, it can be predited that after land requisition and house relocation, the adverse
impact of the project to the local rural economy can be alleviated by rational use of the
land compensation and adoption of proper resettlement measures. The basic
conditions of the project affected households are detailed in Table 2-3.

3 Project Impacts
3.1 Determination of Project Affected Scope
The scope of project impacts is confirmed according to the revised preliminary
design report provided by project design unit, No. 2 Design Institute of Ministry of
Railways in Oct. 2003 including route change, passenger and freight transport station
and its nearby traction substation, work area and subarea of contact system.
3.1.1 Land requisition
The scope of land acquisition for the project is determined on the basis of the
revised preliminary design provided by the project design unit, No. 2 Design Institute
of Ministry of Railways in Oct. 2003. Land requistion for the project includes roadbed
of rebuilding route, drainage ditch, bridge and culvert, station and its nearby traction
substation, work area and subarea of contact system.
3.1.2 Temporary land occupation
Based on the revised preliminary design report provided by the project design
unit, No.2 Design Institute of Ministry of Railways, in Oct. 2003, the scope of
temporary land for the project is determined. The temporary land for the project
includes land occupation of stocking ground, excavation waste dump, production and
living area during construction and temporary road for construction, etc..
3.2 Project Impact Survey
In order to find out the object and quantity of project resettlement and land
acquisition, under the leadership of Ministry of Railways and Nanchang Railroad
Bureau, a project investigation work group was formed which is composed of the
Project Construction Command Office of Nanchang Bureau, project resettlement
consultation unit and the local people's governments at all levels along the Zhe-Gan
Railway (Jiangxi Section). The project resettlement consultation unit, East China
Investigation & Design Institute is responsible for the technical issues. From January
to March 2004, on the basis of scope of land acquisition and relocation and affected
inventory index in the revised preliminary design report supplied by the project design
unit -No. 2 Design Institute of Ministry of Railways in Oct. 2003, inventry breakdown
and supplementary investigation was made for different affected objects such as
population, building, land and speical items influenced by the project.
51



The investigation method of population, land, houses and annexes, sporadic and
special items is as follows. With reference to the revised 1/2000 route plan of
preliminary stage furnished by No. 2 Design Institute, on the basis of administrative
limit of county (city and district), township (town, street, farm and development district)
and village (neighborhood committee), and in combination with the results of
supplemetary investigation made by design unit in preliminary design stage in Oct.
2003, the houses and their annexes were decomposed to villages and households;
additional investigation was made into the population involved in house relocation;
land was decomposed to individual villages (neighborhood committees) and
additional investigation for other affected abojects was made; and the special items
were decomposed to individual counties (cities, districts).
Owing to the particularity of construction of this project and some modification
comments and requirements for the revised preliminary design results put forward
by the local people's governments at all levels and resettlers along with the railway,
the project owner and design unit of the project and local people's governments are at
present negotiating and coordinating. The design unit is also revising the design
scheme, which results in some corresponding changes in the scope of land
acquisition. The pile-fixing and lofting has not been made on-situ for most of scope of
land acquisition. Accordingly, there will be some changes to certain extent in the
project affected inventory index in impelementation stage as comparing with the
revised preliminary design results. To confirm accurately each king of project affected
inventory index, in the next stage, the project owner, the designated departments
appointed by the governments along with the railway and the affected objects (village
sand households) will be organzied to jointly take part in field measurement and
checking of all inventroy indexes in the scope of land acquisition and house relocation,
and they will be requested to approve and sign the measurement and check results.
3.3 Project Affected Inventories
The Jiangxi Section of the project will displace 5277 PAPs of 1421 households
(2939 persons of 767 households for railway rout and 2338 persons of 654
households for railway stations) in 22 counties (cities, districts), distributing in 252
adminstrative villages (neighborhood committees) of 71 towns (townsips, street
committees, farms and districts). A total of 12189.7mu land of various types will be
permanently requisitioned (10353.4 mu for railway route and 1836.3 mu for railway
52



stations), 3177.2 mu land will be temporarily occupied by the project construction
(3175. mu for railway route and 1.9 mu for railway stations). Totally 422017m2 houses
of various types will be relicated (246413m2 for railway route and 175604m2 for raiway
stations), and 87137 scattered trees will be cut. A few of annexes and speical items
will be also affected.
3.3.1 Land requisition (occupation)
3.3.1.1 Permanent land requisition
The above mentioned 12189.7mu land of various types to be permanently
requisitioned (10353.4 mu for railway route and 1836.3 mu for railway stations)
includes plowland 8600.5 mu (6764.2 mu for railway route and 1836.3 mu for railway
stations), wood lands 2218.9 mu (all for railway routes), building area 1300.8 mu (all
for railway routes), unused land 69.6 mu (all for railway route). The details of land
survey results are shown in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2.

3.3.3 Project Affected Population
The affected population of the project was calculated through two measures, the
first is the actual affected population, which includes those to be affected directly by
house relocation, land requisition; the second is the theoretical number calculated
based on the State Land Law, i.e., the population needing production rearrangement.,
which is calculated on the basis of China's rural collective land ownership system of
village groups. In resettlement, the latter is taken as one of indexes in analyzing the
impact of land requisition.

3.3.7 Affected living and production facilities
The rural production and living facilities affected by the project construction
mainly include road of tractors, sidewalk and acequia, etc.. It has been considered in
project design to take palliation and rehabititation measures, therefore, their affected
conditions will not be investigated and counted. In the course of implementation, if
other impacts happen, the relevant inventory index and treatment measures will be
confirmed with the same principles and methods as in this RAP.
3.4 Analysis on Impact of Land Requisition To Regional Social and
Economic Conditions
Land acquisition and house relocation for Jiangxi Section of the project invovles
560 administrative villages (neighborhood committees) of 71 townships (towns,
street committees) in 22 counties (cities or districts) in Jiangxi province. To analyse
the impacts of land acquisition of the project on the local areas, the project
investigation group made a thorough investigation for the existing land resources of
the affected townships (towns, streets) and administrative villages and made detailed

Among the 252 affected villages, there are 230 villages where less than 10% of
the total village land will be affected; and after land requisition, there will be no big
change in land resource of these villages. By using the land compensation, the
income can be restored by land re-allocation, improving the low- and medium-yield
lands and restructuring of crop farming.
However, the remaining 22 villages will loss their plowland by over 10% of the
village total, which will imposes rather big impact to these villages. As these villages
are mostly in the city suburban araea and the their land has been requisitioned along
the urbanization in the area, the villages have been gradually changing from the
agriculture-oriented rural villages to the urbanized small towns and most family
income of the local rural households has early been from the secondary and tertiary
industries instead of the farming. As the existing per capita plowland holding of the
villages is extremely little (not more than 0.05 mu for most of thess villages), it still
looks that the land requisition, though not big in absolute value, will cause big
reduction of plowland in the villages. Howver, with the rational land compensation and
resettlement, the production can be restored by means of developing the local
secondary and tertiary industries.

E. Land requisitioned
According to relative land requisition policies of the state and prefectures, based
on the survey results of the production value per mu in the year from 2000 to 2003 for
different sorts of land, then combining with the practicality of project and project
involved prefectures, project land compensation criteria is finally determined. Since
project involves impact on many aspects, and the prefectures varies a lot on economy
developing level, compensation criteria is also different.
Comprehensive compensation respectively includes land compensation,
resettlement subsidy, compensation for young crops and timbers, of which
compensation criteria for paddy land 7000-15000 yuan/mu; 4000-10000 yuan/mu

construction land; 1100-2600 yuan/mu for wasteland.
F Land temporarily occupied
The compensation will be determined respectively based on the land category
and time occupied by the project construction. Since the temporary land for the project
construction will be used no more than a year generally, compensation criteria for
temporary land occupation of all kinds in respect counties (cities or districts) in Jiangxi
(including recultivation expenses, compensation for young crops and trees) is as
follows: farmland 1450-2900 Yuan/mu: dry land 1200-2600 Yuan/mu; and other

2000 Yuan each and 3000 Yuan each respectively.
4.3.3 Special items
At present, the relevant departments of respective counties (cities, districts) have
not yet provided their detailed restoration plans for project affected special items. The
cost estimation for these items is for the time being listed on the basis of actual
quantities and unit prices. The actual cost will be determined in the implementation
stage through consultation between the project construction command office and the
responsible departments of respective special items.

5 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
The resettlement plan for Electrification Project of Zhe-Gan Railway was
prepared jointly by project command offices of Shanghai Railway Bureau, the
people's governments at all levels along the railway route, as well as East China
Investigation and Design Institute. The above organizations established a joint
resettlement working team to plan for the project resettlement work on the basis of the
survey results of project affected inventories and according to the current policies,
laws and statutes and the World Bank's resettlement requirements as well as the local
actual conditions.
5.1 Objectives and Tasks
5.1.1 Resettlement objectives
The general objective of resettlement plan for this project is to provide the way for
resettlers to continue their production, reasonably arrange jobs for project affected
labors, and improve the living and production standards of PAPs or at least be
restored after the project impact.
As the project affected places are in the areas where the traffic condition is good
and the economy is developed, particularly, the individual business households and
family-based enterprises are very popular. The farmers there do not take farming as
their main living means but mainly live on trading, running their own business and
providing labor service. The grain production level cannot be taken as the base for
determining the resettlement planning schemes. Therefore, the objective of
resettlement for this project is set as follows.
(1) The income per capita shall be recovered to the standard before resettement.
(2) The public infrastructures, schooling, hospitalizing, social welfare level,
natural environment and traffic condition etc. shall be improved after resettlement.
5.1.2 Resettlement tasks
Based on the inventory survey and analysis, there are 8082 households with
30306 persons to be resettled, in which 1421 households with 5277persons will need
house relocation, and 7475 households with 28553 persons will need production
reseetlement, (in which 814 households with 3524 persons are superposition).
150



5.2 Policy and principle of resettlement planning
5.2.1 Resettlement policy
The resettlement work for this project should stick on the policy that: Esteem and
care for the living and production habits of the local PAPs, take full consideration of
the willings of the PAPs; with due consideration of the actual conditions in the original
townships (town, street committees) and villages (neighborhood committes), the rural
resettlers resettled on land basis without changing the agricultural status if land is
available for resettlement; based on developing the traditional crop farming and
guaranteeing the basic material survival conditions of the resettlers, guide and assist
the resettlers to develop the secondary and tertiary industries and to restore, improve
and raise the living and production levels of the resettlers, and reach the target of
prolonged social stability.
5.2.2 Resettlement principle
(1) The resettlement plan is based on detail affected inventory for land acquisition
and houses demolition, and the compensation and subsidies criteria of land requistion,
house relocation standards and inhabitant resettlement.
(2) The resettlement will be combined with the local development, resource
utilization and economic growth as well as environment protection. Considering the
local conditions, a practical and feasible resettlement plan should be developed to
restore and improve their economic production and create basic conditions for self-
development of the PAPs.
(3) The resettlement plan should be based on the principle "Beneficial to the
production and convenient for living".
(4) The re-construction standard and scale should be based with the principle of
recovery to the original standard and original scale. the cost for enlarging the
production scale, raising standard of facilities for local future development shall be
invested independently by local government and relevant department.
(5) Make overall plan and take all factors into consideration, correctly handle the
relations between the state, collective and individual.
(6) Combining provision of resettlement compensation and subsidy with
production support, fully utilize local natural resource to make the resettler' living
standard reach or exceed the original level step by step.
151



5.3 Overall Resettlement Scheme
Construction of the project will affect a small amount of houses and land along
the railway, which will not impose big impact to the original living and production
system in the existing villages. Consultation meeting have been held in the affected
towns, townships and villages to discuss the resettlement scheme. According to the
resettler's opinions and actual situation of the project affected places, it is determined
the the resettler's in the project affected places will be displaced in their original
villages and communities. This can ensure that the resettlers will keep their original
living and production habits, keep their custom and social relationship as before
resettlement, and the resettlers can comparatively easily restore and improve their
living and production level after resettlement. In order to minimize the project impact
to their living and production conditions, all old houses will be demolished after
construction of new houses are completed. The rural households whose houses will
be relocated will be resettled in their original villages, mainly on the land base and
suppiemeted by production development in secondary and tertiary industries. After
the economic compensation is paid to the village, the land of the village
(neighborhood committees) and village groups will be re-allocated at the will of the
villagers.
5.4 Analysis on carrying capacity for resettlement
5.4.1 Natural conditions and land resources
Since the project affected population will be resettled in their orginal villages and
communities, the natural conditions will not be the constriant factor of carrying
capacity for resettlement.
The carrying capacity analysis is based on detailed village-to-village survey.
During Jan. - Mar., 2004, Ministry of Railways, project command offices of the
Shanghai Railway Bureau and consulting unit organized a project investigation team
to carry out the survey. BY collection of local social and economic data, land use
survey results, annual statistical reports, and adjustable farmland possibilities among
each affected village group, and verification of their current land resources, population,
agricultural production, infrastructure, culture, education and sanitation, a detailed
carrying capacity analysis has been carried out. Based on the principle of using same
dialects, having similar ethnic costumes, faciliating traffic, providing complete cultural,
educational, medical and sanitary infrastructures and esteeming the resttlers' wilings,
152



it was determined that all the population affected by the project will be resettled in their
original village by moving back through adjusting land allocation and monitized
compensation. After the determination was made, the Project Management Offices
carried out, together with the leaders of the local townships (towns) and villages,
in-depth analysis on the actual land conditions and extent of project impact was made.
Of the 252 affected villages along the Jiangxi Secition of the project, there are
230 villages whose land to be requisitioned is less than 10% of the total land of each
village, thus, the impact of land requisition will not be much in the land resource of
these villages. The income loss caused by land requisition can be made up by using
the land compensation for land re-allocation, upgrading the low- and medium-yield
land and restructuring the crop farming. The land resource in those village groups will
not be the constraint factor of carrying capacity.
However, the remaining 22 villages will loss their plowland by over 10% of the
village total, which will imposes rather big impact to these villages. As these villages
are mostly in the city suburban araea and the their land has been requisitioned along
the urbanization in the area, the villages have been gradually changing from the
agricultural-production-oriented rural villages to the urbanized small towns and most
family income of the local rural households has early been from the secondary and
tertiary industries instead of the farming. As the existing per capita plowland holding of
the villages is extremely little (not more than 0.05 mu for most of thess villages), it still
looks that the land requisition, though not big in absolute value, will cause big
reduction of plowland in the villages. Howver, with the rational land compensation and
resettlement, the production can be restored by means of developing the local
secondary and tertiary industries.
The villages whose plowland land to be requisitioned is over 10% of the village
total are listed in Table 5-1.

5.4.2 Resettlers' characteristics and relationships
Among the project affected areas, the majority of affected people are Han
nationality. In order that the custom of the resettlers, original personal and social
relationship will not be affected to a possible ectent, and the distance to farmland will
not be increased, the resettlers of affected villages are planned to resettled within the
original villages and communities.
154



5.4.3 Basic Infrastructure Conditions for Production and Living
(1) Traffic Condition
Construction of the project will certainly affect the original traffic mode somewhat,
thus, some corresponding engineering measures have been considered in the project
design, which include building overpasses and intersections at main rural roads,
building pedestrian overpasses or underpasses near the main road of the villages,
schools, hospitals and other crowd area in order to ensure safty for people and
animals. Construction of the Project will not only improve the travel of the local
resident, enhance the circulation of freight and personnel, but also accelerate the
development of local economy. The living envoirnment and the infrastructures of local
resettlers will be upgraded after resettlement. Therefore, the traffic condition will not
be a constraint factor for carrying capacity.
(2) Water Supply Condition
The project is located in the plain and hilly areas of Southeast China Region and
Mid-China Region, where the economic and natural contions are rather good. Most of
the rural residents are mainly using tap water some are using water from wells dug by
themselves. As rivers run zigzag in the area and there is plenty of rainfall, water is
easily available for living and production and the project construction will not affect the
water use of the local residents. The water source and water quantity will not be a
constraint factor to the carrying capacity. Along with the economic development in the
project affected areas, the living and production conditions will be gradually improved.
(2) Water Supply Condition
The project is located in the plain and hilly areas of Southeast China Region and
Mid-China Region, where the economic and natural contions are rather good. Most of
the rural residents are mainly using tap water some are using water from wells dug by
themselves. As rivers run zigzag in the area and there is plenty of rainfall, water is
easily available for living and production and the project construction will not affect the
water use of the local residents. The water source and water quantity will not be a
constraint factor to the carrying capacity. Along with the economic development in the
project affected areas, the living and production conditions will be gradually improved.
(3) Electric Power Supply Condition
155



All electric power supply facilities affected by the project will be re-constructed
based on the orginal standard before the project construction, so the electric power
supply condition of the residents will not be affected.
(4) Medical & Education Condition
The medical and educational service facilities in the project affected areas will be
restored based on the orginal standard before the project construction. The existing
facilities in affected townships and villages could still be used. Access paths will be
constructed by the Project to ensure that no any inconvenience will be created for the
local people.
(5) Fuel Supply
The main fuel supply of the local residents is firewood collected from the nearby
hills. The project land requisition will impose little impact to fuel supply of the local
villages and townships . Along with construction of the project and improvement of the
traffic condition, purchasing coal and other types of fuels will be more and more easy.
5.4.4 Economic Development Potential of the Affected Area
In the rural areas affected by the project, farming is generally not take as the main
living means, and the secondary and tertiary industries are developed and it is rich in
land reserve, which leave a big development potential. In future, with improvement of
transportation condition, the resource advantage and good accessibility of local areas
should be fully utilized. According to local conditions, various income generation
opportunities should be developed by increasing input of science and improving
production technical level of the masses in order to promote overall development of
agriculture, forestry, sideline activities, as well as industrial, trade and transportation.
By using the land resource to develop production and increase the production and
living conditions of the resettlers, the carrying capacity of the project affected areas
will be enlarged along with the economic development in the areas.
5.5 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
5.5.1 Production Rehabilitation Plan
During project impact survey and resettlement planning, the project owner
organized the relevant units involved in the project development to hold consulting
meetings with the representatives of PAPs, cardres and villagers of the project
affected areas for discussing the resettlement scheme. According to the resettlement
156



policies of the state and Jiangxi province as well as the World Bank requirements, and
through the analysis on the carrying capacity for resettlement after land requisition for
the project, it is determined that the PAPs will be resettled within their original village
groups so that they can keep their original living and production ways and their social
relationship will not be affected after resettlement. It is to encourage the resettlers to
carry on their original job and to create conditions for developing local secondary and
tertiary industries.
The impact project land requisition varies with different village groups. The
resettlement planning team, together with the competent departments of local
governments and the resettlers worked out the production resettlement and
restoration plan in light of the actual conditions of each affected village. The plans can
be respectively summaried as follows.
(1 ) Yushan county
The land acquisition of this project.will affect 13 villages of 4 towns with total
area of 855.17mu, and the most is under 10% and 2 villages with larger impact(land
decreased over 10%), including 10-20% for Huyuan village of Liudu township and
Qilijie village of Binxi town. Generally speaking, the land acquisition impact is small
on the production and living of local people.  According to the impact of land
acquisition and actually condition, the production recovery plan of villages affected is
as the following:
Under the overall principle of "stable first, adjusting second", give compensation
by land adjustment for every 3 years;
Give compensation by flexible land from collective land reservation in villages
with certain conditions;
For the villages with larger impact as Huyuan village of Liudu township and Qilijie
village of Binxi town, no land adjustment will be carried out and distribute directly the
compensation fee of young crops, land acquisition and resettlement subsidy to the
resettlers; After getting agreement of villagers team, the land adjustment could be
performed within the villagers team, but the compensation fee for land acquisition and
resettlement subsidy will be controlled collectively by the team or distribute meanly to
whole village or whole team except the compensation fee for young crops which will
pay directly to the land user. But, the actual scheme shall consult with villager's
comment and pass by the villagers representative meeting.
157



Fully using national land compensation policy for land reclamation, and try all the
ways to open up wasteland to keep the dynamic balance of land amount and not lose
land completely to resettlers;
Develop actively the construction of small towns, construct a batch of rural trade

3rd industry except the old people who is engaging in agriculture production, and the
income of 2nd and 3rd industry is above 90%. Therefore, the impact of land
acquisition for local production and living is small.
The land acquisition of this project will affect 3 towns (street) and 10 villages
(neighborhood committee). After the land acquisition, the land decrease between
10-25% include Pengquan village, Quanjiang village, Putao village and Dacheng
village; over 25% include Qingshan village. According to the impact of land acquisition
and actually condition, the production recovery plan of villages affected is as the
following:
A. For these villages with larger impact as Qingshan village, the land per capita
is less than 0.06mu before the land acquisition, the most villagers are engaging in the
2nd and 3rd industry or go out for migrant working, therefore the impact is actually not
big to them. The compensation fee of land and resettlement subsidy will be distributed
directly to peasant or set basic living assurance system, but the actual scheme shall
consult with villager's comment and pass by the villagers representative meeting.
B. For Putao village, Dacheng village, Pengquan village, Quanjiang village, the
land adjustment will be carried out in whole villager or whole team, but the
compensation fee for land acquisition and resettlement subsidy will be controlled
collectively by the team for improving infrastructure and development of 2nd and 3rd
industry, except the compensation fee for young crops which will pay directly to the
land user. But, the actual scheme shall consult with villager's comment and pass by
the villagers representative meeting.
C. For the villages with small impact by land acquisition, the actual scheme shall
consult with villager's comment and pass by the villagers representative meeting and
no land adjustment will be made in whole village, except the compensation fee of
172



young crops to resettler, the distribution and use mehtod of other compensation fees
are as the following:
(1) It is hard for land adjustment because each village has no more flexible land.
The loss by land acquisition in the period of second-round land contract will be
compensated, the rest fees shall be shared collectively by whole villagers for
improvement of infrastructure and 2nd and 3rd industry, and the land adjustment will
be completed in the 3rd -round land contract.
(2) Pay compensation fee of land and resettlement subsidy directly to peasant.
(22) Xiangdong district
Xiangdong district is near the "Golden Delta" of Hunan province, at a special
position, developed traffic condition, complete infrastructure, where is one of most
developed areas of Jiangxi province. A certain scale of industrial pottery, chemical,
construction material system was set up, as electric porcerlain in Laoguan town,
chemical in Xiahu town, and cement in Xiangdong town. The resource of local labor
was not satisfied the demand of labor force for local economic development long ago,
therefore, the proportion of migrant worker is taking a great number. In the most
affected household, the most young and strong labor force is engaged in the 2nd and
3rd industry except the old people who is engaging in agriculture production, and the
income of 2nd and 3rd industry is above 95%. Therefore, the impact of land
acquisition for local production and living is small.
The land acquisition of this project will affect 4 towns (street) and 12 villages
(neighborhood committee). After the land acquisition, the land decrease between
10-25% include Wuli village, Xinjian village, Rixing village and Jimu village; over 25%
include Changcun village, Youtang village, Dukou village and Sanjiaoci village.
According to the impact of land acquisition and actually condition, the production
recovery plan of villages affected is as the following:
A. For these villages with larger impact as Youtang village, Dukou village,
Sanjiaoci village, Changcun village, Jimu village, Xinjian village and Rixing village, the
land per capita is less than 0.05mu before the land acquisition, the most villagers are
engaging in the 2nd and 3rd industry or go out for migrant working, therefore the impact
is actually not big to them. The compensation fee of land and resettlement subsidy will
be distributed directly to peasant or set basic living assurance system, but the actual
173



scheme shall consult with villager's comment and pass by the villagers representative
meeting.
B. For Wuli village, the land adjustment will be carried out in whole villager or
whole team, but the compensation fee for land acquisition and resettlement subsidy
will be controlled collectively by the team for improving infrastructure and
development of 2nd and 3rd industry, except the compensation fee for young crops
which will pay directly to the land user. But, the actual scheme shall consult with
villager's comment and pass by the villagers representative meeting.
C. For the villages with small impact by land acquisition, the actual scheme shall
consult with villager's comment and pass by the villagers representative meeting and
no land adjustment will be made in whole village, except the compensation fee of
young crops to resettler, the distribution and use mehtod of other compensation fees
are as the following:
(1) It is hard for land adjustment because each village has no more flexible land.
The loss by land acquisition in the period of second-round land contract will be
compensated, the rest fees shall be shared collectively by whole villagers for
improvement of infrastructure and 2nd and 3rd industry, and the land adjustment will
be completed in the 3rd -round land contract.
(2) Pay compensation fee of land and resettlement subsidy directly to peasant.
5.5.2 Plan for house relocation
According to the villager's opinion and actual condition of village and team
and combining the master plan of village, resettlers can be concentrated in original
village or new residence area(for large numbers) or scattered (for small number), and
house construction can also be concentrated (for large numbers) or scattered (for
small number), and keeping the original administrative management system and
using existing water, power, road, education, medical and health facilities. For few
resettlers who have additional house in other place for living, he can make application
for monetized resettlement and approved by local government and the resettlement
organization.
According to relative policies of Jiangxi province, the house plot standard for
rural residents is: not over18Dm2 for house plot and idle land, 12Dm2 for farmland,
24Om2for fell and waste land due to limitation of landform condition.
174



The house demolition and house construction of resettlers shall be performed
by their own wishes, and the resettlement organization will give compensation by
replacement price according to original house structure and area. The compensation
shall be paid by stages according to the progress of material preparation and house
construction. The resettler can build new house first or demolish old house first, if
demolish old house first, the subsidy of temporary house shall be paid.
Combining with the local condition, the house plot of resettler shall select
waste slope near road in original village or new residence area avoiding as far as
possible to occupy farmland and scattering for house construction. The residence
spot shall be relatively concentrated.
5.5.3 Social service facilities in host sites
The land acquisition will not affect the social service facilities of school and
medical station, so that the original school, medical room and commercial network
could be used and not necessary to build separately, and move the distance from the
resettlement plot to original social service facility is almost identical.
5.5.4 Resettlers' Administrative Management and house construction
Since the affected households will be resettled locally and economic
rehabilitation will be carried out within the affected villages, the administrative
structure will remain the same.
The house construction should consider the living habit and also leave the
room for the further development. The house demolition and house construction of
resettlers shall be performed by their own wishes, and the resettlement organization
will give compensation by replacement price according to original house structure and
area. The compensation shall be paid by stages according to the progress of material
preparation and house construction. The resettler can build new house first or
demolish old house first, if demolish old house first, the subsidy of temporary house
shall be paid.
5.5.5 Administration of Resettlement implementation organizations
Implementation of resettlement plan will be under the leadership of the project
owner and the relevant provincial people's governments, and the project affected
counties (cities, districts) will designate personnel from their relevant government
departments to establish resettlement organization to formulate the resettlement
policies, and assume the responsibility for publicization, mobilization, arrangement
175



and implementation of the house relocation and inhabitants resttlement. At the same
time, the resettlement organizations are also requested to hear and timely collect and
sort the resettlers' opinions and questions, and timely report such to the superior
organizations or the relevant competent departments and convey the opinions of
handling such issues to the resettlers in possible shortest time.
5.6 Restoration Plan for Special Facilities
The special facilities affected by the Project include: 11OkV, 1OkV and 380/220V
power lines, and telecom cables and power cables, which will all be relocated by the
local competent departments based on the relocation plan worked out by them. In
case the overhead power and telecom lines run across or parallel to the railway route,
they should be highly raised for crossing the railway or shifted horizontally away in
relocation. The underground telecom cables should run across the railway through
sleeves embedded under the railway.

E. Later on, the resettlement leading group and the resettlement offices at all
levels will make publicity of the resettlement policies and encourage the public
participation by the following ways.
-- Declaring Publicly Inventory Index
Declaring publicly the inventory index of each affected household before the
payment of compensation in order to be under the supervision of resettlers.
-- Declaring Publicly Compensation Policies
Declaring publicly the compensation policies for each effected item of household
before the compensation paid in order to be under the supervision of resettlers.
204



-- Establishment of Resettlement Information Booklet
The project resettlement office prepared resettlement information booklets to
ensure the local govemment and people in the affected areas to know the details of
the resettlement plan, and the booklet will be handed out to each of resettlement
households within the project site before project resettlement office obtains the
compensation. The information booklet covers main contents of resettlement plan,
compensation criteria and resettlement policy, the right of resettlers, respondent and
the appeal ways.
-- Holding Meeting
Public meeting will be held to explain relative policies, laws and rules and
compensation criteria in detail so that the PAPs can know these early before the
implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement
Issue relevant land acquisition and relocation announcement through local
newspaper or broadcasting television before enforcement of resettlement; Put up
bulletin to propagate resettlement policy, compensation standard and complaint
channel in the scope of towns and villages affected using easy language that
resettlers accept most according to local resident national composition condition;
The resettlement action plan report is put in local library or the project coordination
office to facilitate the resettlers to read.
9.1.3 Participation during Resettlement Implementation
All resettlers will be encouraged to participate in the whole process of
implementation of the RAP.
A. Participation in House Reconstruction
(1) The compensation criteria for housing will directly affect the interests of the
resettlers. Before the houses are relocated, the relevant resettlement authority will
consult and sign an agreement with the resettlers on the compensation criteria for the
houses. The consultation results will be declared publicly before the agreements are
signed, so as to put the resettlement under public supervision.
(2) Resettlement Host Sites and House Reconstruction
At the RAP preparation stage, the relevant authority carried out survey on the
resettlement host sites and the way of house reconstruction. According to the survey,
most of the affected households are willing to have their houses relocated in their own
groups and to rebuild houses by themselves. The local governments at all levels will
provide assistance at different stages for house relocation.
(3) Disposal of Old Houses
205



All the old houses to be demolished will be compensated at replacement cost
without depreciation. Within a specified time period, resettlers can, on their will,
demolish their old houses first and then rebuild the new houses or vice-versa. The
salvageable material from the old houses can be used by resettlers themselves
without deduction from compensation.
B. Participation in Production Rehabilitation
The land re-adjustment and redistribution process should be decided after
incorporating the opinions of the PAPs and agreed at the villager respresentative
meetings.
C. Participation in Using Land Compensation
According to the ownership in affected area, the land compensation will be paid
to the villager group and shall not be carved up or used for other purpose. The
compensation will be used in a planned way and for specific items planned. The use
of the money will be approved by the villager respresentative meetings and under the
supervision of the villagers.
D. Participation in Project Construction
The project construction will cause certain impacts on the local community. In
order to ensure the PAPs benefit from the project construction, the local people will be
encouraged to take part in the construction, and favorable conditions will be created to
use local materials and local labor force.
9.2 Grievance and Appeal
The public participation is always encouraged in the process of compiling and
implementing of the RAP. There will be some unforeseeable problems occurring in
the process. In order to solve problems effectively and ensure the project construction
and land requisition is carried out successfully, a transparent and effective grievance
and appeal channel has been set up. The basic procedures for grievance include the
following steps.
Step 1:
If any resettler is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement, he/she can state
their grievance and appeal to the village/neighborhood committee or the township
(town, street committee) resettlement office in oral or in written form. If an oral appeal
is made, the village will record it on paper and process it. Village committee or
township (town) resettlement office will make decision on or resolve it in two weeks.
Step 2:
206



If the aggrieved resettler is not satisfied with the decision in Step 1, he/she can
appeal to the county (city) resettlement office or the Leading Group after receiving the
decision; the county (city, district) resettlement office will reach a decision in two
weeks.
Step 3:
If the aggrieved resettler is still not satisfied with the decision of Step 2, he/she
will appeal to the Provincial Project Leading Group office after receiving the decision,
the Provincial Project Leading Group office will reach a decision in two weeks.
Step 4:
If the PAP is still dissatisfied with the decision of Step 3, he/she will appeal to the
civil division of a people's court according to the civil procedural law after receiving the
decision.
The resettlers can appeal on any aspect of resettlement, including compensation
criteria and price.
The resettlers be apprised of their rights for lodging appeals during participation
in the public meetings and by receiving resettlement information booklet. At the same
time, the grievance and appeal process will be publicized among the PAPs through
media. The relevant authorities will sort out the opinions and proposals of the PAPs
and the resettlement offices at all levels will process the information in a timely and
effective manner.
The organizations will accept the grievance and appeals of the PAPs free of
charge, and the reasonable expenses incurred there from will be paid by the PRO
from the Project's contingency fund.
207



10 Monitoring & Evaluation
In order to guarantee that the RAP can be smoothly implemented and the
resettlement target suitably realized, the follow-on fact finding and monitoring will be
carried out throughout the whole process. Monitoring on the resettlement will be
divided into two parts, i.e., internal monitoring (by the resettlement offices) and the
external independent monitoring.
10.1 Internal Monitoring
10.1.1 Target and Task
The target of internal monitoring is to maintain supervision responsibility of the
resettlement organs as specified in the RAP during implementation, and ensure that
the project can be constructed smoothly and the resettlers' legal rights will not be
impaired. The auditing department of the provincial government will independently
exercise the auditing monitoring function over concerning units under its jurisdiction in
accordance with the laws and regulations. The* superior units assume the
responsibilities for monitoring their subordinates so that the RAP principle and
schedule can be followed.
10.1.2 Institution and Staff
The internal monitoring for land acquisition and resettlement will be under the
leadership of the project command office of Nanchang Railway Bureau and performed
by local county (city, district) project resettlement leading group offices and villages.
To make the internal monitoring effective, full-time professionals will be assigned
within all the resettlement offices at all levels. All of them have participated in the
compilation and implementation of the RAP, and they will carry out the internal
monitoring control in the processes of the work. The responsible institutions and
persons for internal monitoring and data processing are shown in Table-1.

10.2.4 Monitoring and Evaluation Measures
Monitoring and evaluation will be performed on the basis of the survey data
provided by the survey design institution and resettlement implementation institutions.
With an overall understanding of the situation, the evaluation will be performed by
sample survey, key informant interviews and rapid rural appraisal techniques. Typical
samples, including resettled households, affected villages and Townships will be
selected to establish evaluation index system for different types of PAPs. Experienced
experts will be invited to decide in a back-to-back way the weights for different
indexes. Referring to the updated research output on living quality both in China and
abroad, the indexes will be non-dimensionally treated, and the survey results will be
analyzed and the computation results evaluated and compared. In addition to typical
samples, there will also be focused investigation of vulnerable groups.
Generally, the external monitoring and evaluation institution will carry out the
following work.
(1) Survey of resettlers' living standards
A base-line survey will be conducted for this project, including the collection of
selected samples of the base-line living standards of the resettlers. (The preliminary
samples will be randomly collected). The living standard will be investigated once or
twice a year to monitor the variation in the resettlers' living standards. The necessary
data can be obtained by periodical survey, random interview and site visit, based on
which statistical analysis and evaluation are performed.
The survey comprises various indicators of living standards. some of the
indicators will be used for weighing the dynamic variation of living standards before
and after the land requisition and resettlement. The selected indicators will be
checked to see whether they are reasonable in reflecting the actual production and
living levels in the base-line survey and are subject to modification according to the
actual conditions, so as to guarantee the message obtained reflects the quality and
quantity of the real situation.
Sampling scale: resettlers: 5%, sample villages by land requisition: 10%,
enterprises or self-employees: 20%.
(2) Holding Public Consultation
213



The independent monitoring and evaluation institution will participate in the public
consultation conferences held by the villages (neighborhood committees) and
townships (towns, street committees). By this method, the institution can evaluate the
effectiveness the public participation and the cooperative attitude of the resettlers
towards the RP implementation. Such activities will be conducted during and after the
resettlement implementation.
(3) Gathering Resettlers' opinions
The independent monitoring and evaluation institution will often interview the
township (town, street committees) resettlement offices and village groups to know
the opinions collected from the resettlers and interview the resettlers who have
grievances. The institution will report the opinions and suggestions from affected
individuals and collectives to the Project Resettlement Office, and provide advice for
improvement, so that the resettlement implementation can be more smooth and
effective.
(4) Other responsibilities

Most of the participants know that this project is one of the national key project, and
will be construction, and express that they will actively support the project construction. At
the same time, they think though the project construction will bring about some adverse
influence to the collectives and individuals, it will be benefit to the local economic
development and facilitate traveling of the local people. Therefore, the project is necessary.
As to the compensation of land requisition and house relocation, they express that this
should follow the relevant policies of the state and the compensation should be better to
pay to the affected units and individuals directly from the project owner, so as to minimize
the intermediate procedures and avoid carving-up and peculation of compensation.
About production resettlement, as peasants, they hope a piece of land can be allocated
to them to guarantee their living requirement, and part of the compensation to build
irrigation facilities to upgrade the low- and medium-yield land. The farming should be
restructured and develop the special agricultural production and increase the economic
output value of agricultural and sideline products. Some of the villagers would like to work
outside or open their own business or work in service industry, so as to improve their
livelihood.
For the resettlement, they hope the implementation institutions will work out reasonable
compensation and execution policies according to the actual conditions of the local people,
enhance the supervision over the management of the compensation, and ensure their
deserved interests. On selection of house plots and building of new houses, they hope the
219



PAPs opinions can be accepted where possible.
In addition, the young participants hope that some of the compensation can be
distributed to individuals, but the village group cadres suggest to use the compensation to
improve the production conditions, promote the farming technologies, and they think the
compensation should be used for "sanguification", not merely as compensation.

The participants know that this project is one of the national key project and will be
construction, and express that they will actively support the project construction. At the
same time, they think though the project construction will bring about some adverse
influence to the collectives and individuals, it will be much benefit to the local economic
development and facilitate traveling of the local people. The local biological environment
will be affected by the project construction to certain extent. However, the benefit is bigger
than frauds. Therefore, the project is necessary.
Regarding compensation to land requisition and house relocation, they express that
this should follow the relevant policies of the state and the relationship among the state,
collective and individual should be well handled, and compensation should be better to pay
to the resettlers and directly from the project owner, so as to minimize the intermediate
procedures and avoid carving-up and peculation of compensation.
About production resettlement, most of them think it is not necessary to re-allocate the
land, and most of the villagers hope that the monitized compensation should be adopted for
land requisition, and the family income is better to get through work outside, opening
private business and work in service industry.
Regarding to resettlement, as Caijian Village has a rather poor living condition, and is in a
small and lower place which is warded off by the existing railway and has mountains
behind, villagers strongly request that the whole village be moved to other side of the
railway to get a better location for their houses. They hope the implementation institutions
will work out reasonable compensation and execution policies according to the actual
conditions of the local people, enhance the supervision over the management of the
compensation, and ensure their deserved interests. On selection of house plots and building
of new houses, they hope the PAPs opinions can be accepted where possible.

The participants know that this project is one of the national key project and will be
construction, and express that they will actively support the project construction. At the
same time, they think it looks that the project construction will benefit the local economic
development in general, but will bring about some adverse influence to the collectives and
individuals. The local biological environment will be affected by the project construction
to certain extent. However, the benefit is bigger than frauds. Therefore, the project is
necessary.
Regarding compensation to land requisition and house relocation, they express that
this should follow the relevant policies of the state and the province (city). They hope that
the relationship among the state, collective and individual should be well handled, and
compensation should be paid reasonably, and is better to pay to the resettlers, so as to
minimize the intermediate procedures and avoid carving-up and peculation of
compensation.
The project will affect the only irrigation source (three irrigation reservoirs) of
Hushan Village. For production resettlement, as peasants living on farming, they think the
most critical matter is to ensure the the sufficient water supply for irrigation. They have
referred this matter to the local government and the project owner, and the constuction unit
has investigated the reservoirs. Secondly, they are concerning very much about the living
ways and livelihood guarantee after resettlement. Through land re-allocation, a piece of
plowland will be obtained for ensuring their living. Part of the villagers hope to get the
family income through work outside, opening private business and work in service
industry.
Regarding to resettlement, they hope the implementation institutions will work out
222



reasonable compensation and execution policies according to the actual conditions of the
local people, enhance the supervision over the management of the compensation, and
ensure their deserved interests.
On selection of house plots and building of new houses, they hope the PAPs opinions can
be accepted where possible.
