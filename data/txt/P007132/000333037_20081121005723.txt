3.3 OriginalComponents:
A. InstitutionalStrengthening
I.       Strengthening of CONAM's capacity to: (a) coordinate and supervise, as          well as promote legal
changes required for the reform measures of the telecommunicationsand           electricity sectors and the proper
utilization of proceeds derived from privatizationof those sectors:    and (b) carrv out more effectively its
functions as coordinator of public enterprise reforn.
2.       Development and implementationof promotional campaigns to highlightthe              need for public
enterprisereform, encourage private investment in economic activities        formerlycarried out by public
enterprises, and expose key public officials (through study tours and seminars)        to the privatization
processes which have occurred in other countries.

B. Telecommunications Sector
I.       Reform of the sector policy and legal/regulatory framework to        facilitateproperly regulated private
sector provision of services in Ecuador.
2.       (a) Institutional strengthening of the public entities in chargeof    policy and regulatory functions in
the sector (including training of such entities' personnel); (b) granting   licensesto service providers; and (c)
improvement of radio spectrum management through establishing          a radio frequency licensedata base,
monitoring of frequency emissions, improved control of the spectrum, and assignment            of new frequencies.
3.       Technical assistance for preparing the privatization of, and actually privatizing,      the provision of
telecommunications services which currently is EMETEL's responsibility.           Such privatization isto occur
through concession arrangements (which shall, if possible, be accompanied by           sale of the assets of, or
shares in, EMETEL).
4.       Technical assistance for analyzingand executing the possible privatizationof         telecommunications
services provided by municipalities.

2.       Institutional strengthening of the publicentities in charge of policies and regulation(including
through training).
3.       Technical assistance (including for environmental matters) for: (a)   restructuring of INECEL (and
all other sector entities over which the Borrower, directly or  indirectly,has managerialcontrol), by means
of creating separate corporations for generation, transmission,   and distributioni;and (b) preparing for the
privatization of, and actually privatizing. electricityservices which were provided by    INECEL and the
distributionienterprises largely owned by INECEL. Such privatization       isto occurthrough sale of the assets
of, or shares in, INECEL. Said entities' operations are to be based   on concession agreements.

3.5 Qualitvat Entry:
Quality at entry was satisfactory. The project objectiveswere consistent with     the Bank'spolicy for the
electricity and telecommunications sectors prevailingat appraisal    and with the Government's priority to
reform the legal/regulatoryframework of those sectors, inorder to     enhance private participation. The
Project was also consistent with the Bank'sJune 1994 country assistance      strategy. Project design and
implementation plan were adequately prepared. The Bank'senvironmental          classification of the Project as
"C" was appropriate because the policy focus of the technical    assistance was expected to have a very
limited environmental impact. Regarding project risks,the Bank      recognized that althoughthe Project was
designed to assist the Government's objectives and strategy, there   were significant political risks associated
with changes in government administration and uneven Congressional        support. These riskswere covered in
the initial stage of project implementation,as a loan effectiveness  conditionalityobliged the Government to
enact at least one of the two sector reform laws and open a project   account in a privateEcuadorian bank to
ensure the flow of counterpart funds. However,the political risks (which     effectivelymaterialized and
delayed project implementation by 17months) were more serious than        estimated by the Bank and the
Government.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievementof objective.
The objectiveof supporting the Governmentthrough technical assistance        was met in regard to (i)
modernizingthe structureof the enterprises in the electricity and    telecommunicationssectors;(ii) creating
the regulatory and enforcement institutions for applying the new    legaland regulatory frameworks; and (iii)
preparing the enterprises for privatization. The Project was instrumental    in achieving the successful

segmentation and corporatization of INECEL and operation of thesuccessor companies for electricity
generationand transmission, as condition of their privatization. In the case of telecommuniciations,the
Project was successful in preparing the actual process leadingto privatization as EMETEL was brought to
the point of sale as anticipated. However, the auction was not successful because of last-minute
withdrawal of key bidders against the background of a difficult nationaland international environment.
Politicaland popular opposition preventedachieving the objectiveof reducingthe subsidies for electricity
consumption to sustainable levels. and electricity tariffs in realterms are now lower than at project
appraisal (3.7UScents/kWh in December 1999vs 6.1UScents//kWh in December 1994.) However,given
that the objectives of modernizing the sector enterprises and creatingthe appropriate
legal/regulatory/institutional framework wNereachieved inthe faceof considerable political obstacles, and
despite the set-backs in policy implementationi.the outcome of the Project is considered marginally
satisfactorv.


Electricitv and TelecommunicationisSector Policies. The policies regardingthe scope of the
legal/regulatory reforms in the electricity and telecommunications sectorsNkerewell stated at project
appraisal. But the priority given to their implementation varied greatly during the four government
administrations in office during 1995-99. In the end, the separation of the Government's policy and
regulatory'functions from the commercial functions in those sectorshad been anchored in the new
Electricity and Telecommunications laws. The latter Law, however. needs substantial changes to
adequately respond to important developments intechnology that increasethe variety of services offered,
and to principles of administrative efficiency. Althloughthere seems to exist agreement at the policylevel
about the need to transfer the commercial functionisin electricity and telecommunicationsto private
enterprise, a consensus is still being soughton how and when to do it. Overall, achievement of sector
policyobjectives is considered modest.


Institutional Development. In the electricitv sector, the achievements are highly satisfactory: the 1996
Electricity Law (Le' del Regir7ientclelSector Elctrico) created CONELEC as the planning, regulatory,
and supervisory entity of the sector, and CENACE as the autonomoustechnical and commercial
administratorof the wholesale electricity market as well as coordinatorfor operating the nationalelectricity
transmission system. Launched in November 1997 and February 1999,respectively. CONELEC and
CENACE are operating well. In contrast, in the telecommunicationssector, the achievements are only
marginally satisfactory. The 1995 Telecommunications Law did not bring about a streamlining of
institutions: it created CONATEL as the sector regulatory entity and assigned to the National Secretariatof
Telecommunications (SENATEL) the sector policy-making function. SUPTEL- the entity established in
the Constitution of Ecuador to enforcecompliance - remained in place, as well as CONARTEL, the
 institution incharge of regulating activitiesof radio and television. The entities are fully functional and are
working well. However, there is stillsome duplication of functions between CONATEL and SUPTEL,
which affectsadversely sector operations. Overall, the achievementof institutionaldevelopment objectives
 is consideredsubstantial.

 Private Sector Development. Existing legislation including the March2000 Onmibus Law allows broad
 private participation in the electricity and telecommunications sectors. The six generation companies and
 one transmission company in which INECEL was segmented ought to facilitate private investors'
 participation. These companies and 18distribution companies are inthe process of being privatized with
 the assistance of an investment bank financed by teh Interamerican Development Bank (IDB), and
 CONAM is actively mobilizing investors' interest. But privatization of ANDINATEL and PACIFICTEL,
the two companies into which EMETELwas segmented, did not materialize in spite of two attempts in
 1997-98,mainly because of the unrealisticallyhigh base price for 35 percent of the companies' assets that
 was offered, uneconomic tariffs, regulatory uncertainties, and the lackof investorconfidence in the political

and economic situation of the country. An investment bank to assist the Government in       privatizingthese
two companies isplanned to be selected and financed as part of a follow-onloan to        PERTAL once a new
telecommunications law is enacted. Given their uneven nature, achievementsare         considered modest.

Electricitv Subsidies. The reduction of subsidieson electricity consumptionwas       not achieved despite
considerable efforts by CONAM and CONELEC (supported by consultants) to prepare              proposals to raise
tariffs to levels covering long run marginal cost (LRMC) over a 15-18monthsperiod.          Consequently,
sector financesdid not improve, which is an unsatisfactory outcome. CONELEC in           October 1999 decided
to adapt a systemof average electricitv tariffs developed by consultants and based on     sound economic
principles. But the Government insistedthat cost-covering tariffs shouldbe achieved       only intwo years
henice,arguing that the economic crisis afflictingthe countrv ruledout drastic     step increases inelectricity
tariffs. Thus. CONELEC has applied instead monthilyincreases in average tariffs,       aimed at reaching 80
percent of their economic levels by October 2000 and 100percent by October2001, but to          maintain
cross-subsidies for electricity consumption below 200 kWh/month. As a result, the        December 1999
average tariff of US$0.037/kWh was equivalent to only 46 percentof         economic cost of US$0.081.
Inadequate tariffs are seriously affecting the financial position of the generation  companies because their
clients -the distribution companies- are not able to mobilize adequate revenues from      final consumers that
would cover the cost of electricity generation and transmission.

Telecommunications Tariffs. Tariffs for nationalcalls (local and long distance) were consolidated        in 1997
into three catecories. Tariffs for internationalcalls have remained grouped into four geographical      areas.
All tariffs have decreased since 1997 inreal terms, especially tariffs for localcalls. For example,     the
registration fee for categories A and B has been reduced from US$172 and US$344          in 1997to US$ 32.70
and US$ 65.30, respectively, in 2000. At the same time, the tariff for local calls decreased    from 0.58
UScents/minute in 1997 to 0.21 UScents/minute in 2000 for categoriesA and B (64 percent          reduction), and
the tariff for calls to the USA and Latin-American countries other than Andean Pact countries,       decreased
from 1.10US$/minute in 1997to 1.00 US$/minute in 2000 (9 percent reduction).            Tariffs for calls to
Andean Pact countries, and Europe and Japan have remained constantat 80 US$cents/minute             and 160
US$/minute, respectively. On the other hand, national long distance tariffs decreased     from 2.86
UScents/minute in 1997 to 0.82 UScents/minute in 2000 (249 percent reduction). Since         international
tariffs continue to subsidize tariffs for national calls, further progress needs to be made to reduce and
eventually eliminate that subsidy.

4.2 Outputsbycomponents:
The main outputs of the Project are:

Electricity sector:
1. Preparation and application of the new Electricity Law. This Law aimed at segmenting          the sector into
     generation, transmission, and distribution corporations, creating the regulatory and   supervisory entities
     of the sector, and removing commercial activities from the Government by enabling private
     participation through a concession system for generation, transmission, and distribution.
     Policy-making functions were assignedto the Ministry of Energy and Mines. The         Law also created a
     wholesale market introducing competitionin electricity generation;
2. Creation and launching of CONELEC as regulatory entity;
3. Creation and launching of CENACE as administrator of the wholesale electricity market          and
     coordinator of the national transmission system;
4. Segmentation of INECEL into seven corporations, i.e., three hydro-generatingcompanies            (Paute SA,
     Agoyan SA and Pucara SA), three thermal-generating companies (ElectroGuayas           SA,
     TermoEsmeraldas SA, and TermoPichincha SA) and one transmission           company (Transelectric SA).

    The existing 18 distribution companies were already   organized and continue to operate as state-owned
    corporations;
5. Preparation and application of general sector regulations   to the new Electricity Law (1997); regulations
    for CONELEC (1997), COMOSEL (1998), FERUM (1998),               tariffs (1998), electric service supply
    (1999), operation and load dispatch of the national interconnected   system(1999), and operation of the
    wholesale market (1999); and concessions for operations (1998);and
6. Design of a model to calculate electricity tariffs based on economic principles;preparation of a revised
    schedule of cost-covering (non-subsidized)tariffs

Telecommunications sector:
I. Preparation and application of the 1995Telecommunications        Law. This Law resulted in separating
    policy from regulatory functions and assigning operating   fulictiolisto two corporations resultingfrom
    the segmentation of EMETEL. Also. the telecommunications        market xsasopened to competition after
    1995 through creation of multipleoperators and licensees for celLIlartelephony,     VISAT, intemet
    services, and cable television. Regulations of services  providedby the fixed-line operators were
    pLiblishedin 1997-98;
2. Creation of CONATEL as the sector regulatory       entity (1996):
    Assignment of policy-making to SENATEL (1996);
4. Preparation of regulations to the new Telecommunications      Law(1996)
5. Segmentation of EMETEL into ANDINATEL            and PACIFICTEL(1997); and
6. Preparationof a revised telecommunications law aimed       at simplifyingthe institutional structure of the
    sector and facilitating the introductionof modern services resultilngfrom  technological advances (since
    December 1999).

InStitutionalstrengthenin:
1. Creation of the Public Enterprise Unit at CONAM in      chargeof project execution;
2. Creation of a modem informationnetwork in      CONAM (hardwareand software) with operational
    budget support from the Govemment;
3. Creation of committees at CONAM to modemize         the electricitysector (COMOSEL) and the
    telecommunications sector (COMOTEI) and prepare both         sectors for privatization;
4. Creation of the Solidarity Fund for the financial management     of the revenues generated by the
    privatization of the electricity and telecommunications sectors;
5. Training of 19 professionals who attended 23    short sessions (totaling43.2 man-weeks) on sector
    reforms, regulation, privatization,and commercial contracts, at a   cost of nearly US$110,000. Of these
    professionals trained, 12continue working in CONAM and CONADE.             Training-related expenditures
    for professionals remaining inthese institutions account  for 82 percentof total allocations for training;
    and
6. Visits to Ecuador by experts of CAMMESA (Argentina)         who assisted CENACE in initiating electricity
    wholesale operations, and by other intemational experts.

                                                     -6 -

strengtheningthe administrative capability of those   sectors. The corporatizationof the state-owned
electricity and telecommunications utilities holds out the  prospect of more efficientoperations, in
preparationof the utilities' privatization. Overall, the institutional development impact is considered    as
substantial.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation             and Outcome

5.1 Factorsoutisidethecontrolofgov,ernmentor imiplementingagencv:
The pursuitof the Project's objectives was   seriouslyhampered by extremepoliticalvolatility      and economic
instabilityfrom 1995onward when the reform-mindedgovernment             inoffice at the time of project approval
lost parliamentary support and later, was succeeded by    three governmentswhose commitmentto          reform
was considerably weaker. Thus, the political platform     on which the Project was based changed
considerably durinigthe period of actual project  implementation. The Govenmenitoften         did not have the
necessary political support in Congress to  enact the proposed legislationon refonn and      privatization of the
electricity and telecommunications sectors.    For example, Congress approved legislationilimiting
non-governmentownership in these sectorsto       49 percent (of which 14percentwNas for employees),      even
though operatorship was envisaged for the    strategic investors. The 1997-98"El Niho"       climatic
phenomenonunleashed an economic deterioration which          was aggravated by intensifiedinternalpolitical
conflict in 1999. The lack of interestby private   investors in the privatizationof the telecommunications
enterprises was caused by this deterioration of  Ecuador's economic and political situation and     to a certain
degree, fast technological developments in the   telecommunications field,which were largelybeyond
governmentcontrol.

5.2 Factorsgenerall' sutbjecttogovernmnentcontrol
Three changesof Government that occurredduring         1995-99 resulted in policy shifts and changes    in senior
policy-makers who had a varying understandingof       and commitment to projectobjectives.and resulted       in
changes of key executives in CONAM as well.       This was evidenced bythe Government's insistenceon
setting an unrealistically high base price for thetelecommunications enterprises,and its oppositionto
applying cost-covering telecommunications      and electricity tariffs. These changesinduced serious    delays in
policy implementation.

5.3 Factorsgenerallysubjectto implementingagencycontrol:
The changes of Government had a cascading effect on       CONAM. The institutionsustained frequent
management changes and corresponding changes        in the priority given to PERTALby these and      other
government authorities. Delays in project   implementation was the inevitableresult.

5.4 Costsandfinancing:
The Project was completed at a cost of US$13.6 million,      15 percent below the appraisal estimate of    US$
16.0 million. The Bank financed US$11.3 million      and the Government financedthe balance. The        decrease
in projectcost was mainly due to lower than estimated     costs of consultantsemployedfor the electricity
sector component (who were selected usingcompetitive        quality and cost bidding.) Also, training costs  were
lower than estimated at appraisal.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationaleforsustainabilityrating:
The project results would be sustainable provided    that the improvements inthe sectoral framework      and
policies are maintained and take further hold   once privatization in the electricity and telecommunications
sectors proceeds. In order to generate sufficient  investor interest and promoteprivatization in    the electricity
sector, progress depends on: (a) Government support to      CONELEC in enforcing electricity tariffs that



                                                      - 7 -

cover economiccost; and (b) Government and Congress reaching agreementon            mechanismsto allow the
participation of private investors in electricity to beincreased for all enterprises beyond 49 percent as
allowed by legislation in force duringthe project implementationperiod.       The privatizationof the
telecommunications enterprises hingeson (a) enactment      of a revised law,(b) market liberalization; and (c)
removal of exclusivity an of cross-subsidizationof    local by internationalcalls.

Despite political turbulence, the EconomicTransformation       Law was enacted in March 2000 that allows for
maximum private participation of 51percent intelecommunications          and electricity enterprises (except for
HidroPaute where private shareholding remains limited to     49 percent). The Government will soon seek
Congressional approval for a follo\\-on law aimed among      others at removing remaining obstacles to
privatizing the telecommunicationisenterprises. A     program to increaseelectricity tariffs by end-2001 to
their economic cost levels is being prepared. An investment    bank finanicedby IDB isassisting the
Government in preparing the state-owned electriccorporations       for privatization. Once these conditions are
met, the Bank plans to finance through a follow-on    loan to PERTAL the investmenitbank that will assist in
preparing ANDINATEL and PACIFICTEL for privatization.              Sincethe progress made in restructuring
both sectors appears to be irreversibleand momentum       to privatize the sector enterprises over the medium
term is building up. project sustainabilitv is rated aslikelv.

6.2 Transition arrcngement to regZlar opperit)ions.
The Bank and the Govermnent have identified post-project       activities required to sustain PERTAL's
objectives and prepare a follow-up lendingoperation.      For this purpose,the Bank has extended the Project
Preparation Facility PPF-360-EC (US$2.0 million): (a) contract an       investment bankto assist the
Government in privatizing ANDINATEL and PACIFICTEL:                (b) hire consultanitsto study major issues of
the electricity market, review and prepare the environmental    regulationls,review the regulation of open
access to the transmission system. and prepare anti-trust   regulations; and (c) carry out a public
consultation and information campaign.

CONELEC will pursue its efforts to increase electricity    tariffs durinig2000-01.and the Government will
seek political consensus on the need to enact legislation aimed    at increasingprivate participation in the
electricityand telecommunications (and hydrocarbons)      sectors. A program for adjusting
telecommunications tariffs is beingprepared. These     actions are expected to stimulate interestby private
investors in the electricity and telecommunicationsectors   and assist the Government in privatizing these
sectors.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Project was based on a comprehensiveanalysis       of the reform requirementsin the electricity and
telecommunications sectors, in order to improvetheir    efficiency and service quality. The Project was
designed to complement the StructuralAdjustment Loan        3819-EC with measuresthat were more
appropriate for a technical assistance operation. The   Project was consistent with the 1994CAS for
Ecuador. In addition, for electricity, the Bank assisted  the Government in preparing the reform program by
making funds from the preceding Power Engineering Loan         2713-ECavailable. The policy, institutional,
operational, and financial (mainly tariffs) issues prevailing in the two sectorswere competently appraised.
However, by underestimating political risks,the    Bank was unduly optimistic in estimating the project
implementation period. Nevertheless, project preparation     and appraisal by the Bank can be rated as
satisfactorv.




                                                      -8 -

7.2 Supervision:
During the initial project phase, Bank supervisionwas   not as intensive as it shouldhave been. Once
LAC-intemal reorganizations resulting in a realignmentof    management units and reassignment of task
managers had taken hold, supervision improved as task managership        stabilized and sector specialists
participated more actively in project management. Being aware     of possible political interference in project
implementation,Bank staff undertook thoroughmonitoring of       no-objection requests and of studies and
documents preparedby CONAM. However,the delays           in implementation caused by governmentchanges,
and at times lackof Congressional support, made it necessary    to extend the loan closing date twice by total
of 17months. The Bank responded to the Government's extension         requests expeditiously'. Supervision is
rated as satisfactory.

7.3 O0verallBankper/ormance:
On balance. Bank performance was satisfactory.

Borrower
7. Preparation:
The Duran-BallenAdministration (1992-96) set out to end     massive energy subsidieswhile reducing the
operating role of the Government inproductive sectors, with the intention of     relying on privateenterprise to
play a greater role inall sectors of the economy.A key element of    that strategy wasto de-monopolize and
liberalizethe electricity and telecommunicationssectors.   Following considerablepublic debate and
deliberation by Congress, the Modernizationof the State Law     wasenacted in December 1993. This Law
was the first legal instrument supporting the reform agenda.  The Law enables private participation in these
sectors through fixed-term concession mechanismsto the extent     permissible under specific sector laws. The
Law also created the State Modernization Council(CONAM)         to take the leadership in planning and
implementing the divestiture of state enterprises.Reform   legislationwaspreparedand two bills, i.e., on
electricity and telecommunications, were sent to Congress in   1994.Also, the Government with assistance of
the Bank, preparedguidelines for the privatization,divestiture  and granting of concessions, as well as terms
of reference for consultants' services on competitionpolicy, legalaspects,    and valuationof enterprise
assets. The Government's assumptions regarding project implementation were         overly optimistic, however,
underestimating the risk that lack of future public, governmental  and Congressional support might delay the
Project. Nevertheless, project preparation by the Borrower   is considered as satisfactory.

7.5 Governmentimplementationperformance:
The Governmentand Congress initiallysupportedproject implementation by           enactingthe Modernization of
the State Law, but nine months passed between loan approval     and effectivenessdue to delays in complying
with the conditionof enacting the newtelecommunicationslaw.        It is difficultto assess government
performance because project implementationduring 1995-99       extended over fouradministrations. It has to
be recognized that the efforts displayed led to key achievements,  i.e. (i) the preparationand enactment of
the new electricity and telecommunications laws that restructured   these two sectors and laidthe basis for
private participation;(ii) the amendmentsto those laws to accommodate them        to political realities; (iii) the
segmentation of INECEL and corporatizationof the successor      companies; and (iv) the corporatization of
EMETEL. On the other hand, two attempts to privatize ANDINATEL              and PACIFICTEL failed, largely
because (a) the base price set for the auction of 35 percent of assets was unrealisticallyhigh; (b) tariffs
were non-remunerative;and (c) the privateinvestors    were uncomfortable with theunstable economic and
political situation and regulatory uncertaintyof the country.Government performancethus is assessed as
unsatisfactory.

 7.6 Implementing Agency:
 In the early stages of project implementation,CONAM through         itsProject Unit was proactive and played a
 strongrole indisseminating the project reform objectives and strategiesamong         decision makers,
 stakeholders, and the public at large (Congress, public enterprises,political     parties, professional
organizations). However, by mid-way of project implementation.the          Unit became more passive and
 somewhat isolated from other institutionsthat participated in decision      making on reforms and privatization
 of the sectors. This was caused in part by changes in the managemenitof       CONAM as Nwellas in receptivity
 on the Government's part. Nevertheless. CONAM was instrumenitalin            preparing high-quality documents
 for the proposed sector legislationsand regulations.    and in strengtheningthe institutional framework of     the
 electricity sector toward the end of the Project.  Since project implementationslipped beyond        the original
 projectcompletion date, the loan closing date had to be extended th ice by      a total of 17 monithsto December
 31. 1999. Overall, the Project Unit's performance was satisfactory.

 8. Lessons Learned

 For the Government:
3     Consistency'of project objectiveswith development needs. realismof       these objectives. and strong and
      continuous Government support during project preparation and implementation are          paramount in
      determining the success of technical assistance in sector reforms. Moreover, as       indicated by the
      experience in telecommunications,the success of specific reform and      privatization programs hinges on
      an appropriate legal/regulatory/institutional framework for the sectors    to be reformed.
*     In a changing political environment- especially ina situation of    economic and political turmoil and
      absence of political protection for refonns -, the objective of technical  assistance was appropriately
      limited to facilitating the reform of sector structures and the strengtheningof    the new structuresneeded
      to enhance private participation. The envisioned sector privatizationrequires      a permanent commitment
      by the Government to reform that extends beyond the scope and duration        of the project supportingthe
      technical assistance.
3     In a situation of profound shifts inthe economic and    political basis of a reform project, continuity in
      project approach and in project management are of particular      importancefor the robustnessof the
      project.
*     The project implementation unit plays a key role in the success of    the Project. Therefore, the Unit's
      professionalstaff should be endowed with the necessary experienceand competence           in maintainingthe
      dialogue with the executive and operational staff of other key entities  involved in the reform process.
     This is especially important in countries where there is a tradition   of basing decisions on consensus
      among the agents fostering the reforms and those agents affected     by the reforms.

 For the Government and the World Bank:
*     Sincethe determinants of the country's macroeconomic and sector position        and prospects cannot be
      entirely controlled, the risks associated with technical assistance aimed   at sector reform need to be
      carefully assessed by the Bank and the Government at the outset, especially       in regard to the viabilityof
      a speedytransition from government-controlledto a market-determinedsystem.             Options for such a
      transition should be analyzed, includinga set of measures to    openthe sector incrementallyto private
      investors.
*     Well-articulated public information and communications campaigns are         key to successful sector




                                                       - 10-

     reforms. These campaigns need to bedirected at decision makers as well as stakeholders such      as
     management and employees of state enterprises. Continued consultations need to be maintained with
     sector entities, groups directly affected by actions to be supportedby technical assistance,professional
     groups, and other shareholders so as to gain their support in the reform process.

For the World Bank:
*    The Project has demonstrated thattechniicalassistance loans for sectoral reforms shoulld(i)  include all
     major components of the sector, (ii) give supervision appropriate priority, and (iii)when major
     obstaclesare encountered, devote resourcesto understandingthe source of the problem and,      on that
     basis, condLucta dialogue on the issues, ratherthan mainly focusing on procurement    and disbursement
     conditions,closing date extensions, and other legaland administrativeaspects of project
     implemlientation.
*    Combiningtechlical assistance withiadjustmiienit   lendingprovides an effectiveway of ensuring thatthe
     Government hiasthe funldsvwith wvhiclh  to carry out tlle necessary preparationsfor reforms.

              De mis consideraciones:


              En atenci6n con su fax de fecha 5 de abril, debo               manifestarle que, se solicit6
              comentarios sobre el borrador del informe               de cierre del Proyecto PERTAL
              (ICR), a la SUPTEL. CONATEL, y CONELEC,                            habiendose recibido las
              comunicaciones del CONELEC sobre                  el sector el6ctrico, y de la SUPTEL
              sobre el sector de telecomunicaciones, copia de             las cuales se servira encontrar
              adjunto al presente.

               Por parte del CONAM y de la Unidad de Empresas                 PCiblicas,a continuaci6n me
              permito poner a consideraci6n los comentarios             al borradordel ICR:
                       1. En el numeral 4.1 uCumplimiento de               Objetivos", a) pArrafo que se
                          refiere a 'Desarrollo        Institucional", la fecha de constitucion              del
                          CONELEC es en noviembre 1997                  y no octubre 1997 y b) parrafo
                          que se refiere a "Desarrollo del Sector Privado',              la consideraci6n de
                          los logros calificada como modesta no es exacta                 debido a que en el
                          sector el6ctrico no se complet6 el proceso           por falta de tiempo y por la
                          busqueda de otro financiamiento para su              culminacion, de tal manera
                          que se deberia calificar los logros como                      inconclusos u otro
                          calificativo,      tomando       en    cuenta       que      en    el     sector    de
                          telecomunicaciones no se concreto la privatizaci6n.
                       2. En el numeral 5.1 'Factores fuera             de control gubernamental o de
                           agencias       implementadoras", se deberia                mencionar el brusco
                           deterioro de la economia debido a la fuga              de capitales y la quiebra
                           bancaria con la consecuente inestabilidad cambiaria.

                    3. En el numeral 5.4 de "Costos y financiamiento",             el costo real de
                         Proyecto      fue de US$13.6 millones, que representa un 15% menos
                         de lo presupuestado. Lo que el Banco financi6 fue US$11.3 millones.
                    4. En el numeral 7.6 "Agencia Implementadora",             se da a entender que
                         la actividad del CONAM se concentr6 en los primeros anos. Se debe
                         recordar que una buena parte de los logros del sector electrico           se
                         Ilevaron a cabo en los ultimos dos ahos del Proyecto.
                    5. En el numeral 8. "Lecciones aprendidas" Por el Gobierno, en             lo que
                          se refiere con Telecomunicaciones se recomienda fortificar el marco
                          regulatorio     y a las entidades de control y regulaci6n,        antes de
                          p,ivatizar las empresas.
                    6. En el Anexo 1 "Indicadores claves de cumplimiento',             en la parte 2.
                          1Modernizaci6n       de INECEL" ia reestructuraci6n    es de las: empresas
                          de generaci6n y transmision y la fecha actual es de enero/99.

                    7. En el Anexo            2. "Costos y financiamiento     del Proyecto",  existen
                          algunas inexactitudes en el primer cuadro y otras discrepancias          en
                          los cuadros       siguientes, por tal motivo pongo a consideraci6n       los

                Presente


                De mi consideraci6n:


                En atenci6n a su oficio No. ULAI:-256-2-000,inediante               el cjal remite una c.Qpiadel
                Infornie de Cicrre del Pioyecto PERTAL, luego              de realizar el analisis del nlisno, me
                permnito presentar las siguientes observaciones:

                En cl numeral 4.1 en cl subtitulo "Desarrollo             lnstituciona"'   se debe sustituir en la
                siguieilte    oraci6n:     "Existo todavia    alguna       duplicacifn    de funciones    entre et
                CONATEL y la SUPTEL", la palabra "SUPTEL"                     por "COINARTEL", puesto qut Ia
                legislacion es clara cei cuanto a la definicion de fu:nciones           entre los dos organismos
                ptimeramentc      citados, mientras quo dicha duplicaci6n de            finciones  se da entre el
                CONATEL y el CONARTEL.

                En cuanto a lo relacion ado con las actividades           clesan-olladas coino producto de esle
                Proyecto, sc observa que han sido numerosas,              desgraciadamente no se han obtenido
                los resultados deseados,              puesto que no se ba efectivizado el fortalecimiento
                institucional do las entidadcs encargadas de la politica             y la regulaci6n, autique se
                procedio a la creaci6n de unidades en el CONAM                     y la creaci6n del Fondo de
                Solidaridad. Tampoco se cuimpliocl objetivo de la optimizaci6nde               la adininistraci6ny
                el oontrol del espectro radiocl6ctrico.

                En cuanto se refiere a la asistencia tecnica para          la preparaci6n de la privatizaci6f de
                ENETEL, como es bicn conoecido,ge realiz6 lu escisi6n de                 las empresas, pero no
                hubo 6xitoen la venta de las acciones. Cabe mcncionarquicexistieron                varios factores
                ex6gcnos al proyocto que ablonaronen la no concrcci6nde                Insubasta.

                En lo relaconado con la asistencia t6cnice y            ejecuci6n de la posible privatizaci6ftde
                las telecomunicaciones provistas por municipalidades(caso              1 TAPA), se desconoce el
                resultado obtenido en est.epunto.
