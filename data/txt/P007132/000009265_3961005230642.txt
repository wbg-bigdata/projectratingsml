MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK
FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN (PERTAL)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR
1.    I submit the folloVing memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Ecuador for the equivalent of US$12.0 million to help finance a Public
Enterprise Reform Technical Assistance Loan (PERTAL). The loan would be on
standard IBRD terms repayable over 20 years, including 5 years grace, at the Bank's
standard  anriable interest rate.  This technical assistance loan wili support the
Government's modernization program in the key economic sectors of electricity and
telecommunications.
2.    Background. Ecuador experienced an explosion in the role and importance of
public enterprises (PEs) since the early 1970's, when oil exports began and the oil price
rose significantly. There are now about 167 publicly-owned enterprises distributed
throughout all sectors of the economy. Two of these enterprises--the Telecommunications
Enterprise (EMETEL) and the Electricity Institute (INECEL)--account for a major share
of total public expenditures. Yet, these state enterprises cannot keep or do not generate
sufficient revenues to meet their critical investment needs. Large modernization and
expansion investments are needed in electricity and telecommunications to accelerate the
development of private sector activities.
3.    Cash generated from state enterprises' operations in Ecuador has been limited by
government interference, similar to that experienced by many state enterprises in other
countries. Problems that have particularly affected the profitability of Ecuadoran PEs
are tight government controls over tariffs; overstaffing; inefficient investment programs;
political interference in operational decisions, budgets and personnel policies; corruption;
and cumbersome procurement, financial, and administrative laws and procedures.
4.    In addition to its overextended role and dubious performance as an entrepreneur,
until recently, the way in which Government legislated prices provided a strong
disincentive to recover the full cost or long run marginal cost of public utilities. The
implicit subsidy in electricity which was estimated to reach 1.4 percent of GDP in 1990,
was significantly reduced in 1992 and 1993 when the Durin-Balldn Administration
authorized a series of tariff increase in electricity. Telephone subsidies were also
essentially eliminated with the tariff increase of 1993, although a massive cross-subsidy
from international to local services continues.



- 2 -
5.    Government Strategy. The Administration of the President Sixto Durnn-Balldn,
which took office in August 1992, has undertaken to end the massive energy subsidies
in a sustainable manner while reducing the scope of the Government in productive
sectors. It stated its intention to rely on the private sector to play a greater role in all
sectors of the economy. Consequently, a key element of the government strategy has
been to demonopolize and deregulate the electricity and telecommunications sectors, two
public service sectors whose efficiency is critical to the sound development of the country
but also important to promote private sector participation in the economy.
6.    However, one of the first legal instruments supporting this reform agenda, the
Moderni7ation of the State Law, generated considerable debate both in the public and in
Congress. The political struggle over the Bill, which was passed in December 1993,
pointed to the delicate and sensitive nature of the reforms. The Law enables private
sector participation in the electricity and telecommunications sectors through fixed-term
concession mechanisms, but only to the extent permissible under other specific sectoral
laws. Concessions could be accompanied by the sale of shares or assets of state
enterprises if specific sectoral legislation is approved by Congress. Such legislation was
sent to Congress in June of 1994 in the case of electricity and in September of 1994 in
the case of telecommunications. Both bills are pending Congress' approval.
7.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. Since the early eighties, the Bank has been
involved in various programs designed to reduce energy subsidies and rationalize and
modernize the electricity and telecommunications sectors, through a dialogue based on
country reports as well as loans to INECEL and EMETEL. While such loans have
contributed to improve equipment and financial systems, their contribution to efficiency
improvement has been hindered by political interference in the enterprises' operations.
Because of the Bank's experience with these sectors in and outside Ecuador, the
Government requested the Bank to assist in the demonopolization and possible
privauzation of the electricity and telecommunications sectors. The proposed project is
thus fully consistent with the Bank's current strategy of assistance to Ecuador as stated
in the Country Strategy Paper for Ecuador, dated June 17, 1993 (ref. private sector-led
growth, page 13).
8.    Project Objectives. The major objectives of the project are to support the
Government's current efforts to: (i) reduce electricity subsidies in a sustainable v y; (ii)
reform the legal and regulatory framework of the electricity and telecommunications
sectors so as to ensure a complete separation of state policy and regula..sy functions
from commercial activities; (iii) establish and/or strengthen the institutions in charge of
the policy and regulatory functions which remain with Government; and (iv) modify the
legal status of the two state enterprises INECEL and EMETEL to prepare them for
commercially oriented activity through concessions possibly combined with sale of assets
or shares.



- 3 -
9.    ProJect Description. To meet these objectives, the project would provide the
Government with technical assistance in the form of consulting services and training to
prepare the necessary legal, regulatory, institutional and sectoral reforms in the electricity
and telecommunications sectors; define reform implementation; and prepare the
privatization of specific activities whenever feasible. In particular, technical assistance
would aim at:
(a)   revising legislation which has heretofore prohibited demonopolization;
(b)   separating the government policy functions from its role as provider of
public services;
(c)   creating and/or strengthening the capacity of the overall reform
implementation agency (CONAM) and the sectoral regulatory institutions
to articulate and implement government sectoral strategies, policies and
regulations, and thereby promote efficient economic development and
environmental protection;
(d)   adapting the electricity and telecommunications PEs to their new
legislative and regulatory environment; and
(e)   preparing PEs for part or total divestiture, particularly in the case of the
telecommunications enterprise EMETEL.
10.   Specific descriptions of the technical assistance components for CONAM and the
electricity and telecommunications sectors are detailed respectively in each of the three
Annexes. The estimated cost of the components are also detailed in the Annexes and
summarized in Schedule A. In brief, the proposed project will assist the Govemment in
the following activities:
(a)   Institutional Capacity for Implementation. (i) Strengthening the Consejo
Nacional de Modernizaci6n del Estado's (CONAM's) capacity for
supervising the preparation and implementation of the regulatory and
sector reform program -- as well as the proper utilization of proceeds
derived from privatizations -- in close coordination with the Ministry of
Energy and Mines (MEM), the Planification Secretariat (CONADE) and
other agencies (US$0.45 million); (ii) providing for CONAM's
incremental operating costs due to the administration of the proposed
project (US$0.15 million); and (iii) developing marketing campaigns to
promote the need for reforms, encourage private investment in PEs and
expose key officials to similar privatization processes in other countries
(US$0.1 million).



- 4 -
(b)    egulatory and Sector Reforms.
Electricity: vi) Preparing the legislative and regulatory framework to
permit the demonopolization of generation and distribution activities
(US$1.2 million); (ii) restructure INECEL in business units, separating
generation, transmission, and dispatch center activities, merging existing
distribution companies in an adequate number of companies and, to the
extent feasible, privatizing them (US$4.0 million); and (iii) training
officials involved in the Government's new policy and regulatory activities
(US$0.3 million).
Telecommunications: (i) Revising the legislative and regulatory framework
approved by the previous Administration in early August 1992 and
providing assistance to the Superintendency of telecommunications
(US$1.78 million) in particular to adequately monitor frequencies; (ii)
preparing EMETEL foi privatization, which will include separating
EMETEL (before sale) into two domestic telecommunications companies
and reviewing various levels of exclusivity depending on the type of
services involved (US$1.98 million); and (iii) other assistance, which may
include preparing ETAPA for privatization ($0.6 million).
11.  Project Implementation and Financing.  The Borrower would be the
Government of Ecuador, with CONAM as the project's executing agency. In the
privatization of EMETEL, CONAM will coordinate with a modernization committee for
telecommunications which the Government intends to establish to supervise all activities
related to the international bidding for the shares of EMETEL Norte S.A. and EMETEL
Sur S.A. In addition to the strategic planning unit, two sectoral project units headed by
a common coordinator reporting to the President of CONAM, will be in charge of
preparing the reform of the sector. This will be done in close coordination with the
MEM, CONADE and other relevant agencies. The coordinator will be supported by a
group of specialists, respectively technicians, lawyers and administrators. Such specialists
could be individual consultants and/or consulting firms, depending on the Government's
decision. The diagram of the institutional framework for reform preparation is shown in
Schedule B (page 14).
12.   Procurement. Procurement would be limited to the employment of consultants
and to the purchase of microcomputer systems for the Superintendencia de Telecomunica-
ciones. Procurement would follow Bank guidelines with short-list selection procedures
of firms for large consulting and training assignments. For small consulting assignments,
the same provisions concerning prior IBRD review or approval of budgets as already
adopted under the PERTAL's PPFs would continue to apply specifically, prior IBRD
review or approval of budgets, short list, selection procedures, letter of invitation,
proposals, evaluation reports and contracts would not be required for contracts for the
employment of consulting fiLls estimated to cost less than $75,000 equivalent each; or



- 5 -
contracts for the employment of individual consultants estimated to cost less than $30,000
equivalent each. However, prior IBRD review would continue being required for the
terms of reference for such contracts; single source selection of consulting firms;
assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably determined by IBRD; amendments of
contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to $75,000
equivalent or above; and amendments to cont.acts for the employment of individual
consultants raising the contract value to $30,000 equivalent or above.
13.   Procurement arrangements for microcomputer systems will follow ICB, using
Bank issued standard bidding documents and requiring Bank prior review of all relevant
documentation. This tender will involve the provision of a modem Radio Spectrum Data
Base Management System, including systems adaptation, hardware, software and training
of the staff of the Superintendencia to use it. The aforementioned arrangements would
provide prior review coverage of 100% of Bank financed contracts for goods. It is
expected that the prior review coverage of Bank financed contracts for services will be
about 80%. All procurement arrangements to be applied under the project are
summarized in Schedule B. Recently enacted procurement legislation resolves past
disagreements regarding the precedence of Bank procurement guidelines over local
legislation. The Loan Agreement will contain explicit provisions reflecting specific
principles that will expressly govern all procurement of consultants' services and all ICB
procurement financed out of the proceeds of the loan. They are specified in Schedule
B (pages 12-13).
14.   Disbursement, Accounts and Audits. The proceeds of tne loan, available after
refunding of the advances under PPF 199-0-EC and PPF 199-1-EC, would be disbursed
over a three and one half year period (six months more than implementation) against 100
percent of expenditures for international and local consultancy costs net of taxes. The
project's total cost estimates include price contingencies of about 12 percent. A special
account would be established in the Central Bank of Ecuador or in a commercial bank,
with an authorized allocation of up to US$1 million, to be managed by CONAM.
Eligible expenditures incurred before the signing of the loan may be retroactively
financed up to a maximum equivalent of US$1.0 million, but would not include
expenditures incurred more than 12 months prior to signature of the Loan Agreement.
Proceeds from the loan would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs)
for expenditures for: (i) consultant and training services under $75,000 equivalent per
contract (in the case of consulting or training firms); (ii) consultant and training services
under $30,000 equivalent per contract (in the case of individual consultants or trainers);
(iii) promotional costs; and (iv) CONAM's incremental operating costs. The project
closing date would be July 1998.
15.   CONAM's administrative unit -- the same as for the Modernization of the State
Technical Assistance loan -- would maintain detailed project accounts, utilizing an
accounting plan acceptable to the Bank, and would process all payments and
disbursement requests. As indicated in para. 10 (a), only incremental operating costs due



- 6 -
to the administration of the proposed project would be financed from the loan proceeds.
Supporting documentation will be maintained by CONAM's administrative unit and made
avah4ble to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. Project Accounts, the
Special Account, and the use of SOEs would be audited annually in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles. The terms of reference for auditors and reports would
be approved by the Bank. Audit reports would be submitted to the Bank no later than
six months after the close of the Government's fiscal year.
16.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. Previous Bank experience has
demonstrated that the key characteristics of a successful process of deregulation and
demonopolization in the electricity and telecommunications sectors include top level
commitment, early preparation and implementation of an adequate legal and regulatory
framework, and clearly defined strategies to ensure the timely and transparent
implementation of the reform process.
17.   Project Sustainability. In close cooperation with CONAM, the MEM, INECEL
and EMETEL, the project has assisted in the definition and implementation of the
electricity and telecommunications reform programs. Also, steps under the proposed
technical assistance aim at the early implementation of regulatory changes so that
enterprise and institution-specific reform programs can be timely implemented in a
transparent manner and in an appropriately competitive (or regulated) environment. Tr
permit such steps however, two key sectoral Bills --whose basis was laid under PPF 199-
-EC and loan 2713-EC-- remain to be approved by Congress. Restructuring and
privatization of public enterprises is a sensitive issue for which bipartisan political
support in Fcuador is needed. The expected pa&sage of the Telecommunications and
Electricity Bills, the request for specific staffing for reform implementation, and the now
reduced scope of the proposed technical assistance should help ensure that a well thought
out and sustainable restructuring and privatization plan is put in place.
18.   Project Fincing. The total project costs is estimated at US$16.0 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$12.0 million. The proposed loan
would finance about 75 % of project costs. At this stage, it is envisaged that the project's
foreign exchange financing needs would be distributed as follows. About US$0.7 million
would be needed to finance the strengthening of the institutional framework for project
implementation; US$5.5 million to finance the remaining preparation of the electricity
reform program--following the initial preparation steps taken under loan 2713-EC and
US$4.36 million to finance the preparation of the telecommunications reform program.
US$ 1.44 remain unallocated to provide flexibility in the financing of reform
implementation. The breakdown of financing after the refundings of the PPFs is
provided in Schedule B.
19.   Agreed Actions.  It has been agreed with the Government that a new
telecommunications law would be required to support telecommunications sector reform.
Conditions were therefore agreed so as to eliminate the possibility of declaring the loan



- 7 -
effective, or of disbursing proceeds of the loan in support of telecommunications sector
reform, in the absence of changes in Ecuador's telecommunications sector legislation.
Also, an effecti.eness condition was agreed to require the National Modernization
Council -- the project's main executing agency -- to have opened the requisite checldng
account for receipt of its counterpart budgetary allocations in a manner consistent with
the Public Sector Budget Law. Finally, it has been agreed to establish project
disbursement conditions in order to permit the disbursement of one sectoral assistance
component, i.e., telecommunications or electricity, independently of the other, in case
the approval of one sectoral law remains pending after the loan Js effective. These
actions were agreed upon to limit the probability of iiiplementation failure.
20.   Program Objective Categories. The proposed project supports the Bank's
current strategy of assistance to the promotion of private sector activities in Ecuador.
21.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project is expected to have a very limited
environment impact due to the policy focus of the proposed technical assistance. As a
result, the Bank's environmental classification of the project is C.
22.   Participatory Approach. Because of the nature of the proposed operation, the
ultimate beneficiaines are the consumers of telecommunications and electricity services.
in the absence of a consumer organization, there has been no diect involvement of such
beneficiaries in project preparation. However, in view of the anticipated significant
impact of the reforms on public services in Ecuador, the Government's privatization
program has been discussed and continues to be discussed in Congress and in public fora
in Ecuador. CONAM, the direct recipient of the project's support, has been active in
promoting public information and assistance will be provided under the project to
erdiance such information, and to increase transparency of the privatization program.
The concerned public enterprises have been involved directly in project preparation and
will continue to be involved in project implementation.
23.   Project Benefits. The project will assist in the key measures to make Ecuador's
recent stabilization program a sustainable one through the phasing out of utilities
subsidies. Also, efficiency in the electricity and telecommunications sectors will be
gained through sustained market-adjusted tariff levels, reduction of political interference,
increased competition and private sector participation.
24.   Risks. Reforming strategic sectors is sensitive politically. It is also complex and
requires time and commitment. The Congress elected in August 1994 may not be willing
to commit to reform sufficiently to ensure implementation of key PE reforms before
Presidential elections in mid 1996. Therefore, CONAM and the Congress must
coordinate efforts to ensure that reform decisions are taken in a timely, rational, and a
transparent manner while political support is adequately built. Any indecision or delay
in establishing a credible and action-oriented structure to prepare and implement reform
will place the whole process supported by this project in jeopardy. While the project has



- 8 -
been designed to assist the Government, it cannot substitute for the lack of direct and
active Presidential and Congressional support.   Therefore, to ensure project
sustainability, the loan effectiveness conditionality comprisas (i) the passage of at least
one of the two key sectoral laws that are required to embark on the restructuring and
privatization of the electricity and/or telecommunications sectors, supported by a legal
opinion by the Legal Director General of the Presidency of the Republic as to such law's
constitutionality; and (ii) the opening by CONAM of an account in a private sector
Ecuadorian Bank to receive the counterpart funds (from the Government's own resources)
corresponding to CONAM's annual operating budget.
25.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.

PROCUREMENT
A. The following principles of procurement shall expressly govern all procurement
of consultants' services to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan.
1. Foreign consultants must not be required to be locally registered as a condition of
participation in the selection process, but may be required to be so registered, at the time
of contracting, if the Borrower and the Bank so agree.
2. Foreign consultants must not be required, either directly or indirectly, to give any
participation in or share of any consulting contracts to any local firm or person, except
in connection with a joint venture arrangement where: (i) a sufficient number of capable
domestic firms or individual consultants exist to allow a foreign consultant reasonable
freedom of choice; (ii) the contribution of either party to the joint venture arrangement
will not be constrained by any prescribed manner or extent of participation; and (iii) the
foreign consultant is not required to associate itself with any specific named domestic
firms or individual consultants.
3. Foreign consulting firms shall not be required, as a condition to provide services in
Ecuador under contracts to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, to be registered
in Ecuador with a minimum capital different from that required for Ecuadorian firms.
4. Foreign consultants, either individuals or firms, providing services under contracts
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, shall not be required to pay fees to the
Ecuadorean Consultants' Association that are different from those required for
Ecuadorean consultants.
5. Any approval of consultants' contracts or of consultant selection processes, required
under the laws of the Borrower, shall be limited to approval by CONAM.
B. The following principles of procurement shal expressly govern all procurement
of goods (microcomputer systems) to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan.
6. Bids must be submitted in one single envelope, and the name of each bidder and the
total amount of each bid, as well as any alternative proposals, if they have been
requested or permitted, shall be read aloud when opened.
7. Foreign bidders must not be required to have a local representative for purposes of
submitting bids, but may be required to have such a representative upon entering into
contracts which they have been awarded.

SCHEDULE B
8. Foreign bidders must be permitted to have their financial solvency certified by a
foreign bank acceptable to the Borrower without recertification by any Ecuadorian bank
or other Ecuadorian person or entity.
9. Bid and performance bonds and guarantees issued by foreign sureties approved by
the Borrower must be admissible without recertification or other participation by any
Ecuadorian bank or other Ecuadorian person or entity.
10.   Letters of credit issued to any supplier of goods or provider of services must not
be required to be counter-guaranteed by such supplier or provider in whole or in part.
This shall not prevent purchasers from obtaining other performance warranties from
suppliers.
