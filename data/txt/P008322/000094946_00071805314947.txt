3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Background
In 1993, the post and telecommunications sector in Bulgaria was comprised of three principal public
organizations - the Committee for Posts and Telecommunications (CPT), the Bulgarian Post Company



(BPC) and the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC). CPT was responsible for developing and
implementing posts and telecommunications policy and held delegated responsibility for the shareholder
functions of BPC and BTC. BTC's services included domestic and international telephony, fixed telephone
network and leased lines, telex, telegraphy, radio and television transmission and data transmission.
With a population of 9.0 million and 2.6 million telephones, Bulgaria had the highest telephone density in
Eastern Europe with nearly 29 telephones per 100 population in 1990. However, there were 612,000
applications on the waiting list with an average waiting time of 10 years. Business, industry and
government administrations were underserved, with only 36% of the lines. Service quality was poor, with
call completion rate at less than 35% compared to world standard of 60-70%, and as low as 9% for
international calls. Automatic direct dialing was limited in most areas due to obsolete equipment and
inadequate network capacity, and international calls were handled by operators due to the scarcity of
international circuits. Advanced services including facsimile and packet switched data communications
were limited due to poor circuit quality and reliability. The telecommunications network infrastructure
consisted largely of obsolete, vacuum tube transmission network equipment and step-by-step switching
equipment which required replacement, involving an investment of US$ 340 million over the medium term.
At the same time, BTC's financial condition was poor with operating losses and added burden of bearing
postal subsidies.
To address these deficiencies and modernize the telecommunications sector, CPT, assisted by technical,
policy and financial assistance from the Bank and by consultants funded by EC-PHARE, developed a
strategy which was adopted by the Government of Bulgaria (GOB) in 1992. The strategy aimed at: (a)
improving the quality of service overall, especially to business customers, and expand access with a
modem digital infrastructure; (b) improving BTC's financial performance by adopting tariff policies to
support the financing of infrastmucture modernization and expansion, and by separating telecommunications
and postal operations, and eliminating postal subsidies; (c) developing BTC by corporatizing it, introducing
modem management practices and assisting it to attract investment; and (d) introducing new services and
encouraging private sector involvement in the sector. The strategy also identified the need to separate and
strengthen policy making and regulatory function, and establish a legal framework for expanding private
sector involvement. The strategy envisioned a multi-phase effort to modernize Bulgaria's
telecommunications sector, of which the Telecommunications Project is the first element.
Telecommunications Proiect: To implement the strategy, the Bulgarian authorities arranged for support and
fmancial assistance from EIB, EBRD and the Bank. EIB and EBRD focussed on financing BTC's
infrastructure modernization under the Project. The Bank, in addition to providing support to BTC's
infrastructure modemization and corporate development, provided technical assistance to CPT to
strengthen policy-making and regulatory functions financed from the Technical Assistance Loan (TAL, Ln.
3384-BU). The Project focussed on actions required over the medium-term to build a foundation for
sustained longer term sector development.
The Project was implemented during a period of political uncertainty resulting from six govermments in five
years and severe economic crisis and collapse of the banking system at the peak of implementation.
Tlhrough concerted efforts of the Donors, BTC emerged in 1998/99 as a strong and very profitable
company with modem technologies in its network, and attracted bids from European utilities for a 51%
stake during 1999. BTC's quality of service over its digital network exceeds that of its peers in Central and
Eastem Europe and compares fairly well with Westem European utilities. The waiting list was reduced by
over one third and the waiting time fell to about one month in most cities and large towns with digital
exchanges. All advanced telecommunications services are available in Bulgaria, with premium services to
business customers. Bulgaria enacted a Telecommunications Law  which met EU  harmonization
- 2 -



requirements and WTO commitments, and the institutional structure for policy making and regulation were
separated to enhance investor confidence. BTC's further development as well as expansion of the benefits
of digitalization to a larger segment of the population are well assured.
Objectives
The objective of the Project was to support the rapid development of the telecornmunications sector along
the lines of the strategy adopted by GOB, which calls for policy and institutional reforms and for
implementing a medium-term investment program that reflects economic priorities.
In the course of the Project, GOB decided to go beyond originally envisaged objectives and privatize BTC,
and requested the Bank's help and assistance. The Bank agreed to finance advisory services for sector
policy, legal and privatization under the TAL (Ln.3384-BU). At the time of this report, the bidding for
acquiring 51% of the shares in BTC, selection of strategic investors and negotiations had been completed
and financial closing was pending approval of the European Commission.
The objectives of the Project were clear, important for sector development, and specifically responded to
the needs of the borrower. While the investment and corporate development parts were not risky, the policy
and institutional reform parts were moderately risky, both because of the lack of understanding of these by
policy makers and because the necessary involvement of political authorities introduced additional
uncertainties. Further, the achievement of these policy objectives from a separate loan (TAL) posed
coordination challenges for the Bank.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the Project were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The objectives of the Project were implemented through three major components, which comprised:
(a)   implementation of a Digital Overlay Network (DON) of BTC for the period 1993-1997, including
digitalization, of the trunk routes and expansion of the network,
(b)    design and implementation of a computer-based Operational Support System! Management
Information system (OSS/MIS) for BTC, and
(c)   technical assistance for the Corporate Development of BTC, including establishment of managerial
functions, i.e. accounting, auditing, financial management, planning, etc.
The sub-components of the DON consisted of the major infrastructure elements, including (i) local The
local exchanges added 220,000 digital main subscriber lines (an increase of 8.5%), but the main emphasis was to
improve service to business customers, which utilized 97% of the digital main lines added, transit and
intemational digital switching exchanges; (ii) optical fiber transmission network, satellite earth station
(Atlantic Ocean Region - AOR), and microwave radio transmission network; (iii) optical fiber cables and
digitalization equipment for local networks, and (iv) network management systems and test equipment. The
components were appropriate for achieving the Project objectives. The design was kept simple, taking into
account the unproven capacity of BTC in implementing large Projects with external financing, and the
Bank's lack of experience in the country.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components of the Project were not revised, but the scope was expanded following significant savings
from lower than estimated prices on almost all infrastructure contracts. BTC expanded the access network
- 3 -



(under EBRD and EIB loans) to resort areas and central parts of cities and towns to serve additional
business subscribers by installing additional switching and transmission as well as multiplex systems in the
national transit level and junction networks in Sofia and seven other large cities. BTC also utilized the
savings in the Bank loan for a second satellite earth station to provide capacity for handling increasing
traffic with Asian countries. These components were all consistent with the original Project description and
hence did not require restructuring of the Project. As a result, the Project was able to implement a
substantially greater new capacity at a lower price than initially envisioned.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry was satisfactory. As noted above, the project design was kept simple, consistent with
experience in the region. Ownership of the project by the GOB was considerable: the project was highly
relevant to the borrower's development priorities, and was consistent with the borrower's strategy for
developing the telecommunications sector. It also reinforced the overall goal - embraced by the Bank and
the Government - of supporting expansion of the private sector. Most assumptions utilized in the
development of the project were reasonable, with the exception of those conceming Bulgaria's
macroeconomic performance, which turned out to be overly-optimistic. This caused BTC's financial
performance - while substantially improved and profitable.- to fall short of the profit target expected at the
outset of the project.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Summary Assessment of Outcome
The overall outcome of the Prcject is rated as Highly Satisfactory. As described in the following sections,
shortcomings in improvement of system quality were relatively minor. All envisioned policy and regulatory
reforms were implemented, albeit with significant delays. However, greatly outweighing these shortcomings
were the following factors: the system installed was much more robust and capable than that envisioned;
the cost of the Project was about 12% less than initially estimated; and during implementation, a new and
significant sector development objective was added - privatization of BTC - with the transaction nearly
completed by Project close. Evidence of the extent to which BTC's financial and operating condition
improved is shown by the fact that the company attracted foreign strategic investors.
Quality of Service
The improvement in access and quality of service was satisfactory. Improvement in access included a
reduction in the subscriber waiting list from 612,000 in 1992 to 416,000 in 1998, of which over 93% are
for residential lines. The average waiting time in 1992 for all applications for service was over 10 years. In
1998 this was reduced for applicants in the larger cities covered by the DON to less than 1 month for 62%
of applications and less than 25 weeks for 99% of applications (however, the waiting time for applications
in areas not covered by the DON, including new residential areas in Sofia and Plovdiv not yet provided
with service, is still over 4 years). Long distance and international direct dialing is now accessible by 93%
of subscribers at the end of 1998, compared to 74% in 1992. As for quality of service, the average call
completion rate for all classes of calls improved from 35% in 1992 to 49% in 1998 for local calls, 44% for
long distance calls and 42% for international calls (compared to SAR targets for 1998 of 73%, 60% and
50%). The number of fault reports per 100 lines decreased from over 100 in 1992 to 50 in 1998
(compared to an SAR target for 1998 of 47). The percentage of faults cleared within 48 hours improved
- 4 -



from near zero in 1992 to 82% within 24 hours and 99% within 1 week in 1998 (compared to SAR targets
for 1998 of 87% within 48 hours and 100% within 1 week). This was due both to the DON additions and
to the performance incentives/penalties adopted in June 1998 tariffs. Teledensity (lines per 100 population)
increased from 27 in 1992 to 30 in 1995 and 32.9 (forecast 30 at appraisal) in 1998. Average residential
and business traffic increased by 12% and 56% respectively from 1993 through 1998, which is indicative
of the emphasis by BTC on improving service to business customers. BTC now offers customers connected
to the DON features including conference calls, call forwarding, abbreviated dialing, incoming and
outgoing call barring, alarm call and detailed billing. ISDN services are now available in Sofia and kost
locations with digital exchanges and nation-wide Internet access is available. BTC has also established a
transparent policy of equal network access and tariffs to licensed network operators and value-added
service operators.
BTC Financial Performance
The improvement in BTC's financial performance and viability was satisfactory. BTC's financial
performance improved substantially through the implementation period, as did its profitability, and BTC
was able to finance the local costs of the investment program. Revenues increased from US$105 million
equivalent in 1992 to US$303 million equivalent in 1998 (compared to US$363 million estimated at
appraisal), and net income after taxes, which was US$ -9.4 million in 1992, turned positive beginning in
1993 and reached US$29.4 million in 1997 and US$53.4 million in 1998. BTC's performance is attributed
to tariff adjustment, cessation of payment of postal subsidies, greater than anticipated increases in other
revenues (e.g. interconnection fee resulting from expanding value added services) and reduction in
payments to international telecommunications utilities. The ratio of international outgoing traffic to incoming
was 1.3 in 1992, which gradually reduced to 0.56 by 1998, resulting in a corresponding reduction in settlements
with foreign telecommunications utilities that are to be settled in US Dollars. Revenue per line increased from
US$53 in 1993 to US$108 in 1998, but lower than the SAR estimate of US$158. Revenue as a percent of
GDP increased from 0.87% in 1992 to 2.32% in 1998 (compared to 1.94% forecast at appraisal).
However, BTC's revenues and profits in 1998 fell about 25% short of the appraisal estimates, which is
attributable to the slower economic growth than assumed; for example, GDP was about US$12.9 billion in
1998 compared to forecast US$20 billion.
BTC's Corporate Development
BTC corporate development was satisfactory. BTC's standing as an independent corporation was well
established at the start of the Project by CPT's issuance of an operator license, the standard industry
practice. Also, a Board and management structure in accordance with commercial codes were established.
The organization structure, including Marketing, Strategic Planning, Human Resources, Finance, etc., were
substantially upgraded to reflect the model in advanced countries. The technical assistance stimulated
improvements in BTC, which were evident in the improvement in its reporting quality, timeliness, ability to
deal with private operators in the country and abroad, and the financial turnaround with an unqualified
financial audit by 1998.
New Services & Private Sector Development
Achievements in this area were satisfactory. Following liberalization of all non-basic telecommunications
services by GoB in 1992, the private sector gradually expanded its role and activities. BTC participated in
several of these services through joint ventures and also in regional and international projects. A brief
summary of the significant outcomes are noted below:
- 5 -



Mobile Networks: (a) An analog mobile cellular service (NMT450) was started in 1993 by Cable
& Wireless in joint venture with BTC (RTC/Mobikom, 39% owned by BTC). By mid-1999, it
served about 120,000 subscribers with 95% coverage of the population, (b) In 1994, a digital
GSM mobile cellular service was started (100% private, Mobitel/Citron) which grew faster than
the analog service and had about 147,000 subscribers with 83% coverage of the population by
mid-1999. (c) Paging services were introduced in 1993 and by December 1997, seven companies
(two with national coverage) had 8,000 subscribers each. Growth has continued and Mobikom
(under the trade name MAobipage) had 25,000 subscribers by mid-1999.
Pavphone Networks: Bulfon (34% BTC owned) and Betcom (51% BTC owned) started operations
in early-1996 and together operate 7,472 modem payphones out of a total of 15,700 payphones
throughout Bulgaria as of January 1999.
Data and Cable TV Networks: GOCIS, a joint venture between Global One (60%) and BTC (40
%) provides nationwide data communications with electronic mail and internet access services
through a dedicated network interconnected with BTC. In addition there are many Intemet service
providers (ISPs) with over 150,000 subscribers and cable TV operators with over 240,000
subscribers.
It should be noted that prior to initiation of the Project, investors were exploring opportunities for meeting
the increasing demand from the business sector for advanced services. The Project contributed mainly
through the build-up of the modem digital BTC network, which was essential, and the strengthening of
BTC's operations and financial performance, which reduced the risk to private operators.
Policy and Regulatory Reforms
All sector policy, regulatory and institutional reforms contemplated under the Project were achieved, albeit
with delays. These are: adoption of sector development policy, a telecommunications tariff policy, an
appropriate regulatory framework and separation of policy making from regulation under the
Telecommunications Act, all during 1998. The decision for privatization of BTC provided significant
political momentum for these reforms, in which the Bank played an active role.
CPT adopted an interim tariff policy in 1994 which: (a) indexed intemational service tariffs to the US
Dollar exchange rate and domestic service tariffs to the domestic producer price index (PPI); and (b)
allowed automatic adjustments by BTC, in consultation with CPT, and not more than once per quarter. The
periodic adjustments of tariffs were satisfactory, which enabled implementation of the Project and
gradually reduced cross subsidies between business and residential subscribers and domestic long distance
and international calls through rebalancing, which is still underway (in 1995, under the BSP govemment,
CPT and BTC did not implement the tariff adjustments as per the formulas, but allowed tariff adlustment
in July 1996 (58%) under pressure from Donors). Following passage of the Telecommunications Act of
1998, a tariff policy was also approved by GOB that allows BTC to adjust tariffs in accordance with
economic factors (GDP, inflation, exchange rate, etc.). Also, under the tariff policy, BTC can adjust tariffs
in accordance with the tariff policy formulas without prior approval from the State Telecommunications
Council (STC), the regulatory body for the sector.
The establishment of STC enabled also the separation of policy making from regulations, and the
establishment of the National Radio Frequency Spectrum Council to deal with all aspects related to radio
spectrum policies has enabled CPT to focus on sector development policy making overall. The achievement
of policy and institutional reforms is thus satisfactory.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Project Implementation was carried out exceedingly well and was completed by June 1999, six months
behind the original schedule of December 31, 1998. Implementation of network components was highly
satisfactory, with substantially greater capabilities than initially envisioned. This enabled the more rapid
growth of traffic and revenues, thus enhancing BTC's profit. As shown in the table below, every parameter
of system performance and capacity envisioned in the SAR was exceeded. The Digital Overlay Network (
see BTC Digital Telecommunications Network diagram in Appendix) included the major infrastructure
elements shown in the table and are all in operation. The ring design for the DON and the back-up network
was appropriate for Bulgaria and enhanced the operational and functional performance and the reliability
of the network and services provided. The expansion of the scope, made possible by the lower contract
prices, increased the benefits derived from the Project.

The very competitive prices obtained by BTC through ICB enabled BTC, with the agreement of EBRD,
EIB and the Bank, to procure and install substantially greater quantities of switching equipment for the
trunk and subscriber line capacities, increase the transmission capacity on the fiber optic cable networks
and install an additional satellite earth station for traffic to Asia. The result was that BTC can provide
better quality service and types of services to more business and residential subscribers in the cities covered
by the DON project. The increased quantities effectively advanced the long term BTC network
development program by about 1 year and BTC derived consequently greater revenues from the resulting
growth in subscribers and traffic for an investment lower than forecast. The implementation of the network
components was highly satisfactory.
An Operations Support System/Management Information System (OSS/MIS) was established for BTC,
which included off-the-shelf and customized computer software and standard computer hardware in a
LAN/WAN configuration. The system is in daily use and provides information and office automation
facilities for Management and the Finance, Human Resources and Marketing Departments, as well as
e-mail services on the BTC Intranet. BTC is continuing development of additional functions for inventory
management and purchasing, and data migration from obsolete computers. This system would also enable
- 7 -



BTC to adapt its financial accounts to IAS (International Accounting Standards). The implementation of
OSS/MIS was satisfactory.
The corporate development of BTC and the significant policy, legal, regulatory and related institutional
reforms were achieved through technical assistance under the Project and the TAL. BTC's financial audit
contributed extensively to the understanding and remedy of initial financial deficiencies, which ultimately
led in 1997/98 to an unqualified opinion of auditors (Arthur Andersen) and significantly enhanced BTC's
image with investors. While the tariff policy and regulatory framework study carried out by CPT in
1995/96 was not immediately implemented, the.tariff and financial model (prepared by consultants) helped
CPT officials understand the impact of tariff rebalancing on sector performance. Subsequently, the next
phase of work carried out by the consultants (in 1997 and early-1998) helped implement the sector reforms
under a Telecommunications Act. The implementation of corporate development of BTC and sector
reforms were satisfactory.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economic and financial returns from the Project were satisfactory. The NPV for the Project was
estimated at BGL 16.1 billion al: appraisal with an ERR of 33%. The NPV for the Project re-estimated at
completion is BGL 4.6 billion with an ERR of 26.4%. The actual IERR would have been higher if the
economy had not suffered as it did during the period, and also if the tariff adjustments in 1995 were made
as warranted. Consequently, lower revenues from business customers, the main beneficiaries of the
Project, reduced the IERR, but it is still very satisfactory. A scenario analysis was made with the original
scope of the Project as in SAR, which resulted in an NPV of BGL 2.8 billion and an IERR of 21%.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
The FRR for the completed project was calculated to be 24% compared to 31.6% estimated at Project
appraisal. The FRR was 19% for the scenario with original scope.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The Project's institutional development impact was high. BTC's development as a financially viable and
strong telecommunications operalor with corresponding improvements in its organization, profitability and
operational performance is remarlkable as already discussed. The strongest evidence of BTC's improvement
is its attractiveness to foreign investors. The far-reaching changes achieved in the policy and regulatory
framework are also significant, both because of the nature of the changes and in terms of the long-term
sustainability brought about by them. These developments were outward looking, embracing international
best-practice and aimed at achieving harmonization with EU requirements and fulfilling Bulgaria's WTO
telecommunications commitment. The specific institutional development with impact on the entire
telecommunications sector (see Annex) are establishment of the State Telecommunications Council as an
independent regulatory body and the National Radio Frequency Spectrum Council, an inter-ministerial
body, for providing policy advice to the Council of Ministers on spectrum allocation.
5. Major Factors Affecting Irnplementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
At the time the loan was negotiated and approved in 1993, Bulgaria had begun the difficult transition from
a centrally-planned to a market economy. There have been four elected governments since 1991, three
caretaker governments and one "oxperts" government, which hindered decision-making. There was also
- 8 -



replacement of the Presidents of CPT and BTC. These frequent changes adversely affected CPT and BTC
ability to implement policies and development activities on schedule in accordance with Project
commitments. Focus and attention was also diverted by the severe economic crisis and collapse of the
banking system in late 1996-early 1997. However, despite these obstacles, in due course, all policy actions
were completed to the satisfaction of the Bank, EIB and EBRD.
As for BTC, vendor-nation restrictions on export of high technology communications equipment [the
Consultative Committee (COCOM) monitored these transfers of technology and suppliers required certificates to
be able to export generally, and to FSU countries in particular, and COCOM was disbanded in end-1994] were
still in place, which caused substantial delays in the start of the DON. Even though the main supply
contracts financed by EIB (switches) and EBRD (cables) had been signed in July/August 1993, the
effectiveness of these was delayed until export certifications were received by contractors. Due to these
restrictions, BTC was compelled to install the older PDH standard (140 Mbps) optical fiber cable
equipment initially in the Sofia Junction Network and medium capacity SDH standard STM- 1 (155 Mbps)
instead of the higher capacity SDH STM-4 (622 Mbps) multiplex equipment in the transit level.
Subsequently, BTC upgraded the system when higher capacity equipment was available.
5.2 Factors generallv subject to government control:
Loan effectiveness, planned for mid-1993, was delayed until December 3, 1993 when the conditions
precedent for loan effectiveness were accomplished. This 6 month delay was mainly due to delays in
issuance of an operator license to BTC and the one-time adjustment to tariffs by 30% in real terms (both
achieved in November 1993). Policy actions governing adoption of a tariff policy and establishment of a
regulatory framework were also delayed, though the transition arrangements were acceptable from project
viability view point. In 1995/96, many actions, including tariff adjustments, and review of tariff policy
recommendations made by consultants were resisted by the then CPT and BTC authorities, which found
considerable support from the Government and policy makers who were then in office.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
BTC successfully managed project implementation to completion and integrated the DON into the existing
analog network during 1994 to 1998 and connected 213,000 business subscribers and 7,000 residential
subscribers. BTC undertook advance procurement in parallel with loan processing for the main packages
and was quick to take advantage of lower than estimated prices and utilize the savings from all multilateral
lenders to bolster system capabilities. BTC improved its financial management significantly based on
auditor's recommendations. BTC also respected relevant environmental codes in its network construction
aspects. Overall, BTC performed well and better than the Government.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Total Project costs, excluding interest during construction (IDC), were about US$265 million equivalent,
or 88% of the appraisal estimate of US$301 million equivalent. The reduction of US$36 million equivalent
in project costs is attributed to lower costs of local access network compared with appraisal estimates,
which used conservative and intemational benchmarks, and to reduction in contingencies. Also, some of the
reduction could be explained by the changes in the exchange rate, which was different from SAR estimates
(the exchange rate reached Leva 1800 per US Dollar by 1998 compared to an estimated 40 in 1998 at
appraisal). The costs of all other components were in line with original estimates mainly because of
expansion of the scope to utilize the savings. As for IDC, the nearly 45% reduction from SAR estimates
-9-



was due to the back loaded disbursement schedule corresponding to actual implementation.
As for financing, loans from E]3RD and EIB were fully utilized while about 6% savings in the Bank loan
(about US$1.9 million) was realized. Due to changes in the exchange rates between the US$ and the ECU
(the currency of EIB and EBRD loans), the disbursed amounts in US dollars by these cofinanciers were
different from original estimates. BTC's counterpart funds for investments were lower by about US$58
million equivalent compared with appraisal estimates, which also significantly contributed to its financial
health.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The impressive improvement in the financial performance of BTC along with GOB's renewed commitment
to continued development of the telecommunications sector indicate that the benefits of the Project are
highly sustainable. GOB and ETC are satisfied with the results achieved under the Project, as are the
business customers whose demajnd for services is growing. If the sale of BTC's shares to strategic investors
concludes successfully, then it would further enhance sustainability. The policy and regulatory framework
for managing the sector represents international good practice and it is contemplated that full competition
will be introduced no later than I st January, 2003 in accordance with Bulgaria's WTO commitment.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The DON, vital to BTC's development and modernization, has been completed. The DON has enabled
BTC to achieve significant improvements in the quality and reliability of service to telecommunications
customers. Digitalization of local access network and associated junction networks to the DON would
expand as necessary and also would be undertaken in areas not covered so far to modernize the network
further and to improve the service and reliability over a larger part of the network and customer base.
BTC's plans for the next phase of modernization is already drawn up as shown in the diagram in Annex.
Tariff policy and tariff increases and rebalancing has enabled BTC to meet financial targets and the
OSS/MIS computer system completed in 1999 will continue to provide improved financial and operational
management support. The GOB  has remained committed to reform  and liberalization of the
telecommunications sector, and the results of the Project evidence the signs of good transitional
arrangements, which would be enhanced further when control and management transfer to the strategic
investors in BTC upon financial closing.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Overall, the Bank's performance in lending was satisfactory. The Bank, in cooperation with the EU, EBRD
and EIB, provided comprehensive assistance to GOB, CPT and BTC to develop an appropriate sector
development strategy and also to identify priority areas for short- to medium-term support. In addition to
sector specialists in technical and financial areas, the Bank deployed policy and institutional specialists who
complemented the mainly technical and financial expertise of the cofinanciers. The Project focussed on
addressing major deficiencies in the sector, including policy and regulatory framework, tariffs and tariff
setting, corporate development and performance, inadequate infrastructure, enhanced competition and
foreign investment and privatization. The Bank was thus able to define a sustainable, long-term
- 10-



development strategy for the sector.
The Bank also ensured a high degree of participation of the Government, CPT and BTC in the design and
appraisal of the Project. The small number of procurement packages with turnkey contracting and advance
procurement in key areas helped reduce delays. On the policy aspects, notwithstanding staffing changes in
CPT and BTC following changes in Government, the design could have addressed the risks of delay for
these actions. The targets for implementing the tariff policy and regulatory framework (January 1, 1994)
were overoptimistic considering the preparatory work needed (the consulting studies) which had to be
managed under another loan (the TAL). Also, better monitoring indicators for evaluating technical
assistance for BTC's corporate development would have been helpful during supervision.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's supervision was carried out in close collaboration with the cofinanciers, including joint
supervision missions throughout the Project cycle, with active participation from the Resident Mission. The
coordination with cofinanciers enhanced the effectiveness of the dialogue with the Govenmment and BTC. A
key accomplishment was the adoption of an interim tariff policy in 1994/95 which ensured BTC's financial
viability throughout Project implementation. The supervision included appropriate skill mix from time to
time and ensured the quality of advice provided. Resident Mission support was exemplary and proactive
throughout the Project cycle, especially during supervision, which helped the continuity of dialogue.
The QAG review in 1997 noted the supervision as marginally satisfactory based on the view that the risks
due to the macro conditions were not adequately reflected in reports. As noted, Bulgaria faced severe
economic hardships during the Project, but the Project was less vulnerable than the other projects in the
Bank's portfolio. First, the intemational incoming and outgoing traffic balance had substantially improved
in BTC's favor, thus reducing risk of hard currency exposure to foreign utilities. Second, BTC's financial
strength as well as the tariff adjustments reduced its vulnerability to economic conditions. Third, a change
in the Government in 1996/97 and the Bank's quick response in providing assistance to help stabilize
Bulgaria's economy contributed to the rapid improvement in BTC's financial health. The Bank's
performance in supervision was satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall Bank performance was satisfactory throughout the Project cycle.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
BTC was well supported by consultants in the preparation of the Project and also benefited from early
Bank involvement. Some commercial aspects were unfamiliar to BTC, with the added strain of dealing with
divergent requirements of the three lenders. However, BTC's commitment was high and senior managers
were involved on a continual basis. BTC coped with technical aspects much easier than financial,
commercial and institutional aspects. Considering BTC's inexperience, its performance and support during
preparation was impressive and is rated satisfactory.
On the part of CPT, because of its policy responsibilities, high level officials were heavily involved in the
preparation of the Project. The transfer of staff between CPT and BTC at high levels helped coordination
and understanding of their different roles.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
- 11 -



Despite the changes in Govermnent over the period of project implementation and substantial delays, the
GOB fulfilled the covenants of lhe Guarantee agreement to the satisfaction of the Bank, EBRD and EIB. In
addition, GOB proceeded with privatization of BTC through international tender for the sale of 51% of its
shares to OTE, Greece and KPN, Netherlands, the financial closing of which was awaiting European
Commission approval at the time of this report. Based on final results, the Government's performance is
rated as satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
BTC's performance was highly satisfactory. BTC was well prepared to handle all technical and
procurement aspects of the DO1N and technical assistance. BTC set up a Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
in the Network Development and Implementation Division, with full implementation responsibility. The
PIU adhered to the procurement strategy and competently managed all contracts and contractors. BTC
successfully integrated the DON into the existing analog network, with all components in full operation.
BTC ensured training its personnel in operation and maintenance of the network and facilities. BTC also
prepared satisfactory progress reports, audited financial statements and other documents in accordance
with the Loan agreement. Despite changes in management, BTC ensured continuity and implementation
progress with minimal delay. The most significant delay was in the award of the OSS/MIS contract, which
required nearly one year to bring into conformance with Bank guidelines. The project did not raise
significant environmental issues since most development was accommodated at existing sites. Installatfon of
fiber optic cables was straightforward, mainly requiring laying cables in trenches along existing road and
rail corridors. The Project had a Category "C" rating for Environmental Assessment. BTC reported that the
physical components of the project were implemented in an environmentally prudent manner and that no
issues were encountered. In fact, the Project is expected to have significant environmental benefits, as more
efficient use of telecommunications will substitute for personal transportation and correspondingly reduce
environmental pollution and prormote energy conservation.
7.7 Overall Borrower per,formance.
BTC's overall performance has been highly satisfactory in both the physical and technical assistance
components. The CPT's (and the Government's) performance, which was unsatisfactory through
mid-course in the Project, was upgraded to satisfactory for having established suitable sector policy and
regulatory frameworks and conducted an open and transparent tender for partial privatization of BTC.
8. Lessons Learned
A Comprehensive Approach Pays
A key lesson learned is the overall positive effect the Bank can have on sector development when it is
involved in all aspects of reform - in this case developing the technical and financial capacity of BTC;
development of policy, legal and regulatory reforms; and structuring and advising on the privatization of
BTC. The Bank's involvement in strengthening BTC gave it credibility in the sector, which permitted the
Bank to pursue additional sectoral reforms including the privatization of BTC.
GOB's overall performance during the course of BTC's privatization process may have been enhanced in
certain aspects of coordination of its decision making process with the many governmental agencies and
officials involved in the transaction.

Synergy from Coordination among Bulgaria's Development Partners
The Project also showed how strong synergy among a country's development partners is key to helping
borrowers and governments achieve reform objectives through a coordinated and consultative approach.
Success in persuading the Bulgarian authorities to conform to the agreed tariff formula was achieved
mainly because of effective coordination.
Timing of Proposed Reforms too Ambitious
The Project's reform agenda was quite ambitious, and the changes in government delayed important
actions. Targets for achieving broader reform objectives should be set with realistic time tables, taking into
account the political risks and implementation challenges. Further, some of these objectives (e.g. regulatory
framework) should be adequately described in Project documents and integrated with more tangible
components (e.g. the infrastructure) in a consistent manner. The Project description falls short of these
marks; "functional regulatory framework" could have been defined more clearly.
Better Monitoring & Evaluation Indicators
The Project should have developed monitorable indicators for evaluation of technical assistance. For
example, the financial management and audit technical assistance could have set specific indicators such as
number of staff trained, turnover of skilled staff, financial deficiency remedies undertaken and benefits,
improvement in working capital, etc. Also, the tariff covenant could have been directed towards rebalancing
indicators rather than just the financial performance of BTC.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Please see Annex 10.
(b) Cofinanciers:
The EBRD: Overall, the Project is rated successful. The physical objectives set forth at approval
are well met. DON was extended to a full digital network, resulting in a near 100% coverage for BTC's
international and long distance customers. No congestion of the network is currently present and fully
automated access has notably improved the quality of service.
BTC, being a former cross-subsidized government entity responsible for both postal and
telecomnmunications operations, has been transformed considerably. In mid-1998, BTC was expected to be
on the verge of its privatization. The company was being restructured with competent management and its
staff being trained to deal with new management information systems and digital technology.
Further prospects appear to be good, and all depends on the BTC management's skill and capacity
to face the tough, free competition in a few years' time. If the privatization is successful, it would relieve
the company of its investment capital shortage, and provided this capital is invested in a manner that
prevents the lucrative business client segment from vanishing once the competition opens up, the prospects
for continued profitable operation remain good.

Annex 9 - Institutional Development and BTC Privatization
Telecommunications Act: The institutional framework was established with an enabling legal
framework under the Telecommunications Act (Act) passed on 27 July 1998. The Act embodies a
modem, flexible, technology-neutral approach toward regulating the sector in order to assure fair
competition among operators in the market, regulatory transparency and predictability to
encourage investment in the sector while balancing the GOB's interests in assuring protection to
consumers and allocation and use of scarce resources. The Act formalized the legal, structural and
financial separation of the ownership, regulatory and policy setting functions in the sector through
the creation of the State Teleco:mmunications Council (STC) and defining the respective roles and
authorities of STC, CPT and other governmental agencies in the sector. The Act was drafted with
a view toward harmonization with EU directives and consistent with Bulgaria's WTO
telecommunications conmmitment. Establishment of a clear legal and regulatory framework for the
sector through the Act as a prerequisite to the privatization of BTC was a key driver in the
transaction. The provisions of tihe Act, embodying the general policy framework and setting forth
a fair regulatory framework to assure both competition and development of the sector provided
GOB with key regulatory and policy negotiating tools during the privatization. The Act will also
provide a regulatory operational framework for a sector already witnessing growing competition
in a variety of services.
The State Telecommunications Council: STC is responsible for regulation of the sector. Its
President is appointed by the Council of Ministers. The STC is headed by a five-member
comrnission, including the President and currently has 150 staff organized into six departments:
(i) licensing; (ii) radio frequency spectrum management; (iii) type approval and standardization;
(iv) tariffs and economic regulation; (v) administrative/finance; and (vi) legal and international
relations. The structure of STC' resembles its counterparts in many countries. STC intends to
adopt a light-handed approach to regulation of the sector to foster investor confidence. STC has
funds allocated under the EU-Phiare program for capacity building, and has requested the Bank's
assistance with review of the raclio frequency spectrum management aspects.
National Radio Frequency Spectrum Council: Under Bulgaria's constitution, radio frequency
spectrum is considered a scairce national resource requiring governmental action for use.
Accordingly, the establishment of the Act and the frequency licensing & monitoring activities of
STC required cooridnation with a ministerial level body. Thus the council was forined which also
met GOB's concerns about balancing the use of this scarce national resource for civil,
commercial and defense needs. CPT would integrate the recommendations of the Council into its
overall radio frequency policies for the sector. Frequency spectrum allocation and management is
undergoing slow but sure changes in almost all countries prompted mainly by the increasing use
of wireless-based technologies in communications. Predictability in spectrum allocation is a key
factor in development of wireless telecommunications services and ensuring fair competition in
wireless communications, which would need to be tested in future.
Telecommunications Policy: The Policy, adopted in October 1998, sets forth the primary
objectives of the GOB regarding the development and regulation of the sector. The Policy adopts
a forward-looking approach to liberalizing the sector, contemplating the introduction of new
services, attracting investment, protecting consumers, assuring access to telecommunications
services at affordable prices and recognizes the link that a robust, competitive sector provides to
the overall economic development of Bulgaria and its competitiveness. The policy provides that it
is a 'living" document that needs to be periodically re-evaluated to account for the rapid pace of
technological and market development in the telecommunications market, both domestically and
globally. Like the Act, the Policy provided GOB with key negotiating tools in the transaction
privatizing BTC.

ANNEX 1 0
ICR Section: PARTNER COMMENTS
COMMENTS
From BTC Plc. - Borrower and Implementing Agency of the
Modernization of Telecommunications Project /cofinanced by
IBRD, EIB and EBRD/
Reference to a Document of IBRD 'Implementation Completion
Report on a Telecommunications Project in Bulgaria'
Loan No 3592 BUL
In our judgment the Report provides authentic coverage of the facts
concerning the period of the initiation of the Project implementation 11992/ till
its completion Ithe middle of 1999/. We appreciate the fact that IBRD applied
a complex approach toward all aspects of restructuring of the
telecommunications sector in Bulgaria throughout the whole period.
Therefore, for BTC specifically the necessary regulated independence and
freedom of action was insured through the way of licensing, corporative
restructuring, independent external audits so that the Company could act as a
proper Borrower and Project's Implementing Agency. At least there were two
times when the intervention of the Bank /concurred with the other cofinancing
banks/ played a decisive role for the implementation of the Project, i.e.:
* Solution of the problem of COCOM restrictions;
* Exerting pressure at a governmental level for the purpose of fulfillment
of the provisions under the credit agreements at the time of the serious
economic crisis in Bulgaria /1995-96/.
It shall be definitely stated that the good relations between the Bank and BTC
have been overtly expressed in transparency, rapid and adequate reactions in
concrete situations and on specific issues as well as the lack of formalism
/evidenced by the fact that many of the provisions under the original contracts
were adapted to the quickly changing conditions in Bulgarial. To put it in a
nutshell, everything that is not bureaucracy featured the relations between
BTC and the Bank.
The periodic missions of the three Banks to BTC played also an important
role, because apart from the regular reviews on the implementation of the
Project, other important for BTC issues were discussed and put in action like:
* Financial accountability and planning;
* Market-orientation and behavior;
* Radical improvement of the international connectivity of BTC network
/BTC has occupied one of the leading positions in the field of regional
telecommunications cooperation/;
* Introduction and implementation of new technologies;
* Interaction with other operators and service providers, etc.
It can be confirmed that through these missions the management experience
of BTC top-level administration was significantly enriched.

The introduction of real market orientation at the time of availability of modern
technological logistics was the reason for triggering off a radical reform in the
structure of BTC in 1997-98. The number of territorial units of BTC Plc. was
reduced from 28 to 11. The leading principle in the process of restructuring
was the separation and detachment of financial management, marketing of
services, quality control.
In the opinion of BTC the main goals of the Project are fulfilled in its basic
components:
* A parallel digital network - DON was built, which insured high reliability
and quality of the services provided by the Company;
* OSS/Operations Support System setting the foundations for introduction.
of a network management center;
* MIS/Management Information System was established;
* Training of the personnel was organized;
* The corporative development of BTC was restructured in line with the
market-orientation.
The accumulated complex potential resulting from the Project implementation
found reflection in impetious improvement of the financial state of the
Company in 1998-1999. In the conditions of preparation of BTC for
privatization and the related restriction on the borrowing of new loans, the.
improved financial State of the Company allowed the generation of significant-
self-financing of BTC intencled for investments.
The short-term Developmeint Program of BTC is entirely dominated by the
privatization process of BTC and is based on:
* Priority-structured Investment Plan for highly efficient sites and
insurance of prerequisites for offering of a wide range of new services
/1nternet, intelligent network, business access network/;
* Active marketing policies aiming at utilization of new market niches and
achievement of maximum consumer satisfaction in the process of
offering of all types of services;
_ Systematic control in view of the maintenance of strict financial and
technological discipline;
* Flexible tariff policy, based on cost-oriented prices and total elimination
of cross-subsidizing among services in view of the improvement of the
efficiency of all activities and above all, in view of the maximization of
financial results.
In conclusion, we shall undierscore that if we did not cover this road together
BTC would not be able to reach the present level of achievements.
The mutual cooperation and partnership with the World Bank has created
conditions and supported the efforts of BTC focused on the accomplishment
of its goal to become a modern telecommunications company.

COMMENTS
to the IBRD Implementation Completion Report
on the Telecommunications Project Loan No: 3592 BUL
by
the Committee of Posts and Telecommunications in its Capacity of
being the Entity Responsible for the State Policy and Regulation for the
Telecommunications Sector in the Republic of Bulgaria, and the capital
owner in companies with state participation
in the time period 1992-1998
As a whole the report fully reflects the activities carried out jointly by the
Bank, BTC,Ltd. and the Committee of Posts and Telecommunications for the
period of beginning, implementation and completion of the Project. This
period saw the beginning and the on-going restructuring of the
telecommunications sector in Bulgaria which has been accomplished to a
great extent, by means of:
- Separation between the state and the business functions and the
institutional consolidation of the CPT
* Separation between the postal services and the telecommunications into
two separate companies
* Abolishing the cross-subsidies to the postal sector
* Separation of the functions of state governance (policy making and
implementation) from the regulatory functions for the telecommunications
networks and services
* Establishing two independent entities on the basis of CPT and their
institutional consolidation.
* Elaboration and adoption of a legislative basis for the sector vwhich is
harmonised with the EC requirements.
* Liberalisation of the telecommunications networks and services market
and setting of a dead-line for the temporary existence of a liberalised and
a reserved market.
* Granting a great number of licences and availability of private operators in
the liberalised sector.
* Creating conditions for the privatisation of the main telecommunications
operator, BTC, Ltd.
* Adoption of a regulatory mechanism for the monopoly services.
31



* Improvement in the quality of the services in the sector as a result of
the construction of the overlay digital network, i.e. the DON Project,
being the main part of the Bank's project.
* Provision of up-to-date telecommunications services by BTC,Ltd and
the new operators.
* Establishing of a National Radio Frequencies Spectrum Council.
* Establishing of a Co-ordination Council on the Issues of the Information
Society
A great deal of the above results have been achieved through the
consultants' assistance that was rendered and supported by the Bank and by
the missions of its representatives. All this contributed to improvement in the
market and customer-oriented way of thinking and behaviour on all levels of
the CPT's personnel. The positive impact of this has been reflected in the
preparation of the adopted legislative acts, notwithstanding however, the four
changes in the CPT's management during the said period.
The results from the implementation of the TAL Project would have been
more successful if enougih time had been allotted to gain experience in the
course of he joint work.
We vwould like to propose the following addition to the Report:  the
implementation of the Project DON has contributed to a growth in the
number of the settlements with automatic incoming inter-urban and
intemnational access. Before the beginning of the Project the number of
such settlements was 144 while as per 1 January 2000 this number
reached 4100. Thus conditions have been created for an overall growth of
the national automatic traffic and the incoming intemational traffic. The latter
is one of the conditions for the credit currency balance in the overall
international traffic of the IBTC,Ltd.
