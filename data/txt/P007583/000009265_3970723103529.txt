SECOND TECHNICAL TRAINING PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      Nacional Financiera, S.A.
Guarantor:     United Mexican States.
Beneficiary:   National Agency for Professional
Technical Education (CONALEP).
Amount:        US$81.0 million equivalent.
Terms:         15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the
standard variable rate.
Project        The project would support CONALEP in implementing the second
Description:   phase (1985-88) of its technical training program for skilled
workers and technicians.
Objectives:    The project's objectives are (a) to improve CONALEP's
operational efficiency and effectiveness; (b) to increase the
supply of skilled workers and technicians; (c) to improve the
quality of training, instructor training, and materials cost
recovery efforts; (d) to develop advanced maintenance systems
for buildings and equipment; and (e) to provide flexible
support for the program as a whole.
Components:    The project would provide technical assistance to achieve the.
above objectives, support the creation of 24 cost recovery,
pilot -production units  and assist in the development of
about 97 technical training centers, equivalent to an
expansion of 90,000 additional students in training and
upgrading programs.
Benefits:      The project would greatly strengthen technical training at the
middle level by further contributing to the institutional
development of CONALEP and by enhancing the quality of
training. The project would increase CONALEP's annua? output
by 21,580 skilled workers and middle level technicians, and
1,500 technical instructors. It would also increase capacity
to upgrade specialized skills for about 16,180 employed
workers and technicians.



- iv -
Risks:         The major risks are difficulties in recruiting part-time
instructors during peak production hours and retention of
students. The ability of CONAIEP to pay competitive salaries
should diminish the problem of teacher recruitment. A
favorable student/teacher ratio and well equipped facilities
to aid in practical application of course work should improve
student retention. The risk of expected benefits of the
production units not materializing is more than offset by
CONALEP's proven capacity for implementing innovations.
Further, the project would provide for the financing of
feasibility studies prior to establishing the production
units. Overall, considering CONALEP's capacity for monitoring
and implementing the program, the risks are acceptable.

I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND LABOR NEEDS
1.01      Mexico is emerging from its worst economic and financial crisis of
the last 50 years. In the early 80s, a trend toward structural economic
imbalance was evident, but the outgoing government did not address some of
the essential economic and financial issues with the vigor that was required,
particularly in the fiscal area. Public expenditures rose rapidly without-
corresponding revenue increases, leading to increased public deficits and
very high inflation rates. In 1981 and 1982, the slack oil market, massive
capital flight and high international interest rates led to a steep
deterioration of public finances and balance of payments. To meet these
deficits the government borrowed heavily both abroad and at home. The
government's stabilization program, which was introduced in 1983, has brought
the situation under control, but economic growth suffered; unemployment rose
from less than 2% in 1980 to about 14% in 1984.  In 1983, the new government
identified the resumption of economic growth and the expansion of gainful
employment as two of its major priorities.
1.02      The government's strategy, as outlined in the National Development
Plan (NDP) for 1983-88, combines special efforts to recover from the present
economic crisis with a longer term perspective for regaining balanced and
stable growth to overcome structural problems. These structural problems
include a high rate of population growth (2.5% annual average estimated for
the decade), 1/ very high rates of labor force growth (about 3.1% per year)
together with skilled labor shortages, slow growth in agriculture, widespread
poverty, highly skewed interpersonal and interregional income distributions,
and an economy too dependent on oil revenues. The medium term strategy
presented in the NDP focuses on the need for structural changes in the
economy: a greater export orientation for the industrial system;
decentralization of the commercial structure; poverty alleviation through
policies designed to meet basic needs; and increased productivity and
absorption of individuals into the labor force, brought about by proper
training.
1.03      Mexico's medium term prospects for recovery and stable economic
growth are good, provided that economic management continues to be prudent,
private sector confidence is restored, and the international environment
remains reasonably favorable.   The government is committed to the economic
stabilization program, which includes the reduction of both the budget
deficit and inflation. It is also committed to liberalize trade and reduce
price controls and subsidies. Restoration of confidence in the private
sector is crucial, since only a strong and dynamic private sector will be
able to raise investment from the present depressed levels and supply the
increasing nonoil export surplus required for resumption of growth and
expansion of gainful employment. Export growth in international competitive
markets requires, in addition, a more productive and better trained labor
force, particularly at the skilled worker and technician levels.

projections of the Ministry of Programming and Budgeting, the National
Population Council and the Latin American Center of Demography.

1.04      Changes in the total population and labor force by decade, from
1950 to 1980 and projections for 1990 are shown in Table 1.1, including the
distribution of workers among the three major economic sectors. While the
total labor force has grown significantly (from 7.9 million in 1950 to 20.4
million in 1980), the proportion of workers in the primary sector will
decline steeply from 62% in 1950 to a projected 20% in 1990. At the same
time, the share of workers in manufacturing (secondary sector) and in
services (tertiary sector) have increased significantly, resulting in a
fourfold growth in the number of laborers in those sectors over 30 years.
The rate of shift has slowed down somewhat during the last three years as a
result of the economic crisis; the number of workers in the primary sector is
projected to remain relatively constant from 1980 to 1990, although the
proportion would still decrease. The labor force in the manufacturing and
services sectors, however, would continue to expand. These trends are
important because the proportion of skilled workers and technicians varies
substantially from sector to sector.

1.05      The number of selected skilled workers and technicians and its
proportion per thousand laborers by economic sector is shown in Table 1.2, as
derived from the 1970 and 1980 Census. The table also shows that the number
of skilled workers and technicians in each industry or sector increases with
time; as a result of these two factors, but primarily of the sectoral shifts,
the average proportion for the three sectors rose from about 85 per thousand
in 1970 to about 101 per thousand in 1980. A higher concentration of skills
in the occupational profile of each particular industry or sector is
necessary to effect productivity gains. Since the proportion of skilled
workers and technicians in the secondary and tertiary sectors is high and the
number of workers in these two sectors are expected to continue growing, the
demand for skilled workers and technicians would grow at a fast pace. The
economy would require about 3.1 million skilled workers and middle level
technicians by 1990, i.e., over 1 million additional skilled laborers in the
current decade. Allowing for a 2X attrition rate in the labor force, the
average additional requirement between 1980 and 1990 would be at least
120,000 skilled workers and technicians per year. According to recent

estimates 2, the output of middle level technical programs yielded an annual
average of only less than 30,000 graduates joining the labor force during the
4 year period 1980-84. Thus, the shortage of skilled workers and technicians
in Mexico greatly surpasses the current annual supply.
1.06      The shortage of skilled workers and technicians could have serious
economic consequences if not alleviated. It would be difficult for industry
to meet the planned 10% annual increase in production, and even more
difficult to remain competitive in international markets. Nor is it
realistic to expect agriculture to grow at a rate of 4% per annum without a
substantial upgrading of its labor force. The number of agricultural workers
is almost stagnant, future growth must be based primarily on productivity
increases. Solutions to current transport bottlenecks and maintenance of an
efficient telecommunications network will depend on an adequate supply of
skilled workers and technicians. Health and other basic services for people
or industry cannot be adequately provided, much less improved or expanded,
without increases in the quantity and qualit-y of labor in the corresponding
sectors. Thus, reducing and eventually eliminating the shortage of skilled
workers and technicians is vital to economic growth and development.
II. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
2.01      The Mexican general education and training system (Annex 2) is well
developed and reasonably financed, but there are major deficiencies at the
middle level. This is particularly true at the upper-middle level, where
terminal technical training, i.e., preparation of skilled workers and
technicians for entry into the labor market, has been weak traditionally, of
low quality and unattractive to students. As a result, the output of skilled
workers and technicians has been quantitatively and qualitatively out of line
with the country's economic and manpower demands.
Overview of the Education and Training System
2.02      The education and training system has primary, middle and higher
levels. It has good coverage, fairly good efficiency and generally achieves
its goals. At the primary level (grades 1-6), the net enrollment rate was
97% in 1980 and reached about 100% in 1984. Total enrollment was 15.4
million students in 1984. Internal efficiency 3/ has improved from less
than 60% in 1971 to almost 81% for the cohort graduating in 1984. A free
textbook program is well developed: it distributed about 83.4 million
textbooks to students and 844,000 guides to teachers during 1983. Virtually
all teachers are properly trained. Middle level education comprises a lower-
and an upper-middle level. At the lower-middle level (grades 7-9), first
year entrants in 1984 constituted 87.8% of all graduatee from the primary
2/   Comite InterSecretarial STPS/SEP, Subsector Study on Formal
and On-the-job Training (forthcoming).
3/   Internal efficiency is the ratio of a current output to a maximum
possible output. In this case, it is the number of student years
represented by the graduates divided by the number of student years
invested. If there were no wastage due to repetition or dropout,
internal efficiency would be 100%.



level in 1983. Enrollments at this level were 4.1 million in 1984, an
increase of about 2.5 million students since 1974. Internal efficiency has
remained high, reaching 95% for the cohort finishing in 1984. The
upper-middle level (grades 10-12) provides the link between lower-middle and
higher education, as well as the lower-middle and the labor force. It is
responsible for supplying the training necessary to produce future qualified
workers and middle level technicians. This latter function has traditionally
been difficult to achieve, despite several attempts at reform during the past
20 years. Thus, the upper-middle level is where the major problem lies.
Higher education (grades 13-17) received more than 308,000 first year
students in 1984, or 91% of those who completed nontechnical upper secondary
education the previous term (338,000). Higher education includes several
public and private universities of high quality. Enrollment in science and
technological subjects accounts for 62Z of all students at this level,
including those enrolled in medical sciences. This proportion represents a
reasonable balance.
2.03      The Mexican Government has traditionally made a reasonable effort
to finance edecation. Although the recent crisis affected education more
than other sectors, it also allowed the government to shift funds toward
high priority areas such as the improvement and expansion of upper-middle
terminal training.  In 1983, federal expenditures on education and training
amounted to Mex$488 biliion (US$4.06 billion). State governments and the
private sector also spent significant amounts on education, which brought
total education expenditures in the country to about 4.2% of the GDP for
1983.  This level is on the low side (see Annex 1 for comparators), but still
adequate considering the fiscal circumstances. While the overall share of
GDP allocated for general education has decreased significantly since 1979
(about 0.6 %), funding for terminal technical training has almost doubled in
real terms in four years, from about US$43 million in 1980 to about US$79.9
million in 1983, indicating the high priority assigned by the government to
this area.
Upper-Middle Level Technical Training
2.04      As stated, this level has dual goals: preparing students either for
the next educational level, or for entry into the labor market as skilled
workers and middle level technicians, but it has traditionally failed to meet
the latter goal. It enrolls 1.8 million students in more than 3,800 schools
and it is highly differentiated. It comprises four major categories of
education or training: academic, teacher training, dual purpose
technica_4/, and terminal technical (Table 2.1). Each one of these
categories includes several streams or types of schools, depending on the
sector served (industry, fisheries, agriculture, etc.) and on the
administrative jurisdiction (federal,, state, private). This high degree of
apparent differentiation, does not represent a wide choice of alternatives.
Instead, it manifests the historical difficulties of solving the problem at
4/   This category was origiaally intended to prepare students either to
enter the work force or to proceed to the next level of academic
education. In fact this category differs only slightly from the
academic category.

hand-i.e., of training sufficient numbers of bigh quality skilled workers
and middle level technicians. For example, the dual purpose technical
schools constituted a first attempt to train skilled workers by providing a
practical outlet to the labor force. They have not, however, been effective
in this respect, less than 7,000 out of 312,000 students joined the labor
force in 1984. In 1969, the government again attempted to direct sufficient
numbers of trained students into the labor force through the Centers for
Technological Studies (CETs); yet only about 5,000 of 220,000 students joined
the labor force in 1984.  In addition, not many students wanted to apply for
terminal training programs until recently.

2.05      Terminal Technical Training. With the creation of the National
Agency for Professional Technical Education (COXALEP) training system (Annex
3) in late 1978, the middle level, terminal technical training program
(grades 10-12) seems to have moved in the right direction and, with the
ak* 's assistance, to have entered a period of rapid development which still
continues. The current enrollment of 316,000 students in terminal training
and a current demand for places, which is twice as large as the number of
school places available for some programs, represent a significant
improvement over 1978.   However, the annual output of 33,000 graduates from
other -terminal- programs outside CONALEP is not effective, only about 15S of
these graduates actually entered the labor force. The major reasons are a
lack of training which provides 'hands-on experience and over emphasis upon
theory, both make students unfit for employment as skilled workers or
technicians and encourage them to proceed to further education.
Nevertheless, the above rate of 15Z in 1984 is a large improvement over the
meager 5% of graduates joining the labor force in 1978. Once CONALEP phase I
is completed, the estimated annual output of properly trained middle level
technicians and skilled workers would still be less than 3Z of the estimated
900,000 first job seekers, and would meet less than one third of actual
demand.
Subsector Issues
2.06      In spite of the success achieved by the new program and its
contribution to the improvement of upper-middle level technical training, the
subsector still has serious problems. If the country's economic and social
development goals are to be attained, the following major issues must
continue to be promptly and effectively addressed by the government, with the
assistance of both public and private enterprise:
(a)  Insufficient Quantity of Skilled Workers and Technicians.
The need for additional selected skilled workers and technicians
in the decade is estimated at 1,050,000 (Table 1.2), plus
replacement needs in excess of 200,000. The total estimated output
for the same period is a maximum of 400,000. I/ Thus, the
estimated shortfall in the combined output of skilled workers and
middle level technicians would be at least 850,000 workers during
the period 1980-90. The major factors contributing to this
shortfall are:
(i)  insufficient training opportunities, exacerbated by serious
regional imbalances;
(ii) low efficiency and completiOn rate (about 40% for the non-
CONALEP terminal training programs in 1983), due primarily to
the poor quality and consequent lack of prestige of most such
programs; and
5/ Comite Inter Sectorial STPS/SEP, preliminary figures for the Subsector
Study on Formal and On-the-Job Training (forthcoming).



-8-
(iii) low proportion of graduates joining the labor force from the
dual purpose technical training schools and from CETs and
other "terminal programs (paras. 2.04 and 2.05).
(b) Inadequate Quality of Training. Training received in terminal
programs other than CONALEP is inadequate for both skilled workers
and technicians. These inadequacies result from:
(i) instructors who, while academically qualified, have little or
no industrial experience and are prone to excessive and
largely theoretical lecturing, and to demonstrations of
classical experiments rather than a more practical and
balanced approach to training;
(ii) curricula and course content which are frequently irrelevant
to the productive sectors, due to the lack of formal links
with industry and to insufficient services of qualified
specialists (or consultants) for periodic revision of basic
instructional materials and course syllabi;
(iii) lack of the appropriate training equipment, in some
instances resulting from financial constraints, and in others
from lack of consultation with industry, or the academic
biases of the instructional staff; and
(iv) scarcity of consumable supplies and audiovisual materials
because some school managers lack the funds, the
administrative authority or the experience to provide
guidelines for their efficient use.
Subsector Achievements
2.07      Despite the significant deficiencies existing in upper-middle level
technical training, tremendous achievements have been made during the 1980-84
period. The proportion of graduates from terminal technical training
programs has increased significantly since 1978 . With Bank assistance
(para. 2.11), the CONALEP system which had no schools in operation in 1980,
now has 122 new and well equipped schools located throughout the country,
with an enrollment capacity of about 110,000 students. CONALEP has initiated
close ties with industry, has sound advisory boards, and has initiated a job
placement and follow-up system. The CONALEP schools are prestigious and are
in strong demand because they are generally well staffed with industrially
experienced instructors. Moreover, the success of the CONALEP system has had
a positive effect on other technical training programs under the Ministry of
Education as was intended. The Government has assigned CONALEP the leading
role in expanding and improving the sector; it is expected that at least the
most recent CETs will emulate this example, whereas other programs, which
have proven to be unresponsive, are being converted into regular academic
programs.

The National Agency for Professional Technical Education (CONALEP)
2.08      CONALEP was created in 1978 as an independent agency responsible
for upper-middle level terminal technical training. Because of the
difficulties involved in the creation of a new training system, it was
conceived as a two-phase effort. The first phase of the CONALEP program
(1979-84) which involved creating the program, testing its major components
and initiating its development was supported by Bank Loan No. 2042-HE signed
on July 31, 1981. Phase II of the CONALEP program (1985-88) consists of
further increasing the capacity of the CONALEP system and making necessary
adjustments in institutional, administrative and training aspects of the
program.
Definition and Distinguishing Features
2.09      The CONALEP program is designed to train (or upgrade) skilled
workers and middle level technicians through terminal programs at the upper
middle level (grades 10-12 or the equivalent). These programs are planned in
close cooperation with the productive sectors, and include a variety of
full-time and part-time agricultural, industrial and service training
programs. The CONALEP program differs from other middle level technical
training programs in that:
(a)  its semiautonomy facilitates flexibility and responsiveness to
the changing needs and participation of the productive sectors;
Cb) its administration is decentralized so that operational decisions,
including curriculum adaptations, are delegated to local training
authorities and their industrial advisory boards;
Cc) its curriculum has a practical orientation and strong emphasis upon
evaluation, 'hands-on' experience, follow up and feedback;
(d)  its training programs, both regular and part-time, are strictly
terminal and job market oriented;
(e)  its unique promotion activities have successfully enhanced the
program's public image, enabling it to attract qualified students
and obtain active support from the productive sectors;
(f)  its students pay a tuition proportional to their training costs and
have a supplementary tuition loan program available; and
(g)  its technical instructors are from industry, teach part-time
(typically 10-14 hours/week), cannot belong to the Teachers Union
and, thus, the system is relatively free of undesirable union
influences, which have resulted in other training institutions in
the hiring of instructors lacking industrial experience and, at
times, the necessary technical qualifications. In the case of
CONALEP, this cannot happen because CONALEP is not the instructors'
primary employer.

Objectives
2.10      The CONAIEP training program objectives are:
(a)  to expand the output of skilled workers and technicians by creating
a large network of upper-middle level terminal training centers in
close cooperation with the productive sectors and in the quantities
required by the economy;
(b) to improve the quality of training by emphasizing a practical
curriculum, which maintains its relevance to changing regional and
sectoral needs;
(c) to increase the efficiency of such training by enhancing its public
image, achieving higher retention rates and decentralizing training
opportunities; and
(d) to upgrade the quality of the existing workforce, by designing
special programs and using CONALEP s facilities for the training of
both employed and unemployed adults.
Previous Bank Experience
2.11      The proposed project would be the second Bank operation in the
sector. The first operation, the Technical Training Project (FY82), for
which Bank financing of US$90.0 million equivalent was provided by Bank Loan
2042-ME signed on July 31, 1981, supported the first phase of CONALEP's
development program. The first phase program (1980-84) comprised: (a)
constructing a central administrative and support complex to establish a firm
base for the effective management of the system; (b) constructing, furnishing
and equipping 122 training centers throughout the country with an enrollment
capacity of 110,000 students; and (c) recruiting and training 920
instructors. COWALEP's first phase program has been very successful and will
be fully implemented by June 30, 1985. In addition, education oriented
components have been included in projects in other sectors and experience has
generally been favorable.
III. TEE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The proposed project would assist the government implement its
training policies and targets set out in the 1984-88 Education Development
Program by assisting CONALEP to continue its rapid development by
implementing its second phase plan through 1988. The specific project
objectives are:
(a) to improve the operational efficiency and effectiveness of central
and local administrations and enhance the role of the industrial
advisory committees through local and expatriate specialist
assistance, management training, and short term study tours and
internships;
(b) to increase the number of skilled workers and technicians by
expanding existing training capacity by an additional 90,000



- 1! -
students (this expansion would have a balanced regional
distribution and an adequate array of training specialties);
(c)  to improve the quality of instruction by further upgrading and
expanding instructor training, emphasizing the practical approach
and perfecting feedback and adjustment procedures;
(d)  to develop an advanced maintenance system for buildings and
equipment and explore other cost reduction measures; and
(e)  to provide flexible support for the program as a whole, eliminating
undesirable distinctions among project and nonproject centers, and
facilitating the development of strategic training options and
institution building.
Components and Description
3.02      The proposed project, in supporting phase II of CONALEP's
development program, would provide technical assistance to achieve the above
objectives, support the creation of 24 pilot production units and assist in
the development of all phase II institutions, which are to be fully
operational by October 1990.

Improving Operational Efficiency and Effectiveness
3.03      Central Administration.  CONALEP's central administrative system
has demonstrated proficiency in project planning and implementation.
However, because of the short period (about four years) since its inception
and an even shorter period (one to two years) in which its schools have been
fully equipped and operational, and because it plans to expand to more than
twice its present capacity, CONALEP's ability to control and coordinate a
large training system is as yet largely untried, and some adjustments might
be required. In recognition of this, the administration has requested
support to finance the costs of specialist assistance and short study
tours/inter$ships abroad for staff to observe, study and participate in
administrative and industrial advisory activities which are applicable to the
CONALEP system.
3.04      Local Administration.  Furthermore, the abilities of local school
administrators have not yet been well proven due to the short period of
operation of properly equipped schools. In view of this, CONALEP has also



- 12 -
requested financial assistance for a variety of management training
activities to strengthen the administrative abilities of key local
administrators.
3.05       Integrated Approach.  CONALEP should strengthen its incipient
system of placement and follow-up for graduates by actively maintaining its
contaccs with local industries and employers. Advisory committees can
provide guidance not only for course content but also for the placement of
graduates. The project would finance the analysis of options and the
incremental costs of strengthening the placement system.
Increasing the Output of Skilled Workers and Technicians
3.06        Technical Training Centers.  The project, which would enable
CONALEP to meet the targets set by the government for its second phase
program, includes building, furnishing and equipping about 97 trrining
centers. The training centers would be widely distributed among
the 31 states and the Federal District. Since the target is increasing
training capacity for about 90,000 new students, the actual number of centers
could vary by as much as plus or minus 10 depending upon the demand
characteristics of the communities in which they are located and the number
of existing centers that could be expanded. The projected distribution of
enrollments and centers by natural regions and phases is shown in Table 3.2.

3.07      Fields of Study.  Enrollments and outputs by major field of study
are shown in Table 3.3. It is expected that women will occupy about 30% of
the training places. The curricula and course syllabi, discussed more fully
in Annex 3 (paras. 6 and 7), are complete for all new centers, and would be
basically the same as for the first phase centers; no major changes are
required.

Improving the Quality of Instruction and the Instructor Training Program
3.08      Instructor Training Program. When fully operational in 1990-91,
the new training centers would require the equivalent of an additional 7,500
full-time instructors (Annex 3, Table B). It will not be easy to recruit,
train and retrain such a large number of instructors, but CONALEP is
continuing with the expansion and upgrading of its instructor training
programs, re-cruitment procedures and instructor services. The instructor
training system is fully discussed Ln Annex 3 (paras. 8-10). The project
would finance specialist assistance for further revising instructor training
materials. Based upon performance in phase I, an acceptable and timely
solution of the recruitment problem is anticipated.



- 14 -
3.09      Pilot Production Units.  The project would provide initial
financial support (US$600,000 base cost) to create revolving funds for the
initial purchase of production materials and supplies for about 24 pilot
"production unitsm within selected training centers and programs.
The underlying principle of the production units would be to enhance training
through making consumable supplies and practical hands-on training
opportunities more readily available. This is also expected to improve
student motivation, enhance student retention, and reduce training costs
financed from the regular budget. The funds would be allocated to programs
such as meat processing, textiles, metal machining, welding, cabinet making,
foundry and hot metal working, and other training programs where the cost of
consumable supplies is high. These production units would emphasize the
production of marketable items, to be sold to small business/industries/
institutions and/or individuals under prearranged contracts and agreements,
which could return to the school the full costs of materials, energy and
other nonlabor inputs, and perhaps generate a small surplus. The various
steps of the production processes would be performed, on the basis of skills
requirements, by trainees who had reached the appropriate level of ability.
This would maximize the efficiency of training and promote motivation. Such
training-oriented production units have been successfully developed in many
training institutions in developed and developing countries.
Development of a Maintenance System and Other Efficiency Measures
3.10      Maintenance. Equipment procured during phase I represents a large
investment. While efforts were initially directed to designing proper
specifications and ensuring prompt procurement and installation, the time has
come when a system should be developed to provide building and equipment
maintenance to protect this investment.  This system would include (a) a
method of verifying that proper naintenance records are being kept in each
center; (b) a set of procedures to follow when equipment breaks down,
including repair and temporary replacement policies; and (c) policies for
spare parts inventory control. CONALEP has agreed to place into operation a
provisional maintenance system before September 30, 1985 and, based on 18
months of experience, to adopt a definitive maintenance system by March 31,
1987.
3.11      Efficiency Measures.  Cost reduction measures to be studied and, if
warranted, implemented on a pilot basis by the project are (a) reducing local
administrative costs by increasing the size of the smaller training centers
where justified by local need; (b) finding administrative ways to effect cost
reductions in the fixed commitments of those smaller centers where the scale
cannot be increased; and (c) initiating practical production activities in
selected centers and programs where sales by production units (para. 3.09)
could ease the financial burden of providing consumable supplies.

Overall Institutional Support
3.12      Criteria for the Creation of New Centers.  With Bank assistance,
CONALEP has been refining the eligibility criteria (Annex 4) for the
creation of future training institutions, and has developed guidelines for
the allocation of equipment funds. New centers have been selected
concurrently with the development of these refinements and they would be
established on the basis of economic need, feasibility and economic
efficiency. These criteria, which include certain revisions and
clarifications of those used in phase I, are reasonable and acceptable to the
Bank. They would ensure that program objectives are met in a timely and
efficient way and provide for an equitable allocation of loan funds and
training opportunities throughout the country. During negotiations, CONALEP
provided assurances that (a) unless otherwise agreed in advance with the
Bank, the expansion of existing training centers and the location of new
training centers financed under the project would be in accordance with the
revised and agreed upon criteria, and (b) a draft transitional program for
centers that are too small or do not otherwise meet the revised criteria
would be presented and discussed writh the Bank by December 31, 1985, so that
any corrective actions could be carried out in the period 1986-88.
3.13      Strategic Training Options.  The project would explore and
eventually promote the initiation of an outreach training system, to be
developed with the assistance of consultants, for the development of
strategic training alternatives with sufficient flexibility to meet short and
medium term local and regional needs, particularly those of smaller
communities. Among the possible alternatives are (a) 'feeder training
centers", which would offer broad first year (or two year) training programs
covering the core curricula and then feed their outputs into "area training
centers" for the final one or two year specialized (and hence expensive)
laboratory and workshop training; (b) rotation of programs and equipment from
locations where they no longer match employment needs, to locations where
such training programs are fully justified; (c) cooperative training programs
with local industry in those specializations requiring excessively costly
equipment and/or consumable supplies; and (d) transportation of students
among three or four nearby municipalities so that students would have a
larger selection of training choices, and the use of facilities would be more
efficient.

4.03           Basis of Cost Estimates.   Costs are expressed in prices of
January 1, 1985. Estimated costs of civil works and furniture for the
project are based upon unit prices derived from current contracts in phase I
and detailed estimates from other Mexican projects of a similar nature.
Costs are adjusted to reflect regional variations within the country.
Professional fees and site development costs are not calculated separately.
Construction would follow detailed standard modular plans acceptable to the
Bank. Equipment costs are derived from preliminary and final lists, and they
include a substantial revision of equipment costs, lists and specifications,
based on the experience of phase I. Cost estimates exclude any identifiable
duties or taxes.



- 18 -
4.04      Comparison of Unit Costs.  The unit area and unit capital cost
estimates are shown in Table 4.3. They are generally comparable to those for
similar projects supported by the Bank and others carried out in the Latin
America and Caribbean Region. Due to a thorough cost revision and to the
exclusion of some expensive programs already covered in phase I, CONALEP has
been able to reduce equipment costs per student place by about 40% between
phases I and II.

cl   The business and health fields account for 27% of total student places
and require only an average of about 5 sq. m. per student.
d/   Project construction costs are less than -hase I and regional
averages because of (a) the simple steel frame type of construction and
(b) the strong US$ combined with peso devaluation.
e/   Phase II includes laboratory and shop tables that were included with
equipment in phase I.
f/   Project equipment erats are less than phase I average due to the
exclusion of some expensive programs such as metallurgy, textile and
machine workshops.
4.05      Contingency Allowances.  The program cost includes a physical
contingency allowance equal to 5% of the estimated baseline costs for all
construction, furniture and equipment for those buildings built after
January 1, 1985. Physical and price increase estimates for construction and
furniture are based upon the amount of construction to be performed after
January 1, 1985. Project costs include price and physical contingencies for
construction, furniture, equipment, production materials and technical
assistance. In view of differences in the rate of price escalation between
local and international market prices, price increases for local and foreigrn
costs for civil works and technical assistance were calculated separately.
It is assumed that price increases for equipment, production materials will



- 19 -
follow international price trends since it is to be procured largely through
ICB (para. 4.15) (i.e., local suppliers will not be awarded contracts if
their prices exceed international competitive bids).  Anticipated price
increases during implementation are shown in Table 4.4. Accordingly, total
price increases during the implementation period are expected to be about 20Z
for construction (excluding sunk costs), 9% for equipment, 18% for furniture
and 13% for technical assistance. Total contingencies (physical and price)
are estimated at about 18.7% of baseline costs (excluding sunk costs) and
15.7Z of total costs (Annex 5).

4.06      Foreign Exchange Component.  After excluding sunk costs (US$1.8
million), the foreign exchange component is estimated at US$80.9 mdllion
equivalent or about 52.9% of total project costs. The calculations of the
foreign exchange component are based on the assumption that (a) all
construction and related professional services would be awarded to local
firms, (b) all furniture would be awarded to local suppliers, and (c) 75% of
equipment would be awarded to foreign suppliers. The resulting foreign
content of each category of expenditure was calculated at 20Z for
construction, 18% for furniture, 82.5% for equipment, 50% for production
supplies and 50% for specialist assistance and fellowships.
Recurrent Cost Implications
4.07      When fully operational in 1990-91, the recurrent costs of the
project are estimated in constant 1985 pesos at Mex$19,730 million (i.e.,
US$96.3 million). CONTALEP's future operating budget represents about 1.8% of



- 20 -
projected federal recurrent expenditures for education and culture in
1990. 6/ CONALEP's current recurrent expenditures are 1.6% of the federal
budget for education and culture. In view of the high priority given to the
proposed program, and the government's strong commitment to expanding output
of technical labor, it is expected that those expenditures will be met.
Project Financingi and Disbursement Plan
4.08      Financing.  The total project cost of US$152.9 million excluding
sunk costs (US$9.3 m) would be financed as follows:
(a) the proposed Bank loan of US$81.0 million would finance about 53%
of total project cost equivalent to the estimated foreign
exchange costs (excluding sunk costs); and
(b) the government would finance 47% of total project cost, equivalent
to the local costs.
To facilitate the early procurement of the equipment required to make about
48 of the training centers operational by September 1985, it is recommended
that US$7.0 million be made available for retroactive financing of equipment
procured before loan signature but after January 1, 1985. This amount would
imply commitments of about US$14.0 million in advance contracting during the
same period.
4.09      Disbursement Plan.  The proposed loan is expected to be disbursed
over a period of about four and one half years (Annex 6) on the basis of:
(a) 100% of total costs for imported equipment (including cost of
installation where applicable) and production supplies; 100% of
ex-factory costs for goods locally produced (including cost of
installation where applicable); and 85% of local expenditures for
off-the-shelf purchases;
(b) 100% of technical assistance costs for specialists in
administration, management training, and training materials, and
for several feasibility studies including the selection of
production units, cost reduction measures and outreach programs.
4.10      The estimated schedule of disbursements by calendar and fiscal
years is presented in Table 4.5. As this would be the second technical
education project financed in Mexico, the expected disbursement profile is
based upon actual performance under the first project (Loan 2042-ME). The
projected disbursement schedule is a substantial improvement on the average
disbursement performance of previous education projects in other Latin
American countries. This is justified by the advanced status of project
preparation and the good implementation record of the first project.
6/   In 1983, federal expenditures for education and culture amounted to
Mex$488,667 million, equivalent to US$4.0 billion. It is estimated that
these expenditures could amount to US$6.0 billion in 1990 at constant
1985 dollars.



- 21 -
Expected disbursements over the initial three semesters are considerably
better than for the first project for two reasons: (a) a special account will
be functioning from the beginning of project implementation (the account was
instituted as an amendment to the first project) and (b) customs clearance
problems experienced during the initial months of implementation of the first
project were resolved and have not recurred.

4.11      Special Account.  In order to accelerate reimbursement of the
Bani:'s share of expenditures prefinanced by the borrower, and to allow for
the direct payment of small foreign expenditures, Nacional Financiera, S.A.
(NAFINSA) would establish a Special Account in US dollars to cover four
months of estimated expenditures. Upon request from NAFINSA, the Bank would
make an initial deposit of up to US$8.0 million. Individual payments for
foreign expenditures in excess of US$100,000 would be made in accordance with
normal disbursement procedures under which withdrawal applications are
forwarded directly to the Bank. NAFINSA would request replenishment of the
Special Account upon presentation of withdrawal applications forwarded to the
Bank with full documentation. The Bank would require a monthly statement of
the Special Account which would reflect transactions during the preceding
month. During negotiations, NAFINSA provided assurances that it would
establish a Special Account and submit monthly statements to the Bank.
Implementation, Procurement and Auditing
4.12      Management.  Project coordination, implementation, supervision and
monitoring would be the responsibility of the administrative directorates of
CONALEP, which performed creditably in implementing Loan 2042-ME. The



- 22 -
Director General would act as project director, wlth the Director of
Administration and Finance serving as project finance officer. The Director
of Buildings and Equipment would define the space planning criter.a and
appropriate architectural and space requirements for the training centers and
would provide this information to the Administrative Committee of Federal
Prograos for School Construction (CAPFCE), 7I which would then handle the
preparation of building plans, specifications and bidding docaments, and the
bidding and award of construction contracts in consultation with CONALEP.
The Directorate of Buildings and Equipment, in close coordination w:th
CAPFCE, would supervise the construction of the centers; including the
installation of furniture and equipment. The Directorate of Building sad
Equipment is also responsible for the preparation of furniture and equipment
lists, specifications and bidding documents. However, equipment and
furniture procurement (i.e., bidding, evaluation and contract preparation)
would be the responsibility of the Directorate of Procurement. The
Directorate of Legal Affairs would assist by preparing the procurement
contracts. The Director of Procurement would also be assisted by a Customs
Clearance Officer in each of the ports of entry. Education and training
matters would be handled by the Director of Operations and Teacher Training.
No additional staffing would be required except part-time help that would be
needed during the equipment bid evaluation period. No difficulty is expected
in the recruitment of qualified assistants and budgetary arrangements have
been made for this additional staffing.
4.13      Implementation Schedule.  The building, furnishing, and equipping
of all institutions is scheduled for completion and the centers operational
by June 30, 1989 (Annex 7). This schedule is considered reasonable, within
the capacities of CONAIEP and CAPFCE, and would serve as the basis for
monitoring program implementation. Expected completion dates for the
critical activities in program implementation are listed in Table 4.6. To
allow sufficient time for submission of final withdrawal applications, the
closing date for the proposed loan would be December 31, 1989.

a/     Sunk costs (i.e. construction expenditures incurred up to
December 31, 1984) of US$9.3 million are not included.
b/     Figures have been rounded.  Expected disbuirsement is about 90% of
total expenditures.
4.15      Civil works totalling US$60.1 million (base costs) would be located
on about 97 sites in the 31 states and the Federal District. None of the
individual contract costs would be great enough to attract foreign bidders.
Mexico's construction industry is highly developed and capable of executing
works at costs competitive wlth International bidders. Construction
contracts for these training centers 8/ would be awarded on

the basis of LCB under procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. 9/ All
new buildings would be built according to standard modular plans which are
acceptable to the Bank. All of the 64 sites where construction is scheduled
for 1985 have been acquired, and no problems are anticipated in acquiring
those for the remaining project centers.
4.16      At least 75% of equipment (costing about US$71.9 million, base
cost) would be procured on the basis of ICB; a maximum of 25% would use LCB
procedures in which foreign firms could participate. The lists,
specifications and bidding documents are similar to those used in the first
project. These were developed with the assistance of industry, and have been
reviewed to incorporate the features of the Revised Bank Procurement
Guidelines (dated August 84). Bidding documents are acceptable to the Bank.
Because the first 48 trairing centers (about 50,000 students) are to be
partially operational (in final or temporary quarters) by September 1985,
equipment procurement under ICB and LCB must begin in early 1985. LCB is
the preferred method of procurement for s8  ller equipment packages because it
is quicker and more efficient given that the participation of sufficient
numbers of local and foreign suppliers (about 100 of which have sales and
services offices in Mexico) is expected to result in competition adequate to
assure economic prices. Equipment packages in excess of US$300,000 would be
procured through ICB procedures. Packages of between US$40,000 and
US$300,000, in an aggregate not to exceed 25% of the total equipment amount,
would be procured through LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank.  Small items
or groups of items estimated to cost no more than US$40,000, not to exceed a
total of US$4.0 million, or items of a specialized nature, for wh,ich ICB or
LCB would not be practical, could be procured through local shopping.
4.17      Mexico's furniture industry is highly developed and capable of
manufacturing furniture of excellent quality at prices highly competitive
with international bidders. Furniture costing about US$4.8 million (base
cost) would be procured through LCB under procedures which are acceptable to
the Bank. Interested foreign bidders would not be precluded from
participating in the bids.
4.18      About 75% of production supplies costing a total of US$0.6 million
(base cost) would be procured through LCB. Small groups of items costing no
more than US$30,000, not to exceed a total of US$250,000, could be procured
through local shopping.  The terms of reference for all technical assistance
contracts exceeding the equivalent of US$100,000 would be submitted to the
Bank for prior review and approval.
4.19      Based upon the implementation experience of the first project (Loan
2042-ME), it is expected that up to 300 contracts would be awarded under the
project.  Because of (a) the excellent performance of CONALEP in bid
9/   The appraisal mission reviewed proposed LCB procedures for phase II and
was satisfied that LCB procedures which are acceptable to the Bank would
be followed, particularly with respect to (a) adequate periods for
prequalification, advertising and preparing bids; and (b) awards to
lowest evaluated bids.

evaluation and contract review under the previous project, and (b) the
impracticality of the Bank reviewing a large number of contracts, only
equipment contracts valued over US$600,000 would be subject to prior Bank
review. These contracts would cover about 30% of the value of equipment
procured through ICB. Other contracts will be subject to selective post
award review by the Bank. For the purpose of comparing foreign and local
bids during ICE evaluation, domestic manufacturers would be allowed a margin
of preference equal to the prevailing tariff or 20% of CIF costs of imported
goods, whichever is lower.
4.20      Auditing.  CONALEP has a financial directorate responsible
for the appropriate recording and reporting of the program's financial
transactions, including accounting and internal auditing control. It is
adequately staffed with experienced accounting personnel. CONAIEP external
auditors during phase I were Horacio Ojeda Paullada y Asociados, S.C. Their
most recent opinion, on the 1983 financial statements, was qualified because
of various accounting deficiencies. Adequate corrective measures are
underway and are being properly executed. A new firm (Salles, Sainz y Cia.
S.C.) has been appointed by the government for phase II in accordance with a
rotation policy established by the Contraloria General de la Federacion. A
recent Bank mission has agreed with CONALEP and the new firm of auditors on
the steps that would ensure that the proposed project's auditing procedures
would be consistent with Bank guidelines, with the norms of the Contraloria
and in accordance with sound auditing practices. CONALEP agreed that reports
on its financial statements by independent arA qualified auditors would be
submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the close of each fiscal
year.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.21      Monitoring.  Efficient monitoring and careful supervision of
project implementation is essential. Monitoring and evaluation of training
processes are described in Annex 3 (paras. 10-11). Monitoring indicators to
assess the progress of the CONALEP phase II program are described in Annex
8. As civil works would be the responsibility of CAPFCE, its architects
would supervise the design and construction of all buildings; CONALEP's
architects would closely monitor progress on both design and construction.
Equipment and furniture procurement and installation would be the immediate
responsibility of the Directorate of Procurement, but would also be closely
monitored by the Directorate of Buildings and Equipment. A well-designed
checklist for use in monitoring implementation of the building, furnishing
and equipping of each institution has been developed and is in use by
CONALEP.
4.22      Evaluation.  The Directorate of Administration would coordinate the
activities of the Directorates of Student Evaluation and Certification,



- 26 -
Buildings and Equipment, Procurement, Planning and Operations in the
evaluation oL project implementation and its impact on the training system
and socioeconomic development. This executive coordinating group would be
assisted aL'I advised by the industrial advisory committees. PreliminarY
results show that, under the fli-st project, CONALEP's National Directorate of
Evaluation and Certification developed an effective system for student
evaluation and control.
V. BENEFITS AIND RISKS
Benefits
5.01      The proposed project would greatly strengthen technical training at
the middle level. First, the proposed project would further contribute to
the institutional development of CONALEP by providing specialist assistance,
internships, and short study tours abroad for its key pLanning,
administrative, evaluation, and placement personnel. Second, the proposed
project would enhance the quality of training by (a) providing the necessary
equipment, (b) emphasizing the practical aspects of training, (c) enhancing
CONALEP's instructor training capability, (d) expanding and improving the
production of instructional materials, (e) creating a maintenance system for
buildings and equipment, and (f) introducing a partial cost recovery system
for consumable supplies by promoting production of saleable products or
services as part of its practical training activities. The project would
also continue to seek reductions in recurrent expenditures through more
efficient scaling of training centers. The CONALEP program emphasizes
evaluation and follow-up, for which a special directorate has been created.
An active industrial advisory system at the national and local levels would
help ensure the continuing relevance of the training programs. Third, the
additional output of skilled and technical workers from approximately 97 new
training centers would help reduce the wide gap between supply of and demand
for skilled labor. Finally, CONALLEP Is success would have a beneficial effect
on the quality and effectiveness and, hence, eventually on the prestige of
the other upper-middle technical training programs.
5.02      The major quantifiable benefits of the program, when fully
operational in 1990-91 would be approximate annual increases of (a) 21,580
skilled workers and lower level technicians (of which 30% are expected to be
women), (b) 1,500 technical teachers, and (c) highly specialized skills
upgrading for about 16,180 employed workers and technicians. Assuming that
CONALEP and other formal training programs could increase their total annual
output to about 75,000 skilled workers and technicians by 1990, these
graduates would represent only about 8% of the new job seekers (2.6%
technicians, 5.4% skilled workers). Upgrading of the labor force would still
require the support of additional programs.
Risks
5.03      The proposed loan entails some degree of risk, especially regarding
problems encountered in the recruitment of part-time instructors during peak
production hours. The ability of CONALEP to pay competitive salaries should
diminish the problem of teacher recruitment. Additionally, experience gained



- 27 -
during phase I has laid down a good base for dealing with this problem. A
favorable student/teacher ratio and well-equipped facilities are expected to
reduce the dropout rate, and result in an appropriate level of student
retention (73% over three years by the time the schools are fully
operational). CONALEP intends to monitor instructor and student retention
closely, and to increase the internal efficiency of regular program from 48Z
in 1982 to about 802 by 1988. Another risk is that the expected benefits of
the production units might not materialize. Yet, CONALEP has demonstrated an
excellent capacity to implement innovations, and the project would be
financing feasibility studies prior to each decision in order to minimize
this risk. On balance, the project benefits greatly outweigh the risks,
which are manageable.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, the Government, NAFINSA and CONALEP provided
assurances that:
(a) A provisional maintenance system would be implemented on a trial
basis by September 30, 1985, and that a revised version of it would
be developed and sent to the Bank by December 31, 1986; the new
version would replace the provisional system by March 31, 1987
(para. 3.10).
Cb) The selection of training centers to be financed under the project
would be in accordance with the agreed criteria (para. 3.12).
6.02      By December 31, 1985, CONALEP would prepare and discuss with the
Bank a transitional program (Annex 4(d)) identifying the existing centers
that do not meet the agreed criteria and a specific timetable on the actions
to be taken to correct existing deficiencies. This program would be applied
to all phase I and phase II centers and implemented, with the necessary
adjustments to meet local and regional circumstances, during the period
1986-88.
6.03      Up to US$7.0 million of retroactive financing would be made
available for equipment and technical assistance expenditures incurred after
January 1, 1985 (para. 4.08).
6.04      A Special Account would be established in US dollars by NAFINSA.
The Bank would deposit an initial amount of US$8.0 million into the Special
Account upon the request of NAFINSA (para. 4.11).
6.05      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to the Government of Mexico for US$81.0
million equivalent, with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of
three years.

SECOND TECHNICAL TRAINING PROJECT
THE CONALEP TECHNICAL TRAINING PROGRAM
Introduction
1.        By the late 1970s, it was evident that the upper-middle level
technical training system was inadequate to deliver the quantity and quality
of skilled workers and technicians required by the rapidly developing and
changing economy. Moreover, there were poor prospects for meeting these
requirements by expanding the traditional system. Therefore, Mexico
concluded that it would be desirable to create a new, independent program to
provide terminal training for a substantial number of skilled workers and
middle level technicians. Given the size of the task, it was conceived as a
two phase effort: the first phase would create a new program, test its major
components and initiate its development; assuming success, the second phase
would complete its development and make all adjustments necessary to
implement the full program. As a result, the President of the Republic
issued a decree in late 1978 creating a decentralized, semiautonomous public
agency, CONALEP. a/ The government requested and received Bank assistance
(Loan 2042-ME) for the rapid development of this institution. Phase I has
been so successful that the new government decided to proceed with phase II,
and has targetted CONALEP to capture and retain 60% of all students in
upper-middle level terminal training, which would more than double the
program's size to encompass 240,000 students and graduate close to 60,000
students in regular programs.bf It would also upgrade the skills of about
43,000 workers annually by 1990.
2.       Administration.  The CONALEP training program is administered at
both central and local levels. At the central level, the Board of Governors
determires policy. This Board is comprised of seven business and industrial
leaders who are appointed by the Minister of Education to serve staggered
terms. The President of the Republic appoints the Director General of
CONALEP, who also chairs the Board. The Director General, who is the chief
administrative officer of CONALEP, can serve a maximum of two, four year
terms and is assisted by the eight departmental directors, who are in charge
a/ In 1980, the government took another important step by making it
mandatory for employers to provide on-the-job and in service training,
either directly or through general training registered with the Ministry
of Labor and Social Welfare. CONALEP met the registration requirement in
1981 and, recently, has been providing training or retraining for about
34,000 adults under a contract with the Ministry of Labar.
b/ Recent budget revisions, however, have reduced the scope of the phase II
expansion to a total of only 200,000 students, equivalent to 48,000
graduates from regular programs (para. 3.02 - 3.07).

of planning, academic operations and teacher training, buildings and
equipment, evaluation and certifi.:ation, administration and finance, legal
affairs, promotion and external relations, and equipment procurement (see
Organizational Chart). Each directorate, with minor exceptions, is well
staffed with qualified and experienced staff and support personnel.
3.        At the local level, the director of each training center is the
chief administrative officer. A committee comprised of local and regional
business and industry personnel, and representatives of instructional staff
and students, advises the director on training matters. Each center director
is assisted by coordinators of training programs and administrative services.
4.        The CONALEP program is well publicized through radio, television,
national and local newspapers, public information booths in the larger
cities, and high quality brochures. This promotion campaign has been
successfully directed towards business, industry, parents, potential students
and the general public. It emphasizes the important role of skilled workers
and technicians in economic and social development, describes the CONALEP
training program (including details of selected courses), employment
opportunities, the job placement system, and where and how to go about
enrolling.  It is estimated that about 80% of CONALEP's students are
recruited as a result of this multimedia campaign. The substantial
assistance CONALEP receives from business and industry also indicates the
success of this innovative procedure for improving the public image of
technical training.
5.        Training Programs and Enrollments.  CONALEP has developed 97
regular training programs, primarily for the manufacturing and services
sectors (Table A.). These programs, which have a duration of three years,
are carried out in centers dispersed throughout the country. The enrollment
capacity, programs of study and location of centers were determined on the
basis of national, regional and local development plans and well-designed
criteria. Enrollment is open to qualified students who have completed
grade 9. Regular training programs operate at the centers "a two daily
shifts of six hours each (07:00-13:00 and 16:00-22:00 hours:. for five days
per week. The hours of 13:00-16:00 are normally reserved frA upgrading
programs. The evening shift and Saturdays are used for either programs when
demand exceeds regular cpacity. The upgrading program is open to employed
youth and adults who have the equivalent of at least six years of basic
education. Current enrollment capacity for regular and upgrading programs,
both day and evening shifts, totals about 110,000.

stidents that have been developed in five broad fields with supporting
curricula and course materials, there are another 82 training programs,
ranging from 40-250 hours each, for upgrading the skills of the existing
workforce. Instructors and the advisory members from local industry adapt
the basic course syllabi to regional requirements. The resulting curricula
and course syllabi are well balanced: on average, program time is distributed
so that 20Z is used for general theory, 20% for technical theory and 60% for
technical practice.
7.         Instructor Characteristics and Preparation.  Experienced and fully
qualified instru-ctors teach all general subjects. Technicians and practical
engineers, having at least five years of industrial experience, are recruited
on a part-time basis (10-14 hours/week) to teach the technical theory and
technical practice classes. They receive a significantly higher hourly wage
than those who teach in other programs under the Ministry of Education.
Local industry has cooperated by making the industrially qualified
instructors avail,hle. Pedagogical preparation of these instructors is
carried out by CUNALEP through its own teacher training unit. Qualified and
experienced professional teacher trainers comprise the training unit and are
assisted by qualified part-time trainers.

8.         The instructor training program consists of both regularly
scheduled pre-service courses and ad hoc in-service courses. In special
lnstances, programmed learning courses are offered by correspondence. The
pre-service courses consist of 56 hours of pedagogical preparation, including
14 hours of practice teaching, and are conducted either in CONALEP's central
facilities or, at the regional level, in local training centers and local
university teacher training centers. The minimum in-service training
consists of 64 hours of human relations, instructional methodology, modular
curriculum preparation, and shop work organization and management.
Additional in-service course work of up to 130 hours is provided for
upgrading specialized technical skills. The curricula and course syllabi for*
the instructor training courses have been developed according to modern
pedagogical practice and, except for adapting them to special local
requirements, are ready for the instructors' use; a fact which aids in the
recruitment of qualified instructors.
9.         About 9,200 instructors were employed during 1984/85 in the 122
first phase training centers, which are now all fully or partially
operational. About 1,500 new instructors will be trained during the 1984/85
academic year to teach in 1985/86.
10.        Operetional Performance Evaluation.  Student and instructor
evaluation and feedback are joint functions of the local training centers and
the National Directorate of Evaluation and Certification. This directorate
has a well-qualified staff consisting of 22 professionals and an adequate
number of support personnel. It has developed a series of well-designed and
execated instruments for evaluating instructor and student performance.
Evaluation of instructors includes formal self-evaluation. as well as
evaluation by both students and supervisors. The National Directorate also
assists the local centers in the proper use and evaluation of the various
instruments and processes, and in integrating the changes suggested by
feedback into the curricula and the teaching/learning process. The results
of these assessments are given not only to local instructors, but also to the
subject-matter specialists at the national level, so that curricula, course
syllabi, and overall performance may be improved in the centers.
A large proportion of CONALEP applicants have finished their lower-middle
level studies two to four years before enrolling in the CONALEP system, and
thus require remedial work in basic studies. In view of this, all new
regular students are tested and, if required, undergo four weeks of remedial
studies before the regular term begins. This has significantly reduced the
high level of dropouts that were typical furing CONALEP's early years of
operation.
11.       Placement and Follow-up of Graduates.  Each training center, with
the assistance of its local industrial advisory committee, has the
responsibility of providing job placement and of assessing the relevance of
training as measured by job performance. Since CONALEP has graduated only a
couple of cohorts and these only from the few initial centers, the placement
system is untested on a large scale. However, after a short period of



- 35
AINEX 3
Page 5 of 9
on-the-job orientation and training, graduates are expected to be able to
perform as medium level skilled workers or as middle to lower level
technicians. Many of them sbould be able to advance to the level of bighly
skilled worker and medium level technician after tbree to five years on the
job. Because recruitment of skilled labor is of critical importance for
industry, local industrial advisory committees are expected to diligently
pursue the development of a strong placement and follow-up system at the
local level. The National Directorate of Evaluation and Certification would
provide advice and the necessary instruments for the systematic evaluation of
graduate placement and performance.
Financing
12.       The Federal Government allocation for the recurrent expenditures of
CONALEP during 1984 was Mex$11,000 million (US$63.6 millUon), or about 1.6Z
of the total budget of the Mini3try of Education and Culture. In addition to
federal funds, COXNALEP is empowered to sign contracts and to receive
contributions from the productive sector. CONALEP has made very good use of
this capability, making contractual agreements with state governments, other
branches of the federal government, and various industries. Total
contributions and contracts from 1979 tbhcugh 1984 anmounted to an equivalent
of Mex$655 million (US$4.8 million) at 1984 prices. Most of these
contributions were in kind: i.e., construction sites, rent free or donated
buildings and specialized equipment.  FinAlly, CONALEP's students also pay
tuition and may commit themselves to a deferred payment plan upon graduation
and employment. Student revenues amounted to Mex$510 mllion (about US$3.0
million) in 1984. In addition to the financial effect, these payments and
commitments seem to have a positive motivational effect on students. In some
cases, employers pay 0ONAIEP the deferred tuition. The National Directorate
of Financing and Administration is currently reviewing CONALEP's long term
policy regarding tuition fees.
13.       CONALEP 's recurrent costs per student are reasonable in comparison
to other technical programs. Unit costs were US$876 per student in 1984. In
1985, unit costs for a typical 800 student training center are estimated at
Mex$168,800, or US$823 equivalent in US dollars of January 1985. While
technical training unit costs vary widely in Mexico, the recurrent unit costs
for other upper-middle level technical training programs in 1983 ranged from
US$650 per student year in the CETs to US$1,250 per student per year in the
Centers for Scientific and Technological Studies in Maritime Sciences.
Assessment of Strengths and Weaknesses
14.       Strengths.  Despite its relatively short existence, the CONALEP
technical training program has been abie to develop several strengths: it has
a sound basis, appropriately addresses the issues of the subsector, is well
designed and is being implemented rapidly. Among its more important
strengths are:



-36-                             ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 9
(a) a well organized and well staffed administration, with a clear and
appropriate division of authority and responsibility between the
national and local administrative levels;
(b) the practical orientation of its curriculum which is terminal
in nature and kept relevant to local, regional and national needs
through inputs from industrial advisory groups at national and
local levels;
(c) the use of industrially experienced and pedagogically qualified
instructors; and
(d) a highly successful promotional program resulting in contributions
from industry and state governments and in a number of applications
from qualified students which greatly exceeds its annual capacity.
15.       Weaknesses.  The CONALEP program still has a number of deficiencies
which must be addressed, although these deficiencies are understandable given
its short existence. Expansion of the program is proceeding at a rapid pace,
but the output is still insufficient to end the shortage of skilled workers
and technicians. Besides, several schools are currently out-of-phase with
other aspects of a successful program.  Among CONALEP's most salient current
deficiencies are:
Ca) Low retention rate. During the first years of the program's
operation (1979-82) overall retention was 38Z; currently this has
been improved to 48.4Z, but needs to be improved further. A major
contributing factor to the relatively high dropout rate in 1980
was the strong industrial demand for employees with even minimal
levels of skills training.c/ The lack of sufficient and
appropriate equipment, and the temporary nature of existing
workshops, were also contributing factors. These latter factors
are being corrected but there still are centers (about 48 not
included in Loan 2042-nE and waiting for phase II financing) that
operate without equipment and in temporary structures. Retention
rates will be adversely affected to some extent until such
anomalies cease to exist. Further improvements are expected to
occur when student placement has been tested and evaluated on a
large scale, the expectation is that the anticipated positive
results would also contribute to higher student retention rates.
(b)  Insufficient capacity.  Assuming a retention improvement to 8M,
the expected output from 122 phase I centers would be about 29,000
students from the regular programs; this is only about one
c7 This factor must be deemed inevitable to a certain extent, and likely to
recur following a cyclical pattern. CONALEP's response should not be to
try, in vain, to ste. this drain when it occurs in response to demand,
but rather to decign inservice training programs to upgrade the skills of
dropouts over time.



-37-                          ANNEX 3
Page 7 of 9
fourth of total annual needs for new labor force entrants. Even if
all the other programs combined were to improve their performance
to produce a like number of entrants, CONALEP would still need to
double its current capacity in phase II to respond effectively to
the national demand for skilled workers and technicians.
(c)  Potential instructor shortages.   Morning shift classes conflict
with peak production hours, making it difficult to recruit
instructors from industry. Plans should be made to avoid expected
shortages and difficulties as economic demand (and therefore
production) increases during the last part of the 1980s.
(d) Lack of systems for maintenance and innovation. No formal
structure yet exists to provide building and equipment maintenance
and explore other possible cost reduction alternatives.
(e) Project/nonproject centers. An artificial and undesirable
distinction between "project" and "nonproject' centers has
developed. This is because phase I centers, developed with Bank
assistance, are fully equipped, whereas the new centers,
established in anticipation of phase II with the same criteria and
standards, are ill equipped and lack adequate capital financing.
16.       CONALEP's development plan is now entering the second phase.  The
broad dimensions of the first and second phases are as follows:

i/ Revised as of April, 1985.
17.       The phase I program is nearing completion and will be fully
implemented by June 1985. Planning for phase II is well advanced: civil
works for 8 centers have been comDleted, although equipment is lacking, and
the construction of another 40 training centers is already underway. The top
priority of phase I was to establish a firm, tangible base for the effective
management of the system. This has been fully accomplished; a central
administrative and support complex has been established to bring together
CONALEP's physically dispersed directorates and its instructor training,
teaching materials development, information and documentation activities.
The establishment of this complex has enabled CONALEP to improve its
administrative efficiency significantly, assure better communications and
coordination of program development, expand and improve its teacher training
activities, and enhance its production of teaching materials.



-38-                      ANNEX 3
Page 8 of 9
18.       Another priority in phase I was to build and equip all the 122
centers. The building, furnishing, and equipping have been completed,
thereby providing a total capacity of about 110,000 students. The locations
of these training centers throughout the country were determined in
accordance with the need for training opportunities and the expected skilled
labor demand. Despite some minor instructor recruitment difficulties at the
beginning, CONALEP has succeeded in recruiting and training the equivalent of
the 9,200 instructors required for phase I.
19.       The plans for phase II (1985-88) are expected to require capital
outlays of about US$162.2 million. This total includes a US$4.2 million
equivalent of in-kind donations. Approximately US$9.3 million, or 5.7% are
sunk costs - i.e., construction expenditures incurred prior to December 31,
1984.

New Criteria for Determining the Location and Size
of Training Centers and of Tr4ining Programs
The criteria agreed upon between the Bank and CONALEP for purposes
of selecting the training centers included in Part A of the Project and which
are to be taken into account for determining the location, training program
and size of such centers, are the following:
(a) Economic Relevance Criteria.  New training programs would be
established on the basis of the following factors:
(i)  Economic Demand: Proposals for the establishment of new
training programs, or for additions or rotation of existing
ones, should be based on the analysis of the relationship
between national, regional and local trained labor
requirements the output from current training programs and
appropriate consultations with public and private enterprises
and municipalities.
(ii)  Gainful Employment:  The establishment of a center in a
location where sustained and relevant employment opportunities
exist should have priority over a location where local
employment opportunities do not exist, except where very
compelling social factors are involved.
Cb) Feasibility Criteria. The feasibility analysis would include the
following socioeconomic factors:
i)  Social Demand and Geographical Distribution: Proposals for the
establishment of a center in a given location should include
the availability of sufficient number of ninth grade graduates
in the center's area of influence and a relative lack of
appropriate training opportunities beyond that grade in the
proposed area.
(ii)  Instructor Availability: The proposal should also determine
whether a sufficient number of potential instructors are
available locally for the training specialties to be offered;
otherwise, it should include specific recommendations on
recruiting and retaining the required teachers.



-41-                       'NEX 4
page 2 of 3
(iii) Cooperation of the Productive Sector: the explicit interest of
local authorities and leaders of the productive sector is a
determining factor iB the success of training programs. Thus,
willingness to offer construction sites, buildings, equipment,
practical release of iastructors, or lead any or-her physical
or moral assistance would be Important factors in deciding on
the establishment of sew centers and training programs;
(c) Economic Efficiency Criteria. In addition to the above criteria
the analysis would include the following efficiency factors:
{i) Economic Size: Proposals for opeaing or expanding training
centers with less than 600 students should specify that
per-student recurrent costs would not be unreasonably high.
CONALEP's Board would fix the maximum ratio acceptable in
relation to CONALEP's average unit costs;
(ii) Minimum Class Size: CONALEP should establish the miaimum
number of students needed to run a program or a training
course economically. It should inquire periodically about the
centers' compliance with this criterion and elicit remedial
actions to avoid excessive unit costs resulting from the
operation of very small classes;
(iii)  Other Efficieacy Alternatives: Training unit costs in certaia
instaaces could also be reduced by establishing shorter
training courses and by expanding existiag centers to provide
ad hoc training activities as are needed by the local
productive sector. The establishment of centers in
municipalities or service areas with small populations (e.g.
less than about 50,000) would require initial and periodic
adjustments to obtain aad maintain adequate efficieacies.
Such adjustments could include offeriag more types of programs
with smaller (but still efficient) numbers enrolled in each,
rotation of programs, with other schools with insufficient
demand for permanent programs, and establishment of a system
of 'feeder schools'-i.e. having centers with a one year basic
training core program feeding into other schools offering
advaace traiaing programs relevant to both iccal and regional
development. CONALEP would periodically review these
alternatives.
(d)  Trasmitional Criteria.  Project files contain a list of the 181
centers that would be, or are, partially operational ia January
1985 and in accordaace with the above feasibility criteria,
iacluding agreemeats made with local authorities and the productive
sector. These 181 centers include 16 centers with less than 400
students ia-two shifts. For the purpose of the preseat project:



-42-
ANNEX 4
pege3of 3
(i)  the traigiag ceaters with 400 students or less could be
cossolidated iato larger, more economically efficient umits,
as lo-g as the total capacity of the project is maistained at
90,000 studeuts, i.cluding both regular and zoaregular
program, and sew locatios ueet all the above criteria; and
(ii)  a trassitioAal program (1986-88) would ideutify ceuters which
do sot meet the criteria aid fiad meass which would trawsform
then iAto more economically efficieat units.
The Board of Governors of CONALEP will decide on the
establishment of sew training centers based os the recommiadations of ax
em.ecutive committee chaired by CDNALEP's Director General which shall review
ox a case by case basis the fulfillment of the criteria set forth above.

a!  The map shows the regional distribution of 130 phase II centers, instead
of 97 centers. The appraisal mission reviewed and endorsed in November
1985, the government plan for CONALEP's expansion of up to 130 centers,
equivalent to an increase of 130,000 students. Austerity measures
adopted in April 1985, reduced the project scope during negotiations to
97 centers, equivalent to about 90,000 additional students (para. 3.02 -
3.07).
