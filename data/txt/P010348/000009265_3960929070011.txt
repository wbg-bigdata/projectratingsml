MEMORANDUM AND RECOHMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTCRS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A BHAIRAWA LUMBINI GROUNDWATER IRRIGATION III PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for SDR 36.6 million (US$47.2
million) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms, with 40 years maturity, and would hlelp finance the Bhairawa Lumbini
Groundwater Irrigation III Project.
2.       Background.  With farm production and related activities comprising
more than 60 percent of GDP and engaging about 90 percent of the labor force,
agriculture is the dominant element in Nepal's economic development.
Irrigation development is critical to Nepal's future agricultural growth, and
both His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN) and IDA place a high priority on
expansion and improvement of irrigation. The Government's current irrigation
policy emphasizes completion of ongoing schemes and new projects with short
gestation periods and high rates of return, such as grcundwater development by
tubewells. Recent government policy initiatives, with full IDA support, have
added a focus on irrigation sector lending development based on (a) a
'program approach in contrast to the traditional project aprroach,
(b) promotion of farmer participation and farmer-managed irrigation schemes,
(c) strengthening of WI to prepare for and implement the sector program
approach and farmer participation on a nationwide basis, and (d) close
Government and donor coordination to assure uniformity of support for the
program.
3.        IDA has supported nine major irrigation projects in Nepal of which
four, including the Bhairawa Lumbini Groundwater Irrigation II Project
(Cr. 1316-NEP, closing date October 31, 1990), are ongoing. The latter is
among IDA's most successful irrigation projects in the country. A major
lesson from past IDA-financeu irrigation projects is the need for more active
farmer participation. This was emphasized in the Project Performance Audit
Report (Report No. 5261) for the first Bhairawa Lumbini Groundwater Irrigation
Project (Cr. 654-NEP), along with the need for proper operation and
maintenance of deep tubewells. IDA is also the executing agency for two UNDP-
financed projects. Of these, the Irrigation Sector Support Project is
designed to develop DOI's capacity to plan and manage the sector program in
preparation for a possible IDA-financed Irrigation Sector Project. The
recently completed Irrigation Master Plan, also funded by UNDP and executed by
the Bank, provides a sectoral investment strategy to implement sectoral
policies, including the sector program. The Bank's recent Agricultural Sector
Review for Nepal examined the sectoral strategy in the context of the
country's overall agricultural program and recommended, inter alia, that
groundwater development be given a high priority over the next decade.
4.       Rationale for IDA involvement.  IDA has been instrumental in
increasing government emphasis on quick yielding irrigation investments such
as groundwater, promoting technical innovation in groundwater irrigation. and
shifting from supply-side to demand-oriented irrigation development based on
close involvement of farmers. IDA has also played a primary leadership role



- 2 -
in helping design and establish the Government's new irrigation sector program
policy and strategy based on direct farmer group participation and
responsibility. Although the principle of farmer participation is now stated
government policy, many DOI staff have yet to become part of the new
institutional consciousness, and continued IDA support will be required to
ensure that these changes become irreversible and accepted as part of DOI's
institu:tional culture.
5.        IDA support is needed specifically to further extend and enhance the
technical innovations for deep tubewells developed with IDA assistance under
the ongoing Bhairawa Lumbini Groundwater Irrigation Project (Stages I and I),
and to assist in privatization of the Bhairawa Lumbini deep tubewell (DTW)
technology model. That model, although successful, has been based on
extensive public sector involvement. The proposed IDA project would help
develop and install a more sustainable model based on increased farmer group
participation and responsibility for DTW management, operation, and
maintenance. In addition, IDA support is also needed to further develop the
sector program model which was initiated as a pilot project component under
the ongoing IDA-financed Mahakali Irrigation II Project (Cr. 1924-NEP).
6.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to raise agricultural production and farm incomes through expansion of
irrigated area; (b) to promote privatization and farmer participation in
irrigation development to reduce Government costs and improve operation and
maintenance of irrigation schemes; and (c) to strengthen irrigation
institutions, particularly DOI, as needed to implement HHGN's new sector
program approach to irrigation.
Project Description.  The proposed project consists of:  (a) Stage
III of the ongoing Bhairawa Lumbini Groundwater Project, which would include
construction of 73 new DTWs serving some 8,600 ha of net command in the Stage
III area, completion works for 16 Stage II DTWs, and modification of 64 Stage
I DTWs to accommodate farmer management; (b) expansion of the irrigation line
of credit' (ILC) pilot project started under Mahakali II to include additional
pilot subprojects in the Western, Mid Western and Far Western Regions; and
(c) institutional development support for DOI which would, inter alia,
strengthen DOI district and regional offices, support development of DOI's new
Planning, Design and Research Division, strengthen DOI internal administration
and management functions, and support a farmer participatory joint management
pilot program in selected DOI schemes. Under the ILC component, prospective
subprojects would be selected and eligible expenditures financed according to
agreed criteria and procedures until the IDA funds under the "line of credit'
were exhausted. The proposed credit would finance the Government's
contribution to subproject costs.
8.        The project would be implemented over eight years.  Estimated
project costs total US$52.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$24.8 million (47 percent). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement,
disbursements and the projected disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank operations
in Nepal are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing project
areas is also attached (IBRD 22124). The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8411-NEP
dated May 7, 1990, is being distributed separately.



- 3 -
9.       Agreed Actions.  Conditions of credit effectiveness are that the
Government would: (a) appoint an international project consultant firm for
Bhairawa Lumbini Stage III; (b) establish in the Bhairawa Lumbini Project a
suitable Farmer Organization Unit; and (c) establish a suitable ILC
Groundwater Unit and prepare its terms of reference satisfactory to IDA.
Conditions of disbursement for ILC subprojec;s aret (a) establishment of the
concerned Regional Appraisal Committees; and (b) approval by the Ministry of
Water Resources for each subproject or cluster of subprojects exceeding
NRs 1.0 million in cost, and by the DOI Director General for all other
subprojects. In addition, the Government has also agreed tot (a) implement
plans to constitute statutory Water User Associations at Bhairawa Lumbini
DTWs; (b) achieve full recovery of operation and maintenance costs at Bhairawa
Lumbini; (c) select, prepare, approve and implement ILC subprojects according
to principles and criteria agreed with IDA; (d) ensure uniformity of approach
for all irrigation schemes of the type financed under ILC; (e) ensure that the
concerned DOI regional, district and field offices meet agreed prequali-
fication criteria; and (f) establish an Irrigation Management Division in DOI.
10.       Benefits.  The economic rate of return (ERR) for the Bhairawa
Lumbini Stage III component of the project is 24 percent. The ILC expansion
component was excluded from the project ERR calculation bpcause it is a pilot
project and most of the specific subprojects to be financed would be
identified and selected only after project implementation begins. However,
estimated ERRs for representative ILC subproject models average 24 percent and
range from 18-35 percent. The Bhairawa Lumbini Stage III component would
generate incremental food production valued at some NRs 280 million (US$9.6
million) annually at full development, and would create about 700,000 person-
days of incremental on-farm employment annually. In addition, availability of
safe drinking water at project tubewells would improve the health of the
population of the project area and would reduce drudgery for women who often
have to carry drinking water from long distances. The ILC pilot project
expansion would assist farmer-managed schemes that are individually too small
for normal project funding by a donor. Benefits of ILC Investments would
therefore reach some of the country's poorest areas not normally covered by
donor-assisted projects, and would increase agricultural output, food
availability, and on-farm employment for the farm families involved. Benefits
of the Institutional Development Support component would include improved
administrative, management and implementation capacity in DOI, and
establishment of an effective farmer organization program within the agency.
All components of the project would promote local initiative and
participation, and slupport privatization and farmer management of irrigation.
11.       Env-ronmental Impact.  The project is not expected to have an
adverse environmental impact.  For the Bhairawa Lumbini component, groundwater
recharge appears fully adequate to support the developments proposed, and
drainage facilities would be installed simultaneously with the irrigation
systems to control potential water logging. Preparation of each Irrigation
Line of Credit pilot subproject would include an environmental assessment and
recommendations for appropriate environmental protection measures to be
carried out during implementation. An ecological benefit of the proposed
subprojects is the substitution of permanent headworks for traditional
brushwood and cobble structures. Presently, the latter are frequently
destroyed in annual floods, and their rebuilding requires brushwood and small
trees, often in large quantities, with consequent cutting of secondary forest
growth in nearby areas.



-4-
12.      Risks.  Project risks are moderate.  They concern mainly:
(a) institutional capacity of the Department of Irrigation to implement
Bhairawa Lumbini Stage III following sector program principles, in particular,
with regard to farmer participation; and (b) the impact of the trade and
transit impasse, mainly with regard to fuel supplies. Item (a) has been dealt
with in project design by requiring DOI to form a farmer organization unit in
the Bhairawa Lumbini Project Authority, and by making establishment by farmers
of a statutory Water User Association a prerequisite for consttzction of each
DTW. With regard to item (b), it is understood that steps to resolve the
issue are now under way. The net impact of these risks, if unabated, would be
mainly to slow implementation.
.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
