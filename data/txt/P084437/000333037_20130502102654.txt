  A. SUMMARY

1.      This restructuring is to: (a) extend the closing date (as a first extension) by one
year from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014; this will allow sufficient time for
the project to complete the latest pilots, carry out evaluations of the new pilots, and
disseminate and roll out to non-piloting areas; (b) remove the reference of National
Validation Panel (NPV) in the Loan Agreement [Schedule II.1.(b) (iii)], and replace it
with the National Expert Panel (NEP) as the NEP has been carrying out this function over
the course of the project; and (c) revise the definition of indicator 17 to better align and
assess the progress of implementation on the ground.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The China Rural Health Project was approved on June 24, 2008, signed on
October 8, 2008, and became effective on December 31, 2008. The original (and current)
closing date is December 31, 2013. The Project, from a US$50 million Loan, was also
co-financed by a DFID Grant (TF092893) of approximately US$5.9 million, which
closed on March 31, 2011. The Project was designed to pilot the reform in eight project
provinces and 40 project counties to promote innovations, building capacity and inform
the government on its ongoing health system reform. The project has been progressing
well toward achieving the project objective. The overall disbursement is ahead of
schedule despite that the new procurement of equipment has not yet started, which
indicates intensive activities on piloting reforms and innovations. The loan has disbursed
77.5 percentage of March 10, 2013. Progress toward achievement of development
objectives and overall implementation progress is on track and rated “Satisfactory?.

  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

3.     Closing date. The closing date will be extended from December 31, 2013 to
December 31, 2014. This is a first extension. The project was designed to support the
government ongoing health system reform. The project innovations and pilots need to be
closely linked with the priorities of national health reform and therefore are being
designed and initiated based on the reform agenda. The extension would allow sufficient
time for the newly launched pilots to be fully implemented, undertake the necessary
evaluations to assess the impact of project innovation, and disseminate the lessons
learned to non-project areas.

4.      Institutional arrangements. It is indicated in Section 1 paragraph 1 (b) （iii）
of Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement that “a National Validation Panel will be
established to be responsible for monitoring and evaluating the progress of sub-projects.?
The panel was never established and the function has instead been undertaken by the
National Expert Panel (NEP). Therefore, reference to the establishment and maintenance
                                            1
of the National Validation Panel should be removed and the function changed to the
National Expert Panel under Section 1 paragraph 1 (b) （ii） of Schedule 2. Please see
attached Amendment to the Loan Agreement.

5.      Results/indicators. To revise the definition of indicator 17 from “% of villages
that meet ‘healthy village’ standards? to “Number of administrative villages that have
initiated the implementation of ‘healthy village’?. The reason for this revision is that the
criteria of “healthy village? are very comprehensive and multi-dimensional which
requires joint efforts across multiple sectors at various government levels. Some of the
indicators are far beyond the control of the project (for example, rural village road
construction and hardening, tap water supply). The project counties, especially the poor
counties, found it impossible to meet the standards under the scope of the project. The
revised indicator will allow the counties to continue implementing the activities that are
feasible within the local context. The updated monitoring indicator table with baseline
and target values is attached as Annex 1.

6.      An implementation plan has been formulated for the remaining life of the project
including the extension period for the eight project provinces and for the Center for
Project Supervision and Management of MoH (CPSM). An estimated disbursement
schedule is also provided by the government. Both central CPSM and the Provincial
Project Management Offices (PPMOs) will enhance their guidance and supervision to the
project counties, closely monitoring the implementation and disbursement progress and
ensure the project complete its activities by December 31, 2014. The implementation plan
and the estimated disbursement schedule are attached as Annex 2.

7.      Safeguards: OP4.01 Environmental Assessment was triggered at project inception
and assigned a Category B. A Medical Waste Management Plan (EMP) was developed as
part of the Project Operations Manual (OM) and the implementation was rated
‘satisfactory’. There are no outstanding environmental issues under implementation. With
regard to two triggered social safeguard policies - OP4.12 Involuntary Resettlement and
OP4.10 Indigenous People, the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and Indigenous
People Planning Framework were developed during project preparation and there were
no outstanding issues found during supervision. The proposed changes do not affect the
safeguard category and there are no any new safeguard issues to be raised.

8.     The restructuring makes no change to the project’s Development Objectives.

9.      This will be the third restructuring for this project. The first one was dated on
March 29, 2011 for the reallocation of loan proceeds. The second was dated July 30,
2011 under which a single category per Province/Municipality was created and
reallocation of proceeds was undertaken.

Action Plan for Extension of WB/DFID China Rural Health Project
(Provided by the government)

By the end of September 2012, the central and provincial progress reports of
WB/DFID China Rural Health Project (RHP) showed that the project accumulative
total expenditure amounted to 236,332,000 yuan, accounting for 60.62% of the total
planned loan of the project. 5 project provinces (municipality), namely, Shaanxi,
Gansu, Henan, Chongqing and Qinghai, had completed over 60%, and 3 project
provinces less than 50%.

After consulting with RHP provinces and in order to achieve project objectives
smoothly and ensure project quality and effect, an extension application is hereby
proposed. The action plan for the extension is as follows:

I. Extension Rationale

(I) National health reform tasks are clearly stated, the RHP innovative pilots
should be more targeted accordingly to achieve project objectives.
In early 2012, the State Council issued the program to deepen the health reform for
the 12th five year plan as the implementation scheme, which requires to speed up the
coverage of health protection for all, to strengthen the basic drug mechanism with
new implementation system for primary health care institutions, and to facilitate the
public hospital reform.

On the basis of the national health reform request, most of the RHP provinces and
counties have started to design new exploration pilots around the above-mentioned
three focus areas. Although majority of these has been put into implementation, it is
still take some time to evaluate the running effect.

(II) The effect of innovative activities needs further evaluation, and experience
replication still needs some time.
All project innovative activities followed the designed principle of pilot exploration,
summarization of experience, improvement and stepwise replication. Many provinces
began to summarize the innovative experiences and started replication gradually from
2011 to 2012, and some time would need to achieve certain scope of replication.

Meanwhile, quite a number of innovative pilot activities were adjusted in line with the
progress of the national health reform, the time for such an exploration was not long
and the effects were yet to be summarized and evaluated, thus project objectives
remained to be achieved through further expansion of the pilot. A one-year extension
would be conducive to ensuring the continuity of innovative experience replication
and reliability of the effect evaluation.

                                          7
(III) The overall disbursement rate of project loan is beyond the expectation, the
remaining fund is difficult to be fully spent before the current closing date.
By the end of September 2012, the project disbursed a total of $22,538,200 from the
World Bank, accounting for 45% of the total planned loan, with 55% remain
undisbursed. According to the present progress and trend, it is unlikely to complete
project fund disbursement and reimbursement by December 31st, 2013. The reasons
for the slow use of loan are as follows:
1. According to the project requirements, during the first two years of the project
implementation, DFID grant funds accounted for 70% of annual activity planned
fund, and the loan fund only accounted for 30%, leading to a relatively limited use of
project loan funds.

2. The project activities and focuses were subject to a constant adjustment according
to the national health reform policy. In order to avoid repetitions, part of the originally
designed project activities and the civil construction and equipment procurement of a
considerable number of village clinics were not carried out, thus resulted in some
amount of project fund remained.

II. Schedule for Extension
The closing date of project account will be deferred for a year, from December 31st,
2013 to December 31st, 2014. The specific extension schedule is as follows:
1. By December 31st, 2013, complete all project pilot activities;
2. From January 1st, 2014 to December 31 st, complete the project final survey,
summary, evaluation, experience publicity and promotion;
3. Withdrawal application and reimbursement will be taken place in a timely manner
once each of the project activity completed.
4. Before March 31st, 2015, all of the project expenditures will be disbursed and
reimbursed.

III. Activities and fund arrangements during the extension

(I) Activity arrangement
In 2013, the work will focus on the implementation and monitoring of key project
activities, project experience summary, project final evaluation survey; in 2014, the
main work shall be to summarize, publicize and replicate project experience, and to
complete wrap-up activities such as project completion and conclusion workshop; in
the first quarter of 2015, the main work shall be fund disbursement and
reimbursement. The activity plan of RHP provinces and central level are detailed in
the attachment.

(II) Fund arrangement for the extension
 Loan use of all provinces by quarter from 2013 to the end of 2014 is shown in
attached table.

IV. Safeguard measures for action plan of extension

(I) Develop detailed implementation plan on extension
1. According to the action plan of extension and based on the approval of the mid-
term adjustment program by NDRC, detailed annual work plan will be worked out.

2. While the annual work plan is designing, due responsibilities will be assigned in
term of staff arrangement, milestone, expenditure and disbursement, in order to ensure
a timely fulfillment of all activities and payment.

(II) Carry out key activity monitoring.
In line with the annual work plan, formulate monitoring program for key activities,
regularly monitor project activity and disbursement to ensure that the project is
completed on schedule.

(III) Enhance supervision frequency and dynamics
1. Bring into play the role of provincial project office and provincial experts; enhance
the frequency and dynamics of provincial supervision and technical assistance, carry
out regular or ad hoc supervision and inspection to project implementation
institutions. Reports on the supervision results will be submitted to the World Bank
and CPSM in time, and to provide solutions to address the identified problems.

2. Mainly follow up with and supervise counties with slow progress of project
implementation, coordinate and solve existing problems in the project implementation
so as to ensure the project progress.
