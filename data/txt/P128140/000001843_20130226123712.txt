       Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement

1.      The Government of Mauritius continues to diversify the economy to enable the
country to achieve a higher income status in the medium term. Since independence in 1968,
economic growth in Mauritius has been built on a long tradition of economic and
institutional reforms. Mauritius has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural
economy based on sugar production to a diversified economy structured around textile exports
and tourism and lately around financial services. In the mid-2000s, a bold reform program
supported by the Bank addressed the erosion of Mauritius’ preferential trade status and rising
commodity prices by strengthening fiscal consolidation, enhancing trade competitiveness, and
improving the investment climate. Nevertheless, critical bottlenecks to Mauritius’ economic
development remain, highlighting the need to reinvigorate public sector performance, to improve
the quality of service delivery, and to support overall economic competitiveness. Progress in
these areas will be a key determinant of whether Mauritius will achieve its aspirations to become
a high-income country over the next two decades.

2.      As anticipated at the time of Development Policy Loan 1 (DPL1) approval, the pace
of reform in Mauritius continues to be slow due to the technical and political complexity of
the necessary public sector reforms. The design and implementation of the new reforms in the
public sector is complex. They cut across many areas and require close collaboration between
many stakeholders. As a result, not only are technical solutions complex but the institutional
process itself is complicated. This requires sector ministries to take a firm lead, although many
lack the capacity to do so. These inherent difficulties are compounded by the large political
capital required to move the reforms forward, which narrows the scope for making politically

                                                                                               1
difficult decisions. The new government program adopted in April 2012 seeks to prioritize those
reforms that not only have the potential to yield broadly shared economic growth but whose
implementation is also politically feasible in this difficult environment. However, hampered by
these technical and institutional constraints, implementation is slow.

3.       With economic growth slowing and global uncertainty mounting, the need for
reform has become even more urgent. Mauritius’ exposure to the global economy ‒ especially
to the European economies ‒ is taking a toll on domestic growth, which is now projected to slow
to around 3.3 percent in 2012. This is below the 3.7 percent projection made when the first
operation under this DPL series was approved (March 2012) and below the government’s budget
projections of close to 4 percent GDP growth in 2012. While the economy proved to be highly
resilient in 2008 and the government has the means to cope with these external shocks, the
sustainability of economic growth will be highly dependent on the government’s ability to
implement reforms to increase the efficiency of the economy. The fiscal position remains
stretched, and any counter-cyclical fiscal policy will be difficult to sustain for an extended period
of time, which highlights the need to increase public sector efficiency. To accelerate GDP
growth while correcting external imbalances, Mauritius will need to undertake structural reforms
to promote national savings, and raise competitiveness. Areas identified include access to better
skills, improved infrastructure and a more efficient public sector.

4.      This DPL series supports the strengthening of institutional, policy, and management
tools required to address some of the challenges posed by these reforms. In this context, the
DPL series focuses on achieving politically feasible reforms in the near term while laying the
necessary building blocks to accelerate reforms in the medium-term. It does so by (i) supporting
the creation of systems (the Social Register of Mauritius, the Human Resource Management
Information System HRMIS, the trade portal, and the single window for trade) that will enable
the government to define appropriate reform options as well as (ii) strengthening the institutions
that coordinate the reform initiatives (the Office of Public Sector Governance, the secretariat for
streamlining business regulations, and the National Empowerment Foundation). The DPL series
focuses on three reform pillars: (i) strengthening services to support and empower the most
vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulations and processes; and (iii) improving human resource
management in the civil service and the monitoring of SOE performance. DPL 2 will now help
to consolidate these reforms while supporting the achievement of immediate results where
feasible. Overall, the use of IBRD resources in this operation is in line with results expected,
maintaining lending headroom should economic conditions would deteriorate in the medium
term.

5.      Program implementation since DPL1 has been generally satisfactory, with technical
and institutional constraints having limited the progress made in some areas. While the
political capital needed for bolder reforms is limited, the government remains committed to the
reform program supported by this DPL, and progress has been made in all of the key areas. For
instance, the Social Register of Mauritius (SRM) is already operational and registers the target
population for all new social protection programs. The curricula for the first and second years of
pre-vocational education are being rolled out, and the Public Management Information System is
operational and includes a growing number of SOEs. However, the pace of implementation
varies, reflecting both technical complexities (such as the need to develop various IT systems)

                                                                                                   2
and difficulties associated with the need to coordinate the different institutions involved in the
reform process, which in some instances is delaying the progress that was expected to be
achieved by this time (i.e. the trade portal or pilot Human Resources management information
system being operational). In this sense, the DPL is proving to be a useful tool. It continues to
provide technical expertise and global best practice in the design of many of the required
systems. Furthermore, it has in some cases filled a gap by acting as a catalyst for institutional
coordination between the many stakeholders.


       Proposed Objective(s)

6.     The development objective of the DPL programmatic series is to support
improvements in the performance of the public sector in Mauritius by assisting the
government to implement the following three reform pillars: (i) strengthening services to support
and empower the most vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulations and processes; and (iii)
improving human resource management in the civil service and the monitoring of SOE
performance.


       Preliminary Description

7.       The proposed DPL is being prepared in coordination with the Bank’s Private Sector
Competitiveness (PSC) DPL, which will be presented to the Board shortly after this
operation. Both DPL series continue the close engagement that the World Bank has had with
Mauritius over the recent years and will strategically serve to maintain the dialogue on areas
essential for the long-term development of Mauritius. The two DPL series are designed to be
mutually reinforcing and to address complementary aspects of the government’s reform program
while ensuring that the Bank’s support remains sufficiently flexible. The PSC DPL series focuses
primarily on strengthening the policy and institutional environment for private sector
competitiveness, while this proposed DPL focuses primarily on the performance of the public
sector. For instance, the reforms included in the PSP DPL in social protection will further
support reforms supported by the PSC DPL with regards to SMEs and entrepreneurship schemes,
by providing more effective resources for the affected work force. If the government is going to
successfully weather the challenges ahead and prepare itself for the next phase of rapid and
inclusive economic growth, the reforms supported by these two operations will be instrumental
to that success. Annex 1 presents the policy matrix for the overall DPL series.


       Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects

Poverty and Social Impacts

8.    Although poverty is low in Mauritius there is evidence that economic reforms are
broadening income disparity. In 2007, the number of poor represented only 8.5 percent of the




                                                                                                3
total population, equivalent to about 106,000 people,1 many of whom lived in 229 pockets of
poverty.2 Yet, while poverty is relatively low, there has been a broad perception that recent
economic reforms have not benefitted all Mauritians equally. In the period 2001/02 to 2006/07,
better-off groups experienced significantly higher income growth than the poorest.3 This trend is
likely to have persisted as Mauritius has continued its economic transformation from a relatively
low-skilled agricultural and manufacturing base to a higher value-added service-driven economy.

9.      Promoting inclusion and social cohesion continues to be a key element of the
Mauritian development model. The government has renewed its efforts to ensure that
economic growth is more balanced and equitable. This proposed DPL series supports these
objectives as laid out in the new government program, Moving the Nation Forward by focusing
on: (i) restructuring the social protection system to make it better targeted and more cost-
effective and (ii) improving education outcomes, especially for the poorest households. These
reforms remain important not only for ensuring that Mauritius’ development leads to equitable
outcomes but also for ensuring that Mauritius has effective safety nets in place as its enters a
period of considerable economic uncertainty.

Environment Aspects

10.     None of the reforms supported by the DPL series will have a direct effect on the
environment, natural resources, or forestry. If supported, the reforms affecting SOEs and
parastatals will focus on increasing transparency and monitoring the management of public
companies but will have no direct relationship with investments in these areas. Historically, the
record of environmental management in Mauritius, though not perfect, has been relatively good.4
Furthermore, all development partners recognize the strategic importance of environmental
protection, and the AFD, the UNDP, and the EU are actively providing technical support to
Mauritius in this area.
