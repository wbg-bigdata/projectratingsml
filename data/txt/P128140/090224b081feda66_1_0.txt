                         The development objective of the DPL programmatic series is to support improvements in the performance of the public sector in Mauritius by assisting the government
                         to implement the following three reform pillars: (i) strengthening services to support and empower the most vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulations and
                         processes; and (iii) improving human resource management in the civil service and the monitoring of SOE performance.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation of the project continues at good pace across most components, pending to receive information on social integration about number of people with less than a
                         secondary school certificate placed in Placement for Training. Also, reforms in the civil service progress at lower pace than envisaged, reflecting the complexity of developing a
                         Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS), and the company selected to develop the HRMIS has been selected in September 2013. Consolidation of schemes of
                         service continues in line with the operation both at the Ministry of Civil Service and Administrative Reform (MCSAR) and other sector ministries but overall achievement is not
                         quantified. Overall, many indicators are not available as they are produced only end of year and will be reported in the next ISR, to take place in 6 months. A notable exception is the
                         number of households registered in the Social Registry of Mauritius, which with 29,318 is well above original target of 13,000.

                         Reform of prevocational education

                         The Ministry of Education and Human Resources (MOEHR) has rolled out the implementation of the reform of prevocational education adopted in 2012. This reform is expected to
                         provide more flexibility in transitioning between programs and institutions and facilitate transition for a larger number to vocational education and/or the labor market. Key measures
                         include a phasing out of the NTC Foundation year, and provision of 4 years of prevocational education, with a gradual integration of trade skills and entrepreneurial skills right from
                         Year 1. This would enable students to be eligible to obtain access directly to the first year of vocational education of the Mauritius Institute for Training Development (MITD).

                         The Mauritius Institute of Education (MIE) in consultation with the MITD has developed a new curriculum aligned on the New National Curriculum Framework – Secondary, based on
                         4 key domains of learning for the prevocational stream, namely: (1) Communication Skills, (2) Numeracy and Problem-Solving Skills, (3) Life Skills, (4) Livelihood and Trade Skills
                         with ICT cross-cutting the different domains. The new curriculum for Year 1 and Year 2 was prepared by the MIE and is being implemented in all Pre Vocational schools since
                         January 2012. The new curriculum for Year 3 is implemented jointly by the MOEHR and the MITD since January 2013. The Ministry plans on phasing out the NTC Foundation in
                         2014, to introduce the fourth year Pre Vocational Education and the first exams leading towards the Pre Vocational Certificate. New resource materials have been introduced along
                         with a new pedagogy, shifting from the traditional subject teaching to domain teaching. Emphasis is laid on activity-based teaching and learning, and team–work. The implementation
                         of the curriculum is being monitored by the Quality Assurance and Inspection Division of the MOEHR and two Prevocational Coordinators have been appointed to support this task.

                         Streamlining existing regulations and systematically ensuring that the design of new regulations is conducive to business

                         The specific reforms supported by the DPL series were (i) Cabinet approval of a Memorandum detailing the establishment of the Business Regulation Improvement Committee
                         (BRIC), its composition, its mandate, its level of representation, and the structure of a related technical Secretariat and (ii) the Cabinet approval for elimination of permits issued by
                         the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Consumer Protection for six products to further facilitate trade in the country.

                         Following the Cabinet approval, the Business Regulation Improvement Committee (BRIC) was established and it has now been replaced by an inter-ministerial committee (IMC)
                         which has more power to advocate for regulatory changes. Since its establishment, one of the major interventions of the IMC has been to facilitate land development by lifting barriers
                         created by ineffective processes and red tape. The regulatory framework was enhanced in January 2013 through the introduction of guidelines for Morcellement permits and setting
                         timeline for approval of requests. The guidelines set the number of days that the Morcellement Board has to request additional information. If within three weeks of date of receipt of
                         an application at the Morcellement Unit, an applicant is not requested to submit further clarification(s)/document(s)/information, the date of receipt of the application is deemed to be
                         the “effective date.? Every member of the board is required to convey a stand on an application within four weeks of the effective date, failing which the board member is deemed to
                         have no objection to the issue of the letter of intent. If an application is endorsed, the Morcellement Unit, upon receiving the endorsement, immediately issues the letter of intent to the
                         applicant. If an application is not endorsed, the Morcellement Unit will inform the applicant in writing, specifying the reasons for refusal, within one week.

                         The authorities are working towards further streamlining regulations and further eliminating unnecessary permits. The authorities identified three more areas where Non Trade

                         Barriers (NTBs) can be eliminated by the end of 2013: (i) automating clearances/ issuance of permits from the Agricultural Marketing Board to process requests faster; (ii) elimination
                         of double approvals for a number of products that has already been identified; and (iii) streamlining regulations for trade in wheat flour. Additionally, the authorities are working on
                         comprehensive and clear guidelines with regard to the application, processing, and approval and payment of any prescribed fee to help improve transparency. All these guidelines will
                         be posted on the Government's website. Time limit for issuance and approval of permits is also being worked on.

                         The Bank has also continued building the capacity of various ministries and agencies to conduct periodic impact assessments of their trade regulations. The authorities have not yet
                         however started undertaking regulatory impact assessments for new regulations.

                         launched in August 2013 and can be accessed at http://www.mauritiustrade.mu/en. The portal increases the transparency and accessibility to all regulations listed by national tariff
                         line for both importers and exporters. It is expected that the single-window system will be fully functional by mid-2014 following the original timetable adopted by the authorities. A
                         service provider has already been selected and the authorities are in the process of reviewing the business processes for participating agencies, harmonizing them per tariff lines.

                         Enhancing the effectiveness of the Mauritius Customs administrative appeals and penalties

                         The specific reforms supported by the DPL series were: (i) Formulation of policy paper (by MOFED) on the legal framework, institutional set-up and operation of an appropriate
                         internal appeal mechanism within MRA-Customs that would be consistent with the requirements of the Revised Kyoto Convention and (ii) The government adopts a prescribed
                         schedule of administrative penalties for Customs. The internal appeal mechanism has been set up and the prescribed schedule of administrative penalties for Customs has been
                         institutionalized. Both legislations are operational and working fine.

                         Development of a Human Resources Management Information System project and streamlining of Schemes of Service

                         The contract for the development of the Human Resource Management Information System for the Civil service (HRMIS) has been awarded to the State Informatics Ltd on 12
                         September 2013. The later will develop the system so that the HRMIS will be piloted in 6 Ministries/Departments by the end of 2014. The roll-out process to other Ministries/
                         Departments will start in 2015 and will last till 2016. This revised timetable represents one year delay compared to the original projections as agreed at the time of the operation
                         approval.
                         Following Government approval to streamline and expedite the process of review, modification and consolidation of Schemes of Service, Ministries/Departments have been
                         requested to take action accordingly. Furthermore, the Ministry of Civil Service and Administrative Reform (MCSAR) has prepared Guidelines to assist Ministries/Departments to
                         effectively apply the streamlined procedures. The new procedures introduced are enabling Schemes of Service, in general, to be prescribed within a period not exceeding 4 months.
                         As regards consolidation of Schemes of Service, action has been initiated for consolidation of Schemes of Service for the grades of Director, HRM and Deputy Director, HRM and
                         Manager HR and Assistant Manager HR. Also, as a result of the publication of the Pay Research Bureau and the Errors, Omissions and Anomalies Committee Reports 2013, several
                         grades within the same cadre have been merged. In addition, for the general services cadre falling under the purview of the MCSAR, several grades that existed prior to January
                         2013 have been merged. These measures have led to a reduction in the number of grades in the Civil Service.

                         Monitoring of State Owned Enterprises (SOE) Performance

                         The authorities embarked on a SOE reform program, supported both by the bank and by the European Union over 2012-2014, to reduce the fiscal burden that state-owned
                         enterprises generate by imposing additional financial discipline within SOEs by asking them a 5% return on all new investment from state funds. The government also established the
                         Office of Public Sector Governance (OPSG) under the aegis of the Prime Minister’s Office to provide leadership, coordination, and cohesion to the implementation and monitoring of
                         the SOE reform initiative. The OPSG’s successfully led two the restructuring plans: the National Transport Corporation (NTC) and the Business Parks of Mauritius Ltd (BPML). Both
                         plans are being implemented in 2013. In August 2013, a 12 percent increase in bus rates was made effective while six non-profitable bus routes were discontinued. During early
                         September, the NTC has also launched a tender for 65 new buses, in line with the proposed restructuring. BPML reforms are being implemented successfully as confirmed by their
                         sudden boost in profitability.

                         v.      National Housing Development Authority – Draft Report sent to Ministry for views (Organizational reforms and Business Plan for Reforms).

                         As regards Performance Information Management system (PIMS), 30 SOE’s are already registered in the system and it is expected to be raised to 50 before end 2013, above original
                         projections included at the time of the approval of the operation. With EU support a dashboard from the PIMS data will be developed. A workshop will be organized on October 23,
                         2013 to present the new system to SOE’s. OPSG should ensure that an annual performance report is prepared by the OPSG and published on the OPSG website.

                         This is an initial ISR. The project became effective as of July 12, 2013. The loan was fully disbursed in September 2013.

                         number of households registered in the Social Registry of Mauritius, which with 29,318 is well above original target of 13,000.
