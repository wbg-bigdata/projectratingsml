APPRAISAL OF
A HIGHWAY PROJECT
CYPRUS
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Cyprus' transport system  comprises highways, ports, and air-
ports. Major lines radiate from the capital of Nicosia to the ports of
Famagusta, Larnaca, and Limassol and to the Morphou region. The 5,200
mi long highway network is the only means of internal transport in this
highly motorized country. Although the network fully covers the island,
it has low capacity with excessive traffic volumes and substandard geo-
metric and technical characteristics. In addition, the network has not
been expanded to match the country's rapid economic growth. Five general
cargo ports and three mineral ports handle imports and exports. Nicosia,
the only commercial airport, serves international traffic exclusively.
ii.       Planning of transport investments is ad hoc. Non-economic con-
siderations play a dominant role in determing allocations among the three
modes and inter-departmental competition has grown for funds available
for infrastructure improvements. This has resulted in unbalanced alloca-
tions, but no apparent misallocations appear to have occurred so far
because the transport system is simple and the modes are complementary.
The Government wants to improve coordination of transport investments,
and a commmications officer has been appointed to the Ministry of Commu-
nications and Works (MGW) to advise and assist on these matters.
iii.      Transport expenditures during the last four years of the Second
Development Plan (1968-1971) were 1C 12.3 million, or about 30% of total
government development expenditures. Highway expenditures were bC 4.85
million, or about 40% of total transport expenditures. These highway ex-
penditures have been inadequate to meet needs and a backlog of highway
investments has accumulated. The Government is preparing its Third Plan
(1972-76) and, although complete details about allocations are not
available, more emphasis is expected to be placed on highways.
iv.       Responsibility for highway administration is divided among the
Departments of Public Works (DPW) in the MCW; the District Administration
in the Ministry of Interior; the Forestry Department in the Ministry of
Agriculture; and the Municipalities. This division has resulted in lack
of coordination and duplication of efforts, equipment, and facilities.
The DPW is not properly organized or sufficiently staffed to complete all
projects for which it has been allocated funds. It undertaces many small
highway construction projects concurrently and spreads the work over
several years; this results in inefficient work and high costs. Main-
tenance procedures, however, are generally satisfactory, but they are
hampered by lack of 1Zunds.



- ii -
v.        A project identification mission recommended that a highway
investment plan should be prepared, highway administration and mainte-
nance should be improved, and the Nicosia-Morphou road should be con-
structed. This project contains elements designed to carry out these
recommendations. It includes a study of highway planning and organiza-
tion that will help the Government: improve its highway administration;
establish proper procedures for and train counterparts in planning,
designing, construction, and maintaining highways; and prepare a highway
development and improvement program for 1972-81. It also encompasses
studies of road user charges and vehicle weight regulations.
vi.       To relieve congestion on the existing two-lane road connecting
Nicosia, the capital and largest city, with Morphou, an important town of
a major agricultural area, this project includes construction of a four-
lane divided highway. The DPW, assisted by consultants, carried out feasi-
bility studies and detailed engineering of the highway. The project also
includes preinvestment studies of other high priority roads (Nicosia-Famagusta
and Nicosia-Limassol) and bypasses (Nicosia, FamXagusta and Limassol) as well
as detailed engineering of the highest priority roads or road sections.
vii.      The project cost, including contingency allowances but excluding
the cost of acquiring right-of-way, is US$10.5 million. The foreign ex-
change component is US$5.4 million or 51%. The estimated cost of the high-
way planning and organization study is based on the Government's contract
with the consultants Italconsult (Italy). The cost of training is based on
local salaries, foreign travel, per diem allowances, and training fees. The
estimated costs of the road user charges and vehicle weight regulations
studies are based on estimated man-months required. The DPW, assisted by
Italconsult, prepared the cost estimates for highway construction based
on quantities derived from completed detailed engineering and estimated
costs of labor, equipment, materials, and overheads. The estimated cost
of construction supervision is based on the availability of local staff
and the need for foreign experts.
viii.     The DPW, assisted by consultants employed in accordance with the
"Guidelines on Uses of Consultants by the World Bank and its Borrowers",
will be responsible for carrying out the project. The highway planning and
organization study began in January 1972. Contracts for road construction
will bo awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with
t .JBankts "Guidelines for Procurement".  Construction is expected to start
in late 1973 and to be completed by mid-1976. The feasibility studies
should begin in the third quarter of 1973 and be completed about twelve
months later, with detailed engineering completed by the end of 1975.
Training will take place in 1974/75.
ix.       The Bank loan will finance the foreign exchange cost of the
project (US$5.4 million).  The Government will finance the local cost
(US$5.1 million) and the cost of purchasing right-of-way (about US$1 million).
Based on a signed contract with consultants, the Government has asked the
Bank for a maximum of US$150,000 in retroactive financing for the highway
planning and organization study, this amount is included in the project cost.



- iii -
x.        The average Economic Return on the investment for construction
of the Nicosia-Morphou road is 53%, with returns varying from 46% to 57%
for the three sections into which it was divided for the economic analy-
sis. The quantifiable benefits from constructing the road are savings
in vehicle operating and time costs for existing traffic diverted to the
new road and for traffic remaining on the existing road as well as
benefits for traffic generated as a result of additional capacity and
improved service provided by the new road. Benefits from the studies and
training are not quantifiable. However, these elements are justified
since they will improve efficiency in highway administration and assist
the Government in necessary improvement, expansion, and maintenance of
its highway network. The immediate and principal beneficiaries from the
construction element will be the residents in its influence area. Also,
as road user charges far exceed highway investments, the increased
Government resources resulting from the road works will be redistributed
through the budgetary mechanism to other sectors of the economy.
xi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$5.4 million to
the Government of the Republic of Cyprus for a 23-year term, including
3 years of grace.






APPRAISAL OF
A HIGHWAY PROJECT
CYPRUS
I.  INTRCDUCTION
1.01      In late 1969, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus
asked the Bank for assistance in developing and improving its highway
network. A project identification mission visited the country and
recommended that a highway investment plan should be prepared, highway
administration and maintenance should be improved, and the Nicosia-
Morphou road should be constructed. Based on these recammendations,
the Government has prepared a US$10.5 million project for Bank con-
sideration.
1.02      This will be the second Bank loan for the transportation
sector of Cyprus. The first (628-CY, June 1969, US$115. million)
was for construction of port facilities and purchases of equipment.
In general, the project is being carried out satisfactorily.
1.03      This report is based on:  information provided by the
Ministry of Communication and Works (MCW); feasibility studies
carried out by the Department of Public Works (DPW) and by the con-
sulting firm Italconsult (Italy); and the findings of a September
1972 appraisal mission composed of Messrs. R. Rafloski (Economist),
K. Myllyluoma (Engineer), and L. Hinkle (Economist).
II. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
A.  The Country and Its Economy
2.01      The main geographical features of this Mediterranean island
are the two east-west mountain ranges (Kyrenia and Troodos), separated
by a broad central plain, which cover about half its land. The shoulders
of the mountain ranges and the central plain are the principal cultivated
areas. Most of the population lives in the capital and manufacturing
center of Nicosia and the port cities of Famagusta, Larnaca, and Limassol.
Consequently, these four cities are the focal points of the transport
system.
2.02      Cyprus depends heavily on foreign trade, importing 47% of its
Gross Domestic Product and exporting 38%. Agriculture is the largest
economic sector, employing about one-third of the labor force and supply-
ing 50% of total exports. In 1970, minerals (mined mainly in the Troodos
mountains) represented about 35% of the value of total domestic export
earnings and about 67% of total export tonnages. Tourism expenditures



- 2 -
increased at an average annual rate of 33% between 1968 and 1971. Because
Cyprus is attractive to tourists and now holds only a small share of the
Mediterranean market (less than 1%), tourism is expected to continue to
grow rapidly, particularly in Nicosia, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and the Troodos
region.
B.   The Transport System
2.03      The transport system comprises highways, ports, and airports.
Table 1 shows traffic statistics for ports and civil aviation; Chapter III
gives details about highways.
2.04      Cyprus is a highly motorized country, depending entirely on
roads for its domestic transport. Major transport liines radiate from the
capital of Nicosia to the ports of Famagusta, Larnaca, and Limassol and
to the Morphou region, one of the principal agricultural areas. Agricul-
tural products are collected in the rural areas and sent to the general
cargo ports of Famagusta and Limassol for export. Mining products are
transported from the Troodos region to the specialized mineral ports of
Karavatessi and Varsilko-Zyyi.  While the absolute flow of minerals is
large, it will impose few new demands on the transport system because
production and exports have stagnated since 1968 and are expected to
decline. General merchandise is imported at Famagusta and Limassol and
distributed to Nicosia and the rest of the country. Petroleum Droducts
are brought ashore at Larnaca and trucked to other areas.
2.05      Airlines carry about 83% of international passenger traffic to
and from the island. Arrivals and departures at the only commercial air-
port, Nicosia, increased at an average annual rate of 21% between 1967
and 1970e The ports of Famagusta and Limassol also handle large numbers
of passengers (171,000 in 1970), primarily one-day visitors from cruise
ships.
2.06      When the Bank-financed expansion of the port of Limassol and the
Government-financed extension of the runway at Nicosia airport are completed,
ports and airports should be able to meet traffic demand for the next four
to five years. Expansion of the highway network, however, has not kept
pace with the rapid economic growth and the consequent traffic increase in
the country. The elements of this project will help the Government expand
and improve the network (para. 4.01).
C.   Planning and Financing
2.07      The Bureau of Planning in the Ministry of Finance is in charge
of planning economic development and allocating development funds to the
different sections of the economy. The Ministry of Communications and Works
(MCW) through its Departments of Ports, Civil Aviation, and Public Works
(Chart World Bank 7173), is responsible for administration, operation, and
planning of all transport modes, except part of the road network (para 3.07).



Planning of transport investments is ad hoc, with non-economic considerations
often playing a dominant role. This system has led to inter-departmental
competition for the investment funds available for infrastructure improve-
ments. As a result, funds allocated to the different modes have been
unbalanced but no apparent misallocations appear to have occurred so far
because the transport system is simple and the modes are largely comple-
mentary. The Government, however, wants to improve coordination of transport
investments and the Director General of the MCW has appointed a communications
officer (economist) to advise and assist on these matters.
2.o8      During the last four years of the Second Development Plan (1968-71),
transport expenditures were LC 12.3 million, or about 30% of total
government development expenditures (Table 2). Highway expenditures were
S,C 4.85 million, or about 40% of total transport expenditures. These high-
way expenditures have been inadequate to meet needs and a backlog of highway
investments has accumulated. The Thiird Plan (1972-76) is still being pre-
pared and complete details are not available on the amounts the Government plans to
allocate to transport. The Government has stated, however, that it intends
to put more emphasis on highways and it has retained consultants to prepare
a highway development and improvement program for 1972-81 (para. 4.06).
Based on the recommendations of the consultants, the Government has prepared
a program of SC 11.5 million for 1972-76.  The average annual expenditure
under this program is about double the amount spent in the preceding four
years and is considered adequate.
III. HIGHWAYS
A.   The Network
3.01      In 1971, the length of the network was about 5,200 mi, of which
over 2,300 mi were paved and the remainder gravel-surfaced (Table 3).
The network is old and it fully covers the island, linking all cities,
villages, and rural areas. Its capacity, however, is low and has not
been expanded to match the rapid economic growth and the accompanying
traffic increase in the country. A recent road inventory showed that the
percentage distribution according to pavement width of roads maintained
by the DPW (para. 3.07) is: 62% are 3-4 m, 36%, 4-6 m; and 2%, over 6 m.
Many roads have poor alignment and geometric characteristics and carry
traffic exceeding their capacity.
B.   Characteristics and Growth of Traffic
3.02      The motor vehicle fleet has grown at an average annual rate of
11% between 1967 and 1971 (Table 4). At the end of 1971, about 92,400
vehicles were registered. The level of motorization (10 cars or 14
vehicles per hundred inhabitants) is about half that of Great Britain
or France and is highest of the developing countries along the Mediter-
ranean. Because incomes are rising and highways are the only means of
domestic transport, further rapid growth of the vehicle fleet (including
private cars) is expected.
3.03      Road traffic grew at an average annual rate of 9% between
1967 and 1971, in line with motor fuel consumption (Table 5). Traffic
growth rates on individual roads have varied and have been highest on
the main roads radiating from Nicosia.



- h -
3.04      The Government regulates public passenger and freight transport
under the Motor Transport Regulation Law of 1964; the semi-independent
Licensing Authority and the Licensing Department in the MCW administer
the law. The Government controls fares and schedules of public transport
routes and approves schedules of urban and interurban buses. Also it
regulates entry into the road freight industry.
3.05      Taxis and buses provide passenger transport service.  Inter-
urban taxis offer faster and more convenient service (on an individual
fare basis) than public transport. Three large private firms (each
operating over 100 buses), several smaller private firms, and numerous
individual owners provide public passenger transport on urban, interurban
and rural routes. Bus capacity exceeds demand, and for this reason new
licenses have been granted since 1970 only to replace vehicles already
in service. The quality and reliability of bus service is generally
adequate, but efficiency could be improved if smaller firms and individual
owners consolidated operations. The Government is encouraging formation
of single bus companies in major urban areas and, based on recommendations
of Government-employed transportation consultants, some individual owners
have consolidated operations.
3.06      Small firms and individual owners furnish freight transport
service. The typical road freight vehicle is a 2-axle truck of 5-10 m
tons capacity; few tractor trailers are used. As with buses, capacity
exceeds demand and new licenses have been granted since 1970 only to
replace vehicles. The quality of service is adequate and, in same areas,
owners have consolidated operations to improve efficiency. Vehicle weight
regulations permit axle loads of 10 m tons and maximum weight of trucks
and trailers of 12 and 16 m tons, respectively; they are inadequately
enforced. The maximum vehicle weight limits are unduly restrictive and
hamper development of a suitable trailer fleet and use of 20-30 m ton
containers frequently used in the European Economic Community, to which
Cyprus exports its agricultural production. The Government is aware of
this situation and has asked that the weight limits be reviewed under the
studies included in this project (para. 4.09).
C.   Administration
Responsibility for highway administration is divided among the
iPW in the MCW, the District Administration (DA) in the Ministry of
Interior, the Forestry Department in the Ministry of Agriculture, and
the Municipalities (Table 3). The DPW is responsible for main roads:
about 1,400 mi in 1971, of which 98% (1,345 mi) are paved. The DA is
responsible for lower class roads; 488 mi of the 2,200 mi of these roads
are paved. The Forestry Department is responsible for 936 mi of gravel
roads; most are in forests and mainly used for forestry management and
exploitation, but some also serve local traffic. The Municipalities
maintain local streets and roads that are not through roads located
entirely within their jurisdiction; 499 mi are paved and 181 mi are
gravel.



3.08      This division of responsibility has resulted in lack of
coordination and duplication of efforts, equipment, and facilities.
The Government is aware of the deficiencies of the present organization
and has employed consultants to review it and recommend improvements
(para. 4.o6). The Government has decided to reorganize the DPW and
centralize its road operations in the MCW in accordance with procedures
to be established in consultation with the Bank taking into account the
recommendations of the consultants. As a first step, the Government has
already decided to transfer the responsibility of all interurban paved
roads to the DPW.
3.09      The Office of the Senior Roads Engineer in the  DPW (Chart
World Bank 7174) is responsible for planning, designing, and supervising
construction of main roads. Under supervision of the Senior Roads
Engineer, the District Engineer's Offices carry out highway maintenance
and force account construction.   The Offices of the Senior Roads Engineer
and the District Engineer have a severe shortage of middle and junior level
engineers, thus limiting capacity for project preparation and execution.
Training to help improve this situation will be provided under this project
(paras. 3.20 and 4.10).
D.   Planning
3.10      Until recently, capital investments for roads were decided on
an ad hoc basis with non-economic considerations playing a dominant role
rather than economic justification and sound planning.  In 1969, when the
Government asked the Bank to assist in developing and improving highways,
attention was given for the first time to formal planning and economic
analyses of highway investments. Bank staff prepared an outline for a
highway feasibility study, which the DPW used to prepare the feasibility
study for construction of the Nicosia-Morphou road included in this
project. In addition, a special section in the Office of the Senior Roads
Engineer was established recently to be responsible for collection of
highway data (traffic counts and origin and destinations surveys) and for
preparation of preinvestment studies. A capable engineer supervises the
work of the Section, but his staff is insufficient and for now the DPW
will have to continue employing consultants for most of its preinvestment
studies. At the Government's request, Bank staff also helped the Govern-
ment prepare Terms of Reference for the highway planning and organization
study included in this project (para. 4.06).
E. Financing
3.11      Funds for highway construction and major improvements are drawn
from the development budget, and those for highway maintenance and minor
improvement works by the DPW are allocated annually from the current budget.
DPW funds for minor improvement works on many small sections are allocated
on an excessively detailed basis. Funds allocated must be spent within
the budget year on the specific project for which they were designated.
Funds allocated to the DA are on a village basis and not as detailed as
the DPW allocations.
3.12      Table 6 summarizes recent expenditures on roads.  The DPW has
spent on annual average of about 1C 250,000 (not including overhead) on
road maintenance during the last four years. Although this amount is



- 6 -
inadequate, so far the DPW has not been able to obtain a larger allocation.
Between 1968 and 1971, the DPW spent an annual average of about SC 1 million
(not including overheads)on capital road investments. This has been insuf-
ficient to provide necessary improvements to enable highways to handle the
rapid growth of traffic. The Government wants to increase highway investments
and has prepared a highway development and improvement program for 1972-76
based on the consultant's study (para. 2.08).
3.13      Low funding for highways has not been the only reasan for low
expenditures. In 1970 and 1971, thw DPW did not have the capacity or the
organization to complete projects for which funds were allocated. In 1970
and 1971 SC 1.4 million and SC 1.6 million was allocated for highways but
expenditures amounted to only 66% and 53% of these amounts. The main reasons
why the DPW could not spend the amounts allocated were that it: worked
inefficiently on too many small projects (para. 3.17); carried out almost all
works by force account; used consultants very seldom for project preparation;
and lacked sufficient staff. To help ensure that funds allocated for highway
investment and maintenance are fully used, the Government has agreed that road
administration will be centralized under one agency, the MCW, which will be
reorganized to ensure efficient operations. The highway planning and organiza-
tion study under this project has made recommendations to this effect.
3.14      The Government does not have a well-defined road user taxation
policy, but charges road users taxes and duties on vehicles and gasoline
and vehicle registration fees (Table 6) to raise public revenue. Average
annual collections in 1969-71 were approximately seven times annual highway
expenditures and represented about 23% of total budget revenue. The
Government wants to establish a more rational road user tax policy and
has requested that a study be made under this project (para. 4.09) to
determine a taxation policy suited to the needs of the country.
F. Engineering
3.15      In the past all highway design work was done by the Design
Section of the Office of the Senior Roads Engineer. The DPW has the
technical know-how for undertaking this work, but is understaffed to meet
all needs and will have to employ consultants for major des'gn work.
Present gecmetric design standards are inadequate for all road classes.
F, sion of these standards has been under consideration for many years
and is now being studied under the highway planning and organization study
(para. 4.06). During negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that
it will take steps to establish adequate highway design standards in
consultation with the Bank. For the project road, the DPW has developed
special design standards (Table 7), which are adequate.
G. Construction
3.16      During the last four years, road construction has been limited
to paving an annual average of about 50 mi and extending the Nicosia airport
runway. Most of this work was carried out in force account by the DPW,
which has modern equipment, including the only efficient asphalt plant



- 7 -
on the island. However, DPW has no heavy earth-moving equipment and sub-
contractors are employed for these works and for supplying materials,
usually on a fixed price basis. Recently, a few contracts for roadworks
and extension of the Nicosia airport runway were awarded on a unit price
basis to local contractors. The quality of the DPW's construction work
is acceptable.
3.17      The practice of undertaking many small construction projects
concurrently and spreading the work over several years has led to in-
efficient work and high costa. Often work on a project must be suspended
for several months at the end of the year when all allocated funds have
been spent. The work crew is then shifted to another project, only to be
returned to the original project early in the next year. The Government
has decided to an increased use of contractors to improve total work capacity
and efficiency and to concentrate on fewer projects; both these measures
were reconmendei in the highway planning and organization study (para. 4.06)
3.18      The domestic civil works contracting industry coaprises three
contracting firms (one being a subsidiary of a foreign firm) with experience
in road construction (para. 4.17). One of these firms mainly works abroad.
These firms are capable of handling highway projects that are the size of
the project road. In addition, a number of small contractors are operating
and competing for subcontracts, mainly for earth-moving and hauling materials.
H.  Maintenance
3.19      The District Engineer's Offices use force account and  sUtbontractors
to maintain main roads. The maintenance equipment fleet is generally adequate.
The DA arranges for local roads to be maintained entirely on a subcontract
basis. The quality of maintenance works is good, but the amount is inadequate
because funds are insufficient. Periodic maintenance is not properly planned
and is inadequate, resulting in deterioration and short pavement lives. The
consultants for the highway planning and organization study have also reviewed
existing highway maintenance and made recommendations for improvements (para.
4.06). During negotiation the Government gave an undertaking that it will
establish appropriate standards for routine and periodic maintenance of the
inter-urban road network taking into account the existing conditions of the
road network and the traffic volumes. The Government will implement these
standards on a timetable agreed with the Bank.
I.   Training
3.20      Insufficient staff at middle and junior levels limits the DPW's
capacity for project preparation and execution (para. 3.09). In the next
few years, this shortage should be remedied when the current scholarships
program and UN-financed local higher technical institute begin to produce
qualified engineers and technicians. However, an urgent need exists to
train new, inexperienced DPW staff in highway planning and design, construc-
tion supervision, and planning and execution of periodic and routine highway
maintenance. Under this project, DPW staff will be trained abroad and as
counterparts to the consultants undertaking the feasibility studies (paras.
4.o6 and 4.10).

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.0I      The project will help Cyprus in constructing a high priority road,
in improving its highway administration, and in establishing proper proce-
dures for improving and maintaining the highway system. It consists of:
(i)  construction and construction supervision of the Nicosia-Morphou
road (32 km) and about 12 km of access roads;
(ii) consultant services for:
- a study of highway planning and organization;
- feasibility studies of the Nicosia-Famagusta and Nicosia-
Limassol roads and of the Nicosia, Famagusta and Limassol
bypasses (170 km) and detailed engineering for the highest
priority roads or road sections (about 90 km); and
- studies of road user charges and vehicle weight regulations;
and
(iii) training of DPW staff.
(a) Construction and Supervision of the Nicosia-Norphou Road
4.02      The existing Nicosia-Morphou road is the most heavily trafficked
road on the island. The section between Nicosia and the international
airport was constructed from 1966 to 1968 on a good alignment with a 6.5 m
wide asphalt pavement.  It carried an estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
of about 8,300 vehicles in 1972. The section between the airport and Morhpou
is basically a track, developed at the beginning of the 20th century and
improved in 1953 to a 5.5 m wide bituminous pavement with about 1 m shoulders.
The road is on a poor alignment with sharp curves, and passes through several
villages. Because of inadequate sight distance, only a few opportunities for
passing exist. In 1972, this section carried an ADT of 5,400 vehicles (25%
trucks and buses).
4.03      North of and  parallel to the existing Nicosia-Morphou road, a
tertiary road, linking the two cities with villages in the Morphou plain,
passes through high value agricultural land. This road is on a very poor
alignment with a 3 m wide low class bituminous pavement. It was constructed
to carry only local traffic, but because the main road is congested it also
carries through traffic. After the project road is opened, both existing
roads will serve local traffic.
4.0h      From Nicosia to the international airport (about 4 km), the
project road will be constructed with two additional lanes along the
existing alignment. From the airport to Morphou (30 lkm), a new road
section will be constructed on a new alignment. It will traverse the
Althalassa Formation, which provides good engineering properties and is
largely uninhabited. By eliminating traffic congestion, the new road
will improve the environment of villages and communities on the existing
roads. The DPW, assisted by Italconsult, prepared the feasibility study
for the new road and also carried out the detailed engineering; this work
was a satisfactory basis for preparing the project.



- 9 -
4.05      The DPW is capable of supervising construction.  It will, however,
employ experts of a qualified consulting firm to assist in the planning of
supervision and in the supervision as may be necessary. The DPW will be
entirely responsible for supervision of construction. During negotiations,
the Government and the Bank agreed on the proposals for staffing the
supervision team and the terms of reference for the consultants.
(b) Consultants' Services
4.06      Highway Flaming and Organization Study: Bank staff helped the
Government prepare Terms of Reference for this study. The Government employed
Italconsult to carry it out, and the firm began working in January 1972. Its
assignment was to: (i) review present highway administration, planning,
construction, and maintenance; (ii) prepare a program for 1972-81 to develop
and improve the highway network; and (iii) review and complete detailed
engineering as well as prepare prequalification and bidding documents for
construction of the Nicosia-Morphou road. Italconsult submitted a Draft
Final Report in February 1973 recommending that: (i) administration of roads
under the responsibility of the DPW and the DA should be centralized under
one agency; (ii) new divisions for planning, design, construction and
maintenance should be established in this agency; and (iii) the 1972-81
program to develop and improve the highway network should give high priority
to construction of the Nicosia-Famagusta and Nicosia-Limassol roads, including
bypasses of Nicosia, Famagusta and Limassol, which ahould begin by 1975.
4.07      During negotiations, the Government and the Bank discussed the main
findings and recommendations of the consultants and agreed on implementation
of centralizing highway administration and improving project preparation and
execution. The Government gave assurances that it will: (i) implement a
reorganization of the DPW to improve highway planning, desipg, construction,
and maintenance in accordance with an agreed timetable; (ii) maintain the
highway network adequately in accordance with sound engineering and highway
practices; and (iii) provide promptly as needed the funds, facilities, services
and other resources needed for adequate maintenance of the highway network.
4.08      Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering:  A consulting firm
will be employed under this project to carry out feasibility studies of the
Nicosia-Fainagusta and Nicosia-Limassol roads, including bypasses of Nicosia,
Famagusta and Limnassol, in accordance with Italconsult's recommendation that
these roads should be given high priority for construction. Detailed
engineering will be undertaken subsequently for the highest priority roads
or road sections (estimated at about 90 km). During negotiations, the Bank
obtained an assurance from the Government that it will select the roads or
road sections for detailed engineering in consultation with the Bank.
4.09      Study of Road User Charges and Vehicle Weight Regulations:  Con-
sultants will review existing road user charges and vehicle weight regulations.
The road user charge study will include an analysis of the effect of current
charges on transport demand and supply and a determination of the advantages
and disadvantages of possible modifications, particularly concerning future
revenue potential. The weight regulation study will cover a review of existing



- 10 -
legislation and regulations concerning pernissible axle loads of vehicles
using public roads, and will recommend necessary modification, taking
into account the existing condition of the network and present and future
transport demand. During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances from
the Government that it will, in consultation with the Bank, institute
appropriate vehicle weight regulations, based on the consultants' recommen-
dations and take adequate action to enforce the regulations.
(G) Training
4.10o     The DPW is preparing a 30 man-month program of training abroad
for up to 12 engineers, each for 2-4 months. The fields in which they will
be trained are highway planning and design, construction supervision, and
planning and execution of periodic and routine highway maintenance. During
negotiatios , the Government and the Bank discussed the program and the
Government will submit a list of DPW personnel and courses for Bank review
and agreement.
B.   Cost Estimates and Foreign Exchange Component
4.11      The project cost, including contingency allowances but excluding
the cost of acquiring right-of-way, is US$10.5 million. The foreign exchange
component is US$5.4 million or 51%.  A summary of the project cost is on
Page 11.
4.12      The DPW, with assistance from Italconsult, prepared the cost
estimate for construction, based on quantities derived from completed detailed
engineering and estimated costs of labor, equipment, materials, and overhead.
The estimate is acceptable. The estimated cost of construction supervision
is based on the availability of local staff and the need for foreign experts.
The cost of the highway planning and organization study is based on the
Government's contract with Italconsult. The costs of the feasibility studies,
detailed engineering, and study of road user charges and vehicle weight
regulations are based on estimated man-months required. The cost of training
is based on local salaries, foreign travel, per diem allowances, and training
fees.
4.13      Contingency allowances for physical overruns and price escalation
have been included in the project cost. The physical contingency allows for
a 10% increase in construction quantities and 10% increase in estimated man-
months of construction supervision and preinvestment studies. The price
contingency is for a 13% increase in local prices (8% annually) and a 10%
increase in foreign prices (6% annually) of construction costs from the
expected time of receiving bids to completing construction. During negoti-
ations, the Government and the Bank agreed on the project cost estimates.

4.14      According to calculations by the DPW and confirmed by Bank staff,
the foreign exchange component for highway construction would be about 56%
if all work were done by foreign contractors and bb% if all work were done
by local contractors. As the probabilities of awarding the conBtruction
contract to a local or foreign contractor are about equal, the foreign ex-
change component for construction has been estimated at 50%. The 10%
foreign exchange component for construction supervision reflects maximum use
of DPW staff and the 80% foreign exchange component for consultant services
is based on estimates of foreign experts' salaries and other foreign costs.
The 70% foreign exchange component for training is based on estimated costs
for foreign travel and per diem allowances.
C.   Execution
4.15      The DPW, assisted by consultants, will be responsible for carrying
out the project. The Government gave assurances that it will: (i) employ
qualified and experienced consultants in accordance with the "Guidelines on
Uses of Consultants by the World Bank and its Borrowers"; and (ii) make
qualified staff available to work full-time with the consultants.
4.16      The contract for the project road will be awarded to prequalified
contractors after international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank Group "Guidelines for Procurement"T. The road works will be executed
under a single contract as this would require minimum staff input by the
DPW for administering and supervising construction. This would not limit
participation by local contractors because the firms with experience in road
construction have been prequalified and are expected to bid for the work.
4.17      The Government has the necessary powers to expropriate right-of-
way required for roads, and already has obtained authority to occupy the
land required for the project road. The Goverrmnnt assured the Bank that
it will make available all right-of-way as and when needed for timely imple-
mentation of the project. Construction is expected to start in late 1973
and to be completed by mid-1976. The feasibility studies should begin in
the third quarter of 1973 and be completed about twelve months later; sub-
sequent detailed engineering of high priority roads or road sections should
be completed by the end of 1975. Training will take place in 197b/75.
During negotiations, the timing of project execution and progress reporting
requirements were reviewed and agreed.
D.  Financing
4.18      A US$5.4 million Bank loan is proposed to cover the foreign
exchange costs of the project. The loan will be for a 23-year term with
3 years of grace. The Government will finance the local costs of the
project (about US$5.1 million) and the cost of purchasing right-of-way
(about US$1 million). During negotiations, the Governmtent gave an assurance
to this effect. Based on a signed contract with consultants, the Government
has asked the Bank for a maximum of US$150,000 in retroactive financing for
the highway planning and organization study, which started in January 1972
(para. 4.06). This amount is included in the project cost estimate and was
confirmed during negotiations.



-   1I.  -
E.  Disbursements
4.19      Disbursements from the Loan Account wil)) be made on the basis
of 50% of the construction cost and 100% of the foreign exchange cost of
construction supervision, the studies, and training. Based on the fore-
going and in accordance with the schedule of project execution (para. 4.17),
an Estimated Schedule of Disbursements has been prepared (Annex) and was
agreed during negotiations. Surplus funds remaining in the loan account
upon completion of the project will be cancelled.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.  Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.01      A reliable transport system  is an essential element in the
Government's strategy of increasing agricultural production: expanding
industry, and stimulating tourism. The present highway network does not
fulfill these requirements adequately. Many roads have substandard geo-
metric and technical characteristics and lack the capacity to handle the
traffic they carry at reasonable cost. With continued rapid economic
growth, improvement of the network is critical if present and future
transport requirements are to be met. This project will help attain
these ends by: providing for construction of a high priority road;
strengthening the institutional capability for highway planning, ad-
ministration, and project preparation and execution; and preparing
feasibility studies for high priority highway projects.
5.02      The proposed Nicosia-Morphou road will alleviate congestion
on existing roads and provide a modern route which will satisfy increasing
transport demand that could not otherwise be met in the area it serves.
The immediate and principal beneficiaries from its construction will be
residents in the influence area of the road. In addition, since road
user charges far exceed highway investments (comprising some 30% of total
budget revenue), the increased government revenues that will result from
the roadwarks will be redistributed to other sectors of the economy through
the budgetary mechanism.
B.  The Nicosia-Morphou Road
5.03      The project road connects Nicosia, the island's capital and
largest city (125,000 people), with Morphou, an important town in one of
the major agricultural areas in the country (8,000 people). A further
80,000 people live in the numerous villages lying within the influence
area of the road. The groundwater-iirrigated lands around Morphou from
an important area for production of citrus fruits, melons, and carrots.
Produce is trucked from the area to Nicosia for local consumption and
to Famagusta for export. The road also provides access to increasingly
important summer and winter tourist resorts in the Troodos mountains.
Minerals, pyrite mixes, and chrome will be transported over the road
from the Troodos mountain area to the mineral port in the Morphou Bay
area. The Morphou region also is an important residential area with people
travelling between Nicosia and the numerous towns and villages for work
and personal business purposes.



- 14 -
5.04      In 1972, the existing main road carried an estimated ADT
of 8,300 vehicles between Nicosia and Yerolakkos; 5,700 vehicles
between Yerolakkos and Astromeritis; about 4,400 vehicles between
Astromeritis and Morphou. Most of the traffic consisted of
through journeys. The traffic was composed of cars (63%), light vans and
pickups (15%), trucks (14%), and buses (8%). In 1972, the tertiary road
north of and parallel to the existing main road carried an estimated ADT
of 850 vehicles. Between 1967 and 1972, traffic on the existing main road
grew at an average annual rate of 10%. Passenger car traffic is expected
to continue growing at an average annual rate of 10% through 1975, tapering
off to 5% annually in the 1990's. Other traffic is assumed to grow initially
at about the same rate, levelling off more rapidly (Table 8).
5.05      Under the feasibility study prepared by the DPW, three alter-
native solutions were studied for improving the road between Nicosia and
Morphou and for accommodating future traffic volumes: (i) minor realignment
and improvement of the existing road; (ii) major realignment of the existing
road; and (iii) construction of a new road on three different alignments.
Alternative solutions (ii) and (iii) compared a two-lane facility to a
four-lane facility with staged construction. Based on a cost/benefit
analysis a new road on a new alignment was selected, apart from the
section to the airport (4 km.) where the new road will follow the alignment
of the existing road.
5.06      In addition to developmental aspects of satisfying future trans-
port demand (para. 5.02), the project road provides a shorter route bet-
ween Nicosia and Morpol   (reduced about 4 kim) and relieves congestion on
the existing roads. The quantifiable benefits from constructing the road
are:
(a)  savings in vehicle operating and time costs for existing (or
normal) traffic diverted to the new road when it is constructed
(i.e., about 82% of the total traffic);
(b)  savings in vehicle operating and time costs for traffic remain-
ing on the existing road as a result of decreased congestion; and
(c)  benefits accruing to traffic generated as a result of the
additional capacity and improved service provided by the new
road.
Based on an origin and destination survey by the DPW, an analysis was made
of the savings in vehicle operating and time costs resulting from the new
road. Under this analysis, the time of vehicle occupants engaged on busi-
ness trips was valued at the average wage rate in the country (LCO.460) and
for occupants on on-business trips at 25% of this rate (LCO.115). This is
considered conservative for a relatively developed econonm  like Cyprus with
full employment and a high motorization level.
5.07      For the analysis, the project road was divided into three sections:
Section I - Nicosia to Yerolakkos Junction (6 km); Section II - Yerolakkos
Junction to Troodos Interchange (18 kmi) and Section III - Troodos Inter-
change to Morphou (8 km). Based on an economic life of 25 years, a con-
struction period of about three years, and the estimated economic costs of



- 15 -
construction, construction supervision, right-of-way acquisition, vehicle
operation, and time, investment in a four-lane divided highway between
Nicosia and Morphou would yield an Economic Return (ER) of 46% on Section I,
57% on Section II, and 48% on Section III, with the average being 53% (Table 9).
Table 10 shows details of the cost/benefit streams.
5.08      Section I is so heavily trafficked (ADT of about 14,000 vehicles
in 1977, the first full year of benefits to the road) that, immediate con-
struction of a four-lane divided highway is required to provJde adequate
capanity for the traffic to be served. For the remaining two sections, a
detailed analysis was made of the relative merits of initial construction of
two or four lanes. The results show a first year return on the incremental
investments in the third and fourth lanes of 11% for Section II and 8%
for Section III. These returns are satisfactory and the Government has
therefore decided that the road 3hotld be built immediately as a four-lane
divided highway over its entire length. This is fully justified as initial
construction of a full four-lane road woald:
(i) avoid higher expenditures which would be necessary if construction
of the third and fourth lanes would be delayed;
(ii) result in a more efficient use of the limited Government staff
in preparing, supervising, and administering the project;
(iii) provide safer and more convenient service; and
(iv) prevent any hindrance (resulting in higher vehicle operating
cost) during subsequent construction.
5.09      Sensitivity tests show that the ER would remain satisfactory if
construction costs were higher and benefits lower than estimated, or if
part of the benefits were disregarded (Table 9). The average ER would
fall to 44% if benefits were 25% lower and to 45% if construction costs
were 15% higher than estimated. In addition, an extreme case was investi-
gated whereby benefits from passenger time savings (work and nonwork) were
completely eliminated. Under this assumption, the overall ER would be 38%.
C. Other Project Elements
5.10      Although benefits from the studies and training included in the
project are not quantifiable, they are considered justified since they will
permit increased efficiency in highway administration and assist the Govern-
ment in the necessary improvement, expansion, and maintenance of its highway
network.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      Agreement having been reached on the principal issues discussed
in Chapter III and IV, the project is recommended for a Bank loan of US$5.4
million to the Government for a 23-year term, including 3 years of grace.
