INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMDMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation oni a proposed
loan -to the Republic of Cyprus for the equivalent of $5.4 million to help
finance construction of the Nicosia to Morphou highway together with feasi--
bility studies and detailed engineering of other high priority highways, a
highway planning and organization study and studies of road user charges and
vehicle weight regulations. The loan would have a term of 23 years, includ-
ing 3 years of grace, with interest at 7.25% per annum.
PART I - THIE ECONOMY
2.        A "Memorandum on the Current Economic Position anid Prospects in
Cyprus" is being prepared and will be distributed to thc: Executive Directors.
separately. Country data are presented in Annex T.
3.        In spite of the difficult internal political situation which pre-
vailed during the 1960's, Cyprus has enjoyed a decade of rapid economic growth.
Substantial progress has been achieved and most of the targets laid down in
the First (1962-1966) and the Second (1967-1971) Five-Year Plans have been
fulfilled. The average rate of growth for the decade (about 7.1% cent per
annum) surpassed the targets set in both plans. During the two five year
plans, value added in agriculture has almost doubled due to the application
of new technologies, but with the more rapid expansion of the manufacturing
(to 12% of GDP) and tourism and other service sectors (to 54%), the share of
agriculture in GDP declined slightly to 19%. Mining, on the other hand, has
declined both in absolute and relative terms and, in the absence of new
discoveries, the future of this sector is uncertain. The major factors
behind the rapid growth of the economy are a high and rising rate of invest-
ment, a rapid increase in agricultural exports and a flexible fiscal and
monetary policy which not only helped to stimulate growth but also maintained
domestic price stability.
4.        Economic growth brought about changes in a number of other econ-
omic indicators. Employment in agriculture declined in absolute as well as
relative terms (from 42% in 1961 to 35% in 1971) while increasing in the
industry and service sectors. Value added per worker increased in all the
major sectors. The high rate of unemployment which characterized the economy
prior to 1960 has been reduced to below 1% in 1971. This achievement is all
the more impressive in view of the continuing fall in the number of emigrants
from 13,000 in 1961 to 2,000 in 1971. Shortages of labour are beginning to
be felt largely in higher and middle grade technical personnel and particularly
in the, dwelling construction and hotel industries. With a tight labour market,
there have been union demands for higher wages. A policy of keeping wage in-



-2-
creases in linie with productivity growth, while accepted in principle by all
parties, has proved difficult to carry out. The accelerating rise in. money
wages might make it difficult in the future to limit the rise in prices in
Cyprus to the rate of the recent past (2.5% per year on average).
5.       'Tle attainment of a sound balance of paymnents position by encour-
aging tourism and commodity exports and simultaneously reducing dependence
on foreign military expenditure has beel one of the main long-term objec-
tives of the First and Second Five Year Plans. Throughout the two plan
periods, the overall balance of payments has been in surplus despite an in-
creasing deficit in merchandise trade which rose fromn Cb 18 million in 1961
..o Ch49 million in 1971.  During this period, merchandise imports increased
bv 12% per year. Imports of capital goods and raw material components accounted
for most of the expansion in the import bill, and their relative share in total
imports increased significantly while the share of consumer goods declined,
indicating a moderate success of the pol'icy of import substitution pursued
by the Government. Merchandise exports or. the other hand have increased at
an annual rate of 11% during 1961-1971 while foreign exchange receipts from
toutism increased by 17.1% per year during the same period.   As a result of
the increased surplus in invisibles and of net capital inflows, total foreign
exchange reserves increased from US$67 million in 1961 to US$285 million
in 1971, equivalent to 12 months of imports of goods and services. A rela-
tively high level of reserves is important for Cyprus in view of the potential
vulnerability of its balance of pavments to internal political developments.
6.        In spite of an increase in current expenditures during the Second
Five-Year Plan, the Government has managed to generate sufficient surpluses
in its current budgets over the Plan period to finance 85% of public sector
development expenditures. Between 1967 and 1971, Government revenues as a
percentage of GDP increased from 17.4 to 18.2 while current expenditures
increased from 13% to 15%. Development expenditure by the Government in-
creased from 3, to 5% of GDP during the same period.
7.        During the past decade much has been achieved in the field of
social services. Health services have been improved significantly and the
number of doctors and hospitals have increased. Considerable progress has
been made in the field of education by increasing the number of schools and
teachers.  Primary school enrollment has reachect 100% of the relevant age
group and the teacher/pupil ratio has dropped from 1:37 in 1961 to 1:30 in
1971.  Elementary education up to the age of 12 is at present free and com-
pulsory; and free education for the first three years of secondary schooling
was introduced in 1972. It is envisaged that by 1974 secondary schooling
will be completely free.
8.        The Third Five-Year Plan, which covers t1he period 1972-1976, pro-
poses to continue the strategy of the earlier plans, and focuses on the further
development of agriculture, manufacturing and tourism togetlher with associated
infrastructure needs. Continuing emphasis will be placed on increasing ex-
ports to maintain a strong balance of paym ents position. The plan envisages
a 7.1% annual rate of growth of GDP. Agriculture is expected to grow by 7.3%
per annum while manufacturing is projected to grow by 12a. However, further



- 3 -
decline in the value added in the mining sector is envisaged. Foreign exclange
receipts from tourism are expected to continue to increase rapidly during the
plan period. In order to achieve these objectives, the plan provides for total
fixed investment of Cl 350 million compared with Cb 240 million realized during
the period 1967-71. Of this total, about Cb 120 million will be public and
CG 230 million private investment.
9.        Barring a major deterioration in the internal political situation,
growth prospects are expected to remain favorable. However, shortages of water,
long-term capital and manpower may constrain the pace of development in the
future. In particular, shortages of water for irrigation pose a serious
constraint for future development and the Cyprus Government is actively in-
vestigating the feasibility of establishing desalination plants. Prospects
for increased exports appear to be favorable in view of the impending rati-
fication of the association agreement with the Common Market.
10.       External public debt incurred by Cyprus over the past few years
has remained at a low level as a result of the Government policy of finan-
cing economic development largely from internal sources.   As of December 1972,
the total public debt outstanding amounted to about US$73.4 million of which
$40.8 million was disbursed. About 65% of the total debt was from interna-
tional organizations, mainly the Bank and, of the rest, 19.4% came from the
U.K., 10.0% from the Federal Republic of Germany and 2.7% from the U.S..
Debt service payments are estimated at $7 million in 1972 equal to 2.4%
of exports of goods and non factor services. A high growth rate of exports
and output and a low debt service ratio make Cyprus creditworthy for bor-
rowing substantial amounts on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CYPRUS
11.       Despite unsettled political conditions in recent years, the strength
of the Cyprus economy has made possible a continuity in Bank Group operations.
Loans have been made at a fairly even rate of one or two a year since FY67
and now total $51.5 million (net of cancellations), of which $21.1 millio-,
was undisbursed as of March 31, 1973. Although some projects have been de-
layed in the past, action has been taken to remedy this and progress is now
satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and I.F.C.
investments as of March 31, 1973 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       Bank Group lending in the past has concentrated on improving in-
frastructure and on bringing about necessary structural and institutional
reforms which would provide the basis for sound economic growth. Through the
power loans, the Bank has assisted in the consolidation and expansion of the
Electricity Authority. Improvement of port administration and operation
through the creation of a National Ports Authority, now underway, was one of
the objectives of Bank lending for the ports project, and the creation of
sewerage boards was an important element in the two sewerage projects. The



recent loan to the Cyprus Development Bank will help strengthen the m-ain
financial institution providing long--term finance to the private sector, thus
giving valuable support to the promotion of industrial exports and tourism,
the two most promising sectors in the economy for growth in earning foreign
exchange.
13.       There are no further loans under consideration for Cyprus in
FY73. Loans for projects under consideration for possible Bank financing in
future years would aim at strengthening the structural and institutional re-
forms initiated under existing loans.    Further lending is anticipated for
the Cyprus Development Bank, and for sewerage and roads. The Electricity
Authority should soon be in a position to mobilize its own requirements of
capital from revenues and other external sources, but Bank assistance might
be envisaged for a combined power and desalination project at present under
study by consultants. Consideration is also being givetn to providing assist-
ance to agriculture through more effective development and utilization of the
limited water resources available for irrigation on the island.
14.       IFC made its first investment in Cyprus in September 1972 amounting
to $0.4 million equity and $2.3 millioni loan for an expansion of the Cyprus Cement
Company (Limassol). A steel rolling mill and two hotel projects, still in the
preliminary stage of preparation, have been brought to IFC's attention.     These
may be suitable for financing after further study..
PART III - TRANSPORTATION IN CYPRUS
1,.       Transportation in Cyprus comprises roads, ports and a single inter-
natioral airport located at Nicosia.   The road network (see map) serves the
econotmy, which is highly dependent on foreign trade, by linking the capital
of Nicosia to the ports of Famagusta, Linassol and Larnaca, dnd by providi.ng
for the export of minerals from the inland areas through private mineral ports
locatEd to the north and south of the island.    Roads also link th2 principal
agcrictltural areas of the countrv to i'dcosia and the coastal ports.
lh.       Nicosia airport handled 83% of total international passenger traf-
fic ir 1970. Remaining passengers and one day visitors from cruise shi.ps
c{ame ashore at Famagusta and Limassol.  General cargo to and from the island
is harndld mainly at Famagusta and Limasso1l and petroleum products are im-
ported via Larnaca.   Total port freight traffic, exclusive of petroleum
products and mineral exports which amounted to 330,000 tons and about 920,000
tons respectively in 1970, grew on average at 9.5% per annum during the period
1966-70 and amounted to 1.6 million tons in 1970.    With the completion of the
Bank financed expansion of the port of Limassol and extension of the runway
at Nicosia airport financed by the Government, both port and airport facilities
should be adequate for some years to come. The capacity of the mnineral ports
is sufficient to cope with future mineral exports, which have remained constant
in volume since 1968.



17.       In contrast, the road network has not kept pace with the rapid
economic growth of the country and consequent increase in traffic. There
are about 5,200 miles of road on the island of which about 2,300 are paved
and the remainder gravel-surfaced. Although the road network is fairly
extensive and links all cities, villages and rural areas, its general con-
dition is poor. Less than 2% of the roads maintained by the Department of
Public Works, which is responsible for all main roads, have a pavement width
over 6 meters. In addition, many roads have poor alignment and other sub-
standard geometric and technical characteristics, and carry traffic exceeding
their capacity. Between 1967 and 1971, the vehicle fleet increased at an
average annual growth rate of 11%. Traffic growth rates on individual roads
varied but have been highest on the main roads radiating from Nicosia.
18.       Responsibility for construction and maintenance of highways is
shared by the Department of Public Works (D.P.W.) under the Ministry of Com-
munications and Works, the District Administration under the Ministry of
Interior, the Forestry Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and the
Municipalities. This division of responsibility has resulted in lack of co-
ordination and in duplication of efforts, equipment and facilities. Planning
of highway investments received little attention in the past although recently
D.P.W. has established a special division responsible for basic data collection
and preinvestment studies. Shortage of staff, which is general at the mid-
dle and junior engineer level, compels D.P.W. to continue employing consultants
for most of its preinvestment studies. The technical standard of road mainte-
nanice carried out by D.P.W. and other responsible authorities is generally good
but is handicapped by lack of funds.
19.       In order to identify and overcome problems which arise from the
present division of responsibility for highway construction and maintenance,
the Government engaged consultants in 1972 to review the existing road ad-
ministration and policies of highway planning, construction and maintenance.
Following their recommendation, the Government intends to centralize road
administration under the Ministry of Communications and Works (para 29).
20.       From 1968-71, expenditure on transportation amounted to Ch 12.3
million or about 30% of total development expenditures by Government, of
which CL4.8 million was spent on highways. During this period, investments
in ports and, to a lesser extent, on the airport, grew quickly while road
investments actually declined until the current budget year and moreover have
been lower than the funds allocated by the Government. This level of road
investment has been insufficient to provide for the highway improvements
necessary to handle the rapid growth in traffic. The consultants' report
(see para 30) makes detailed recommendations concerning the program for devel-
opment and improvement of the highway network and has identified a backlog
of high priority projects which the Government has agreed should be financed
over the period 1972-81. Expenditure on highways envisaged by the Government
during the third development plan period (1972-76), amounts to Cbll.5 million
or about double the average annual expenditure under the program in the preceding
four years. Institutional improvements, strengthening of staff and central-
ization of planning and responsibility (para 29) should now make this increase
possible.



- 6 -
21.       Road user taxation policy is not related specifically to investments
in the highway network, but the Government levies taxes to raise general public
revenues. Taxes on highway users consist of taxes and duties on vehicles and
gasoline and registration fees. Total annual collections from all user taxes
were on the average about 7 times the total annual expenditure on roads in
1969-71. At the request of the Government, the proposed project includes a
study of road user charges and regulations to determine future revenue po-
tential and to examine the merits of possible modification of the existing
tax structure.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the
report entitled "Appraisal of a Highway Project - Cyprus" (No. 106a-CY)
dated May 1, 1973 which is being distributed separately. A Loan and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III.
23.       The project was identified by a Bank highway mission wlhich vis-
ited Cyprus in December 1969. Project preparation was carried out by the
Government with the assistance of consultants.   The project was appraised
in September 1972 and negotiations took place in Washington in April
1973. The Cyprus delegation was headed by Mr. Kazamias, Director General
of the Ministry of Communications and Works (M.C.W.) and included repre-
sentatives of the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Public Works
(D.P.W.).
24.       The project consists of:
(a)  construction of a four lane divided highway between Nicosia
and Morphou (32 km), including supervision by consultants;
(b) study of highway planning and organization including the
preparation of a highway improvement and maintenance
program;
(c)  feasibility studies covering 170 km. of new roads and de-
tailed engineering of about 90 km. of high priority road
sections;
(d) studies of road user charges and vehicle weight regulations;
and
(e)  training of D.P.W. staff in highway planning and design,
construction supervision and highway maintenance.
25.       The total cost of the project (including physical and price con-
tingencies but excluding right of way acquisition) is estimated at $10.5 mil-
lion of which $5.4 million will be foreign exchange. A detailed breakdown
of project costs is given in Annex III. The proposed loan will finance the



- 7 -
foreign exchange component (51 percent of total costs) net of duties and
taxes, and the local currency costs will be financed by the Government.
The Government will also finance right of way acquisition, estimated at about
$1.0 million.
26.       The proposed highway will relieve the con.gestion on the existing
road connecting Nicosia with the important agricultural center of Morphou,
(see map) and will cater for the expected growth in traffic. The project
road carries agricultural produce from the Morphou Plain to Nicosia for local
consumption and to Famagusta for export. It also provides access to the
increasingly important summer and winter resorts in the Troodos Mountains
and serves the numerotus residential areas, towns and villages along the way.
In addition, minerals, pyrite mixes and chrome mined in the Troodos Mountains
passes along the road for export through the mineral ports on Morphou Bay.
27.       The existing two-lane road is the most heavily traffickecl on the
island. The section linking Nicosia to the airport junction (about 2 km.) was
constructed in 1966-68 to a width of 6.5 m. and carried some 8,300 vehicles
per day in 1972; thereafter the road to Horphou narrows to 5.5 m. and
carried between 4,400 and 5,700 vehicles per day.   The road is heavily con-
gested, passes through a number of villages, and is poorlv aligned for most
of the way. The new highway will be built as a four-lane divided highway
with access roads to Nicosia airport and villages en route (12 km) and will
reduce the distance between Nicosia and Morphou by about 4 kin. From Nicosia
to the airport the existing road will be followed and two additional lanes
constructed.  The main section (30 km.) from the airport junction to Morpliot
will be built on a new alignment. After the highway is opened, the existLng
road will be maintained for local traffic.   Constroction work on the Nicosia
to Morphou highway is expected to start in the last quarter of 1973 and to
be completed by late 1976.
28.       Consulting Services.   A firm of consuiltants was appointed by the
Government in 1972 to carry out a highway planning and organization stuidy.
Their terms of reference, which the Bank assisted in preparing, included
(a) review of detailed engineering and bidding documents for the proposed
Nicosia to Morphou highway and assistance in preparation of prequalification
of contractors; (b) review of the present roads administration and existing
practices of highway planning, construction and maintenance; and (c) prepara-
tion of a program for the development and improvement of the highway network
over the period 1972-81.
29.       The recommendations on organization contained in the consultant's
draft final report, which was completed in Februarv 1973, have been discussed
with the Cyprus authorities. The Government has agreed to reorganize its
highway administration by centralizing its road operations in the Ministry
of Communications and Works in accordance with procedures to he established
in consultation with the Bank. As a first step, the Government has already
decided to transfer full responsibility for all inter-urban paved roads to
the D.P.W. In addition, the GoverTment has agreed to review the organization
of the D.P.W. and its District Offices and will, according to the result of
the review, take appropriate measures to strengthen D.P.W. staff.



- 8 -
30.       The consultant's report identified a number of priority projects
which are reconmended for financing over the period 1972-81 and concluded
that construction on some of these shoul.d. begin in 1975. Accordingly, the
Bank has agreed, as part of the proposed project, to f-inance feasibility
studies of the Nicosia to Famagusta and Nicosia to Limassol highways and
of the Nicosia, Famagusta and Limassol bypasses (170' km) and detailed engi-
neering of about 90 km of the highest priority road sections which could
form the basis of a future Bank project.
31.       Consultants will be appointed by the Government t:o carry out the
feasibility studies and detailed engineering mentioned above and also to carry
out the studies of road user charges and vehicle weight regulations, the con-
clusions of which will be discussed with the Bank. Supervision of construction
of the Nicosia to Morphou highway will be carried out by D.P.W. with some as-
sistance by consultants. All consultant services under the project will be
provided by qualified and experienced consultants satisfactory to the Bank.
The D.P.W. will participate in the studies carried out by consultants by pro-
viding qualified professional, technical and supporting staff.
32.       Disbursements and Procurement.   The loan will be disbursed agaiinst
100% of the foreign exchange cost of consultant services and training and 50%
of the total construction cost of the Nicosia to Morphou highway. At the
request of the Government, the Bank proposes to finance retroactively the
foreign exchange costs incurred from January 1972, estimated at $150,000,
for the highway planning and organizatiorn study, which includes review of the
detailed engineering for the proposed project road.    The estimated schedule
of disbursements is shown in Annex III.
33.       The contract for the proposed road construction woul.d be awarded
to prequalif ied contractors in accordance with international competitive
bidding procedures.   The size of the contract 4S expecited to attract exper-
ienced firms.
3-i.      Eccnomic Justification.   The project road will allenrta-e-. congestion
:,! existing roads and provide a modern route which will satisfy increasing
transporL dermiands in a country that has no alternative means of transport.
Its central location will benefit manv of the inhabitants of the island,
tourist resorts and producers of agricultural and mineral products.    Economic
evaluation of the project shows an economic rate of return on the proposed
investment of 53% based on the most probable estimtates of construiction and
vehicle operating costs, initial traffic growth and tiime savings. If pas-
serniger time savings are excluided from the benefit:,; the economic return would
he reduiced to 38%. The principal benefits that would result from the project
i:nclude savings in vehicle operating. and timne costs and additional capacity
for future growth of traffic. The project reinforces the road infrastructure
necessary for service activities whichi at present account for more than half
of (DP, Benefits accruing from training, feasibility studies and the highway
planning and organization study have not been quantified.    Thlese items are
justified since they will contribute to increasea efficiency in highway admin-
istration and assist Government in the necessary improvement and maintenance
of the highway network.

Loan of April 5, 1971 and US $1.9 million Loan of April 5, 1971; closing
dates March 31, 1975. As a result of delays in sewer construction, fol-
lowing a strike by the pipe supplier, progress of both projects is about
six months behind schedule. Contract prices are 20 percent below estimates,
and the loan for Nicosia has consequently been reduced by $0.8 million at
the request of the beneficiary.
Loan 830 Cyprus Development Bank: US $3.0 million Loan of June 19, 1972;
closing date June 30, 1974. The loan was declared effective in September
