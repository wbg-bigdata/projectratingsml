the preparation for, control of, and response to influenza pandemics and other infectious
disease emergencies in humans.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised project objective was to assist the Borrower in building its capacity to
respond to potential future infections of humans by HPAI and other zoonoses, and
preparing for, controlling and responding to influenza pandemics and other infectious
disease emergencies in humans.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which started in late 2003 in the
Southeast Asian countries, quickly spread over Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Between
February and May 2006, the first cases of H5N1 (or H5) infections in poultry or wild birds were
reported in 34 countries, historically marking the fastest and most extensive geographic spread of
the HPAI virus. In addition, June 2006 marked an increased evidence of human H5N1, including
cases of human-to-human transmission.

The HPAI situation in Romania: The first H5N1 virus in animals was detected in Tulcea county,
(east of the capital Bucharest) at the beginning of October 2005. This case was followed by 52
cases in nine other counties. This first wave of Avian Influenza (AI) in Romania lasted until
April 2006, followed by a second one in May 2006. While no human cases were experienced
during that period, about one million birds died or were culled, resulting in a total cost of disease
control and economic losses of around Euro 90 million. The outbreak resulted in market collapse
due to loss of consumer confidence. It also caused a significant effect on the country’s
agriculture sector and the economy as a whole.

The aggravated situation in the country, especially after the second wave of the outbreak,
revealed a number of major concerns:

(i) Weak bio-security, particularly in backyard poultry systems. Poultry production played an
increasingly important role in Romania’s agricultural sector, i.e., domestic production of poultry
meat at project design stage doubled compared to the year 2000. This production was mainly
based on small-holder (backyard) systems, in which 70 percent of the country’s poultry
population was kept.

(ii) Institutional weaknesses in the public veterinary institutions included the following
issues:

      (a)   Lack of proper monitoring at national level. Systematic investigation of the
            population for analyzing disease prevalence was carried out only in high risk areas.
            This was considered to be inadequate.

      (b)   The country lacked an active surveillance system. At project appraisal stage,
            Romania had in place a passive system, which was only reacting to reports of
            disease and testing dead or sick birds. Following the virus outbreaks, it became
            evident that there was a need for an active system for surveillance, which was going
            to increase samples tested.

      (c)   Lack of reliable epidemiologic information. The lack of reliable information
            hampered the development of rational, targeted disease control measures as well as
            slowed down containment of the disease.

      (d)   Weak information system for animal disease. The country lacked an integrated
            national system, including registration of poultry farms.
      (e)   Culling and disposal of carcasses. The disposal of carcasses did not meet the
            required safety level.


                                                 10
(iii) Issues in the Public Health Care System:

       (a)    A national plan and several government orders were already in place at project
              appraisal, constituting an acceptable strategic framework, including presentation of
              the information flows. However, the management process, including distribution of
              tasks, needed significant improvements. Furthermore, additional work was needed
              with regard to preparations for a possible flu pandemic and measures for reducing the
              virus effects.

       (b)    Although the existing surveillance system had proven to function properly, the risk of
              AI outbreaks spread in humans, especially in remote areas, imposed the need for
              capacity strengthening at the central and local level to effectively investigate and
              control outbreaks. The capacity of district and regional laboratories needed to be
              significantly upgraded to perform all major tests, while the National Influenza
              Reference laboratory needed to be upgraded to bio-safety level 31 (BSL-3).

       (c)    In the context of virus spread or a pandemic situation, existing hospital capacity
              needed significant improvement. Hence, establishment of intensive care units in
              seven regional hospital/health facilities was considered necessary. Furthermore,
              despite the access to the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) international
              stockpile of vaccines, Romania could not produce a significant share of vaccines
              required to cover the national needs. In order to meet its needs and be able to
              respond to a medium–size pandemic, the vaccine production unit at the Cantacuzino
              Institute (CI) needed major upgrading.

Rationale for Bank assistance: The justification for the Bank involvement was the Global
Public Goods aspect of the HPAI, one of many emerging and re-emerging zoonoses 2, and its
strong link to poverty reduction. HPAI control programs required a multi-disciplinary approach
to integrate technical, social, economic, political, policy, and regulatory issues in addressing a
complex problem. The Bank was well-placed to build upon its knowledge of multi-disciplinary
approaches needed in the project, which drew on evidence and lessons learned in the various
regions regarding emergency preparedness responses and multi-disciplinary approaches.

The Bank’s experience with multisectoral emergency response and risk-mitigation projects gave
it considerable qualifications in bringing together the relevant ministries, government agencies,
and the donor community, in understanding and addressing the social and economic impact, and
in assuring high level political coordination. Given the Bank’s work with the Food and

  A Biosafety level is the level of the bio-containment precautions required to isolate dangerous biological
agents in an enclosed facility. The levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level 1 to the
highest at level 4. Bio Safety Level 3 (BSL-3) is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching, research, or
production facilities in which work is done with indigenous or exotic agents, which may cause serious or
potentially lethal disease after inhalation. It includes various bacteria, parasites, and viruses that can cause
severe to fatal disease in humans but for which treatments exist. BSL-3 facility is expected to improve the
country’s capacity for surveillance of pandemic flu and other infections.

  Zoonose is any infectious disease that can be transmitted from non-human animals, both wild and
domestic, to humans or from humans to non-human animals (the latter is sometimes called reverse zoonosis
or anthroponosis).

relief, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overall development objective of the project at the time of Board approval was to reduce the
threat posed to humans and the poultry sector in Romania by HPAI and other zoonoses, and to
support the preparation for, control of, and response to influenza pandemics and other infectious
disease emergencies in humans.

Key indicators. The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following three
outcome indicators as identified in the PAD:

(i)     evidence of institutional mechanisms for effective implementation of appropriate disease
        contingency plans;

(ii)    evidence of an effective surveillance system for both animals and humans for HPAI and
        other zoonoses; and

(iii)   evidence of increased capacities to handle human cases of infectious diseases.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

As further explained in Section 1.7, the Project was restructured in June 2009.

The following Table shows the original and revised PDOs and their respective indicators:

3 The  World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The need to fight animal diseases at the global level
led to the creation of the Office International des Epizooties through the international agreement signed on
January 25, 1924. In May 2003, the Office became the World Organization for Animal Health but kept its
historical acronym OIE.

The restructuring was undertaken for the following reasons:

•       To remove the animal health component (Component 1) and related management and
        communication activities from Component 3;
•       To reallocate part of the resources from the animal health to the human health component;
•       To revise the Project Development Objective (PDO) and results framework by deleting
        objectives and results related to animal health activities from the relevant sections; and
•       To remove some other indicators and provide greater specificity or clarity to those
        remaining.

The component related to animal health was removed at Government request, due to
implementation problems and the desire to shift priorities to human health.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The expected beneficiaries of the original project included:

•       Smallholder poultry farmers who would receive competitive grants to improve their on-
        farm biosecurity.
•       Poultry breeding farm owners who would receive compensation for culled poultry.
•       Veterinary networks, laboratory systems, disease surveillance and extension systems.
•       Institutional beneficiaries including ANSVSA (National Sanitary Veterinary and Food
        Safety Authority) and MOH and their staff and their laboratories, surveillance and
        inspection services, and the infectious disease reference hospitals.
•       Cantacuzino Institute which would receive funding for the purchase of equipment and
        infrastructural rehabilitations.
•       Consumers and other stakeholders who would receive information and public awareness
        training to guard against HPAI.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had three components, with a total value of Euro 37.5 million, out of which the Bank
was expected to finance Euro 29.6 million and the Government to contribute Euro 7.9 million.

COMPONENT 1: ANIMAL HEALTH (total cost: Euro 9.15 million). It included nine sub-
components:

                                                  13
(i) Strengthening the Institutional Framework (Euro 1.148 million). Key areas of support
under this sub-component were: (a) evaluation of National Veterinary Services, and (b)
Strengthening Veterinary and Food Safety Institutions.
(ii) Improving HPAI Prevention and Control Planning (Euro 0.355 million). The sub-
component would finance technical assistance for supporting the process of preparing the draft
contingency plans (produced by the Government) and developing necessary detailed
implementation guidelines and manual for relevant agencies and services.
(iii) Strengthening Monitoring and Surveillance Systems (Euro 0.188 million). The key
activities included collection of samples around outbreak areas, as well as routine investigation of
dead wild birds.
(iv) Strengthening Diagnosis Capacity (Euro 8.142 million). This sub-component was to
support the existing veterinary laboratories for the increased work load under active surveillance
scheme, through purchasing of laboratory equipment and consumables as well as technical
assistance and training aimed at increasing the existing capacity for virology tests, screening
surveys for confirmation of the disease and differentiation of AI sub-types.
(v) Strengthening Animal Disease Information Systems (Euro 2.236 million). The sub-
component was to support development of an integrated national animal disease information
system to enable the country participate in global disease information and comply with its
obligations as a member of OIE (The World Organization for Animal Health).
(vi) Strengthening Applied Veterinary Research Capacity (Euro 0.310 million) The activities
under the sub-component included technical assistance to support ANSVSA to design the
research program on epidemiology, bird migration, and ecology as well as assist with the
construction and refurbishment plans for the physical facilities of the Research Center.
(vii) Targeting Virus Eradication at the Source (Euro 1.475 million). Activities under the sub-
component included purchasing and operations of containers where CO2 was applied in an
acceptable manner, as well as purchasing and operation of mobile incinerators.
(viii) Supporting Poultry Vaccination Campaign (Euro 0.103 million). This sub component
included technical assistance and training for developing the country’s vaccination policy and
implementation manuals, as well as training for Government officials to strengthen their capacity
for vaccination campaigns and post-vaccination monitoring.
(ix) Improving Bio-security in Poultry Production and Trade (Euro 0.293 million). Activities
included: (a) supporting awareness campaigns and knowledge transfer activities; and (b)
providing technical assistance for a comprehensive poultry sector assessment.

COMPONENT 2: HUMAN HEALTH (total cost: Euro 19.8 million). It was composed of
three main sub-components, as follows:

(i) Enhancing Public Health Program Planning and Coordination (Euro 0.160 million)
through providing technical assistance and funding for research, conferences, and workshops.
(ii) Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems (Euro 1.267 million).
Activities included: (a) minor civil works and supply of additional security devices, aimed at
upgrading the National Influenza Laboratory to BSL 3; and (b) supply of critical equipment and
staff training, for strengthening the regional public health laboratories.


                                                14
(iii) Strengthening Health System Response Capacity (Euro 18.297 million). Activities
included: (a) purchasing of equipment for intensive care units in the two main infectious diseases
hospitals in Bucharest, establishment of isolation and intensive care units in seven regional
centers for infectious diseases (namely: Brasov, Craiova, Cluj, Iasi, Timisoara, and Targu Mures);
and (b) strengthening the capacity at the CI, aimed at increasing production of vaccines to up to
25 million doses, in compliance with the required Good Manufacturing Practice Standards
(GMP).

COMPONENT 3: PUBLIC AWARENESS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND
IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT. The component was to support two main areas, as follows:

(i) Public Awareness and Communications (Euro 1.641 million). The activities were to
support: (a) technical assistance and training for the communication staff of ANSVSA (National
Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority); (b) development of the integrated strategy and
related action plan for human and animal health, and (c) delivery of a number of information
campaigns aiming at obtaining public support as well as wide participation in the reporting and
monitoring process.
(ii) Implementation Support, Monitoring and Evaluation (Euro 1.824 million). The project
was to finance: (a) incremental costs of the two Project Management Units (PMUs) in terms of
operating costs and staff; (b) studies and manuals; and (c) surveys for monitoring and evaluation
purposes at the Ministry of Health 4 (MOH) and ANSVSA.

1.6 Revised Components

At the time of project restructuring in July 2009, the Animal Health component and related
management and communication activities from Component 3 were cancelled. See Section 1.7
for details.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

(i) Partial Suspension of Disbursement. Due to ANSVSA’s inability to effectively manage
the implementation of the Project, there were significant delays in implementation. In addition,
there were a number of unresolved governance issues related to some procurement processes.
Thus, in November 2008, at the time of the Mid-Term Review, the Bank partially suspended
disbursements of the loan as it related to activities managed by ANSVSA, with the exception of
ongoing salary contracts for PMU staff and for some lots for which contracts had already been
awarded.
(ii)    Project Restructuring. The project was restructured in July 2009, which included the:

        •   removal of the Animal Health component and related management and communication
            activities from Component 3;
        •   reallocation of part of the freed resources from the Animal Health to the Human Health
            component;

    Ministry of Public Health (MOH) was the previous name of the Ministry of Health (MOH).


                                                   15
      •   revising the Project Development Objective (PDO) and results framework in that
          objectives and results related to animal health activities were deleted from the relevant
          sections; and
      •   removal of some other indicators and amendment of others to provide greater
          specificity or clarity.

The restructuring was undertaken pursuant to a request by the Borrower in March 2009, for
reallocation and partial cancellation of the Loan proceeds. Pursuant to this request, the Bank
cancelled 7.32 million Euro of the Loan in April 2009, leaving 3.9 million Euro available from
the ANSVSA-managed activities for reallocation to the Human Health component as requested
by the Borrower. This amount of 3.9 million Euro was allocated to support the upgrading of the
vaccine production capacity at the CI, which, in light of the emergence of H1N1 at that time, was
even more crucial.

The request by the Borrower was made against the following background:

•     First, ANSVSA, the institution responsible for the implementation of the Animal Health
      component, had proven unable to effectively manage the implementation of the Project in
      accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement and the Project Operational
      Manual, resulting in significant implementation delays that made the achievement of the
      (related part of the) PDO unlikely. ANSVSA-managed parts of the project were placed
      under suspension in November 2008, and the corrective action required for the Bank to
      consider the lifting of the suspension was not taken by the set deadline of March 31, 2009.
•     Second, the MOH – responsible for the implementation of Component 2 of the project –
      had requested additional resources to cover a cost overrun in actual bids and to cover
      expenditures for additional items not foreseen at appraisal, which were needed to complete
      the agreed activities under that component.
(iii) Project Schedule. As part of the restructuring, the closing date of the loan was extended
for 12 months from December 30, 2009 to December 30, 2010 (Government request of March
2009). The exact timing of the renovation of the CI vaccine production line was difficult to
anticipate. The Institute was then producing the H1N1 vaccines for the MOH and neighboring
countries had indicated that they would be interested in procuring vaccines from Romania.
Production was likely to continue until March or April 2010, and only when this was done could
the civil works start.
In September 2010, the Government requested a second extension of the loan closing date. The
extension was meant to allow the completion of the remaining civil works at the CI. However, in
late December 2010, the Bank reached a decision not to extend the closing date because project
implementation was not satisfactory.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Background. The Project was prepared and approved in response to the emerging threat
of Avian Influenza and other zoonoses worldwide and acute outbreaks of Avian Influenza in
Romania. Recognizing the need to act effectively and fast, the Project was financed through an
Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) under the Global Program for Avian Influenza Control and
Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI). Under the GPAI, individual countries
could obtain separate loans (and credits and grants, depending on the specific country case) to

                                               16
finance national programs. The GPAI was endorsed with a comprehensive list of eligible
activities and set out the criteria for participation in this global program.

The Bank's emergency policy and business procedures, OP/BP 8.50 was applicable to this
Project; and it was financed as a new and self-standing operation on standard IBRD terms. The
project was initially working jointly on animal and human health under the leadership of the
Sustainable Development (SD) staff with a Human Development (HD) staff member managing
the Human Health component. The SD Task Team Leader (TTL) managed the restructuring of
the project, which included canceling the Animal Health component of the project. Subsequently,
the team leadership was naturally moved to the only sector still involved (HD-Health). The HD
team member who had been involved in the project from the beginning remained as a team
member for the entire duration of the project, and consequently, the transition was smooth.

Lessons of Earlier Operations Taken Into Account. The following general lessons learned from
some of the emergency projects supported by the Bank in various regions were listed in the PAD
as being of relevance to the design of the project: (i) emergency projects should avoid policy
conditionality; (ii) project design must be simple and take into account a realistic assessment of
the existing capacity of the Borrower and other stakeholders, e.g., Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs); (iii) a speedy appraisal and approval are crucial to provide a prompt
response and a substantial contribution to project success; (iv) procurement arrangements should
be finalized at an early stage but need to remain flexible; (v) mitigation and prevention measures
should be included in the design to minimize impacts of a possible recurrence of the disaster; and
(vi) realistic assessments should be made of the counterparts’ absorptive capacity, as well as of
the effectiveness of communications and coordination mechanisms among all relevant
stakeholders. Some of these were reflected in the project design (including i, iii, and v), while
others (ii, iv, and vi) unfortunately were not and ultimately impacted negatively on the
implementation and results of the project.

Adequacy of Government Commitment. At the outset, the Government’s commitment and the
existence of appropriate structures and mechanisms for the fight against HPAI were evident, inter
alia, in the establishment of a National Disease Command Center, chaired by the Prime Minister;
the existence of effective control measures demonstrated during the first wave of outbreaks in
October 2005 through April 2006; the rapid detection of the second wave of outbreaks and efforts
to detect the source of infection; and the absence of human infections.

The Government had demonstrated full commitment in fighting AI and had shown good practice
and efficiency in containing the disease and closing all outbreaks during both the first and the
second AI wave, both prior to project effectiveness. The level of transparency was also
outstanding, and the information to the public was beneficial in avoiding any human case
transmissions. The national level institutional structures and command lines were established and
Romania had planned for improved preparedness and response capacity.

The Government had set up emergency response structures at the national and local levels for the
management of HPAI control. The Anti-Epizootic Command Center at the national level and the
animal disease command centers at the county and municipality levels formed the backbone of
the HPAI emergency institutional structure, activated in times of disease outbreak.

As such, the Bank team assessed commitment to be high and designed a comprehensive set of
activities under the project.



                                               17
2.2 Implementation

The project was approved on September 8, 2006. The Loan Agreement was signed on October 5,
2006, and the original effectiveness date was agreed for February 2, 2007. As a result of delays
in Parliament’s sessions, an extension of the effectiveness deadline was granted, and the project
became effective on March 19, 2007.

There were delays in starting the implementation of project activities (even after eight months of
effectiveness, the disbursement ratio was only 0.9 percent) due to inefficiencies in institutional
decision making, mainly from the ANSVA side.

Once project activities got underway, the following factors affected implementation:
(i)   H1N1 crisis. The first case of H1N1 (swine flu) was detected in Romania in October 2009.
Between October 2009 and January 2010, the country had a total of 7,000 laboratory confirmed
cases of H1N1, including 500 pregnant women. The outbreak of H1N1 distracted the
Government from its earlier focus on avian influenza as it understandably gave higher priority in
responding to the more immediate H1N1 pandemic.

(ii) ANSVSA's institutional weaknesses. When the project was prepared and negotiated, the
Bank had a very serious and committed partner in ANSVSA. It had many staff members
experienced in the implementation of Bank projects, which included the ongoing Modernizing the
Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (MAKIS), Agricultural Pollution Control
Project (APCP), Rural Finance Project (RFP), Forestry Development Project (FDP), Rural
Development Project (RDP), Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, and Hazard Risk Mitigation and
Emergency Preparedness Project. However, immediately after the project was approved and
signed, ANSVSA’s president was changed and the new one brought in a new management team,
which was much less interested in the Avian Flu project. The President was changed several
times throughout the project implementation, and this triggered changes at lower levels as well.

Furthermore, problems between ANSVSA and the Project Management Unit (PMU), including
the lack of delegation of authority and competences to the PMU, very centralized decision
making processes, limited collaboration between the technical departments of ANSVSA and the
PMU, weak procurement capacity, and cumbersome internal procedures in ANSVSA all
contributed to significant implementation challenges in the Animal Health component.

(iii) MOH’s institutional weaknesses. The Human Health component also suffered from
institutional, coordination and managerial weaknesses at the level of MOH and of its institutes
and agencies (CI and Matei Bals Hospital), and as a result, progress on the Human Health
activities was also very slow at first. The change of the State Secretary in charge of the
component in 2008 also created some delays in the project activities. The positions of PMU
Director, assistant manager, procurement expert, and M&E expert remained vacant from 2009
until the end of the project. As a result, the PMU Technical Coordinator functioned as the de-
facto Director from that time until the end of the project and had to manage multiple
responsibilities. The Financial Manager also resigned in late 2010. Attempts to hire a new
person for this position failed, and the FM functions were subsequently carried out by the
Accountant for the last few months of project implementation.




                                               18
(iv)   Problems at CI. The problems at CI included the following:

       (a)   Vaccine Production Unit.

             •    Since the CI produces the stock of the annual seasonal influenza and other
                  vaccines, and this vaccine must be produced every year 5, rehabilitation works 6
                  (estimated to last 4 to 6 months) could only be carried out once production had
                  stopped. However, the initiation of the civil works was dependent on the
                  availability of completed technical designs, which in turn were delayed due to the
                  failure to resolve a misunderstanding with the firm contracted to prepare the
                  technical designs for the vaccine production line. The firm completed
                  approximately 90 percent of the designs, but the remaining part was needed, as
                  otherwise none of the works could start at all even with the 90 percent of that
                  done.
             •    Further aggravating this situation was the suspension of the CI’s accreditation for
                  vaccine production by the National Drug Agency in April 2010. A temporary
                  accreditation was eventually provided in May 2010, after some remedial actions
                  were taken. Since vaccine production for that year had not been completed at the
                  time of the suspension, this further delayed the civil works, which at the time
                  were anticipated to begin in the summer of 2010. However production of
                  seasonal influenza vaccine was only completed in October 2010, by which time,
                  the project closing date was less than three months away. As a result, the
                  rehabilitation works could not start under the project.

       (b)   BSL 3 Upgrade.
                  With regard to civil works for upgrading of the National Influenza Laboratory
                  (NIL) to Bio Safety Level 3, the contract with the construction company was
                  signed on October 12, 2009, and the works started soon after. However,
                  construction was suspended in December 2009, due to the lack of Government
                  permits for the construction. A building permit was finally obtained on May 6,
                  2010, and the Government approved the investment. However, by then, the
                  contracts signed by the CI with the site supervisors expired, as initially,
                  construction was expected to be completed by April 2010. As the CI no longer
                  had the budget to support this, the MOH PMU had to contract a new site
                  supervisor to monitor the three sites for the civil works, resulting in a cumulative
                  delay in implementation of about six months.




5
  The production of the bulk influenza vaccine begins after the WHO announces the composition of the
vaccine (the virus strains). This happens usually around mid-February and takes normally six months (i.e.,
until mid-August). The filling of this bulk product into ampoules is done in July-August.
6
  The works were in two parts: one for the vaccine production area which was affected by the issue above
(i.e., incomplete designs). Second part was rehabilitation of the vaccine filling area; which required
vaccine production to stop or be finished for that year in order for the civil works to be done. Both part 1
and part 2 works needed vaccine production to not be in process for works to start, but part 1 could not start
anyway without the designs.




                                                     19
(v) Lack of intra-agency coordination. The absence of an effective Steering Committee was one
of the critical bottlenecks (and non-compliance issues), which prevented effective cross-sectoral
coordination and collaboration in implementation of the project activities.
(vi) Lack of Government commitment. During the life of the project, as the avian flu crisis
subsided and the H1N1 (swine flu) virus emerged, commitment from the Government to this
project somewhat waned, as it did in many countries. Further, Romania became an EU member
on January 1, 2007, and stated its intention to work more closely with the European Commission
and less with the Bank and the IMF, thus redefining the relationship between the Bank and the
Government – a fact that affected the smooth implementation of this project and indeed the entire
Romania portfolio.

(vii) 2010 Budget and priorities. Due to the economic crisis and the pressure it put on public
finances in Romania, the share of the 2010 budget earmarked for projects funded by international
organizations was lower than the amount initially requested by the PMUs. The budget for this
Project was short by Euro 3.4 million. As a consequence, funding for the civil works needed for
the rehabilitation of the vaccine production unit at the CI was not available for that year.

The Bank conducted a Midterm Review (MTR) in November 2008, jointly with the implementing
agencies and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). The objective of the MTR was: (i) to
assess progress made in meeting the project’s objectives; (ii) to select activities under the Animal
Health (ANSVSA) component that could still be implemented in the remaining lifetime of the
project; (iii) to agree on the use of project resources that would become available after dropping
Animal Health activities that could not be implemented before loan closing; (iv) to clarify the role
of the Bank in the financing of the construction of a new building for the disease control center
proposed by ANSVSA; and (v) to consider the reallocation of some project resources from the
Animal Health to the Human Health component, in order to provide for adequate funding for
agreed activities. The MTR mission also discussed in great detail the implications of the
suspension of the loan related to non-fulfillment of most of the activities under the responsibility
of ANSVSA and the actions by ANSVSA required for the Bank to consider the lifting of the
suspension.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. The initial results framework tried to measure all possible aspects of the project
activities under Animal Health and Human Health components. As a result, there were too many
indicators which were difficult to monitor. Targets were set for these indicators, but they were
broad and, as a result, it was difficult to quantify the progress made in comparison to the baseline.
At the time of restructuring, those indicators which related to animal health activities or which
were difficult to monitor were dropped. The task team also tried to introduce some quantitative
elements. For example, a quantitative target was introduced on the vaccine production prior to
the equipment and after equipment installation to show that functioning did improve.

M&E implementation. The indicators were used to monitor progress on implementation but by
virtue of the fact that they were process-oriented, could not have shown what results were being
achieved. The restructuring of the project dropped indicators which had become irrelevant due to
the new nature of the project or were difficult to monitor, but an opportunity to revisit the results
framework was missed and the new shorter version was approved by the Board. Soon after, an
in-depth analysis by the new task team revealed the shortcomings of the indicators, but at that
point, given that the project was about to close and had just been restructured, the team, in


                                                 20
consultation with management, decided not to undertake a formal restructuring for the purpose of
improving the results framework.

M&E utilization. Project data was used to restructure the project. For example, the task team
monitored the implementation progress, and the activities which were not making satisfactory
progress were cancelled at the time of restructuring.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard issues. All works financed by the project were implemented in accordance with the
health and safety requirements, and in compliance with the local and Bank’s environmental
safeguards.

Fiduciary issues. The project complied with fiduciary covenants during implementation. Internal
control arrangements were in place, and adequate financial management system and records were
maintained. The audit opinions were clean and no significant internal control issues were
mentioned.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

(i) The rehabilitation of the vaccine production unit and rehabilitation of the vaccine filling
station, which could not be completed before the project closing date of December 31, 2010, have
been transferred to the ongoing Bank-financed Health Sector Reform Project – Phase II. It is
expected that these activities would be completed before the closing of this project on December 15,
2011.

(ii) Bio Safety Level 3. Investments made on rehabilitation and equipment are in place and they
are fully functional. The completion of the civil works to upgrade the National Influenza Lab to a
BSL 3 was one of the main activities at the CI that was completed before the project ended. The
remaining activity that was not done was the BSL 3 certification by an external agency. The CI
had already identified in early 2010 three relevant agencies in Europe that could perform the
certification activities for them, and the CI management has given assurances that they will be
doing this task. Since this is the one remaining step to enable the lab to function 7, it is highly
likely that this job will be done by the CI.

(iii) CI’s GMP license. The CI was granted a temporary GMP license in May 2010, after taking
the requisite remedial action, which included the installation of a separate water and purification
system. Vaccine production resumed that same month 8 . Further, the Manufacturing



7
  The rehabilitation of the lab to make it BSL 3 only finished at the end of December 2010. So there was
nothing to be certified prior to that. The certification can now be done this year. The lab consists of many
parts, which are already functioning and are certified. What is required now is for the certification to be
extended to this upgraded part- the BSL 3.
8
  The CI has many parts; one is the National Influenza laboratory, which does testing, etc. The other part is
the vaccine production facility, which is the part that had its GMP license temporarily revoked. They have
since installed the water purification system for the vaccine production and it is functioning, and the
national drug agency renewed their GMP earlier this year. GMP license is awarded for three years, but
each year, an inspection is made to ensure that certain basic things are in compliance, so next year, they
will get another inspection.


                                                    21
Authorization 9 issued by the National Regulatory Authority (the National Medicines Agency) is
renewed yearly, based on a follow-up inspection. The last such follow-up inspection was in
February 2011 and the Authorization was renewed without objection.

(iv)   Follow-on project: No follow-on project is anticipated nor recommended.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Moderately Satisfactory. The project objective was clear, relevant, and important to Romania’s
public health. It is timely and appropriate to the needs of the country's health sector at that time.

One of the lessons identified in the PAD as important for emergency projects was to keep a
simple design. However, the task team designed a project with multiple sub-components, many
of which were not implemented. The strong commitment of the counterparts at the outset and the
relatively strong capacity in the implementing agencies may have given assurances to the task
team that a very comprehensive project would be achievable.

The design of the project featured a combination of civil works, capacity building, and
communications. The civil works components in turn relied on Government permits, technical
design companies, and, in the case of vaccine production, on licensing process; which all incurred
significant delays. Most of the reasons were beyond the project’s control. At the end of the
project, most of the planned civil works had not been undertaken (with the exception of works
related to BSL3 labs, which was completed successfully). The capacity building elements of the
project fared somewhat better. Contingency plans for avian flu pandemic were prepared and
tested in Tulcea County. Meanwhile, the communications aspects of the project were not
undertaken, but the Government was successful in managing communication by itself.

Implementation arrangements were relatively straightforward, with a single agency responsible
for each of the two main components – Animal Health and Human Health. Both PMUs had
managed other World Bank projects, but many problems arose between the PMU and the
technical departments in ANSVSA, as well as between ANSVSA’s legal and technical
departments, and between these departments and the World Bank. Furthermore, there was a high
turnover of staff in ANSVSA PMU and the positions remained unfilled for a long time.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Moderately Unsatisfactory. The project was moderately successful in achieving its objectives in
relation to the human health activities. As a result of the project, Romania’s human health
services are currently in a better shape to deal with outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as
Avian Influenza and H1N1. Investments made under the project have facilitated the
strengthening of surveillance, diagnostics, control, and treatment capacities for responding to


9
 GMP is for the vaccine production, the accreditation of the lab has nothing to do with the GMP or the
vaccine production.




                                                   22
pandemic diseases in Romania. In brief, the project objective contributed to strengthening the
capacity of the country to respond to pandemic diseases and to treat patients under safer
conditions.

On the animal health side, however, very little was achieved. For example:

(i) Mobility, institutional structure, and skill level of local veterinary staff did not improve,
and activities on these aspects were dropped. For example, for strengthening epidemiological
capacity, the recruitment of the epidemiological expert was not completed.
(ii) County laboratories could not provide timely disease diagnoses, as equipment and reagents
were not procured.
(iii) Comprehensive/integrated animal disease information system was not established and
activity was dropped.
(iv) Quarantine, culling, and disposal measures could not be improved, as procurement of CO2
containers and incinerators did not even start.
(v) No activities for awareness campaigns and knowledge transfer activities were carried out to
improve behavioral and managerial changes towards higher bio-security in small-holder poultry
systems.

Although the two project development indicators, as revised under the 2009 restructuring, were
met, they do not reflect well the full PDO, and clearly, the project fell far short of the intended
results. Hence, the overall rating for achievement of the original project development objectives
is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

I. Project Outcomes Before Restructuring

The outcome of the project on the Animal Health side was unsatisfactory, as there were only
very modest achievements as shown below:

•     Appropriate contingency plans for avian influenza and human influenza pandemic were
      prepared and improved. Coordination mechanisms were defined, and legislation was
      revised. Capacity to implement the contingency plan was demonstrated in the district of
      Tulcea in November 2007.

As a result of these partial achievements, the related project development objective 1 (prior to
restructuring) could not be met and was removed during project restructuring. In addition, at the
time of restructuring, the project had disbursed only 8.2 percent of the total funding.

On the Human Health side, the achievement was moderately satisfactory in light of its major
progress on the following two aspects:

•     Rehabilitation/refurbishments (small civil works) to facilitate new equipment. Using the
      MOH allocations for two national and seven regional infectious disease hospitals,
      reinforcement works were finalized in most of the hospitals (Craiova, Iasi, Constanta,
      Bucuresti – Babes Hospital and Bals Institute, Timisoara); and the other hospital was in the
      final stages of rehabilitation.

•     Training. Training was implemented according to the agreed plan. The CI staff received
      training on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards in vaccine production, based on
      four modules, with five technical staff from CI completing the necessary training modules.


                                                23
On the whole, the project’s outcome before restructuring was Moderately Unsatisfactory.

II. Project Outcomes After Restructuring

After the project was restructured, there were significant achievements as demonstrated by the
following:
•     According to the National Influenza Laboratory, there were no confirmed human cases of
      H5N1 since 2007 and until the end of the project.

•     Upgrading of the NIL to BSL-3. The certification of the NIL as a BSL-3 facility will be
      undertaken in 2011 and financed by the CI. According to EU and WHO standards, the
      certification could be granted after an inspection of the facility by an independent
      internationally accredited laboratory. This upgrade will allow CI to perform more complex
      tests than they previously were able to. Even though the NIL has yet to be certified, the
      upgrade supported by the project is expected to be sufficient to ensure that this certification
      is granted.

•     Strengthening Health System Response Capacity The health system’s capacity to respond
      to avian and other pandemic influenza has been significantly improved through the
      provision of equipment to the two main infectious diseases hospitals in Bucharest and
      seven regional hospitals and training of personnel in the hospitals. Equipment provided
      included ventilation machines and monitors for intensive care units (ICUs), furniture and
      intensive therapy accessories, clinical examination and treatment equipment, and laboratory
      and mobile examination equipment (including portable x-ray machines).

•     Upgrading of the influenza vaccine production unit at the CI. The purchase of new
      equipment has boosted vaccine production at the CI two-fold from 30 doses of trivalent
      influenza vaccine per week in 2007-2008 to 79 doses per week in 2008-2009. The CI can
      now produce up to 8,000 vaccine doses per month.

•     National contingency plan is in place since 2009, and implemented during H1N1 outbreak.
However, improvements after project restructuring could not cover for all previous shortcomings.
Some main activities that could not be completed by the project’s end were cancelled. In terms of
financing, the total funds cancelled reached to Euro 11,631,799 (out of which Euro 7,317,233
during project restructuring and Euro 4,314,566 at project closure). The uncompleted activities,
as given below, have been transferred to the ongoing Bank-financed Health Sector Reform
Project-Phase II:

a)    Rehabilitation works for the influenza vaccine production unit at the Cantacuzino Institute
      (Euro 1.1 million);
b)    Rehabilitation of the aseptic ampoule sealing and filling station (Euro 1.8 million);
c)    Modification of the filling line (Euro 0.85 million);
d)    Site Supervisor for the rehabilitation works (vaccine production unit and sealing and filling
      station) (Euro 0.01 million); and
e)    Designs for vaccine production upgrade at the Cantacuzino Institute (Euro 0.06 million).

Based on the above, the project’s performance after restructuring was Moderately Satisfactory.



                                                24
3.3 Efficiency

Project benefits are primarily driven by key assumptions regarding the gross attack rate for the
human population and for the mortality rate among those affected as well as by the likely
frequency of HPAI outbreaks. This is to be expected in a project that is intended to prepare for a
contingency for which neither timing nor severity can be reliably predicted. Nevertheless, the
overall benefits from the project in terms of human health sector benefits, decrease in human
suffering and deaths alone are significant and can be argued to justify this and other similar
projects. The analysis further shows that even in the absence of human infection, as has
happened in the past in Romania, benefits from reduction in infection rate in the poultry could
generate benefits that make the project worthwhile. The benefits from increased capacity of
Veterinary and Animal health systems, which may accrue even in the absence of an outbreak, are
additional benefits of the project that are not considered in this analysis. It may be noted that
analysis do not consider the additional benefits like costs averted in repopulating the poultry
stock, effects on prices, losses from reduced consumption after an outbreak and impacts on
foreign trade, if any. The inclusion of these benefits will further improve the returns on the
investment in the project.

Human health benefits substantially outweigh those in the poultry production sector (detailed
analyses in attached Annex 3). The two parameters that drive the economic value of the human
health benefits are (i) the project impact on the percentage of the human population affected by
HPAI infection, and (ii) the project effectiveness in reducing the expected mortality rate from
HPAI infection. Note that even with parameters indicating relatively small improvements in the
percentage of the human population affected by HPAI and in the number of human deaths
attributable to HPAI, the returns remain robust. Changes in the key parameters for the poultry
industry have less impact on the overall outcomes.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The project has a number of satisfactory achievements to its credit. For example: (i) Appropriate
contingency plans for Avian Influenza and human influenza pandemic were prepared and
improved. Coordination mechanisms were defined, and legislation was revised. (ii) There were
no confirmed human cases of H5N1 since 2007 and until the end of the project. (iii) The CI staff
received training on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards in vaccine production. (iv)
Upgrading of the NIL to BSL 3 will allow CI to perform more complex tests soon after its
certification. (v) The health system’s capacity to respond to avian and other pandemic influenza
has been significantly improved through the provision of equipment to the two main infectious
diseases hospitals in Bucharest and seven regional hospitals and training of personnel in the
hospitals. (vi) The CI can now produce up to 8,000 vaccine doses per month.
However, as already mentioned above, a number of project activities were cancelled or
transferred, thus resulting in a very partial achievement of the original project outcomes.
Therefore, the overall rating for the original project outcomes is Moderately Unsatisfactory.




                                               25
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts and Gender Aspects. There were no specific, recorded impacts on poverty and
gender.

Social Development. Even though there is no counter-factual data to prove the impact, anecdotal
evidence shows that the project has benefited the Romanian population in terms of protecting
them from pandemic diseases.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project resulted in a substantial institutional development impact as demonstrated by the
following:

(i)   The Project has strengthened the capacity of employees of CI by providing GMP training
      for those involved in vaccine production. There were four GMP training sessions in 2008,
      which benefitted five employees of the Institute. The courses were organized by the
      European Compliance Academy (the leading European association with regard to GMP and
      regulatory compliance). In addition, there was on-site training provided by the suppliers of
      process equipment, for operation and maintenance of the equipment.
(ii) Investments made at two national and seven regional infectious diseases hospitals and
      training given to hospital personnel have enabled these hospital to respond to many
      infectious diseases, including AI, more effectively and efficiently.
(iii) The project has strengthened the capacity of the MOH PMU staff in financial management,
      procurement, environmental management, and many other aspects of project management.
      For example: the financial coordinator and the accountant expert had a one-week training in
      financial management at the Bank’s country office in Bucharest and a one-week training in
      project management organized by the International Labor Organization (ILO) in Turin
      (Italy). The procurement expert has attended a three-week training in procurement
      organized by the ILO in Turin.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

None

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Moderate

Production of vaccines at the CI’s National Vaccine Center appears to be sustainable. Incomplete
activities that have been transferred to the Health Sector Reform Project should be completed
before project closing on December 15, 2011. At that time, the CI will be in a better position to
keep up with the production at a higher level. This will enable them to meet routine national

                                               26
vaccine needs as well as increased demands for vaccines during crisis periods (e.g., influenza
outbreaks) for the country as well as neighboring countries.

However, because of the country’s economic problems, currently, CI is financially in a very
difficult situation. Although CI is state-owned, it does not receive any financing from the
government budget, and is self-financed, mainly from the revenue generated by selling vaccines
and other products and services, such as laboratory services and research projects. However,
given that the CI is Romania’s only such institute, chances of its complete closure are low, with
the Government’s financial support.

The same can be said for the contingency plans, which were prepared by the Ministry of Health.
Since there is no immediate threat of influenza pandemic to the country, the contingency plans
are not being used for the moment. However, the plans are published in the MOH website and
are publicly available.

In case the budget situation deteriorates further because of the country’s economic problems,
maintenance of equipment at project-financed infectious diseases hospitals could be adversely
affected.

The current freeze on public sector staff recruitment, which may remain in place for the
foreseeable future, could affect provision of services to the population.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. There was no official assessment of the quality at entry by the
Quality Assurance Group (QAG). The ICR deems the quality at entry to be moderately
satisfactory.

Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists from two sector units
who had the required technical skill mix necessary to guide project design. The Bank provided
adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and budget to ensure quality preparation and appraisal
work. The Project was consistent with the CAS and government priorities in the sector at the
time. It is also worth pointing out that the Bank prepared the project at a difficult time, in a very
short period of time due to the emergency nature of the project. To this extent, the Bank
performance was satisfactory.

On the other hand, the project design had the following two major shortcomings:

•   Considering the emergency nature of the project, many of the project activities could have
    been avoided and the project design simplified.
•   The M&E framework was weak. It had some indicators that were difficult to monitor (many
    of which were dropped after the restructuring). Targets were set for these indicators, but they
    were broad and as a result, it was difficult to quantify progress.

Considering the above factors, the overall quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                 27
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory.

The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory. Sufficient
budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately and closely monitored.
The task team prepared Aide-Memoires systematically and alerted the Government and the PMUs
to problems with project execution and tried its best to facilitate remedies in a timely manner, in
conformity with Bank procedures. The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) generally
realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of achievement of development
objectives and project implementation.

The task team carried out a Mid-Term Review in November 2008. The task team also monitored
safeguard and fiduciary compliances. The team worked closely with the project management
teams in both the ANSVSA and the MOH and held meetings with representatives of ANSVSA,
the CI, and the Matei Balş Hospital. The team also made site visits including to the Institute for
Diagnosis and Animal Health (IDAH), and undertook consultations with the EU's Resident
Twinning Advisor in ANSVSA.

The Bank was proactive in terms of taking appropriate remedial measures whenever required.
For example, in November 2008, the Bank imposed partial suspension of disbursements of the
loan as it related to activities managed by ANSVSA due to operational and institutional non-
compliance issues. Likewise, the task team initiated restructuring process when it became
obvious that it was essential for achieving the project objective. The restructuring narrowed the
scope of activities and facilitated achievement of many positive and creditable results.

As mentioned in Section 2.1, when the TTL was from Sustainable Development, a senior staff
member from Human Development was involved with the implementation right from the
beginning, and they worked together closely and effectively. When the TTL-ship changed from
the Sustainable Development to Human Development after MTR, detailed hand-over discussions
were conducted between these two TTLs and the transition was thus made smooth. Even though
the TTL had changed three times over a period of four years of the project, the task team
remained more or less the same, and this helped in mitigating the frequent turnover of TTLs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the Bank performance during the preparation phase and supervision as discussed above,
overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As mentioned in Section 2.1, the Government had shown strong commitment to the objective of
the project at the time of project preparation. However, this initial commitment somewhat faded
during the course of implementation for the reasons mentioned in Section 2.2. For example, there
were some leadership issues in CI until towards the end of the project. Based on the overall
factors, the Government performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.




                                                28
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

MOH was committed to the project. However, frequent change in leadership at the Minister’s
level affected the implementation. For some period of time in 2009, there was no Minister of
Health. Further, the overall economic situation in Romania adversely affected implementation.
For example, the public sector budget freeze in late 2009 affected payment of salary to PMU staff,
causing some staff to leave their positions.

There was adequate commitment to the project on the part of PMU, which tried to manage the
challenges during implementation including working without a Director and other technical staff.
For example, the technical coordinator, despite having her own tasks to manage, also ended up
filling in as the Director for more than a year and a half.

Internal Controls. The PMU had adequate internal controls for the project, including regular
reconciliation of bank accounts, adequate segregation of duties and monthly reconciliation of
disbursement summaries of the World Bank with project accounting records. The PMU used a
comprehensive set of accounting policies and internal control procedures in accordance with the
Romanian legislation and the project financial management manual.

Financial Management. The semi-annual unaudited financial monitoring reports were received
in general on time. With certain follow up to clarify any discrepancies, all the interim financial
reports had been accepted by the Bank. All the project audit reports were received and accepted
by the Bank, but the reports were submitted to the Bank with some delays due to late selection of
the auditors. The audit opinions were clean and no significant internal control issues were
mentioned. The project was affected to a certain extent by delays in the provision of timely and
adequate counterpart funding and, as such, counterpart financing received a moderately
satisfactory rating throughout the life of the project.

Procurement Arrangements. Procurement was significantly behind schedule and the project
suffered the cumulative consequences of poor planning and management. The most salient
problems related to the upgrading of the vaccine production line. The design of the vaccine
production line was delayed due to a problem with the technical design firm that failed to be
resolved despite several attempts by the PMU to reach some consensus.
Reporting Arrangements. All records under the project are kept by the PMU in its existing
accounting software (CIEL). The outputs from the software were used to prepare the semi
annually financial monitoring reports, which were aggregated for the whole project by the MOH
PMU and thereafter sent to the Bank’s FM team’s for review. The PMU also prepared monthly
and quarterly trial balances and other reports as required by the Ministry of Public Finance
(MOPF), and MOH.

Considering the above factors, the performance of MOH is rated Moderately Satisfactory

ANSVSA. There was a lack of commitment to the project on the part of the ANSVSA. Its
highly centralized decision-making, and the nomination in April 2007 of a new President and
Project Coordinator, had resulted in serious start up delays. Due to the project restructuring and
the cancellation of Euro 7.32 million loan funds (ANSVSA components), the PMU was left with
only very few contracts after the restructuring.



                                               29
Internal Controls. Several layers of control were in place at ANSVSA, related to the approval of
each contract and then of each invoice and payment, however, due to the staffing situation, these
controls were not functioning effectively and resulted in significant delays in processing
transactions.

Financial Management. The PMU had been affected by its internal management weakness and
lack of sufficient FM staff and thus had a lower FM capacity. The semi-annual unaudited
financial monitoring reports were received with some delays from the PMU components in the
early part of project life. All the project audit reports were received and accepted by the Bank,
but the reports were submitted to the Bank with some delays due to late selection of the auditors.
The audit opinions were clean and no significant internal control issues were mentioned.

Procurement Arrangements. Due to disagreements between ANSVSA's technical and legal
departments and the Bank, procurement activities were inordinately delayed. For example,
ANSVSA's technical and legal departments were constantly in disagreement on each other’s role
during preparation of procurement packages. As none of the legal department representatives
was familiar with Bank financed procurement, almost every contract was blocked by the legal
department despite the fact that No Objection Letter (NOL) to contract award was issued. The
Bank organized a joint meeting with the representatives of both departments in order to
bring them together and provide guidance on possible ways of interaction in order to
resolve the deadlock. The Bank also invited them for a one-day training for their legal
staff, and during the meeting, they accepted our proposal, but later on turned it down by
proposing to send only junior staff who did not have decision making authority.
Further, following the change in the PMU Director and resignation of the Procurement Specialists
in 2008/09, procurement capacity in the PMU for the ANSVSA-implemented component was
considerably limited.
Reporting Arrangements. All records under the project are kept by the PMU in its existing
accounting software (SAGA). The outputs from the software were used to prepare the semi
annually financial monitoring reports, which were sent to MOH PMU for consolidation for the
whole project. The PMU also prepared monthly and quarterly trial balances and other reports as
required by the MOPF and ANSVSA.
Considering the above factors, the performance of the ANSVSA is rated Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

In light of the Government, MOH, and ANSVSA performances as discussed above, the overall
performance of the Borrower is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Important factors for the success of a project:

    •   It is important for the Bank to be proactive and use its various tools (such as suspension
        of disbursements, re-allocation to faster disbursing sub-components, cancellation, and
        restructuring) to give a project a chance to go forward more efficiently and smoothly.
        For example, restructuring of the project enabled it to achieve many positive results.


                                               30
Project Design:

   •   Even though a project such as an Avian Influenza Project needs to be prepared in a hurry
       and within a short period of time to respond to an emergency situation, it is essential to
       see that basics aspects for successful implementation are in place.

Implementation:

   •   It is necessary to have an idea of the country’s laws and procedures and factoring them
       into the time framework of a project. Especially, when a project includes civil works, it
       is critical to decide at the preparation stage a realistic time framework for planning and
       managing them. This would minimize implementation delays. Also, it is necessary to
       have a civil works engineer in the project team to monitor the progress of the civil works
       and resolve implementation issues expeditiously.

Monitoring:

   •   A strong M&E framework needs to be prepared before starting the implementation.
       Under this framework, indicators need to be clearly defined, and the targets should be
       specific, realistic, and achievable during the project’s time line.

Procurement:

   •   Purchasing equipment for health projects, especially for an input-based project such as an
       avian influenza project, is generally complicated and time consuming, and a lot of efforts
       will be required to manage these types of projects. For these reasons, sufficient time
       should be allowed for completing the project activities, with considerations for possible
       delays in procurement.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


COMPONENT 1: ANIMAL HEALTH

(i) Strengthening Veterinary Institutions: Evaluation of National Veterinary Services.
Assessment of Romania’s veterinary services was completed and the report was made available.
The assessment concluded that Romania’s veterinary services and crisis response mechanisms
perform at high levels, with particular emphasis on veterinary services coverage across the
country, national and regional laboratory equipment, epidemiological surveillance, and access to
electronic means of communication and access to information. At the same time, the report also
highlighted some gaps (such as the mobility of veterinarians in districts) and the notable
exception of ANSVSA’s headquarters as not offering appropriate facilities (space).

(ii) Strengthening Monitoring and Surveillance Systems
(a) Surveillance program. The 2008 National Strategic Program for Surveillance was prepared.
(b) Strengthening Animal Diseases Information Systems. Study tours to Germany and the
Netherlands were undertaken.

(iii) Improving Bio-security in poultry production and trade
Activity merged with communications activities. Recognizing that the initiation of behavioral
change in backyard poultry systems and markets (the key challenge in increasing bio-security in
these systems) is primarily a communications issue and against the background of ANSVSA’s AI
communication strategy covering the approach towards backyard poultry owners, bio-security
related project activities were covered under “Communications? (Component 3.A).

COMPONENT 2: HUMAN HEALTH

Enhancing Public Health Program Planning and Coordination
   • Public Health Program was prepared in 2006, complying with EU requirements
   • MoH finalized the national contingency plan in July 2009.

Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems
(i) Upgrading of the National Influenza Laboratory to NBL 3.
     • NBL3 Lab was improved to: (i) the threat of high risk avian influenza and other zoonosis;
        (ii) increase the training capacity, control and prompt response in case of pandemic
        influenza or other human infectious diseases. Activities included redevelopment,
        rehabilitation and modernization of the Laboratory area with level 2 biosecurity to
        upgrade to international level 3 biosecurity requirements.
     • The rehabilitation works for NBL 3 were completed in December 2010

(ii) Strengthening of regional laboratories by providing critical equipment and training of staff.
     • Cantacuzino Institute representative was trained in US in 2010 for laboratory supervision
         with the support of the Cantacuzino Institute and WHO.

Strengthening Health System Response Capacity
(i) The strengthening of the isolation and case management capacity in both national and
     regional hospitals.


                                               34
    •   All contracts for procurement of equipment for Intensive Care Units were cleared, and
        signed in 2009/2010. All equipment packages for the infectious disease hospitals were
        delivered and installed by December 2010.

(ii) The upgrading of the influenza vaccine production unit at the Cantacuzino Institute.
     • This activity included the rehabilitation and equipment of the influenza production
         department, and the completion and equipment of the filling and sealing unit.
         Cantacuzino Institute now has the capacity to produce major part of the vaccines needed
         in Romania during the inter-pandemic and pandemic periods.

TA for engineering design and procurement support (vaccine production and filling units).
   • Due to the economic crisis MoH could earmark only a lower amount for projects funded
       by international organizations than the amount initially requested by the PMU. The
       Ministry of Public Finance could allocate for 2010 only 14.6 million Euro instead of 18
       million Euro requested by the PMU. This amount was used to finance on-going contracts
       and/or contracts which were about to be awarded. Consequently, funding for the civil
       works needed for the rehabilitation of the vaccine production at the Cantacuzino Institute
       was not available for 2010.

Equipment
   • Equipment for upgrading the inoculation and harvesting machine at CI was delivered and
      installed in October 2010.

COMPONENT 3: PUBLIC AWARENESS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND
IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT

Implementation Support, Monitoring and Evaluation
   • MOH and ANSVSA used existing PMUs in these agencies to ensure effective
      implementation of the project in accordance with Bank fiduciary and procurement
      policies and guidelines. The project financed: (i) Incremental support to the two PMUs in
      terms of staff and operating costs; (ii) Studies, technical services, manuals; and (iii)
      Surveys for monitoring and evaluation.
   • Cantacuzino Institute hosted the MoH PMU as an autonomous entity.

After the PMU Director resigned in June 2009, Financial Coordinator in July 2010 and the three
positions remained vacant from 2008, three members of the PMU (Technical Coordinator,
Procurement specialist and Accountant) successfully completed the project

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

1.          Project benefits

The expected project benefits estimated include human health benefits and poultry sector benefits.
Since reliable data were not available, other benefits, such as the benefits from improved capacity
to detect and respond to other zoonoses and infectious diseases, the reduction in scale and cost of
poultry culling and compensation programs due to better surveillance and control measures are
not considered. Secondary effects, such as the prevention of abrupt and severe changes in poultry
prices on farm incomes or consumer incomes and of cross-price elasticity effects on other
livestock subsectors were also ignored.

The human health benefits include cost of human hospitalizations averted and the income losses
avoided due to reduced rates of human infection, hospitalization and deaths. The project benefits
in the poultry sector considered include the production losses of poultry meat and eggs averted,
savings from compensation programs to poultry producers and cost of culling affected poultry in
the event of an outbreak.

In order to compute the project benefits it is assumed, for the base-case scenario, that a severe
HPAI outbreak with a mutated virulent virus would occur every five years, with the first one in
2012, after project completion. The time period for the benefits stream being considered is 2012-
2025. A discount rate of 12 percent per annum and an exchange rate of I EUR = 1.42 US$ was
used in this analysis.

1.1.        Human health benefits

The project’s main impact on human health is to decrease the percentage of the human population
infected by HPAI, thereby decreasing the number of hospitalizations required and decreasing the
number of deaths attributable to HPAI. Hence, the human health benefits are expressed in terms
of loss avoidance and include:

      (i)   The economic value of hospitalization costs averted: Hospitalization costs for an average
            7-day stay per hospitalized person for treatment of HPAI infection is up to 2,000 Euros
            per day, which translates to a 14,000 Euros per 7 days hospitalization for an average stay
            of 7 days per hospitalized person;
      (ii) The economic value of income loss avoidance from days lost due to illness: assumes 25
            percent of the affected population would lose 3 days of take-home income and 50 percent
            of the hospitalized survivors would lose 30 days of income. The income lost due to
            illness is imputed at the national average income, which is 250 Euros per month 10;
      (iii) Income loss avoidance from fatal HPAI cases: People that could be infected are between
            20 and 40 years old, and life prognosis is between 53 and 33 years assuming a life




10
     The other 50 percent are assumed to be children and retirement-age adults.


                                                      36
        expectancy of 73 years. Then the remaining lifetime earnings is assumed to be between
        159,000 Euros and 99,000 Euros 11.

In order to conduct the analysis, the incidence of HPAI infection among the human population
(Gross Attack Rate) in the base-case scenario without the project was assumed at 2 percent, with
10 percent of those affected requiring hospitalization and 2 percent of those affected dying from
the disease (the Without-Project scenario) 12 . The With-Project scenario on the other hand
assumes that only 1 percent of the population would be affected by HPAI infection, of which 10
percent of the affected being hospitalized and a death rate of only 1.5 percent among those
affected.

1.2.    Benefits in the poultry sector

Poultry production is widespread across the country, with the backyard holdings accounting for
70 percent of Romania’s total poultry production. Typical household in Romania comprises
chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, swine, sheep and goats, cows and horses living in an immediate
proximity. As regards the commercial poultry production, about 15 large producers of poultry
meat account for about 60 percent of the total domestic production. In 2005, the total Romanian
consumption of poultry was around 375,000 tons, of which 220,000 tons were provided by the
domestic producers (59 percent). If production for self-consumption is also considered, the total
domestic output of poultry could be estimated around 360,000 tons.

This analysis accounted for the following benefits to the poultry sector in the form of averted
expenditures in the event of HPAI outbreak:
    1. Value of poultry that needs to be culled
    2. Compensation to poultry holders
    3. Disinfection, culling, incineration of poultry, etc
    4. Production loss during the outbreak control (disinfection and surveillance) period
    5. Additional storage costs and disinfection costs for commercial farms

Since data were not available, the effect drop in poultry demand (less sales), falling prices (sales
at lower prices), and losses in export earnings from an export ban on the project’s net worth are
not considered in this analysis. The analysis followed comparison of the losses and expenditures
under project to corresponding values without the project. The costs and losses averted with the
project are then used to assess the net worth and rates of return from the project investment.

For the present analysis, under the base case scenario without the project, a Gross Attack Rate
(poultry population affected by an outbreak) of HPAI was assumed at 3 percent of the
commercial and backyard poultry population -a “low infection rate? scenario- with a 100 percent
mortality rate of the birds affected by HPAI. In addition, an equal number of birds, in and around
the locations where HPAI outbreaks are confirmed, were assumed to be destroyed through culling
as a precautionary virus control measure. The with-Project scenario on the other hand assumes
that only 1 percent of the commercial farm and household poultry would be affected by HPAI and
would die, and that an equal number would be destroyed by the eradication program. Note that
the project can only affect the number of poultry that become infected and that need to be culled,
but it has no effect of decreasing the mortality rate among the poultry flocks infected. The first


11
   The number of persons in this group is assumed to decline by 2 percent annually, reflecting normal
mortality rates.
12
   Similar World Bank projects used, at appraisal, Gross Attack Rates as high as 30 percent.

                                                    37
outbreak is assumed to happen in the first year after the completion of the project. Subsequent
outbreaks are assumed to occur once in every five years thereafter. The analysis covers the
period from 2007 to 2025.

2.          Estimation of costs averted with the project in the event of an outbreak

This section estimates the expenditures averted with the project in the event of an outbreak of
HPAI. The estimates were based on data on actual expenditures incurred by the GOR to combat
the last outbreak.

Table 1: Costs that could be averted due the project following an outbreak under base case (Million US $)
1          Disinfection, culling, incineration of poultry, etc.                                   4.98
2          Compensation to poultry holders                                                        3.46
3          Vaccination of civil population and security forces                                     1.4
4          Preventive medication with anti-viral drugs (Tamiflu                                   0.28
5          Sanitary and protection equipment, information materials                               0.42
           related to human health
           Total                                                                                  10.54

These expenditures will be incurred if and when there is an outbreak and are based on
conservative estimates provided by the GOR. There may be additional cost savings with the
project, which will increase the project that are not included here.

3.          Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis

3.1.        Base case scenario

Although Romania experienced two recent episodes of HPAI, human infections were not
reported. Hence, in the base case scenario, two cases are presented in Table 2. The first is the
case when there is an outbreak in the poultry sector and there is no human infection. A gross
attack rate of 3 percent among the industrial and backyard farms is assumed without the project.
The Gross Attack Rate is assumed to fall 1 percent with the project. In the second case, without
the project, in addition to 3 percent gross attack rate among the poultry, it is assumed that 2
percent of the population is affected by the epidemic and the mortality rate of the affected human
population is 2 percent. With the project the attack rate among the poultry is assumed to fall to 1
percent, and incidence among the human population is assumed to fall to 1 percent of those
affected.

                                                           38
The rates of return shows that, under the base case scenario, even in the absence of human
infection yields rate of return of 28 percent over the period considered. The benefit/cost ratio also
showed significant returns on the investment. It may be noted that the rates of return and projects
worth increases significantly if there is a disease incidence among the human population. The
Economic rate of return and Benefit: Cost ratios were 86 percent and 4.39 percent respectively.

These results are in line with the ex-ante estimates of return from the project, as provided in the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The PAD estimates that a reduction in incidence rates as
low as about 10 percent in the first two years and 5 percent in years 3 and 4 would yield an
internal rate of return of 12 percent on the project’s investments. The base case scenario in the
present analysis considers reduction in infection rate from 3 percent without the project to 1
percent with the project and the resulting ERR of 28 percent without human infection and 86
percent, if there is human infection as in Scenario 2 in Table 2.

3.2.       Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis was done with alternative scenarios to examine the effect of changing the
different assumptions/parameters on the returns from the project. Four different scenarios are
presented to test the sensitivity of the returns to investment in the project to infection rates among
poultry and in the humans. The results seem to suggest that in the event of an outbreak, the
investment in the project is worth.

The human health benefits substantially outweigh those in the poultry production sector. The two
parameters that drive the economic value of the human health benefits are (i) the project impact
on the percentage of the human population affected by HPAI infection, and (ii) the project
effectiveness in reducing the expected mortality rate from HPAI infection. Note that even with
parameters indicating relatively small improvements in the percentage of the human population
affected by HPAI and in the number of human deaths attributable to HPAI, the returns remain
robust. Changes in the key parameters for the poultry industry have less impact on the overall
outcomes.

The program was carried out between March 2007 and December 2010 and was financed by a
World Bank loan of EUR 29.6 million.

It was the first World Bank project to support the avian influenza control in Romania.
Given Romania's endowment with waterfowl habitats (Danube Delta, UNESCO world heritage
site) coupled with the dominance of backyard poultry with low bio-security, future AI outbreaks
are likely. The natural and farming system environment create a real possibility that the virus
could become endemic which would further increase the risk of future outbreaks. Spreading of
the H5N1 HPAI among backyard poultry in Romania will significantly affect Romania's
agriculture and economy in general; it poses a risk of human infection and also presents a
danger of spread of the infection to poultry in other countries in the region.

Project objectives:
• To support and constitute an integral part of a national program to increase Romania’s avian
  and human influenza preparedness, i.e. the country’s capacity to prevent and control the spread
  of influenza among animals and humans.

• To reduce the threat posed to humans and the poultry sector in Romania by HPAI and other
  zoonoses, and to support the preparation for, control of, and response to influenza pandemics
  and other infectious disease emergencies in humans

• To support activities in the three areas of prevention, preparedness and contingency planning,
  response and containment under the three components: (i) animal health; (ii) human health;
  and (iii) public awareness, communications and implementation support.


I. Project implementation – Main Achievements

COMPONENT 2: HUMAN HEALTH

Funds availability: EUR 16.95 million World Bank loan
                     EUR 2.8 million Romanian Government

                                               44
(A) Enhancing Public Health Program Planning and Coordination

Funds availability: EUR 0.16 million World Bank loan

Objectives: Activities under the first subcomponent will aim at enhancing coordination and
program planning by providing financial and technical support for additional studies and research
as well as for conferences and workshops, including the organization of a regional coordination
meeting on preparations for a human influenza pandemic.


The governmental authorities have developed individual contingency plans for animal and human
health, overall national contingency planning and coordination still needs improvements. The
Government has established a National Disease (AI) Control Center that has started a
comprehensive process of reviewing, integrating, and consolidating existing contingency plans.

European Council Directive 2005/94/EC has specific provisions for every EU Member Country
in order to draw up a National Contingency Plan specifying the national measures to be
implemented in the event of an avian influenza disease outbreak and human influenza pandemic.
While Romania has joined the EU starting with January, 1, 2007, a National Contingency Plan
must be developed in accordance with the Directive provisions and shall be submitted for the
EC’s approval.
While governmental authorities have developed individual contingency plans for animal and
human health, overall national contingency planning and coordination needs improvements. Until
the loan date, the existing contingency plans were reviewed in order to be integrated into a
consolidated National Contingency Plan.

Main activities carried on between March 2007 and December 2010:

Public Health Program was previously prepared in 2006 in accordance with EU requirements; the
need to update the AI contingency plan and to prepare related guidelines and manuals was
reconfirmed at the end of 2008.
MoH worked on this revision with human resources available in-house and finalized the national
contingency plan at the end of July 2009, the objective of the component A has been achieved.

Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems

Funds availability: EUR 1.27 million World Bank loan

Objectives: This subcomponent will help strengthen the national public surveillance system by:
(i) Upgrading of the National Influenza Laboratory to BSL 3 through the financing of minor civil
works (partitioning and creation of decontamination rooms), the supply and installation of
additional security devices, and the installation of a system for maintaining negative pressure in
the rooms; and
(ii) Strengthening of regional laboratories by providing critical equipment and training of staff.

Main activities carried on between March 2007 and December 2010:

(i) Upgrading of the National Influenza Laboratory to NBL 3.



                                               45
NBL3 Lab was improved for the purpose of reducing the threat of high risk avian influenza and
other zoonosis on people, also to increase the training capacity, control and prompt response in
case of pandemic influenza or other human infectious diseases.

Works consisted in redevelopment, rehabilitation and modernization of the Laboratory area with
level 2 biosecurity in order to answer international level 3 biosecurity requirements.

The contract with the construction company was signed on October 12, 2009 and the works
started soon after. The construction was suspended in December 2009, due to the lack of
Government permits for the construction. The building permit was obtained on April 6, 2010 and
the Government approved the investment on May 26 2010. In April 2010 the Cantacuzino
Institute requested the PMU to hire a site supervisor to monitor the 3 sites for the civil works.

The rehabilitation works for NBL 3 were successfully completed before December 31st 2010 but
it has been planned to buy the 2 equipment after completion of the works, Containment Glove
Boxes and a Mobile Decontaminating System. Considering that works were completed at the
ending date of the project, the 2 equipment were not purchased anymore and they should be
purchased by INCDMI Cantacuzino from its own funds or transferred from other units if
necessary.

The total payments made for the site supervision for the rehabilitation works at the BSL 3
laboratory were in the amount of 2.521 Euros.

Since funds were available under the project for this purpose, the PMU took the necessary steps
and hired an individual consultant to manage all civil works activities.
Works were resumed early July 2010 and have been completed with success at the end of 2010.

Considering that the works have been completed at the end of the project the bio-safety level 3
laboratory certification could not be financed from the project. Cantacuzino Institute made a
market research and concluded that TUV-Nord (Germany) - internationally accredited laboratory
have the lowest price (approx. 50.000 Euros).

(ii) Strengthening of regional laboratories by providing critical equipment and training of staff.

Also, in 2010 a Cantacuzino Institute representative was trained in US for laboratory supervision;
training was supported by the Cantacuzino Institute and WHO.

In order to ensure best performance of the laboratory the Cantacuzino Institute has to hire or
nominate an internal person and train for the bio-security officer position.

Some equipment and consumables that were planned to be purchased in addition to civil
Works have not been procured any more considering that the works have been completed at the
end of December 2010, the closing date of the project. The equipment will be purchased by the
Cantacuzino Institute from their own budget.

Strengthening Health System Response Capacity

Funds availability: EUR 15.52 million World Bank loan

                                                 46
(i) The strengthening of the isolation and case management capacity in both national and
    regional hospitals.

The project financed equipment for the intensive care units of the two Bucharest infectious
diseases hospitals and the establishment of isolation and intensive care units in the 7 regional
centers for infectious diseases (Brasov, Craiova, Constanta, Cluj, Iasi, Timisoara and Tg. Mures).

According to the National Plan, during the inter-pandemic period, all suspected cases shall be
transported to and isolated at the Institute of Infectious Diseases Prof Dr Matei Bals, where
medical assistance can be provided by specialized dedicated personnel. The centralization of
patient care is the only possible way at this point in time as there is no medical unit able to ensure
high quality care to suspected or confirmed AI human cases in the rest of the country. However,
within the project the patients would have to be hospitalized within their region of residence.
Therefore, through the project were developed isolation and intensive care capacities in the
regional centers for infectious diseases.

Main activities carried on between March 2007 and December 2010:

The only Bank-funded activity planned under this component is the procurement of equipment
for Intensive Care Units. All contract awards have been cleared, and contacts signed at the end of
the year 2009 and in the first trimester of 2010. All the equipment packages for the infectious
disease hospitals have been delivered and installed before December 31st, 2010 – closing date of
the project.
The payments were made according to the contracts in 2010 and in the first trimester of 2011 (Lot
1).

Considering filling this objective the expected death rate of the HPAI infected people decreased
from 70% before implementation of the project to 33% after implementation.

(ii) The upgrading of the influenza vaccine production unit at the Cantacuzino Institute.

This activity includes the rehabilitation and equipment of the influenza production department,
and the completion and equipment of the filling and sealing unit.

A significant part of the vaccines needed in Romania during the inter-pandemic and pandemic
periods can be produced by the Cantacuzino Institute. Making the Institute able to significantly
increase up to 2.5 million doses and its production in full compliance with GMP standards
requires the upgrading of both the production unit and the filling and sealing station. This
intervention will help both to increase the production capacity and to ensure that the production is
at the required Good Manufacturing Practice standards.

TA for engineering design and procurement support (vaccine production and filling units).

The PMU signed a contract with SNC Lavalin NV in March 2008 provide technical assistance for
engineering design and procurement support to upgrade the production unit and the filling and
sealing station.

The ending date of the contract was 24.05.2009; the contract was therefore finalized from this
point of view according to the contract clause. At the ending date of the contract the consultant
realized just a part of the tasks: technical documentation for building permit for the investment
project at Cantacuzino Institute and the technical volumes of the SBD to be used for the
procurement of works contract for “Upgrading filling & sealing unit?.

Considering that the contract was not fully realized under contractual terms the Ministry of
Health through the Project Management Unit has tried to negotiate a new contract but this failed.

The total value of payments made to SNC Lavalin NV is 160.862 Euros.


                                                  49
The remaining work: technical volumes of the SBD to be used for the procurement of works
contract for “Upgrading vaccine production unit?, validation file for the vaccine production unit
and validation file for the filling & sealing unit will be provided for completion of the objective
by another technical assistance firm – SC Claudia Design Art SRL through the Ministry of Health
– APL2 project, also financed from a world bank loan.

Due to the economic crisis and the pressure it puts on public finances in Romania, the share of the
MoH 2010 budget earmarked for projects funded by international organizations was lower than
the amount initially requested by the Avian Influenza Project Management Unit. The Ministry of
Public Finance has allocated for 2010 the amount of 14.6 million Euro instead of 18 million Euro
requested by the PMU at the end of the year 2009. This allocation was used in priority to fund on-
going contracts and/or contracts which were close to being awarded. As a consequence, funding
for the civil works needed for the rehabilitation of the vaccine production at the Cantacuzino
Institute was not available for 2010.

COMPONENT 3: PUBLIC AWARENESS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND
IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT

Implementation Support, Monitoring and Evaluation

Funds availability: EUR 0.90 million World Bank loan

The project was implemented by the MPH and ANSVSA, and used already existing Project
Management Units in the two agencies at the loan date. In order to ensure effective
implementation of the project in accordance with Bank fiduciary and procurement policies and
guidelines, the project financed: (i) Incremental support to the two PMUs in terms of staff and
operating costs; (ii) Studies, technical services, manuals; and (iii) Surveys for monitoring and
evaluation.

The MoH Project Management Unit was hosted by the Cantacuzino Institute, and functions as a
self-standing unit, de-linked from the PMU for the Health APL 2 Project, as previously
recommended by the Bank.

The Government decision (issued end of December 2009) to incorporate all PMUs implementing
projects with international financing into the regular structure of the Ministries, led to significant
reductions of the earnings of their staff.

Following the resignation of the PMU Director in June 2009, Financial Coordinator in July 2010
and the three positions remained vacant from 2008, the PMU 3 members team (Technical
Coordinator, Procurement specialist and Accountant) has successfully completed the project.

The cooperation with the World Bank

The PMU and MoH had an excellent cooperation with the Bank’s team. They are excellent
professionals, very well connected to the Romanian health needs and reality and very committed
to support, to facilitate the project implementation and to find flexible ways to solve different
issues. Interpersonal communication and strong relationships were built between the PMU staff
and Bank’s staff reflected also in the good results.




                                                     51
It is already a tradition for the MoH and PMU to look for the Bank’s specialist guidance and
agreement in the most important measures and actions, as an appreciation of their valuable
knowledge and experience.

The PMU highly appreciates the way the Bank’s team has cooperated and worked in this project
and specially thanks for the permanent support and encouraging of the PMU for involvement in
other projects.
