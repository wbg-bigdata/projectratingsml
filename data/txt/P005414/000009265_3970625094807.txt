KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A SECOND INDUSTRIAL AND TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrowetr:        The Kingdom of Morocco
Amount:           US$200.0 million equivalent.
Terms:            20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Loan Description: The proposed loan would support the second phase of
implementation of the Government's economic adjustment
program. The program comprises actions extending export
promotion and reform of protection policies, rationalizing
the public investment program and improving investment
planning and budgeting, and introducing financial sector
reform. The principal aims of the program are to improve
the efficiency of resource allocation and utilization in the
economy, achieve structural changes in the incentives
system, and realize the potential for export development and
promotion of public and private savings. The:program is
described in the Government's Statement of Development
Policy to the Bank. The foreign exchange provided by the
loan would be used to finance imports. The main benefits of
the program would be improved allocation and efficiency of
investment, increased national production, growth of
savings, and an improvement in the balance of payments
through increased exports and a reduced current account
deficit. The risks of the program relate to uncertainties
in the external env- ronment and export prospects, the
possibility of further deterioration of Morocco's financial
situation which could affect the commitment to import
liberalization. and the difficulty of balancing the length
and rigor of the adjustment process against the political
constraints faced by the Government.
Estimated
Disbursements: The loan would be disbursed in two tranches. The first
tranche of US$120.0 million would be available for
disbursement at the time of loan effectiveness. The second
tranche of US$80.0 million would be released after
implementation of specified actions and a progress review,
approximately six month.s after effectiveness. Disbursements
of the entire loan are expected to be completed within
12 months.
Appraisal Report: This is a combined President's and Staff Appraisal Report.



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOWMENDATION OF THE -PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$200.0 MILLION
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A SECOND INDUSTRIAL AND TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMENT LOAN
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Loan to
the Kingdom of Morocco, for the equivalent of US$200.O million, in support of
its program of industrial and trade policy adjustment. The loan would have a
term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate. Cofinancing possibilities with commercial lending institutions
in support of this program are being explored by the Government.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.     An economic report, entitled "Morocco: Priorities for Public Sector
Investment (1981-85)" (No. 4156-MOR), was issued in June 1983. It was
followed by an economic report entitled "'orocco: Industrial Incentives and
Export Promotion" in January 1984 and a report on the Financial Sector (No.
4957-MOR) in December 1984. A Country Economic Memorandum is being prepared
and should be ready during the first semester of 1985 11. Country data are
given in Annex I.
A.      INTRODUCTION
3.     During the first 15 years after Independence in 1956, a conservative
approach to economic policy predominated in Morocco. GDP increased at an
average rate of 4Z a year in the 1960s. A relatively weak savings effort and
conservative external borrowing policies permitted only a slow rise in the
share of resources allocated to investment. Morocco thus entered the 1970s
with no major financial imbalances, but a relatively limited growth capacity.
Although some industrialization had taken place, over half of the labor force
was employed in the traditional agricultural sector at relatively low
productivity. Primary products accounted for close to 90% of merchandise
exports, with phosphates representing about a quarter of the total.
1/ This will be an expanded version of the report prepared by the Bank for
the Consultative Group meeting in Paris, January 9-11, 1985.



-2-
B. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN THE 1970s
4.       During the mid-1970s, economic policy became more ambitious.  In
1974, phosphate export earnings more than quadrupled with the sudden jump in
phosphate prices. Although the petroleum import bill also quadrupled in 1974,
the current account of the balance of payments remained in surplus. The
Government launched a massive public investment program which brought about a
sharp acceleration in the rate of growth of the economy, and GDP grew at the
rate of 7.5Z annually in 1973-77.
5.       The phosphate boom, however, was shortlived and phosphate exports
started falling in both volume and value as early as mid-1975. Markets for
other exports as well as earnings from tourism and labor migration were also
negatively affected by the world recession. Agricultural production and
exports entered a period of prolonged stagnation and Morocco turned from being
a net exporter into a net importer of foodstuffs. As a result of all these
factors, the growth of exports of goods and nonfactor services averaged only
0.6P a year in 1972-77 in constant prices, compared to more than 8Z a year in
1967-72.
6.       Accelerated investment, and growing public expenditures, increased
defense spending resulting from the situation in the Western Sahara, coupled
with stagnant exports, increasing imports, and relatively sluggish revenue
performance created strong pressures on both the balance of payments and the
Government budget.  In 1977 the overall Treasury deficit reached 15.8Z of GDP
and the current account deficit rose to 16.51 of GDP. To help finance these
gaps, Morocco borrowed heavily from the international capital market, which
led to rapid increases in external debt and the debt service burden. The debt
service ratio rose from 5.61 of exports of goods and services in 1975 to 10.71
in 1977.
C. STABILIZATION PROGRAM: 1978-1980
7.       In order to redress the rapidly deteriorating financial situation,
the Moroccan Government in 1978 adopted a three-year stabilization program
which aimed at reducing internal and external deficits to sustainable levels.
The demand management policies of that period centered on reductions in
investment outlays and stricter import controls and included an exchange rate
devaluation in 1980. The reforms did not adequately address the fundamental
structural weaknesses of the economy, with the result that the short-term
adjustment of the economy was only moderately successful. By 1980, both
fiscal and external imbalances were still substantial: the overall Treasury
deficit remained at about 11% of GDP and the current account deficit at 81 of
GDP.
8.       Expenditures for social activities have been high since the
mid-1970s, accounting for more than half of current budgetary outlays.
However, social indicators still appear to be at a relatively low level in
Morocco. The limited effectiveness of past social policies in reaching the
lower income groups, especially in rural areas, is increasingly recognized as
a major issue. The strategy of the 1981-85 Deve opment Plan emphasized the



3
importance of rural development in rainfed areas, where most of the poorest
households in Morocco currently live, and the need to improve mechanisms for
delivering services to meet basic needs at an affordable cost. An effort is
also being made to increase the involvement of local communities in meeting
basic needs, particularly for low cost housing, water supply, sewerage and
electrification. Although rapid results cannot be expected in any of these
areas, accentuated implementation of these policies would help meet the needs
of low-income groups, while holding down the budgetary cost of social programs.
D. GROWING DISEQUILIBRIA: 1981-82
9.       The agricultural sector, which grew by nearly 4X in the 1960s, failed
to grow in the next decade, partly as a result of poor climatic conditions.
This trend continued in recent years with a sharp fall in output in 1981, only
partly reversed in 1982. At the same time, and despite large public
investment in manufacturing since the mid-seventies, value-added in
manufacturing declined in 1980-82. Expanding Government activities were the
main source of growth (12Z per annum in real terms during the period) which
was linked to the rapid rise in Treasury expenditures. Overall, real GDP
increased by only 2.7S per annum in real terms in 1980-82 compared with 4.2%
per annum in 1976-80, and Morocco's real income per capita declined for the
first time in many years.
10.      The Government's effort to stabilize the Moroccan economy was
severely hampered by a series of external shocks: (a) the 1979 increase in oil
prices aggravated an already substantial oil import bill ($1.2 billion in
1982); (b) a severe drought in 1981 reduced agricultural output by about 202
and led to substantial imports of cereals; (c) the rise in international
interest rates contributed to a steep increase in debt service to 34.77 in
1982; and (d) the international economic recession contributed to a 307
decline in the dollar price of rock phosphates and to a fall in workers'
remittances, Morocco's principal sources of foreign exchange earnings.
II.      In addition to the external shocks, continued internal pressure to
provide social services and consumer subsidies to a rapidly growing population
as well as defense expenditures for the Sahara war resulted in rapid growth in
Government current expenditures. At the same time, the 1981-85 Development
Plan, which aimed at an ambitious 6.57 p.a. GDP growth rate, led to a sharp
increase in public investment expenditures (467 rise from 1980 to 1982).
Despite tax increases, the ratio of current revenue to GDP has remained mostly
in the 23-24% range and the overall Treasury deficit rose again from 10.7. of
GDP in 1980 to 14.5X in 1981 and 12.37 in 1982.
12.      The combined effect of the external shocks and the highly
expansionary fiscal deficit was an overall increase in the current account
deficit from $1.4 billion in 1980 to $2.0 billion in 1982 (or from 87 to 13.3%
of GDP). On the export side, positive factors such as the continued growth of
manufactured exports, the emergence of new non-traditional expQrts, and
renewed growth in the tourism sector after the 1980 devaluation were more than
offset by the fall in phosphate earnings, agricultural exports, and workers'
remittances. On the import side, continued growth was due mainly to
petroleum, food, and capital goods imports.



-4-
13.      To finance the investment program and current account deficit and to
meet its debt amortization payments, Morocco increased its external borrowings
considerably. Total commitments on medium-and long-term credits averaged
$1.8 billion annually over the period 1976-82, compared with $320 million per
annum between 1970 and 1975. External public debt outstapding and disbursed
grew by 26% a year between 1975 and 1982 in current dollars, and by 20% per
annum in constant dollars. Total debt service rose rapidly from 5.6% of
exports of goods and services in 1975 to 34.7% in 1982, when a total of
$1334 million was owed in interest and principal repayments. Of this total,
about 55% was owed to official creditors, and about 42% to bilateral lenders.
Saudi Arabia and France were the largest bilateral creditors, with claims to
23% and 13% respectively of the total outstanding debt. Among multilateral
lenders the World Bank had the largest share at about 8% of the total.
Payments to private creditors accounted for about 70-80% of total debt service
in 1978-82-
PART II:  THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS, PHASE I: 1983-84
A. STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS
14. The structural problems facing the Moroccan economy have been (i) a
chronic shortage of foreign exchange, which stems from an unbalanced external
trade situation and a high level of debt service; (ii) current budgetary
expenditure persistently higher than current revenues, which has resulted in
negative public savings and high internal and external borrowing by the
Treasury to finance investment programs; (iii) a relatively low level of
private domestic savings; and (iv) a low GDP growth performance with sectoral
imbalances and a low share of industry in total value added. These
disequilibria were already nascent in the 1960s and were aggravated in the
1970s by the more ambitious growth oriented policies adopted.
15. Imports of goods and non-factor services increased rapidly (17% per ann
in real terms in 1972-77) while exports lost their previous dynamism and grew
very slowly. As a consequence, the external trade situation became
increasingly unbalanced during this period. Although this trend was briefly
reversed with the implementation of the 1978-80 stabilization plan, the trade
deficit became gradually worse in 1980-82, with merchandise exports declining
from 56% of cif import costs in 1980 to 47% in 1982.
16. Although the poor export performance of finished manufactured prcducts can
be attributed in part to unfavorable world demand trends, equally important
factors have been a loss of competitiveness of industry and strong incentives
to produce for the protected internal market rather than for exports.
Exchange rate and trade policies have had anti-export biases. The real
effective exchange rate appreciated by 17.4% between 1970 and 1980 in relation
to the currencies of Morocco's major trading partners. The trade protection
system during that period was highly restrictive, with extensive use of import
and export licensing and a high level of tariffs. In 1978 there was on
average a 50% differential in the effective protection ratio in favor of



-5-
production for the domestic market versus exports. Imports continued to grow
due to the poor performance of the agricultural sector, an investment program
heavy in imported capital goods, and an industrial sector dependent on
imported intermediate goods.

17.      Domestic savings have been abnormally low as incentives for savings
have been weak. After increasing in the late 1960s and early seventies,
domestic savings fell from 15.6X of GDP in 1973 to 8.4X in 1982. This was in
large part due to negative savings by the Government. However, private
financial savings also remained low as a result of inadequate financial and
banking policies. Real interest rates were negative on deposits during the
1970s and the early 1980s (Table 2). In contrast, gross fixed investment _ose
sharply in the mid 1970s and remained at a high share of GDP in the early
1980s (23.3% in 1982 compared with 16.9% in 1973). As a conseou'.-nce, high
foreign borrowings were contracted by the public sector to compensate for the
deficiency in domestic savings, which resulted in high levels of external debt
(para- 13).

18.      The sharp increase in the investment rate achieved in the mid-1970s
could not be sustained without large capital inflows. As these declined, GDP
growth fell to an average of 3.2% per annum in real terms during 1977-82,
which was close to the population growth rate. The incremental capital output
ratio rose from a level of 3.0 in the early 1970s to 4.3 in the period
1975-80, reflecting a significant decline in the efficiency of investment.
The industrial strategy of import substitution and capital intensive projects
relied upon continuing increases in tariff levels and quotas, generous
investment incentives, and an artifically low price of capital to sustain
growth in manufacturing. It did not succeed. In the public sector, the low
efficiency of investment was due to poor project selection and a continued
preference for large scale projects, which usually had a high import content.
19.      Unemployment (about 10%) and underemployment (estimated at between
30% and 40%) remained high. While unemployment was alleviated in the
mid-1970s by rapid growth, employment creation was less than could have been
expected due to the capital intensity of new investment. Although accurate
data are not available, it is likely that unemployment worsened in the 1980s
due to the economic recession. In addition, a growing percentage of the
unemployed are relatively well educated young people, but their skills have
not matched the demand for labor, creating a potential source of political and
social tension.
20.      An important constraint on growth is the high level of debt
(para. 13), which resulted from the rapid increase in external borrowing in
1975-82, when Morocco relied heavily on the international financial market to
fill the balance of payments and government budget gaps. During this period,
the debt structure shifted, with an increased proportion being owed to private



-7-
lenders (over 501 of total debt in 1977-80, compared with about a third in
1975). Consequently, average loan terms hardened significantly, wrhen
beginnirg in 1979 there was a simultaneous rise in interest rate. and
shortening of maturities on non-official borrowing. By 1982, the grant
element of new commitments extended to Morocco had dropped to 4.8X from about
181 in 1977-78.
B. STABILIZATION POLICIES: 1983-84
21.      Current account deficits in the range of 8-13S that obtained in the
early 1980s could not be sustained: the accumulated debt and debt service
burden were more than the economy could support or creditors would tolerate.
In 1983, access to international financial markets was sharply reduced and
expectations of further inflows of concessional assistance did not
materialize. Morocco was abruptly faced with a large external payment gap.
Some $500 million of exceptional aid was raised at a special Doners' Meeting
chaired by the IMF in November 1983. Official debt falling due in 1983-84 was
re-scheduled by donors acting through the Paris Club, following negotiations
in October 1983. In May 1984, Morocco signed a debt rescheduling agreement
with Saudi Arabia. The rescheduling of commercial bank debt for this period
was effectively completed by early 1984, although technical issues delayed the
final signing. The total amount of debt relief obtaiced by Morocco on its
medium-and long-term debt through these arrangements is estimated at
$508 million in 1983 and $1031 million in 1984.  Wichout   Lz r s^chcduling,
debt service would have reached 54.51 of exports in 1984.
22.     The significant decline of net foreign assets in early 1983 prompted
the Government to impose emergency import restrictions and to prepare a
revised, reduced budget. The level of new budgetary investment appropriations
was cut back sharply and virtually all new projects in the 1981-85 Plan that
had not yet started were deferred or cancelled. A new stabilization program
was prepared and supported by an 18 month IMF stand-by arrangement providing
$317 million (SDR300 million). The DMW program aimed initially at reducing
the current account deficit of the balance of payments from 13.21 of GDP in
1982 to 8.91 in 1983 and 7.51 in 1984 (before debt relief). The balance of
payments target was to be achieved through a sharp reduction of the Government
budget deficit, relatively tight credit policy, and depreciation of the
exchange rate. The budget deficit was to be cut from 12.31 of GDP in 1982 to
8.7% of GDP in 1983 and to 7.31 in 1984 (before debt relief on interest
payments). The balance of payments and budgetary targets for 1984 were
subsequently revised to 7.31 and 7.8% respectively.
23.      In 1983, in order to achieve its fiscal targets, the Government
raised the price of subsidized foodstuffs by amounts ranging from 17 to 601.
Prices of fertilizers, electricity, water, and petroleum products were also
increased. Net public service recruitment was reduced and capital outlays
were cut by one third. In 1984, remaining consumer subsidies were eliminated,
except those for wheac flour, granulat-d sugar, and edible oils.  Strict
limits continued to be imposed on public service recruitment, salary increases
and investment expenditures.

C. THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMENT (ITPA I) PROGRAM: 1983-1984
24.      Along with the stabilization effort in 1983-84, Morocco also made a
significant start on the structural reforms needed to restore a viable balance
of payments position with a package of measures to restructure trade
incentives and to promote the efficient use of resources. In January 1984,
the Bank approved a $150 million Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment (ITPA)
loan to support the first phase of this program. This phase included actions
to increase exports, reduce import protection, remove price controls, improve
the financial system, and prepare fiscal reforml/.   Its focus was an
improving industrial efficiency, lowering manufacturing costs, and restoring
dynamism to industrial growth through a significant reduction of the bias
against export production. Many of the measures envisaged under this program
were initiated in 1983, and all have now been implemented. The profitability
of production for export was substantially increased as a result of a
depreciation of the effective exchange rate. Temporary import procedures for
export production were expanded. Imports were liberalized; the special import
tax was reduced from 15 to 10%, the remaining prior import deposit
requirements were eliminated, and the maximum rate of customs duty was reduced
to 60% so as to decrease the excessively high incentives previously granted to
some import-substituting industries. In addition, the emergency quantitative
import restrictions that had been imposed in March 1983 were progressively
removed, so that the share of freely imported goods rose from 21Z of the value
of imports in 1983 to 75% in 1984 (on the basis of composition of 1982 trade
data). This import liberalization process included the removal of import
licensing on about 350 product categories and elimination of import
prohibitions on 60 product categories. On the export side, special customs
regimes for exporters were extended and improved and export procedures
simplified; export licensing was removed for all but a few products; and the
monopoly of the state marketing board (OCE) on exports of processed food
products was abolished, so as to allow exporters to choose freely their
commercial intermediaries. In parallel to these external trade measures, the
Government also implemented in 1983 and 1984 a reform of the system of export
credits and export credit insurance and a substantial increase in interest
rates on remittances of overseas workers. Measures for tax reform were
proposed during this period, some of which were designed to strengthen
specifically the incentives for export production. In addition, a significant
lib3ralization of manufacturing prices was carried out.
D. MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE: 1983-84
25.      Stabilization policies succeeded in reducing external and internal
deficits in 1983. However, the same policies, together with a poor harvest,
contributed to a lower GDP growth performance: 2.2% real growth in 1983
compared to 3.4Z during 1979-82. The lower investment budget and the
restrictions on consumer goods imports had a depressing effect on total
demand. The drought caused a decline in agriculture value added, which
2! Please see memorandum Sec M84-816 of September 19, 1984 on release of
the second tranche of the ITPA loan.



decreased by 4.6% in real terms and slowed growth in other related sectors.
Inflation also slowed in 1983 with consumer prices growing at less than 6.5S.
The money supply however grew at a rate of 132 p.a., much faster than GDP in
nominal terms, which increased cash balances in the economy. These could
eventually finance private and public enterprise imports purchases at a later
stage, and did so in 1984. The control of inflation was thus short lived, and
consumer prices grew at 11.11 during the year.
26.      Morocco's economic growth remained slow in 1984, at an estimated
2.4%. The 1983-84 drought and then damaging rainfall just before the harvest
continued to depress the agricultural sector. The prolonged drought also led
to a decline in the production of hydroelectric power. Value added by the
construction sector declined by about 21, as a result of continuous
restrictions in Government investment expenditures. Manufacturing industries
stagnated in spite of a significant growth of manufacturing exports at 9.21.
27.      The ratio of the Government budget deficit to GDP was reduced from
12.31 in 1982 to 9.11 in 1983. This relative improvement of the budgetary
position did not result from a better performance in Government savings, which
remained negative. Budgetary capital expenditures decreased from
DH 12.5 billion to DH 8.0 billion and were the principal factor in the
reduction of the overall budget deficit.
28.      Despite the adverse effects of the low level of economic activity on
Government revenues, the overall Treasury deficit was further reduced to 8.11
of GDP in 1984. Budgetary receipts increased by about 31 less than expected
as there was a shortfall in receipts from indirect taxes and income taxes.
Moreover, the shift in the composition of imports towards food imports and
capital goods, which are exempt from customs duties, and towards fuels, which
have lower than average duties, resulted in slower growth of revenues from
customs duties. Capital expenditures were again restrained below projected
levels in order to offset the shortfall in budgetary receipts. They amounted
to DH 7.4 billion in 1984, compared with an expected level of DH 8.5 billion
and an actual level of DH 7.9 billion in 1983.
29.      The results on the trade and current accounts, although less
favorable than expected, indicate that the trade adjustment policies adopted
since 1983 have had a positive impact. The current account deficit as a
proportion of GDP was reduced from 13.3% in 1982 to 8% in 1983. This was
achieved through a significant reduction in the level of imports of consumer
goods other than cereals (-14.81 in 1980 prices), intermediate (-1.61), and
capital goods (-26.21). The decrease in imports was primarily due to a
decline in fixed capital investment expenditures. Conversely, exports of
goods grew at a rate of 9.7%.
30.      The balance of payments performance worsened in 1984.  The current
account deficit reached 10.7% of GDP compared to 7.51, the original estimate
of the IMF stand-by program. Merchandise exports grew by 7.81 (in 1980
constant prices), while imports increased at a rate of 15.81. The excess of
imports was partially offset by a lower than expected deficit on service
account and higher workers remittances, which were attracted by higher
interest rates on deposits and, to a lesser extent, the devaluation of the
dirham between mid-1983 and mid-1984.



- 10 -
31.      Recent export performance is encouraging. High export growth was
registered in 1982-84 as a result of a surge in phosphate derivative exports
as newly installed production capacity became operational. Phosphoric acid
exports grew at an average of 25.2% per annum in real terms in 1982-84, and
fertilizer exports increased by 38.6Z p.a.. The other sources of export
growth were processed agricultural products, which increased by 10.21 per
annum in 1982-84 and finished products, with a growth of 6.61 in 1983 and 9.2X
in 1984. The performance of the latter trade categories was aided by the
export promotion measures implemented under the adjustment program supported
by the ITPA loan.

with a sharp contraction in 1983 and a surge to 15.8X at constant prices in
1984, which led to a large current balance deficit in the year. The major
sources of import growth in 1984 were cereals, fuel, and machinery and
equipment:

Cereals and fuel were imported in much larger quantities to compensate for
hydroelectric production shortages due to the drought (para. 26). The high
growth of machinery and equipment imports resulted from the implementation of



- 11 -
public sector investment programs already approved in past years. Imports of
capital goods benefiting from the tax exemptions under the Investment Codes
increased from DR 1.2 billion in 1982 to DH 3 billion in 1984. Half of the
1984 purchases were made by the national phosphate agency (Office Ch6rifien
des Phosphates, OCP), including equipment for a phosphoric acid unit, and most
of the remainder were made by other public enterprises such as the
telecommunications, power, and rail companies.
33.      Although the balance of payments position worsened in 1984, the
devaluation of the dirham in 1983 and early 1984 had positive effects on key
components in the trade sector and compensated in part for the tariff
reductions and liberalization. The real effective exchange rate index
calculated on a trade weighted basis declined by 9Z between July 1983 and May
1984. The devaluation did not have much impact on food and fuel, or public
capital goods imports which benefit from duty exemptions under the investment
codes and have no price elasticity. However, it had an effect on other
consumer goods imports, as they declined in 1983 and remained at that level in
constant terms in 1984. On the export side, no substantial effects were
expected on phosphate products which are sold mostly in US dollars, but
finished manufactured product exports grew faster in 1984 (para. 31). Canned
fish, beverages, textiles, capital equipment, and hardware products were among
the fastest growing export items.
E.  EVALUATION OF DISEQUILIBRIA AT END-1984
34.      The first phase of the adjustment program grew out of the acute
financial and balance of payments crisis of 1983. In that year, the Moroccan
Government recognized that the inward oriented development strategy based on
large Government interventions and major capital public investment projects
was not working and that another strategy would have to be adopted. The
severity of the debt crisis required that this major strategy reorientation
take place during a period of severe constraints and stabilization, making the
process that much more difficult. On the basis of analysis already undertaken
in Morocco and consultation with the Bank and IMF, the Government adopted a
development strategy based on an increasingly outward orientation, reduced
protection and trade controls, increased reliance on the market and
competition, and a more restrained role of the Government. Implementing this
strategy required major changes in policies and practices as well as a
fundamental change in mentality and attitudes of officials and the private
sector. The program undertaken with the support of ITPA I was aimed at
undoing the severe distortions introduced as reactions to the growing economic
crisis in the last decade and at beginning to change the strategy followed by
the Government away from protection towards economic openness. These
objectives were achieved.
35.      The ITPA I loan resulted in significant changes; however, its impact
on nacional production and efficiency can be fully realized and evaluated only
in the medium-term, in view of the structural nature of these changes. Import
liberalization measures implemented under the loan helped reverse the import
controls imposed in March 1983. The number of items prohibited from import
decreased by 30%, and products which could be imported freely (raw materials,
spare-parts, some intermediate goods) rose from 0 to 43% of all import



-12-
categories. The reduction in the level of trade taxes resulted in a decrease
in the weighted average of nominal import duties from 48.0% to 35.8Z and a
fall in the level of dispersion, as indicated by the standard deviation
coefficient, from 32.8 to 18.5. The decrease in variance of the structure of
nominal tariffs implied a considerable decline in both the average effective
rate of protection and the dispersion of effective rates. In addition, export
promotion measures under the ITPA I loan contributed to some extent to the
significant acceleration of exports of finished manufactured products in 1984
(para. 31). Substantial increases from tourism and workers remittances
occured as a result of a more flexible exchange rate and an increase in the
interest rate on workers remittances from 3 to 8% in September 1983.
36.      Factors which slowed adjustment in 1984 were exchange rate management
in the second half of the year, continuing public sector investments, monetary
and interest rate policies. The dirham appreciated in the second half of 1984
against currencies of Morocco's major trading partners, other than the US
dollar, by about 5Z in real terms, as a result of inadequate management of the
real effective exchange rate. This appreciation diminished the relative
profitability of exports to Europe, Morocco's major market for finished
manufactures, and did not discourage imports as much as desired. Public
enterprise expenditures for investments approved in earlier years remained a
major cause of import growth, although there were drastic cuts in the:
Government's investment budget. However, the investments of the OCP group,
which represented a major part of imports for the public sector, were
necessary to increase productive capacity for exports. Finally, expansionary
monetary policies in 1983 raised the inflation level to 11 in 1984. Several
major interest rates were negative in real terms, and, as a result, there were
insufficient incentives to domestic resource mobilization and efficient credit
allocation. The disequilibrium between savings and investment remained high,
with investment at 22.9% of GDP and domestic savings at 12X of GDP in 1984.
37.      The import liberalization and export promotion measures of ITPA I
were fully implemented. Available evidence indicates their positive effects
on trade movements and industrial efficiency. However, inadequate management
of the exchange rate limited some of the positive impact of the trade policy
reforms, and required correction. Other areas in which corrective action was
indicated at end-1984 were the financial sector (to raise interest rates, and
improve intermediation efficiency), the public investment program (through
continued rationalization and strengthening of planning), and public
enterprises (through structural measures to raise operating performance and
resolve the issue of public enterprise arrears).
38.      The second phase of the adjustment program, which will be supported
by the proposed ITPA II loan, will address the deep, long-standing structural
distortions that have characterized the economy for a long time. It will also
confirm the Government's intention to follow its strategy of liberalization
and increased competition. In support of this strategy, this phase will
continue the reduction of incentive distortions by lowering tariff barriers,
increasing import liberalization, and furthering export promotion. A wider
range of structural issues must be addressed to achieve the desired results of
increasing production and productivity over the medium term. The trade and



- 13 -
industrial policy measures would reduce distortions and improve efficiency in
the markets for intermediate and final goods, and shift supply towards exports
and import substitutes. But to effect lasting structural changes, biases and
distortions must also be eliminated in the factor markets, particularly the
capital market. The second phase addresses these issues through measures to
increase public and private savings; to improve the allocation of the savings
to investment through more efficient inteimediation in the private sector and
more effective investment plahaning in the public sector; and to make better
use of existing capital stock through restructuring and rationalization of
existing enterprises (public and private), thereby helping them adjust to the
changed environment. The medium-term structural measures, begun under ITPA I
and continued and expanded with the aid of ITPA II, are supported and
complemented by short-term macroeconomic stabilization measures in the IMF's
stand-by programs. These programs have focussed on demand management and the
related exchange rate issue to meet the immediate crisis until the medium-term
structural reforms can have their effect. The exchange rate, of course, also
has a major role to play in the medium-term adjustment program.
PART III: THE SECOND PHASE OF ADJUSTMENT, 1985-86
A. MEDIUM-TERM OBJECTIVES
39.      The Moroccan authorities have fully recognized that continuing the
adjustment effort is imperative. On behalf of the Government, the Ministers
of Finance and Plan presented a comprehensive medium-term adjustment strategy
at the Consultative Group meeting in January 1985 I'.  The objectives of
this adjustment program are to restore the Government budget and current
account balances to sustainable levels while carrying out fundamental
adjustment of the economy aimed at increasing its efficiency and productive
capacity, in order to achieve the country's longer-term growth and development
goals. The Government's objective is to reach a sustainable growth path by
1988, when it is expected that no further rescheduling will be necessary, and
the country's creditworthiness will be sufficiently restored, so that it can
return to commercial credit markets on a normal basis. The program presented
is comprehensive and includes actions affecting all sectors in the economy.
1/ The Moroccan delegation included senior representatives of a large number
of major economic agents and ministries to emphasize the Government's
commitment to the program.



- 14 -
The primary emphasis is to resolve the current debt and balance of payments
crises and make the economy more competitive, through reducing price and
incentive distortions and promoting exports and growth. The program is
supported by measures to increase national savings, improve investment
allocation and planning, increase competition, and reduce Government
intervention in the economy. Many of these measures are supported by the
proposed loan. In addition, the Government's program includes extensive
reform in agriculture, which is supported by a sector loan to be presented to
the Board shortly; rationalization and restructuring of the role and
functioning of public enterprises; reorientation of priorities in health
towards primary care, and in education towards reaching a larger portion of
the population, while reducing the burden on the budget. Similar measures are
being undertaken in other sectors to achieve a better balanced and more
effective development effort scaled to a realistic view of the resources
available.
40.      The medium-term prospects remain difficult, despite the encouraging
results of the adjustment and stabilization policies pursued in 1983-84. Some
elements of the external environment will have a positive impact on the
realization of the stabilization and adjustment objectives. A recovery in
phosphate exports in 1986-87 should provide additional foreign exchange, as
well as a higher contribution to central government revenues. Acceleration bf
industrial activity in OECD countries should facilitate Moroccan export
promotion. Relatively good cereal production in 1985 will reduce import
requirements and improve overall domestic production prospects. More normal
rainfall after years of drought will help restore much of the productivity in
the agricultural sector and hydroelectric capacity. The expected stagnation
of international oil prices will also tend to moderate the growth of the oil
import bill. However, the high level of debt service and the size of the
current account and budget deficits imply that the attainment of an overall
balance of payments equilibrium will require continued determined
stabilization efforts supported by a strong package of restructuring policies
over the next several years.
41.      Future sectoral developments will be sustained in the Government's
program by new policies concerning the main production factors, labor and
capital. The human and financial resources in the education sector will be
reallocated towards basic education and vocational training. Overall growth
of expenditures on education, which have been very high, will be reduced.
Priorities will be adjusted to support increasing the coverage of basic
education (years 1-6) to all the population and to increasing vocational
training. Expansion of upper secondary and university education, which is
expensive and produces more graduates that can be currently absorbed, is being
curtailed. This reform will improve the relevance and impact of the education
system while reducing its cost to the budget. Links between planning and
budgeting will be improved to assure that projects undertaken are economically
justified and fit with the level of resources available. New systems will
monitor their implementation more closely. Priority will be given in the near
term to completing investments which are directly supportive of increasing
production. Financial sector reforms will reduce biases favoring the use of
capital by raising the cost of capital toward its scarcity value through
increasing interest rates, reducing subsidies to capital, and improving its
allocation.

B. STABILIZATION POLICY IN 1985-86
43.      In view of the continuing disequilibria at end-1984 and in the
context of achieving its medium-term objectives of a viable balance of
payments and budgetary situation, the Government has concluded negotiations on
a stabilization program with the IMF covering the period April 1985 to
February 1987. This program will be supported by a stand-by in an amount
equivalent to SDR 225 million.  Compensatory financing has also been discussed
with the IMF, to cover higher costs of cereal imports in 1984 and a temporary
shortfall in merchandise export revenues. In addition, the Government has
requested official lenders and commercial banks to reschedule debts in 1985
and 86, in the amounts of SDR 1.2 billion and SDR 1.7 billion respectively.
44.      The stabilization program provides the necessary macroeconomic
framework for successful continuation of the ITPA II program. Under the
program agreed with the IMF, the target for the balance of payments deficit is
set at 6.5% of GDP in 1985, and 4.5X in 1986. The need to meet the balance of
payments targets highlights the importance of measures to encourage export
growth and of appropriate exchange rate policy. Quarterly performance
criteria have been set in the agreement to monitor progress towards the goal
of a budget deficit of 6.5% of GDP in 1985. Realization of this target will
require significant actions both to increase budget revenues and to limit
expenditures. In connection with revenues, a major reform of both direct and
indirect taxation (including introduction of a value added tax) has been
prepared by the Government in collaboration with the IMF. The Bank has given
its view regarding aspects of the reform concerning industrial and export
incentives and they have been taken into account. The fiscal reform laws have
been presented to Parliament and are expected to be- implemented by end-1985.
45.      Current revenues are expected to increase in 1985 by 16.0%, more
rapidly than current expenditures at 13.4X. A major source of additional
revenues will be increased transfers from the national phosphate agency
(Office Cherifien des Phosphates, OCP). The introduction of the value added
tax (VAT) will provide some additional revenues in 1986. As regards current
expenditures, personnel expansion by the Government will be limited in 1985 to
a net recruitment of 2000, and salary increases for the year to an incremental
cost of 52 of salaries in 1984. Budgetary outlays on subsidies paid through
the Caisse de Compensation on flour, sugar and edible oils are to be limited
to DE 2.1 billion. This will require significant price increases for
subsidized commodities. Subsidies have declined in the period 1981 to 1984,
from about 14.3 to 9.2Z of current expenditures, or from 3.8Z to 2.01 of GDP
and are expected on the basis of the 1985 budget, to decline further in this
year to 7.5Z of current expenditures or 1.7Z of GDP. The Government plans to
control investment expenditures strictly; they are programmed not to exceed
DE 7.1 billion in 1985, excluding settlement of accumulated Government arrears
on the investment budget from exceptional grant financing. This latter may
permit a reduction of up to DH 3 billion of accumulated arrears.



- 16 -
46.      Budget discipline will be accompanied by stringent monetary policy
measures. The growth of bank credit to the economy will be restricted in 1985
to lO.OZ. Quarterly performance criteria have been set for the growth of
total bank credit and net bank credit to the Government.  At the same time, to
ensure appropriate signals through thq interest rate mechanism, deposit and
lending rates have been raised, effective April 1, 1985, as part of the
financial reform package agreed with the Bank (see para. 64 below). Inflation
is projected at about 12% atnually in 1985, 10X in 1986, and 8S in 1987.
Finally, ceilings have been established for new external debt ($500 million
for non-concessional debt) and total short-term debt outstanding (not to
exceed the end-1984 figure of $1 billion).
47.      The relatively poor performance on the current account in 1984 and
the unexpected appreciation by 5Z of the dirham in real effective terms in the
last half of 1984 have been a cause of concern. After evaluation and
discussion with the IMF, the Government has agreed on an appropriate exchange
rate adjustment. Additional adjustments will be made, as necessary from the
point of view of the balance of payments and trade policy, given in particular
the Government's objectives of achieving rapid export growth at around 7-8X
annually and restricting import growth to around 2% annually in the period
1985-90.
C. THE SECOND INDUSTRIAL AND TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMENT (ITPA II) PROGRAM:1985-86
48.      The adjustment program which would be supported by the proposed loan
is described in the Government's Statement of Development Policy (Annex IV).
The measures constituting this program and their implementation schedule are
outlined below and summarized in the table in Annex IV.
49.      Within the context and constraints implied by the stabilization
program described above, the adjustment program covers measures aimed at
structural reform in three main areas: i) continued export promotion and
import liberalization, consisting of greater simplification of export
procedures, tariff reduction, and further trade liberalization in conjunction
with continued flexible exchange rate policy; ii) rationalization of the
public investment program and of public enterprise finances; and iii)
financial sector reform to raise interest rates, restructure the
administrative framework, reduce direct Government intervention, increase
competition among financial institutions, eliminate interest subsidies, and
develop the money market. This set of measures has been designed with the
objectives of improving the efficiency of resource allocation and utilization
in the economy, realizing the potential for development of exports, and
promoting growth of public and private savings.
Export Promotion
50.      Exchange Rate.  The Government has committed itself to a flexible
exchange rate policy as described in para. 47. In addition to its short-term



- 17 -
impact, this policy is vital to the structural adjustment to provide
appropriate price incentives to exporters and to compensate for the trade
liberalization and import duty reductions.
51.      Customs Regimes.  Several important reforms were introduced in
1983-84 to improve existing customs regimes and assist exporters. Further
reforms will be introduced under the second phase of the adjustment program.
The procedure of temporary admission has been extended to cover all inputs of
direct and indirect exporters except a few (particularly packaging materials)
specified on a "negative list" by the Customs Office. In 1985, the Government
plans to complete this reform by removing all industrial products (except
glass used for packaging, which will be removed in early 1986) froai this
"negative list", thereby facilitating certain exports (eg. canned fish) for
which the unrestricted import of packaging materials is particularly
important. Other items on the list (agricultural and fisheries products) will
be removed progressively in function of freeing of their imports in 1986-88
through import liberalization (see para. 59). Administration of the prior
export scheme (exportation prealable) has been decentralized. Under this
scheme, when goods originally intended for local sale are exported, the value
of these duties on imported inputs can be credited against duties on future
imports, even where the latter are for products to be sold locally. The
system of guarantees required from industries to cover possible payment of
duties and taxes on temporary imports has been simplified by allowing global,
annual guarantees for firms, rather than the previous requirement of a bond
for each transaction.  Such guarantees could be either from commercial banks,
or from other firms. To speed up and facilitate processing, the Customs
Administration has issued instructions to permit release of imported
merchandise rapidly, even where there are unresolved customs claims from other
transactions by the same importer.  These latter should be settled
separately. The Customs Administration will also compile and revise
periodically the Customs Code and tariff list. As a result of the concerted
effort of the authorities, it is expected that average customs processing time
will be reduced by 50 percent, in 1985, from the estimated 12 days at the
beginning of the year (in some cases, delays were as long as twice this
period). The Government has stated its commitment to this target.
52.      Administrative Procedures.  To complement these measures, the
Government will undertake a series of reforms of administrative procedures.
Export licensing requirements have already been removed under ITPA I for
industrial and most agricultural products. In 1985, such requirements will
also be removed for nearly all mining products (with the exception of
barytine, lead, and charcoal, for which prior monitoring of exports is
considered essential), hides and leather. The Government has become
increasingly aware of the administrative complexity of external trade
procedures and the significant transaction costs incurred by both importers
and exporters as a result of clearance delays. A concerted approach to trade
facilitation over the medium term to address the problems that arise at each
stage of the international transaction is needed in order that export growth
not be slowed by overly cumbersome administrative procedures and clearance
delays. The Government has confirmed that it will establish by December 31,
1985 a Committee for Simplification of Foreign Trade Procedures with terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank. The establishment of the Committee would be



- 18 -
a condition of disbursement of the second tranche of the proposed loan. The
composition of this Committee will reflect the full range of participants in
most international transactions, namely importers and exporters, the Customs
Office, administrative agencies responsible for international trade, foreign
exchange allocation, and transport, various port authorities including the
Port of Casablanca, commercial banks, and road, rail, and air carriers. This
Committee will be responsible for the identification and monitoring of applied
studies which will provide the analytical foundation on which to base the
reform of international trade procedures. Three areas will receive immediate
attention: Ci) the facilitation of informational flows by simplifying and
standardizing official documentation; (ii) the identification and elimination
of bottlenecks in the chain of international trade transactions which lead to
costly delays for traders; Ciii) the preparation, publication and regular
updating of a document setting out rules and regulations which pertain to all
foreign trade operations. In addition, a handbook for importers and exporters
will be prepared, providing a clear account of administrative requirements for
the clearance of goods by Customs. This will enable the first set of reforms
to be implemented by June 1986.
53.      Agricultural and Food Products.  In order to improve export
incentives in the processed food sector, the Government eliminated the export
monopoly of OCE for processed food exports in September 1984. Their exports
are no longer submitted to price controls or commissions. OCE is still
responsible for quality control of processed food products and has a monopoly
of exports of fresh vegetables and fruits. A study of export marketing of
fresh vegetables was proposed under the ITPA I program_1. The results are
now expected to be available by September 1985; so that its recommendations
would be implemented beginning in early 1986, following discussions with the
Bank by end-1985.
54.      Other Export Incentives.  To facilitate promotional foreign travel by
exporters, the Government has granted, with effect from January 1985,
automatic foreign exchange allocation to exporters, up to 3 percent of annual
export value, with the right to carry over any unused portion of this amount
indefinitely into the future. Exchange allocations to cover payments of
commissions on export sales have also been liberalized and made automatic.
The Government will eliminate, in 1985, the statistical export tax, levied at
0.5 percent of the value of each transaction. Elimination of this tax would
be a condition of disbursement of the second tranche of the proposed loan. In
order to reaffirm its policy of active export promotion, the Government plans
to prepare in 1985 an Export Code, which will confirm the fiscal and other
incentives granted to exporters.
1/ This study was originally scheduled for: completion in September 1984, but
as a result of slow recruitment of consultants, it has been delayed.



- 19 -
Reform of the System of Protection
55.      A key objective of the Government's adjustment program initiated in
1983-84 is to reduce progressively the distortions caused by the system of
tariffs and import restrictions built up over the years. This system was
identified as a major cause of inefficient capital-use and low labor
absorption 1/. it frequently favored industrial activities in which Morocco
did not have any comparative advantage and often resulted in a strong bias
against exports and efficient activities. The variation in effective
protection rates across sub-sectors was quite large; there was no clear
relationship of protection to the economic profitability of the production
process; and exemptions from duties were granted on various products without
consideration of the overall impact. As a result, the overall impact of the
tariff structure was extremely unequal and led to severe distortions. The
system resulted in high costs of production, both for exports and the local
market.
56.      Tariff Policy.  The reform of protection policy begun in 1984 is
planned to continue over a five-year period. The medium-term objective in
tariff policy is to reduce the overall level of protection to 25% through
decreasing maximum customs duty rates and evening out Zhe spread in tariff
rates within and between sectors. In the first phase in 1984, the Government
reduced the Special Import Tax (SIT, levied at a uniform rate on the vast
majority of imports) from 15 to 10%, and the maximum rate of customs duty to
60% (affecting 320 tariff positions). In the second phase, beginning in
January, 1985, the Government has further reduced the SIT to 7.5% 2.   The
Government will reduce the SIT to 5X by January 1986, and intends to eliminate
it by January 1987. The Government will also reduce the maximum rate of
customs duty to 45Z by January 1986. The reduction of the SIT to 5% and of
the maximum rate of custom duty to 45Z would be conditions of disbursement of
the second tranche of the proposed loan.
57.      In the case of new investments in manufacturing, the Government will
continue to apply the protection criteria adopted under the ITFA I program.
For products which, after rigorous economic and financial analysis, protection
in excess of 25% (within the overall tariff ceilings set) is considered
justified in the first three years after project completion, the Government
intends to grant such protection only through tariffs and not through
quantitative restrictions, except in exceptional and duly justified cases.
1/ See "Morocco: Industrial Incentives and Export Promotion", Bank Report No.
4893-MOR, of January 1984.
2/ The Government had originally planned to reduce the SIT to 5% in January
1985, and eliminate it by January, 1986. This schedule has been modified
for budgetary considerations in the context of the stabilization program,
following discussions among the Bank, the IMF, and the Government.

58.      Import Liberalization.  An essential element of the Goverment's
strategy to improve industrial efficiency is to expose Moroccan industries to
greater competition from abroad. This is partly achieved through tariff
reductions, but the more important element in this liberalization is the
gradual eliminatioi of quantitative import restrictions (import licensing and
interdictions). This process is expected to be completed over five years.
The liberalization of the licensing regime in July 1984 went beyond reversing
the sweeping controls imposed in March 1983 by freeing imports of a number of
additional products. Subsequently, in February 1985, considerable further
progress was made in reducing the number of goods banned from import I'
(only 7 items remained on list C compared to 132 in July 1984) as well as
increasing the categories of products which could be imported without
licensing (items on List A rose from 314 in July 1985 to 419 in February
1985). The increase in product categories subject to import licensing (goods
on List B numbered 352 in February 1985 compared to 287 in July 1984) can be
explained wholly by the greater transfer of items from List C to B than from
List B to A. There were no regressive transfers from a more liberal to a more
restrictive regime. The extent of liberalization can be gauged not only by
the number of categories transfered, but even more by the degree of
deprotection incurred by these categories. For instance, nominal protection -
and by inference, effective protection - was reduced by approximately 40% for
certain chemical product groups, 33% for specific ceramic products, 25% for
cardboard boxes, and 20% for resinated plastics.

59.      A calendar of sectoral studies to be completed during 1985-86 has
been prepared in anticipation of transferring more product categories to List
A, including cheese, margarine, glass, rubber products, minerals and mining
products, batteries, tableware, cutting tools, heating equipment, ceramics,
wood products, hand tools, steel tubing, light bulbs, optical instruments,
automobile spare parts, and certain appliances. The underlying rationale of
these studies is to determine those

List A comprises goods which may be freely imported;
List B consists of items requiring prior authorization through licensing;
List C comprises items prohibited from import.



- 21 -
tariff rates (within the overall ceilings established) which confer the
appropriate level of protection to industries no longer benefiting from
quantitative controls. The Government plans to transfer these products
corresponding to some 75 categories to the free list in January 1986. The
transfer of these products to the free list would be a condition of
disbursement of the second tranche of the proposed loan. Industries which
will be significantly affected by the elimination of quantitative restrictions
include glassware, steel tubing, certain rubber products, and heating
equipment. The reduction in the level of nominal protection for these
products ranges between 15% for hollow glass to 50% for heating equipment.
The reduction in the nominal tariff ceiling from 60% to 45% will lead to a
further decrease in the level of protection, with both the weighted average
and standard deviation of nominal import duties falling respectively from 35.8
to 30.1% and from 18.5 to 13.9. The reduction in protection resulting from a
decline in the maximum nominal tariff rate will be considerable in the
Moroccan context, insofar as it primarily affects those industries which
previously enjoyed indeterminate levels of protection afforded by quantitative
restrictions.
60.      Customs Nomenclature and Rationalization of Tariff Structure.  The
Government has commenced preparation of a new customs nomenclature
(international harmonized system) and a major tariff rationalization (to
ensure that duties are not higher on inputs than on output). The introduction
of the new nomenclature is planned to take effect within a year of the
completion of the final nomenclature by the international body, the Customs
Cooperation Council. Rationalizing the tariff structure will reduce
dispersion among customs duties, ensure that similar products bear the same
rate of duty, and prepare for the reduction of the overall rate of protection
to 25%. As part of this rationalization, the stamp duty would be either
eliminated or subsumed by the customs duty. Continuing preparatory work on
tariff rationalization will be carried out in 1985 - 87 according to a
work-program discussed with the Bank. The first step will be the adaptation
to Moroccan requirements of those chapters of the harmonized code already
agreed, and the preparation of a provisional tariff structure with duties
consistent Bith the 25% protection objective. This would serve as the basis
for further tariff reductions and liberalization. The new harmonized
nomenclature and rationalized duty structure will enter into effect, at the
latest by January 1, 1989.
61.      Price Liberalization.  Recognizing that competition is a vital
element to increase dynamism and productivity, the Government removed price
controls in 1983-85 on about 40 products and services. Price controls have
essentially been eliminated, except on subsidized food products, public
utilities, and products where competition is limited, either as a result of
the existence of natural monopolies, or where imports are still restricted.
With the gradual elimination of import restrictions, the Government plans at
the same time to remove price controls for these latter products. The few
remaining cases where removal of price controls poses complex issues are in
the agricultural sector: imported butter, molasses, cattle-feed. These
issues are being addressed as part of the sector adjustment program in
agriculture. In addition, it is expected that the Government will remove
price controls in 1985 for tractors and explosives, two cases in which price
liberalization has been delayed for essentially administrative reasons.



22 -
Reform of the Financial Sector
62.      Structure of the Sector.  Morocco's financial system includes the
Bank of Morocco (the central bank, Banque du Maroc), 15 deposit banks, five
specialized institutions controlled by the public sector, and two savings
banks. There is also a stock market in Casablanca with a limited role, an
active inter-bank market, instalment finance and leasing companies. The
Credit Guarantee Organization (Caisse Centrale de Garantie, CCG) is a public
agency which guarantees domestic and foreign loans to public and private
enterprises and organizations with a developmental role. Interest rates are
set by the Minister of Finance upon the recommendation of the Bank of
Morocco. The degree of concentration is high in commercial banking, with the
two largest banks (controlled by the public sector) accounting for 44% of
total commercial bank assets at end-1982, and the largest seven for 87%. The
banking network is well-developed, with 643 branches at end-1982, of which
over half are on the Atlantic coast. Commercial banks in Morocco generally
have a record of high profitability, explained by lack of competition. Sight
deposits represent the major portion of commercial bank resources, and
short-term loans account for over 90% of their lending. Two principal reasons
for this feature are the fact that commercial banks derive a much higher
spread (6-7Z) on short-term than on medium- and long-term credits (about
2 percent), and the conservatism of commercial banks with regard to the
greater risks inherent in medium- and long-term lending. The banks do not
compete for deposits, and have even, on occasion, -cfused certain time
deposits as not profitable. This is a result of tne constraints imposed on
the banks to invest a portion of term deposits in Treasury instruments,
(bearing interest well below market rates), reserve requirements, and the
regul:-tion of interest rates. The Treasury is also a major agent in the
financial sector. It is the main borrower abroad, uses domestic resources
from non-financial agents, makes loans and advances to certain sectors, and
provides capital subsidies to public enteprises and interest rebates to
certain private investments. Three of the specialized public financial
institutions are responsible for the bulk of medium- and long- term lending.
They are differentiated by sector of activity: agriculture and agri-business
(CNCA), tourism and housing (CIH), and industry (BNDE).
63.      Financial Sector Issues. The Financial Sector Study carried out by
the Bank (Report No.4957-MOR) of December 12, 1984 draws attention to several
issues in the sector which need to be addressed to achieve the overall
objective of raising national savings. The absorption of total financial
resources by the Treasury is too high (40% of total lending of Moroccan banks,
and over 70Z of total outstanding credit, including foreign loans, at
end-1982) and has constrained sector development. Treasury borrowing at
artificially low rates has distorted intermediation spreads and structure and
has introduced a strong bias against term deposits. Competition in the
financial sector has been limited, leading to adverse effects on sector
efficiency, low savings mobilization, and distortions in resource use.
Limited competition is due to the high degree of concentration, the tight
regulation of interest rates and credit ceilings, the specialized role of
public financial institutions, and the high level of obligatory placement
requirements imposed on banks. Credit allocation has been strongly influenced



- 23 -
by selective credit policy operating through a number of instruments such as
exemptions from credit ceilings, rediscounting beyond ceilings or at special
rates, interest rebates, and preferential credit allocations to specialized
institutions or particular sectors. The relatively undeveloped state of the
capital market has restricted the range of financial instruments available.
Institutional deficiencies in the financial sector are apparent in the system
of coverage of the exchange risks on the foreign borrowings of the specialized
financial institutions which imposes a heavy burden on the Treasury, and in
the credit guarantee system. The policy measures concerning the financial
sector in the ITPA II program are designed to address these issues.
64.      Interest Rate Policy.  Changes in interest rate policy aim at
increasing domestic resource mobilization and raising the cost of capital to
reflect its scarcity value more closely. They are designed to promote
competition among financial intermediaries. The structure of delosit and
lending raLes in Morocco has been rigid. Interest rate changes have been
infrequent and have been tightly controlled by the monetary authorities (see
para.17 and Table 2 above). Fixed rates have been set for deposits, and
lending rates have been fixed within a narrow range, except for preferential
credits. The levels of deposit and lending rates have generally been negative
in real terms (Annex VI). Preferential rates for certain types of crLdit (in
agriculture, housing, and for exports) and interest rebates (on term-loans to
industry, agriculture, fisheries, housing, hotels, and merchant shipping) have
accentuated this feature. The Government has recognized the importance of
making the interest-rate structure more flexible and of maintaining rates at
levels which are positive in real terms. To achieve these objectives, it has,
with effect from April 1, 1985: i) freed interest rates on deposits exceeding
12 months from administrative controls; ii) transformed the remaining deposit
rates into minima and lending rates into maxima; iii) raised the minima on
term deposits by 2Z, and on savings accounts by 1X; and iv) raised the maxima
on loans by 1 to 22. The Government is committed to reducing the number of
rates set by the monetary authorities, thereby allowing more scope for market
forces to operate. The Government will discuss with the Bank during 1985
propositions for further liberalization of lending rates and of phasing out
credit rationing. It is also the Government's objective to eliminate interest
rate rebates in various sectors, which would be identified in a study to be
completed and discussed with the Bank by end-1985, with a view to preparing in
1986 a program for the elimination of such rebates. With the application of
this program, it is expected that interest rebates would continue to be
granted on a selective basis only for some investments particularly connected
with export activities.
65.      To inisure greater flexibility in setting interest rates, the
Government has created a Permanent Committee for Interest Rates with
representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Morocco and the
association of commercial banks. This Committee is responsible for ensuring
that a continuing review of interest rates takes place to reflect changes in
relevant variables such as the rate of inflation, the liquidity situation, and
exchanige rate movements. The Committee will prepare, on a semi-annual basis,
a report on interest rates, and if necessary, recommend changes.



- 24 -
66.      Coverage of Foreign Exchange Risk.  Until now, the Government has
assisted the specialized financial institutions (BNDE, CNCA, CIH), by bearing
the bulk (all but 1.5 rprcent) of the foreign exchange risk on their
term-borrowing abroad -/. While such a policy has contributed to the
financial viability of the DFCs, it has distorted the costs of foreign
borrowing to the intermediaries and to the ultimate borrowers. Since 1982, it
has also imposed a considerable burden on the Treasury's finances. Costs of
exchange risk coverage were estimated at DH350 million for 1984, and
DH500 million for 1985. The Government considers that passing on the entire
exchange risk to the ultimate borrower would be too sudden a step at this
stage. It could considerably discourage use of long-term credit for priority
private-sector investments. The Government has therefore set up a Foreign
Exchange Risk Fund which will be funded by contributions from the specialized
financial institutions and the ultimate borrowers to cover risks on operations
after June 1, 1985. The fund's performance would be reviewed periodically,
and the rates of contribution would be revised if necessary. The Government
will also initiate a study, by end-1985, of the implicit foreign exchange risk
posed by imports of capital goods and equipment, financed from local currency
loans of commercial banks.  The Government would plan to transfer to ultimate
borrowers, in the long-term, the full exchange risk.
67.      Obligatory Placements and Reserve Requirements.  A major factor
distorting intermediation spreads and creating disincentives for mobilization
of term deposits by commercial banks has been the high level (as a percentage
of total deposits) of obligatory placements of commercial banks in
low-yielding Treasury bills. The Government moved to improve this situation
in 1984 by excluding deposits of maturity beyond 12 months from the
calculation of this requirement. Effective April 1, 1985, all term-deposits
and certificates of deposit will be excluded from both obligatory placement
and reserve requirements. These measures are expected to have a strong
incentive effect on mobilization of term deposits.
68.      Other Measures.  Fnrther specific measures have been designed to
increase competition in banking. The credit ceilings of commercial banks will
henceforth be decided in function of their savings mobilization
performance 2'. The commission rates charged by the banks for different
services have been fixed by the Bank of Morocco and not revised in the last 10
years. With a view to simplifying and up-dating the structure of bank
commissions, the Bank of Morocco will carry out a study by September 30, 1985,
in collaboration with the commercial banks. This study will focus on
identifying commissions which would henceforth be expressed as maxima, with
the Bank of Morocco only establishing these maxima. Within this framework the
commercial banks could compete by establishing lower rates. The reform of
bank commissions will be implemented at the latest by January 1986.
1/ Public and private enterprises bear all the risk cn their direct borrowing
abroad.
2/ Overall credit ceilings are part of the IMF stabilization program.



Several measures are proposed to increase competition between the specialized
financial institutions and the commercial banks, both in deposit mobilization
and lending. By January 1986, the specialized financial institutions will be
authorized to issue certificates of deposit to the public. In addition, the
Government will examine, before September 30, 1985, what changes in the legal
framework are necessary to permit BNDE and CIH to collect term deposits (CNCA
already does so). If these institutions can be authorized through simple
administrative steps, such measures will also be implemented by January 1986;
alternatively, the Government will inform the Bank of the next steps in
modifying the laws governing the specialized financial institutions.
Regarding measures to facilitate and promote term-lending by commercial banks,
the Bank of Morocco has authorized the Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur
(BMCE) to review and certify the medium-term loans of other banks; so far,
this privilege was restricted to BNDE. The Bank of Morocco is also examining
the possibility of extending this authorization to other commercial banks with
appraisal capability; the study now in progress would be reviewed with the
Bank by end-1985, with a view to implementation of the recommendations from
January 1986.
69.      Specific aspects of the major fiscal reform proposed in 1985 (see
para. 44 above) of importance in the financial sector, are the replacement of
tihe tax on products and services (levied at 12% on interest payments) by a
value added tax system, and the possibility granted firms of revaluing assets,
which would help reduce the fiscal burden and strengthen cash generation.
70.      Since 1983, the Treasury has financed an increasing part of its
requirements through borrowing at non-concessional rates in the money market.
Such financing has grown from a negligible amount in 1983 to an estimated 33Z
of the portion of the deficit financed by commercial banks in 1985. The
Government plans to continue this policy through ensuring that all future
incremental borrowing is on a non-concessional basis. The development of the
money market will also be assisted by the increased proportion of
rediscounting by the Bank of Morocco at flexible interest rates and the sale
of Treasury bonds to the general public in 1985. So far Treasury bills were
only placed with institutions.
71.      Outstanding guarantees of the Credit Guarantee Organization (CCG)
exceeded DH 10 billion at end-1984. Such guarantees have been provided on
loans from foreign and domestic financial institutions and suppliers'
credits. CCG has experienced major organizational, financial, and policy
problems as a result of inadequate funding and staffing and the poor
definition of its responsibilities and evaluation criteria. The major portion
of its funding has been from the Treasury budget, and coverage of risks has
not been systematically monitored.  As a result of delays and difficulties in
making payments against guarantees when due, its credibility is low. To
address these issues, the Government will initiate a study by September 1985
with the objective of formulating a coherent rebabilitation program. Specific
reform measures proposed will be reviewed with the Bank by end-1985, with a
view to implementation in 1986.
Public Enterprise Reform
72.      Sector Organization.  Public enterprises in Morocco generated about
20Z of value added for the whole economy in 1982. They are active in a



- 26 -
multitude of roles and sectors: utilities, manufacturing, mining, transport,
wholesale trade, and services (eg. hotels). Specialized agencies are
responsible for a variety of tasks in agricultural development (the Offices
Regionaux de Mise en Valeur Agricole, or ORMVAs), industrial promotion, and
local collectivities (the Regies) for distribution of electricity and water,
and sewerage. Among the utilities, the most important are those responsible
for power (Office National d'Electricite, ONE)+ water supply (Office National
de l'Eau Potable, ONEP), posts and telecommunications (Office National des
Postes et Telecommunications, ONPT), and railways (Office National de Chemins
de Fer, ONCF). The largest and most important of the manufacturing
enterprises in the public sector are the Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP)
group, responsible for phosphates and phosphate derivatives. Other
significant public enterprises are engaged in sugar milling and cement
production. Certain public enterprises operate as "Offices". This structure
confers a certain autonomy, which is utilized to varying degrees depending on
the relative strengths of the enterprise and the supervising ministry. Each
Office falls within the purview of the ministry responsible for the sector of
activity. In addition, the Department of Public Enterprises at the Ministry
of Finance exercises an inspection role; it is, however, seriously
understaffed. The systems of controls and monitoring of performance are, in
general, highly ambiguous and unsatisfactory.
73.      Degree of State Involvement.  The State is full owner of about 200
public enterprises, has a majority interest in another 270, and directly or
indirectly has a minority interest in the remaining 130. Public enterprises
experienced considerable growth both in size and number in the 1970s. State
financial participation is largely concentrated in a relatively few large
public enterprises and takes the form of capital grants, subsidies for
operations, and loans (generally re-lent bilateral aid). In recent years
(1981-84) capital grants have averaged about DH 2.0 billion ($280 million) per
year; operating subsidies averaged about DH 600 million ($84 million). About
301 of capital grants were for agriculture, 22X for railways, 181 for water
supp-y; and about 10% each for power and petroleum. Of the operating
subsidies, on average, 60X went to agriculture. Domestic bank credit and
external credit are available in principle to public enterprises on the same
conditions as offered to private firms. However, financing public enterprises
through these sources has hardly been possible, given their generally
unsatisfactory financial situation. Net flows between the State and the major
enterprises for the period 1977 through 1981 are estimated to have been as
follows:

74.      Financial Situation  The financial performance of public enterprises
has been less than satisfactory. Public enterprises in general have had low
earnings and often operational deficits which have had to be met from the
State budget. Liquidity has been poor and capitalisation inadequate. Low
earnings have been mainly due to pricing policies (which were often controlled
by the Government in order to keep prices "reasonable", e.g. power tariffs),
poor sector organisation, unsatisfactory management, inefficiency,
over-capacity, and inappropriate or untimely investment policies. Higher fuel
costs, and increased costs arising from three successive years of drought,
higher interest rates, and the appreciation of the dollar have also had a
negative impact on earnings. The result has been inadequate internal cash
generation and therefore higher demands on the State budget for public
enterprise investment. The problem of low earnings has been compounded by the
overall lack of liquidity caused principally by the inability of the
Government and its agencies to pay amounts due to public enterprises. The
arrears owed by the Government have created major illiquidity in the public
enterprises, with repercussions on the cash-flow of private enterprises, to
which the public enterprises have, in turn, not made payment. This arrears
question has been the focus of a recent Government study, which has attempted
to ascertain the dimension of public arrears, diagnose the structural problems
of which they are a symptom, and initiate measures both to eliminate the
arrears gradually, and more importantly, to prevent their recurrence.
75.      Recent Analyses and Reform Initiatives  In 1978 the Government became
concerned about the unprecedented expansion of the public enterprise sector
and the pricing and investment policies of public enterprises. A study of
their role in the economy and of needed reforms was carried out in 1978-81.
The report addressed in detail the problems stemming from the relationship
between the State and the public enterprises and provided the Government with
the reasons for strengthening controls which had become too lax in the 1970s.
The Government is now determined to improve the financial performance and
operational efficiency of public enterprises through improved controls,
pricing policy reform, and restructuring where necessary. Privatization or
outright closure will be considered where appropriate. An Inter-Ministerial
Commission under the direction of the Prime Minister has already carried out
an intensive study of arrears and is implementing a plan of action designed to
reverse the accumulation of arrears and aid their elimination. The Commission
will assure systematic reviews of the financial and economic aspects of the
public sector, identify problems of individual public enterprises, and specify
the measures necessary for their solution. A special committee of the
Commission has been set up to monitor and report on the implementation of the
corrective measures decided on by the Commission and an the performance of
individual public enterprises against the established targets. In six sectors
reviewed, the Commission has called for action on 142 measures over a wide
field including pricing, settlement of Government and public enterprise
arrears, budget allocations, remuneration of capital, abolition of subsidies,
consumption curbs, capital increases, liquidation, rehabilitation studies, and
improved cost accounting. Many of the measures have been implemented or are
in course of implementation. Since early 1984 rail fares have been increased
on average by 6.5%, but on some routes by 15-20%; coal prices have been
increased by 20%; fuel oil prices by 22%. Power tariffs were increased by 11%
in 1984, and a further increase of 13% is proposed; a 25% increase in water
supply tariffs has been requested.

76.      The Conmission prepared a matrix of arrears of 60 major public
enterprises due from the Government, its agencies, and local collectivities,
and also between the public enterprises themselves and from the private sector
as of December 31, 1983. The matrix has since been updated to December 31,
1984 with coverage being extended to 20 pore public enterprises and shows a
net debt of the Government to these 80 public enterprises of about
DH 3.8 billion at this date (this figure is a provisional estimate and
excludes about DH 0.7 billion of claims which have not beea confirmed). As
the Government is the major net debtor, the settlement of arrears owed by the
Government will have a major impact on improving the liquidity of public
enterprises and reducing the arrears problem. The Government proposes to
reduce arrears in 1985 by DH 1 billion from special aid grant received. This
payment will be a condition of disbursement of the second tranche of the
proposed loan. The Government also plans to reduce the arrears by a further
sum of DH 0.5 billion by June 30, 1986.
77.      The Government is committed to make public enterprises financially
self-sufficient and to eliminating budgetary subsidies to public enterprises.
These objectives are a vital element of the Government's overall adjustment
plan and will be achieved by implementing structural reform of public
enterprises. The Government has set a ceiling of DH 3.3 billion for transfers
to public enterprises in 1985. This ceiling includes investment subsidies and
transfer payments for services rendered to the State by public enterprises; it
excludes operating subsidies to public enterprises, for which accurate
estimates are not available; the accounting framework is being up-dated to
permit such estimates in the context of the on-going preparation of a public
enterprise reform program. From this budget allocation of DH 3.3 billion, it
is expected that as a result of strict discipline only payments totaling about
D_ 2.1 billion will be made in 1985. The complete elimination of budgetary
transfers to public enterprises requires detailed studies of the de jure and
de facto relationship of the enterprises to the Government, the structure of
the enterprises, and the specific actions required to make individual
enterprises profitable, or salable. These are now being undertaken, and the
Government would discuss with the Bank the measures proposed to reduce the
overall level of budgetary transfers to public enterprises in 1986.
78.      Proposed Global Reform.  The phased reduction of arrears of public
sector enterprises and specific measures for reform of particular sectors
which have been initiated are part of the more global program to address the
problems of public enterprises. The Government has given high priority to
improving their performance efficiency and to establishing clear and
appropriate control and monitoring systems, while ensuring adequate enterprise
autonomy. The key objectives are to eliminate the structural problems which
have caused enterprise inefficiencies leading to arrears and dependence on
budgetary transfers. To achieve these objectives, the Government is
preparing, in collaboration with the Bank, a program of reform of public
enterprises which is expected to cover key changes in the administrative and
control framework, improvements in the State-enterprise relationship, improved
policies and procedures for appraising and implementing public enterprise
investments, and detailed packages to rehabilitate particularly critical
enterprises through financial, technical, and organizational restructuring.
The Government has noted that this exercise could involve a rethinking of the



- 29 -
rationale for State involvement in particular sectors or activities and
progressive divestiture where feasible. A Bank mission has visited Morocco in
May 1985 to carry out an analysis of these questions. Its report is expected
in the second half of 1985.
79.      Preparation of a rehabilitation program is at an advanced stage in
agriculture. As part of the adjustment of the agricultural sector supported
by the Bank, the multi-purpose agricultural development offices (ORMVAs) are
being re-organized. Their roles are being redefined, clear monitoring and
control systems developed, and an action-plan to halve Government payments for
specified current operations by 1990 put into place. The ORMVAs have so far
represented the largest portion of Government operating subsidies with
DH 250 million ($29 millAon) in 1984.
Rationalization of the Public Investment Program and Reform of Planning and
Budgeting
80.      The combination of the shortfall in resources and the stabilization
programs undertaken by the Moroccan government has constrained expenditures
for the public investment budget well below the levels foreseen in the 1981-85
Development Plan. Authorizations exceeded actual funds available for
expenditure by a large margin. The traditional budget system was unable to
adjust to these changes and major reductions were made outside the normal
budget process with technical assistance from the Bank. The Government has
recognized the limits of the existing system and is designing and implementing
a modern, computer-based budgeting system that is linked closely with the
planning process, which is also being modified to make it more responsive to
changing circumstances--
81.      In the current system, the public investment program is defined in
the Five Year Plan at the beginning of the period. Priorities are set, and
the investment projects are agreed for each implementing ministry or agency
for the whole plan period, even though those in the later years have not been
Lhoroughly studied. The Five Year Plan becomes a law and forms the basis for
subsequent annual budget laws containing authorizations. The amounts
authorized by Parliament each year often exceed the amounts that actually may
be spent that year by a substantial amount. Unused authorizations are carried
over to the next year. However, operating ministries cannot begin actual
procurement activities or sign binding contracts against their budget
appropriation until they have received executive approval from the Ministry of
Finance. Once the approval is received, the investment outlays can be
initiated, and actual disbursement may take place in the year of approval or
any later year depending on the speed of execution of the project and
availability of financial resources.
82.      Neither the inclusion of a project in the Plan nor the authorization
in the annual budget law are effective control points to assure-careful
project selection. Insufficient information is often available-at the time
the Plan is prepared, and a number of political factors enter into the annual
budget process. Effective control is exercised by the Ministry of Finance
when the funds appropriated for a project are given executive approval and
when appropriated funds are carried forward without having been firmly
committed.    At those points, the Ministry of Finance can intervene, review
the project, and adjust the amount to be spent. Once funds have been



- 30 -
comuitted by the executing agency, the Ministry of Finance can delay
expenditures if resources are tight, but can no longer prevent their eventual
disbursement. In the past, a ratio of total authorizations to actual
resources available for disbursements of about 2 to 1 in a given year seemed
to work, given the slack in the system: less would result in lower actual
disbursements than funds available. However such a system is very poorly
suited to deal with fluctuations and reductions in resources available in
relation to the expectations of the Plan.
83.      The 1981-85 Plan initially inscribed investment levels of
DH 70.6 billion for the the five year period, expecting the resources to be
available, and DH 9.2 billion were added "hors Plan" L' After the Plan was
introduced, it became clear that resource availability wouild fall short of
planned expenditure. The Government was slow to react and did not cut
authorizations, which were based on the Plan. Disbursements were delayed when
funds were not available.  This led to complaints from suppliers and delays in
a number of projects.  The Bank became increasingly concerned about this and
conducted investment reviews in 1983 and 1984 to speed implementation of its
own projects.  In the course of these reviews, the fundamental problem became
clear, and technical assistance was provided to revise the investment program
by freezing some authorizations and delaying executive approval of others by
the Ministry of Finance.
84.      Priorities were set by the Moroccan authorities following discussions
with the Bank, and the investment program was reviewed in detail for six major
sectors. Projects were evaluated on the basis of the following criteria: i)
economic rate of return; ii) the stage of physical implementation of the
project; iii) the lead-time to realize project benefits; iv) the project's
contribution to export promotion and to efficient import substitution; v) the
need for budgetary contributions. On the basis of these priorities, a number
of projects that had been authorized were frozen, and others where
appropriations were made but not committed were postponed. Frozen
authorizatiors amounted to DH 4.6 billion in 1983, and DH 6.0 billion in
1984. New budget appropriations in these years amounted to DH 13.6 billion,
and DH 10.0 billion  H'.  However, resources available have fallen faster
than appropriations could be curtailed, ar,d arrears built up, amounting to
DH 4.6 billion in 1983 and DH 6.0 billion in 1984 on the basis of actual
commitments to be paid. Since all these commitments are not generally
submitted for payment in the same year, the arrears in a legal sense were less.
85.      This year the Government has further tightened up the review
procedure for approving expenditures and has carefully examined projects where
appropriations have not been committec. with the objective of further reducing
actual disbursements. A joint working group of the Ministries of Plan and
1/ The program "hors Plan" included one railway project and one irrigation
project which would have been implemented only if specific external
financing were available.
2/  These do not represent new projects, but appropriations for ongoing
projects expected to be committed in future years.



- 31 -
Finance under the direction of the Prime Minister has reviewed all projects
currently authorized in order to establish a full inventory of projects, their
state of preparation or execution, and their calendar of completion. This
review has been completed in May, 1985. All remaining projects of the 1981-85
Plan have,been scrutinized in relation to the criteria established, and
further cuts and delays will be enforced, reducing total outstanding
appropriations to DH 22.8 billion, against expected resource availability of
DH 10 billion, including DH 2 billion of special supplementary grant funds.
This will leave a carry-over plus arrears of DH 12.8 billion for 1986, the
first year of the next plan. Further efforts to reduce authorizations are
expected during the year as projects are reviewed for carry over into the new
plan beginninv    1986.  It is also expected that the 1986 Finance Law (Loi de
Finances) wilA definitely cancel the projects that have been frozen. While ad
hoc in nature, these interim procedures to limit the use of budget
appropriations and postpone commitments have assured that available resources
are directed to the priority projects. The Ministry of Finance recognizes
that this is at best a stop-gap measure and that given the momentum of
projects already begun, it will take another two to three years to work off
the backlog of approved projects even thotgh few new projects have been
started in the past two years.
86.      The Ministries of Plan and Finance are now cooperating clobely to
improve the planning and budgeting system. A new planning system will be
instituted in 1986 whereby only those projects of high priority and within the
limits of available resources will be included in the budget. Better analytic
tools would be installed in the Plan to estimate resource availability and the
impact of major investment projects. A new technical cell is expected to be
created in the Ministry of Finance to review project proposals and assure
their economic viability, consistency with the country's priorites, and
availability of resources prior to including them in the budget. A
computerized system of monitoring investment projects from their inception in
the Plan, their inclusion in the Finance Law, and the granting of executive
authority to commit funds, to their execution and completion, is now being
designed. It is expected to be implemented by mid-1986. This would allow
adequate control of the investment budget far enough upstream to prevent
serious project delays due to budget stringency late in the project cycle. It
would also assure that the rate of appropriation is consistent with resources
available. The Bank is working with the Moroccan authorities to improve the
analytic tools of the Plan and is providing technical assistance to the
Ministry of Finance to help design and implement the computerized system to
monitor the investment program and budget. An Investment Review will be
conducted in October to review the composition of the new Plan and the 1986
investment budget. Our review of the 1984 investment expenditures indicate
that they were very much in line with the priorities originally set. The '985
investment budget also conforms to those priorities.
D. EXPECTED EFFECTS OF THE SECOND PHASE OF ADJUSIMENT
87.      The goal of the ITPA I and II loans is to effect lasting structural
changes in Morocco's productive capacity and make the economy more dynamic and
flexible. The achievement of these goals is rendered more challenging by the
impact of this particularly difficult period in the country's economic
history. The policy of import-substituting industrialization followed since
independence gave rise to a highly distorted structure of production with



- 32 -
discrimination against exports and a low level of competitiveness and
efficiency in Moroccan industry. In addition, expansionary macroeconomic
policies pursued over the past decade led to unsustainable rates of growth, a
inefficient public sector, financial rigidities, and a dramatic rise in
foreign borrowing. The ensuing balance of paynments crisis, which necessitated
external debt rescheduling, was addressed by a series of stabilization
measures, and the imposition of sweeping import controls. The measures
implemented under the ITPA I Loan reversed these restrictions an the trade
regime and successfully began reorienting the economy towards export growth
and industrial competitiveness. Levels of trade openness prevailing before
the balance of payments crisis were restored and steps towards long-term
adjustment begun.
88.      The ITPA II loan is designed to support the next stage in the
process, which is a fundamental shift away from the inward-looking strategy
pursued in the past to a strategy of outward-oriented, export-led growth. The
adjustment program will take place, however, under the constraints of the
stabilization measures, which reflect the impact of lower levels of external
finarcing available for future current account deficits and the necessity to
restore equilibria on the external and public sector accounts. In order to
achieve a rapid decrease in the current account deficit, import demand,
including investment goods, must be contained, which implies implementing the
adjustment under conditions of lower rates of economic growth. To avoid a
precipitous decline in the level of domestic production, considerable
increases in exports and domestic savings are necessary, and in this way, the
stabilization and adjustment programs are complementary. The policy measures
envisaged under ITPA II, addressing the structural deficiencies in the
Moroccan economy, would serve to increase exports. and domestic savings, so as
to permit a higher level of imports, investment, and growth than would
otherwise be possible. The increase in performance will be achieved by
eliminating distortions in the present structure of production incentives, and
channeling increased domestic savings to the most productive uses through
reform of the financial sector, particularly regarding interest rates policy.
The speed of adjustment and hence the rate of economic growth are, however,
conditioned by the constraints of stabilization as well as the successful
implementation of the ITPA II policy reforms.
Macro-economic Projections
89.      The ITPA II adjustment program is expected to have a salutary effect
on the Moroccan economy as a whole. The program is based on a set of
coherent, mutually supportive policy measures designed to have a positive
impact on economic growth, subject to the limits imposed by external
constraints and the IMF stabilization program. Although the effects of the
adjustment program will be felt at the sectoral level, it is useful to focus
rather on their overall impact.
90.      Global Economic Trends.  The medium-term adjustment scenario is based
on the following assumptions concerning developments in the external
environment. Economic growth in tne OECD countries is assumed to average 3.3%



- 33 -
per annum during the period 1985-1990. International inflation is anticipated
to rise to 7.5Z per annum in 1986, and 8.0% in 1987-90. International
interest rates are projected to decline from about 12X in 1985 to OZ in
1986-88, and to 9Z in 1989-90. Apart from percoleum, commodity prices are
expected to recover slowly in the 1985-90 period increasing at about 2% per
annum in real terms. Finally, phosphate prices have begun to recover
following a steady decline through 1983 and are projected to increase by about
2.5Z per annum in real terms, stabilizing at an equilibrium price of $45 (in
1983 US dollars) in 1990.
91.      Policy Related Assumptions.  The macro-economic projections assume
continued progress on structural reform and stabilization as described in the
ITPA II and IMF programs. The growth of domestic absorption would be slowed
through restrictions on fiscal and monetary policy required for
stabilization. Export promotion and import liberalization would be supported
through further trade policy reforms and appropriate exchange rate
management. The reform of the financial system would encourage the
mobilization of domestic savings.
92.      In view of the constraints set by global exogenous factors, external
debt, and the stabilization program, an analysis of the policy measures
envisaged under ITPA II leads us to expect the following trends: The
progressive reductioa of trade taxes (special import tax, customs duties) and
quantitative restrictions should constitute an important step toward
restructuring the present system of incentives in order to attenuate the
existing bias against exports. These measures would be further supported by
measures reducing or eliminating other disincentives to exports, which should
have a significant impact on exporc growth. Exports of goods and non-factor
services are thus expected to increase by 4.2% in 1985 and 7.9% per annum
during 1985-1990. The growth of finished manufactured exports (excluding
fertilizers) is expected to rise from 9.2% per annum registered in 1984 under
TTPA I to an average of 14.5% per annum in constant terms during 1984-1990, as
the supply capacity for such an expansion grows. Current excess capacity in
the economy is not in export sectors, so a more rapid response to the policy
measures is not likely. Creation of this capacity is a major element in the
adjustment program and is supported by Bank project lending. Exports of
phosphoric acid and fertilizers, whose growth declined in 1984 due to capacity
constraints, are expected to rise once new processing facilities are brought
onstream in 1985. As a result, total phosphate exports should increase by
8.9Z per annum in 1985-90, implying a significant increase in Morocco's share
of the world phosphate trade. Agricultural exports, which include fish and
processed food, will also benefit from the reduction in anti-export biases and
are expected to grow at an average real rate of 4% per annum in 1985-90.
Appropriate exchange rate policies coupled with global economic recovery
should also lead to an improvemeat in the service account: tourism, in
particular, is expected to grow at 8% per annum in real terms, while other
nonfactor service exports should increase at the same rate as merchandise
exports.



- 34 -
93.      Import demand, which was unexpectedly high in 1984, due, in part, to
exogenous factors, is assumed to increase very slowly in the near future from
the high 1984 base. Containment of import growth is contingent on: (i) the
implementation of appropriate demand management policies in the short-term,
including limits on public expenditures and monetary expansion, the adoption
of appropriate price and wage policies and continued reduction of subsidies;
(ii) flexible management of the exchange rate to offset reductions in the
levels of protection; and (iii) improvement in the efficiency of import
substitution industries leading to reduced reliance of the Moroccan economy on
imported inputs. The growth rate of agricultural imports is projected to
decline as a result of assumed normal climatic conditions and increased
domestic production linked to policy measures on producer prices and the
reduction of consumer subsidies- . Energy imports are assumed to grow at an
average rate of 1.6% per annum during 1985-1990, reflecting both a slowdown of
domestic demand as well as progress in the areas of conservation and the
development of domestic energy resources. Intermediate goods imports other
than sulfur should grow modestly at an average of 2.7% per annum over the
1985-1990 period, reflecting a rise in the efficient substitution of imported
inputs as a result of trade policy reform. On the other hand, capital goods
imports are expected to deeline by 1.3% over the 1985-1990 period as a result
of the reduction in overall investment growth as well as the policy measures
designed to correct fiscal and financial distortions which encourage the use
of imported, capital-intensive processes. Imports of non-food consumption
goods should increase at a rate of 2.4% as a result of complementary policies
(e.g. exchange rate, VAT) pursued in conjunction with trade liberalization
measures.  These measures would forestall an increase in the imported content
of consumption. Finally, on the basis jf commodity price forecasts and the
estimated average annual rate of international inflation during 1985-88,
Morocco should experience a slight improvement in its terms of trade over the
next few years.
94.      The proposed financial policy reform and the fiscal stabilization
program are designed to increase the levels of domestic resource mobilization
and channel these resources to their most productive uses through greater
reliance on market forces and more efficient financial intermediation. By
raising the opportunity ccst of capital, investors will be less inclined to
undertake direct investment in projects offering lower financial rates of
return. The effect of higher deposit rates and flexible exchange management
on worker remittances from abroad will contribute to the increased
mobilization of financial resources. Commercial bank margins will benefit
from the proposed financial reform and increase on a gross basis from 5.9% to
6.3%. This is principally due to the measure which significantly reduces the

lending to this sector from the Bank; the first agricultural sector luan
is planned for FY85.



- 35 -
deposit base of obligatory placement requirements of commercial banks to the
Treasury, thereby increasing the return on loanable funds. On this basis, it
does not appear that the overall package of policy reforms will impose
insuperable costs on the concerned economic agents and will offer scope for
more competition ip the financial sector.
95.      The increase in deposit rates and the liberalization of the financial
sector together with the increasing public savings is expected, moreover, to
raise the ratio of gross domestic savings to GDP from 12% in 1984 to 17% by
1990, implying a sharp rise i2 the marginal savings rate from the historical
level of 10-11% to about 40% by 1990. Only through a sharp increase in
domestic savings can the external deficit be reduced while maintaining
investment at levels sufficient for adjustment. In view of the greater fiscal
restraint required by the IMF stabilization program, the overall budget
deficit is expected to decline from 7.8% of GDP in 1984 to 6.5% in
1985,equivalent to DH 8.0 billion. It will decline further to alout 2% of
GDP by 1988. This implies Government savings will increase from '0.7% of GDP
in 1984 to about 3% in 1988.
96.      Results of the Macro-economic Projections.  Compared with a growth of
2.4% in 1984, GDP is expected to increase at over 4% in 1985, as a result of a
recovery in the agriculture sector.  However, the associated stabilization ;
measures will allow GDP to grow only 2.8% per annum on average through 1990.
With population growth forecast at about 2.5% per annum, per capita GNP and
consumption would not register much real increase before the end of the
decade. Notwithstanding the positive effects of ITPA II, medium-term growth
will continue to be constrained by stabilization efforts, external debt, and
the depth of the structural change required in the productive structure. Most
of the positive growth effects of the adjustment policy measures will be felt
after 1988, although it is necessary to initiate action now to achieve the
results in that time frame. The measures to increase product vity and
allocate resources more efficiently are reflected in the decline of the
five-year ICOR from 8.3 in 1980-85 (relatively high due to a lower base rate
of growth) to 5.7 in 1985-90.
97.      The narrowing of the resource gap implied by stabiliaation suggests
that the increase in domestic savings to 17% of GDP in 1990 will uot be
sufficient to maintain the share of investment at its present levels,
particularly in view of the decline in external financing in the future. This
will result in a reduction of the share of both consumption and investment in
GDP, with investment growth declining until investment corresponds to domestic
and foreign savings availabilities. The share of gross fixed investment is
thus projected to fall throughout the 1985-1990 period in real terms,
decreasing from approximately 22.9% of GDP during 1984 to 18.5% towards the
end of the decade. This reduction in the share will be borne about equally by
public enterprises, the Government, and the private sector. An increase in
the surplus of private savings is critical to achieving the overall
investment-savings equilibrium. It will serve to finance a portion of the
savings shortfall of the public sector. Increased financial savings and
higher economic returns on investment are dependent on the Government's
ability to increase public savings and improve allocation of domestic
resources through a policy of positive real interest rates, greater
deregulation of lending rates, and a more flexible financial sector.

98.      A key result of the adjustment process in the medium-term is a
reduction in the current account deficit from l0.7% of GDP in 1984, before
debt rescheduling, to 1.5Z by 1990, with short-term targets of 6.5S of GDP in
1985 and 4.52 of GDP in 1986 as agreed with the IMF. Export growth will
contribute to this. In addition, the share of imports of goods and non-factor
services in GDP is projected to decliuae from 35.7Z in 1984 to 33.3% in 1990.
This result is closely related to the maintenance of a flexible exchange rate
policy and the judicious management of domestic demand over the next few
years, including strict controls on public expenditure, appropriate pricing,
wage, and subsidy policies.

99.      The medium-term adjustment scenario projects a $1 billion annsal
increase in external debt outstanding and disbursed until 1987; thereafter,
debt outstanding will stabilize through the end of the decade at a level just
below $14 billion. Substantial amounts of medium and long-term capital will
thus be required over the next few years to finance the continuing current
account deficits and meet the formidable debt repayment schedule, including
significant EMF repurchases. Total gross capital requirements would average
$2.3 billion annually in 1985-87. Of this total, about $1.3 billion, on
average, could take the form of additional debt relief, essentially along the
lines of the debt reschedulings obtained by Morocco from its creditors in
1983-84. The remainder could be obtained through normal medium- and long-term
capital inflows, which could amount to about $1 billion a year on a net
disbursement basis (after rescheduling), provided that new loan commitments
from Morocco's official lenders can be maintained at their current rate (about
$1 billion a year in 1983-84), along with the Government-guaranteed bank loan
programs already in place in connection with official assistance. According
to the macro-economic projections, the ratio of debt outstanding and disbursed
to exports of goods and services will decline from a peak of 258Z in 1984 to
139Z by 1990. Moreover, the debt service ratio (excluding IMF repurchases)
LI Before debt rescheduling.



- 37 -
will decrease from 54.52 before debt rescheduling in 1984 to 32.72 in 1990.
'Net external factor receipts are projected to decline from 0.9% to 0.41 of
(MP, primarily because of higher foreign debt payments.  The portion of
Morocco's total debt outstanding and disbursed owed to the Bank was 9.31 in
1984 and is projected to increase to 18.9X in 1990.
100.     An important result of the Government's program of economic
adjustment would be to enhance Morocco's creditworthiness in the medium-term.
During the transition period, when adjustment and stabilization policies take
hold, the economy's needs for longer term external resources would be covered
by multilateral assistance (in large part from the IMF and the Bank), official
aid, and mixed credits. Rescheduling of official and commercial debt is
expected to continue till 1988. In function of the projected reduction of the
disequilibrium in the balance of pawments and the restoration of the econmy to
a sustainable and stable growth pattern, the expected effects of stabilization
and structural adjustment, Morocco would gain renewed access to commercial
funds from international capital markets. The improvements in export
performance, productive efficiency, and domestic resource mobilization would
reduce the debt service ratio (including payments on rescheduled debt) to an
estimated level of 33% in 1990, from 46% in 1985. The increase in the Bank's
share of the external debt during the transition period would support
adjustment efforts, leading to an improvement in the structure of Morbcco's
external liabilities, and hence a more appropriate debt structure. On the
other hand, in the absence of adjustment as supported by the Bank, not only
would there not be such improvement in creditworthiness and the debt
structure, but Morocco's ability to meet its current external commitments
would be impaired.
101.     The implementation of stabilize! on policies and measures for
structural adjustment would entail some Lransitional social costs. Tight
control of the public investment budget and of growth of Government
expenditure on personnel, increases in public enterprise tariffs, and prices
of basic staples, as well as measures to improve industrial efficiency would
be reflected to some extent in depressed domestic demand, increased
unemployment, and some possible reductions of incomes and real wages of urban
workers, especially of Government employees and employees of less competitive
firms. However, erosion in real personal incomes will be mitigated with
control of inflation, and over the medium-term, the restoration of economic
dynamism and strengthening of growth prospects will help address the issue of
unemployment. Increased private investment and exports are expected to result
from the structural change envisaged; the maintenance of real, positive
interest rates and encouragement of exports should reduce the bias in favor of
highly capital-incentive investments and promote employment. In addition,
consumer welfare would be increased through overall improvement in the
efficiency of Moroccan industry.
E. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
102.     In the past, the Bank has supported Morocco's development efforts
with investment projects in agriculture, rural development, infrastructure,
housing, energy development, industrial finance, etc.  These have contributed
to development of these sectors and improvements in sector policy. The Bank
has also carried on a general policy dialogue in the context of its economic
and sector work and sponsored studies in a number of areas, including



- 38 -
industrial and trade policy. With the crisis of 1982-83, the Bank shifted the
primary focus of its activity from projects to a greater concentration on the
policy dialogue and lending to support structural change. The policy dialogue
in industry and trade has been supported by the ITPA I loan, which is followed
by this op3ration. The policy dialogue in agriculture is being supported by a
sector loan to be presented shortly. Disc'issions concerning major policy
reforms are being conducted on education a-id vocational training, health,
transportation and public enterprises. Th- impact of the Bank on policy
formulation is significant and positive.
103.    The Bank's policy based lending a d application of special action
program measures to Morocco have provided ital financial support during this
difficult period. The Bank is assuming a .arger share of total and official
financing during this period to support the structural changes necessary to
restore Morocco's longer term financial stability and creditworthiness. This
will also lead to a healthier mix of official and private debt in Morocco's
portfolio while assuring that the necessary policy reforms are put in place.
The Bank's program provides a vehicle for attracting co-financing from other
official and eventually perhaps private sources that are increasingly willing
to be associated with the Bank supported reforms. As this process continues,
the Bank can redu;e its own involvement and stabilize its share.
104.    The Bank is, as a function of its larger role in policy discussions
and aid flows, playing a larger role in aid coordination and consultation.
The Morocco Consultative Group has been revived under the Bank's chairmanship
and provides a forum for the Government to present and discuss its new
strategy with donors. The Consultative Group Meeting in January 1985 has
already shown some positive impact in facilitating bilateral aid flows. The
Bank plans to increase its role in aid coordination in cooperation with the
Government.
F. IMF ACTIVITIES IN MOROCCO AND GOVERNMENT/INF/BANK COOPERATION
105.     In the last five years, the IMF has supported a series of
stabilization programs in Morocco through: i) an Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
for $1.2 billion (SDR 956 million), negotiated in 1980, but declared
inoperative in late 1981 when the target on domestic credit could not be met;
ii) a one-year stand-by and drawings under the Compensatory Financing
Facility, totaling about $570 million (SDR 518 million), which replaced the
EFF in April 1982; and iii) a stand-by covering the second half of 1983 and
calendar 1984, for $317 million (SDR 300 million). The key objectives of
these programs were to address budgetary and balance of payments
disequilibria. The specific targets and measures under the 1983-84 stand-by
are described in paragraphs 43-47 . Progress under the program was good in
1983. Initial targets were revised upwards. T_e performance criteria were
met in 1984, but macro-economic adjustment was impeded by continued severe
drought, slower growth than expected, and budgetary and external deficits
which exceeded targets. The curtailment of payments on the investment budget
led to further build-up of payment arrears, the Government was unable to
implement the proposed price increases for subsidized commodities in January
1984, the implementation of major fiscal reform was delayed, and the dirham
appreciated in the second half of 1984 in relation to currencies of major
trading partners. These developments have led to an increased emphasis in the
latest stand-by -n corrective budgetary, monetary, and balance of payments
measures. The ma.n features of this new agreement are discussed in Part III.



- 39 -
106.     There has been full coordination of Fund and Bank positions on
assistance to Morocco, with extensive consultation and exchange of information
at the staff level between the two institutions. Two Bank staff members
participated in the mid-June 1983 preparatory IMF mission and two Fund staff
participated in the Bank economic updating mission in July 1984. Their
participation was aimed in particular at ensuring consistency in economic and
financial projections, and reviewing the revised Government investment
budget. The preparation of the currently proposed loan was also coordinated
closely with IMF staff, and the appraisal mission was in the field at the same
time that the IMF mission was there negotiating the 1985-87 Stand-by. The
missions stayed in close contact.
107.     There have been detailed discussions with Fund staff on the program
of measures under the proposed loan. There is full agreement on its overall
objectives, on the specific measures, and on their timi g. The division of
work has followed the comparative advantages of the cwc institutions, with the
Fund handling short-term macro management, budgetary dnd exchange rate issues,
and fiscal reform. The Bank has addressed issues concerning the content of
the public investment program, the rationalization of public enterprises and
long term improvements in planning, as well as structural adjustments of
trade, industrial policy, and the financial sector. The Moroccan Government
has welcomed the close cooperation between the Bank and the Fund, as it hits
helped assure consistency between the programs supported by the two
institutions.
108.     The Bank has participated in discussions organized by the IMF to
coordinate balance of payments assistance over the short-term (para. 21),
presenting its view of Morocco's medium-term prospects, and it chaired the
meeting of the Consultative Group in January 1985, in which the Fund was a
major participant.
PART IV: THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. LOAN HISTORY
109.     The ITPA loan, approved in January 1984 was conceived as the first in
a series of sectoral adjustment loans to Morocco.  Given the far-reaching
nature of the changes in industry and trade, it was clear that they would need
to be phased over a period of four to five years, and would probably require
continued Bank assistance. The Bank carried out a comprehensive study of the
financial sector in 1983-84, with a view to policy changes which could improve
intermediation efficiency and savings mobilization. The Bank and the
Government have also engaged in an increasingly close dialogue on ways to
rationalize the public investment program, and reform of the public enterprise
sector. The loan was appraised in February/March 1985; negotiations were held
in Washington in April, 1985. The Moroccan delegation was led by Mr. Tazi,
Director of the Treasury at the Ministry of Finance. Supplementary loan data
are provided in Annex III.



-140-
B. DISBURSEMENT AND PROCUREMENT
110.    The proposed loan would be disbursed in two tranches, and is expected
to be fully disbursed within a year of loan effectiveness. The first tranche
of $120.0 million would be available upon effectiveness, and the second
tranche of $80.0 million would become available about six months later.
Disbursement of the second tranche would be conditional on: i) satisfactory
progress with respect to continued implementation of the program of adjustment
set forth in the Government's Statement of Development Policy (Annex IV), and
ii) on the Government's having taken the following actions (Loan Agreement,
para. 3 of Schedule 1 and Schedule 4): a) elimination of export certificate
requirements for specified mining products and hides and leather (para. 52
above and para. 4 of the annex to the Government's Statement of Development
Policy); b) establishment of a Committee for Simplification of Foreign Trade
Procedures (para. 52 above and para. 7 of the annex to the Statement);
c) elimination of the Statistical Export Tax (para. 54 above, and para. 9 of
the annex to the Statement); d) reduction of the Special Import Tax to 5% of
the cif price of imports (para. 56 above and para. 12 of the annex to the
Statement); e) reduction of the maximum rate of customs duty on each imported
good to 451 (para. 56 abore and para. 13 of the annex to the Statement);
f) elimination of import licensing requirements on specified products through
their transfer to List A (free list, and elimination of prbhibitions against
imports of specified products, through their transfer from List C (items
banned from import) (para. 59 above and para. 15 of the annex to the
Statement); and g) payment by the Government of DH 1 billion of arrears owed
to public enterprises (para. 76 above and para. 22 of the annex to the
Statement).
111.    The satisfactory administrative disbursement and procurement
arrangements made for ITPA I will be continued, with the Ministry of Finance
and the Bank of Morocco bearing the main responsibility for administering the
proposed loan.
112.    The loan would reimburse 100l   of the foreign exchange cost of
eligible imports. Ineligible imports include goods financed from other
sources, goods intended ror military or paramilitary use, and goods for luxury
consumption. A list of ineligible imports is included in the Annex to
Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement. Expenditures for goods procured under
contracts of $25,000 or less would not be eligible for financing.
Disbursements against petroleum products and foodstuffs will be limited to a
maximum of $50 million. (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para. 2 (d) and (g)).
Retroactive financing would be permitted up to $20.0 million of expenditures
made after March 8, 1985 (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para. 2 (c)). The
retroactive financing is to ensure a smooth transition between the ITPA I
and II loans, particularly in view of the important measures of the ITPA II
program already implemented.
113.     The Rank of Morocco will be responsible for maintaining loan
accounts, and for the preparation and submissicn of withdrawal applications.
Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made on the basis of a summary
from the Bank of Morocco detailing individual transactions in a given period,
in respect of eligible imports, together with a certification from the Bank of
Morocco of payment of the amounts involved, and of their eligibility under the



- 41 -
loan. Documentation would be retained by the concerned commercial banks, and
made available for review by Bank supervision missions. Applications for
withdrawal will be consolidated and submitted in amounts not less than
$1 million (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para. 1 (b)).
114.     Both private and publ-ic sector imports would be eligible for
financing. Commonly traded commodities may be purchased through price
quotations available from organized international commodity markets.
Contracts under $5 million each and contracts for petroleum purchases would be
awarded on the basis of the normal procurement practices of the purchaser.
PetroLeum is procured under bilateral agreements with oil-exporting countries;
these agreements are based on prevailing market prices, and are generally for
a maximum period of 12 months. Contracts for the procurement of goods by the
private sector estimated to cost less than $5 million are awarded on the basis
of normal procurement procedures. Public sector imports under contracts below
$5 million are procured in accordance with standard Government practices,
which require competitive bidding, and which are acceptable to the Bank.
Contracts for all other goods, public and private, estimated to cost $5
million or more each, will be procured through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines (Loan Agreement, Schedule 3).
C. MONITORING
115.     The implementation of the adjustment program will be monitored by the
inter-ministerial committee which was established to follow-up on the ITPA I
program. This committee will meet regularly to review progress, and to decide
on appropriate actions to ensure timely implementation.
116.     The Bank will also monitor the prcgress of implementation of the
program through regular supervision and exchange of views with the Government,
covering, inter alia, actual performance towards the goals of policy change,
particularly as regards exports. As part of this process, the Government will
prepare and send the Bank two status reports, summarizing the status or
implementation, the first by early January 1986, and the second by June 1986.
The first status report would precede a mid-term review, which in turn would
form the basis for the release of the second tranche of the loan (see
para. 110 and Loan Agreement, Section 3.01).
D. RISKS L-SD JUSTIFICATION
117.     The risks of the adjustment program relate to the uncertainties in
the external environment and export prospe:ts; the possibility of further
deterioration of Morocco's financial situation or inability to follow the IMF
program, which could affect the commitment to import liberalization; and the
difficulty of assuring adequate rigor of the adjustment process over a
sufficiently long period. The medium-term prospects outlined in this report
are based on assumptions of continued export growth, active exchange rate
policy, and fiscal and monetary discipline. The magnitude of the expected
benefits of the program cannot be predicted with certainty. If the projected
increase in exports does not materialize as a result of unexpected adverse
developments in the trade environment or international economic conditions, or



- 42 -
if the rate of growth is reduced as a result of adverse climatic conditions or
inadequate policy support, the Moroccan economy's performance may be lower
than projected. The resulting lower output and increased unemiloyment may
lead to pressure on the Government to ease stabilization efforts and reverse
import liberalization. The need to reduce the Treasury deficit and the
progressive change in the structure of the fiscal system as a result of
reduced dependence on customs duties will require difficult decisions to raise
other taxes and cut Government expenditures. Firms which are unable to
effectively compete are also likely to mount pressure to revecse import
liberalization.
118.     There are, however, significant features which reduce the above
risks. First, the Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to
adjustment by implementating the ITPA I program and the stablization as agreed
with the IMF in 1983-84, despite a difficult economic environment. This
commitment has been clearly affirmed during the January 1985 Consultative
Group meeting.  The ITPA II program and stabilization program under the*
standby arrangement for 1985-87 therefore represent key elements of a coherent
strategy for changing macro-policy and restructuring the economy. The
Government has weighed the risks of this strategy and come to the conclusion
that there are no viable alternatives other than such adjustment for restoring
the economy to a dynasbic pattern of growth and eliminating the need for
rescheduling external debt beyond a reasonable period. During implementation
of ITPA I, the Government clearly indicated to the public that this was only
the first phase in a medium-term adjustment program; momentum has
subsequently been maintained, and the program is receiving increasing support
in the Government. Measures will be implemented to offset some of the adverse
effects of the program. For example, a flexible exchange rate policy will
cushion the budgetary effect of reductions in tariff rates and special taxes
and will forstall increases in imports due to lower tariffs. Also, industrial
restructuring programs will be implemented to help firms adjust to a more
competitive environment. The implementation of the program in phases will
help allow firms to adjust gradually. Estimates of the fiscal cost of the
various measures in the program have been reviewed in detail with the
Government. It is expected that during the critical period required for
policies to take hold, the support of the IMF, the Bank, and bilateral donors
will provide adequate access to resources.
119.     The main justification for the proposed Bank loan is that it will
support the Government in a particularly critical phase of the on-going
medium-term program of policy change and economic restructuring. The expected
impact of the program, as described in section III D above, is to effect a
fundamental revitalization of the framework for export production, and improve
efficiency globally in the mobilization, allocation, and utilization of
resources. Some of the adjustment measures (such as reduction of import
tariffs and increase of interest rates) would impose immediate costs on the
Government, while the benefits would be perceptible in the longer-term. Tax
revenues will decline by about $180 million annually as a result of the tariff
reductions. The introduction of the tax reform will widen the tax base to
eventually provide additional revenues, so as to make up for the shortfall in
receipts. The IMF has adjusted its budget targets to take account of this
revenue shortfall, as well as the financing from the proposed ITPA II loan.



- 43 -
The financial sector reforms will raise Government interest payments by about
$25 million per annum until the Treasury reduces its domestic borrowing
requirements. The higher rate of export growth will raise the economy-wide
requirements for foreign exchange-denominated working capital to cover higher
inventory levels of imported inputs. The value of imports entering through
the temporary admission scheme rose from DH 2.4 billion to DR 3.2 billion
between 1983 and 1984. If stocks were to rise by 25S as a result of export
growth, working capita. requirements, and hence foreign exchange needs, would
increase by $35 millic . Finally, the structural changes require new capital
investment in equipmer.- and certain intermediate goods to achieve the desired
increases in productici and productivity. These must be imported and the
foreign exchange proce ds of the loan will permit a higher level of necessary
imports to accelerate the structural change.
120.     The proposed Bank loan would help mitigate the costs of adjustment
and provide resources for imports during the adjustment period. It is an
important element of the total package of financial support expected from the
international community in 1985-so. Other elements of this package are the
stand-by agreement with the IMF, and rescheduling of official and commercial
debt. Such support is essential for the adjustment process to be carried out
in a planned and systematic manner. At the same time, Bank assistance would
contribute significantly to enhancing Morocco's creditworthiness in the
medium-term, as the effects of adjustment become evident. In this context,
cofinancing with commercial lenders is being explored by the Government in
support of the ITPA II adjustment program. If such cofinancing were to
materialize, it would be within the IMF ceiling for commercial borrowing (see
para. 46), but would help improve the term structure of Morocco's external
debt.
PART V: OTHRn BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO1'
121.     Bank lending to Morocco has supported 63 projects, financing a total
of $2,408.5 million (net of cancellaticns), of which $25 million f7om a Third
window loan. IDA credits, totalling $45.2 million, have been made available
for five projects. IFC investments have amounted to $99.1 million
($52.2 million after cancellations, terminations, repayments and sales).
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits, and of
IFC investments, as of March 31, 1985.
122.     Until recently, performance in project execution has been
satisfactory overall, although in some cases management problems have caused
delays in project implementation, and in others insufficient tariff
adjustments have affected project entities' financial performance. However,
during 1983 and 1984, as budgetary constraints became more severe, projects
relying on the Government budget for a substantial part of financing have been
seriously delayed because of inadequate budgetary allocations. The
appreciation of the dollar vis-a-vis the dirham in recent years has reduced
considerably reimbursable expenses in dollar terms, thus lowering
disbursements vis-a-vis appraisal estimates. The ratio of disbursements to
11 Part V is essentially the same as Part II in the Jerada Coal Mine
Modernization and Expansion Loan (Report No. P-3965-MOR of
February 27,. 1985).



-44-
appraisal estimates averaged. 48% as of March 31, 1985, low in comparison to
other countries in the region.
123.    The objectives of Bank Group activities in Morocco are to support
(a) investments and policy reforms aimed at structural adjustment and
strengthening the balance-of-payments; (b) measures to reduce the Treasury
deficit; and (c) efforts to redress poverty and :mprove income distribution,
particularly through lowering the unit costs for the delivery of basic
services, in order to increase access by lower-i .come groups. Important
structural reforms must be undertaken in the com ng years, in order to return
to a path of reasonable economic growth compatib e with a sustainable external
payments position. A major objective of Bank ec nomic and sector work is to
provide the analytical basis for the development of specific proposals for
structural reform, which in several cases may later be supported by Bank
lending. The Government has requested that, in addition to ongoing work on
the public investment program, the Bank assist in developing reform proposals
relating to public enterprises (for which a sector mission visited Morocco in
May 1985), and the education and agricultural sectors. Because severe
budgetary constraints are likely to persist over the medium-term, projects now
under preparation are being designed to minimize their reliaiice on budgetary
funds.
124.    Agriculture continues to represent the most important sector in Bank
lending for Morocco. Past Bank lending has primarily supported rural
development or irrigation projects focusing on particular geographical
regions, as well as a highly successful agricultural credit program. In the
future, increased attention will be given to agricultural support services at
the national level, which are essential for backstopping regional development
projects and would be more appropriate vehicles for addressing sectoral policy
issues. Projects are under preparation in agricultural inputs distribution,
research and extension services, cereals storage and marketing and irrigation
management. In view of limited budgetary resources, special attention would
be paid to maximizing non-budgetary financing and improving cost recovery.
Sector work on agricultural incentives - fiscal, financial, pricing and
institutional policies - has been undertaken; and a program of agricultural
sector policy lending is plan2ned to support measures of structural reform.
125.    Energy and mining. The Government has given high priority to
reducing the oil import bill, a major factor in the current account deficit,
through development of domestic energy supplies. The Bank has supported this
effort through loans for the exploration and appraisal of petroleum (primarily
natural gas) and oil shale resources as well as for power generation and
transmission. Future projects would assist in the development of domestic
energy supplies, including gas, and hydropower. In FY85, a Bank loan has been
approved for the Jerada Coal Mine Modernization and Expansion project.
Through these projects as well as in our sectoral policy dialogue, efficiency
in energy development and use would be promoted through attention to pricing,
cost recovery and management issues. A pilot project to support small-scale,
export-oriented mining activities in a remote, low-income region still be
monitored with a view to its possible extension.
126.    Bank lending for infrastructure and utilities has helped to build a
number of technically competent agencies in the fields of road transportation,
electricity, water supply, housing finance, and community infrastructure

finance, as well as to expand the provision of essential services. Future
projects will place greater emphasis on improving the productivity and
efficiency of existing infrastructure through improved financial and
management performance. Mobilization of private and non-budgetary financing
as well as improved cost recovery in these subsectors through tpriffs should
help reduce the Treasury deficit. la addition to continuing support for the
above-mentioned subsectors, projects are under preparation for ports, sewerage
and telecommunications.
127.     Industrial development in Morocco has been supported primarily
through strengthening the financial and institutional resources of the Banque
Nationale de Developpement Economique (BNDE), the major source of industrial
medium-term credit. In addition, policy changes were introduced to widen
access to credit by small-scale labor-intensive industries. Other projects
focused on phosphate processing and cement production. The Bank's efforts are
now focused on the development and implementation of medium-term policy
reforms aimed at encouraging exports and improving incentives to domestic
production. The first phase of such reforms was supported by the Industrial
and Trade Policy Adjustment (ITPA) loan, and the second phase of the
medium-term ITPA program adopted by the Government, as well as comprehensive
financial sector reform continuing rationalization of the public investment
program, and discrete phases of public enterprise reform are supported by the
proposed ITPA II loan. At the same time, the Bank is contributing through
project lending to building up productive capacity to support the Government's
priorities in the sector, particularly export promotion. The Electrical and
Mechanical Industries Project, approved in FY85, aims at deepening the
industrial base, encouraging term-lending to industry by commercial banks, and
strengthening industrial promotion.
128.     Education, health and urban development projects will increasingly
concentrate on lowering unit costs in order to widen the access by low-income
groups. Policy dialogue in these sectors continues to encourage the shift
away from capital-intensive investments benefitting limited clientele and the
development of more cost-ei.ccLive delivery systems for basic services. While
previous Bank-financed projects have supported technical education, rural
primary eduication _...'a p.roved teacher training, these should be complemented
by efforts to expaua h-4ic education and skill training, as well as
restructuring of the formal education system, which has represented a major
drain on the recurrent btiiegt. A first health development project would test
new health care delivery systems in order to improve basic health services in
rural areas. Finally, the experience of projects in urban upgrading will be
continued and expanded, with increased efforts t- -obilize private financing
in order to reduce budgetary costs.

TRANSLATION OF THE ORIGINAL DRAFT IN FRENCH
Dear Mr. Clausen,
Statement of DeveloPment Policy: Second Industrial
and Trade Policy Adjustment Program (ITPA :1)
Introduction
1.       In 1983-84, the Government of Morocco undertook a serious
stabilization effort, in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund,
and a program of policy adjustment in the industrial and international t-ade
sectors, which was supported by the World Bank through the Industrial and
Trade Policy Adjustment loan (2377-MOR). The objectives of these joint
efforts of stabilization and adjustment were to correct the global
disequilibria of the economy, particularly of the balance of payments and the
budget, and to implement a continuing reform program to address structural
constraints, so as to restore dynamism to the Moroccan economy. It was
realized that the nature and the complexity of the structural issues would
make it necessary to continue the adjustment program over a prolonged period
of several years. However, we are convinced that the adjustment process
initiated in 1983-84 has already contributed significantly to a perceptible
change in relation to past policies.
2.       In a second phase, the Government is committed to continue the
adjustment program developed in collaboration with the World Bank as well as
the stabilization program agreed with the IMF. The measures and specific
actions recommended would contribute to the intensification and broadening of
adjustment, and reflect changes in the economic environment and the results of
implemented actions. The World Bank contributes, through its financial
support and its analyses, to this process.
Recent Performance of the Moroccan Economy
3.       In the context of a world economic situation which was not very
encouraging, the Moroccan Government was able to respect the performance
criteria of the stabilization program agreed with the IMF. Important progress
was registered in correcting the financial disequilibria of the economy. From
a level of 13.3% of GDP in 1982, the current account deficit of the balance of
payments was reduced to 8% in 1983 (before debt rescheduling), that is, from
an amount of about $2 billion in 1981 and 1982 to $1,060 million in 1983. The
implementation of a flexible exchange rate policy and a series of export
promotion measures contributed to this progress, as also a tightening of
import restrictions in early 1983. The budget deficit was reduced by about
30Z in 1983, from 12.3Z of GDP in 1982 to 9.1Z in 1983. This reduction was
effected principally through tight control of the public investment budget.

4.       On the other hand, in 1984, even with the observance of the
performance criteria of the IMF and the implementation of the ITPA measures,
the performance of the economy was not very satisfactory, as a result largely
of the unexpected continuation of the drought. The growth rate was only 2.4X,
the budget deficit was at 7.8S of GDP and the deficit of the current account
of the balance of payments rose to $1.2 billion. In 1984 the budget deficit
was coutrolled by a tight control of expenditures, in particular as regards
the investment budget, in the case of which expenditures only grew by 6.7X.
Expenditures on salaries, materials purchases and personnel recruitment were
strictly controlled, and petroleum product subsidies were eliminated through
periodic price adjustments. Investment expenditures were reduced in 1984 to
an estimated amount of DH 7.4 billion, as against the planned figure of
DH 8.5 billion. As regards the balance of payments, exports grew at 7.81 in
volume terms. Phosphate exports grew at 5.81, and phosphoric acid exports at
19.1%; agricultural exports continued to stagnate because of adverse climatic
conditions; and exports of finished goods grew by 9.2n, reflecting improved
competitivity. The higher than anticipated balance of payments deficit is
explained by increased imports of wheat and petroleum, and the tendency to
restock raw materials.
5.       The increased imports of cereals in 1984 and the appreciation of the
dollar resulted in an increase in expenditures on subsidies of basic food
products. The appreciation of the dollar also increased the payment of
interest on the external debt. As regards financing of the budget, the most
important developments were the debt rescheduling, and a more important
recourse of the Treasury to the money market.
The ITPA Program
6.       The objectives of this important program of structural reform were to
improve the system of industrial incentives in order to address the
fundamental problem of inefficient resource utilization in the industrial
sector, improve the balance of payments situation through export promotion,
effect more efficient import substitution, and create the necessary conditions
for employment generation and higher growth. The strategy underlying this
program consists of: (a) modification of industrial and trade policy, which
was previously focussed on protection of the domestic market, in order to
encourage an outward-looking approach; and (b) reducing administrative
controls and increasing reliance on market forces. The economic policy
measures envisaged in the first phase (1983-84) concerned the following main
areas: export incentives, protection reform, fiscal measures, improvements of
the financial system, and price liberalization. The results of the adjustment
policies which were implemented in 1983-84 have been clearly encouraging.
7.       However, the disequilibria at end-1984 were more serious than
expected at the beginning of implementation of the adjustment program. This
consideration influences the design of policies in the second phase of
adjustment (1985-86), in order to return to a viable balance of payments
situation and a satisfactory rate of growth of the economy.

8.       The Government's objectives, made explicit at the Consultative Group
meeting in January 1985 are to pursue economic and financial restructuring, in
order to achieve in the next four years a reduction in the balance of payments
deficit sufficiently large to eliminate the need for debt rescheduling at the
end of this period. The growth rate during this period will be 32 per annum.
These objectives wll be achieved through reinforced policies of export
promotion, trade liberalization, promotion of domestic savings, improvement of
the efficiency of resource allocation and utilization in the economy. In this
context, it would be important to improve the planning and budgeting system,
and to rationalize the public enterprise sector. The expected results of
these policies will only be perceptible slowly, given the structural and
fundamental nature of the changes. Consequently, during this period, it will
be necessary to implement suitable complementary measures to control the level
of aggregate demand and the part of this demand which translates into
imports. Despite the difficulties which can be envisaged, the Government is
comitted to realizing the required structural changes, and hopes to continue
to benefit from the increased support of multilateral development
institutions, as well as customary and exceptional aid from bilateral donors,
and recourse to international financing markets, in order to meet the
difficulties associated with the adjustment process.
The Next Phase of Adiustment
9.       In function of the medium-term perspective summarized above and of
its global strategy, the Government has prepared, with the IMF, a standby
program covering the period up to February 1987. In the framework of this
program, the Government's objectives are to reduce: (a) the current account
deficit of the balance of payments to 6.5X of GDP in 1985 and 4.51 in 1986;
and (b) the budget deficit to 6.5Z of GDP in 1985 and 4.5X in 1986. Policies
in the areas of taxation (including the implementation of fiscal reform and
control of public expenditures), money and credit, exchange rate management,
public investments and public enterprises, would reflect these objectives. As
regards the exchange rate, the Government proposes to maintain a flexible
policy in order to ensure the competitivity of Moroccan exports and support
the program of import liberalization.
10.      The Government has also prepared, in collaboration with the World
Bank, a program for the period 1985-June 1986 (ITPA II) of implementation of
appropriate structural reforms and adjustments. The ITPA II program covers
three main areas: (i) continued export promotion and import liberalization,
consisting of an extension of reforms already initiated in the ITPA program in
the industrial and trade sectors; (ii) the re-establishment of equilibrium in
public finance through policies and actions concerning the public investment
program and the rationalization of public enterprises (public enterprise
reform will be continued in the context of a more detailed program, for the
support of which a subsequent World Bank loan is anticipated); and (iii)
financial sector reform aiming at liberalization through the restructuring of
the administrative framework, incentives to increased competition, the graduaL
elimination of subsidies, institutional reform measures, and the development
of the money market. This program is described in greater detail in the annex
attached to this letter; the attached table summarizes the measures and their

ANNEX IV A
Page 4
expected schedule of implementation. The Government has already begun to
implement a large number of these measures.
11.      Other reform programis, which aim at achieving the stated objectives,
and for which analytical and preparatory work has been completed or initiated
in collaboration with the World Bank concern public enterprises, incentives
and resource utilization in the agricultural sector, and the sector of
education and vocational training. The Government desires World Bank
financial support for the implementation of these reforms. I would like to
emphasize that all these reform programs support the economic policy announced
by the Government, which aims at bringing about key changes in priority
sectors, so that the Moroccan economy :an grow on a sound and durable basis.
12.      The Government declares its commitment to implementing the actions
and policies described in the attached annex in order to attain the objectives
of the stabilization and reform programs concerning industrial and trade
policy, the re-establishment of the equilibrium of public finance, and the
financial sector.
13.      In view of the measures decided by the Government, we would be
grateful for a favorable response to the Government's request for a Second
Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (ITPA II). We hope the World Bank
will also support our adjustment efforts through other sectorallstructural
adjustment loans in the medium-term.
14.      We appreciate the continuous exchange of views with the World Bank
and hope to discuss at regular intervals the progress achieved in implementing
the envisaged measures.
Yours sincerely,
The Minister of Finance

The Second Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment Program (ITPA II)
1.       The economic policy measures of the ITPA II program cover three main
areas: continued export promotion and reform of protection, rationalization
of the public investment program and public enterprises, and financial sector
reform. We are convinced that these measures will permit Morocco to improve
the efficiency of resource allocation and utilization in the economy, and
realize the substantial existing potential for the development of exports, as
well as for the growth of domestic savings, public and private.
I. Export Promotion and Reform of Protection
2.       Export promotion is of special importance for generating foreign
exchange to meet the needs of the economy and to service international debt,
developing new industrial activities, and creating a significant source of
employment.
3.       Exchange Rate.  We confirm that a flexible exchange rate policy will
continue to be pursued in conformity with the agreement with the IMF, and with
the objectives of maintaining and enhancing the competitivity of Moroccan
exports and supporting the program of import liberalization.
4.       Export Certificates.  In order to simplify export procedures, export
certificates will be eliminated before end-1985 for hides and leather, and for
mining products with the exception of barytine, unrefined lead, lead minerals
and charcoal.
5.       Food Products.  The study of exports of fresh vegetables is expected
to be completed by September 1985. This study is expected to yield
recommendations aiming at increasing fresh vegetable exports; the agreed
measures will be implemented after discussions with the World Bank during the
last quarter of 1985.
6.       Customs Regimes.  In 1985, the temporary admission procedure (which
permits exporters to import inputs free of tax and duties, without prior
authorization), will be expended through modifying the negative list which was
retained under the ITPA I program. This will be effected through the
elimination from this list, before June 1985, of all products other than glass
used for packaging and agricultural and fisheries products; the latter will be
eliminated from the list immediately on their transfer from List B to List A.
In addition, the Customs Directorate will decentralize the management of the
procedure of "exportation pr6alable" (pre-exporting). As regards guarantees
for customs duties payable by exporters, the Customs Directorate will accept
global annual guarantees (bank guarantees or mutual guarantees of
industries). A procedure will also be established to permit settlement a
posteriori of customs claims, without blockage of customs clearance of

merchandise. In order to improve the access of industries to customs
legislation, the Customs Code and the tariff list will be up-dated regularly.
The average period between filing a customs declaration and the delivery of
permission to lift the goods will be reduced in 1985 by 6 days from the time
estimated at the beginning of the year of 12 days.
7.       Global Approach to Simplification of Foreign Trade Procedures.  After
implementing a number of measures under the ITPA I program to simplify
administrative procedures for foreign trade, the Government intends to
complete and amplify these measures. It has realized that the complexity of
administrative procedures and the slowness of movement of merchandise require
a global and continuing approach over the medium-term to address the problem
by successive stages of analysis and action. A Committee for Simplification
of Foreign Trade Procedures will be established by end-1985, with
respresentatives of different agencies concerned: the Customs Directorate,
the agencies responsible for foreign trade, exchange control, and transport,
the port authorities, the commercial banks, transit and maritime agents,
importers and exporters, etc. This Committee will be responsible for the
conception and follow-up of programs of analysis and folow-up of the
implementation of specific measures resulting from these analyses concerning:
Ci) the rationalization of all international trade documentation; (ii)
identification and elimination of delays due to procedures; and (iii) the
preparation and publication of an annual compendium of foreign trade and
exchange control rules. During 1985, an itinerary of export and-import
transactions will be prepared to provide a clear set of documentation on
current foreign trade procedures. This would permit preparation of the first
phase of their reform before June 1986.
8.       Exchange Allocation to Exporters.  From January 1985, an automatic
allocation of foreign exchange is granted to exporters, up to a ceiling of 3Z
of annual export value, with the possibility of cumulating the allocation, in
order to assist exporters to cover the expenses of export operations such as
business trips and other incidental expenses.
9.       Elimination of the Statistical Export Tax.  The statistical export
tax is currently levied on all exports at the rate of 0.5X of each
transaction. In order to simplify the operating framework for exporters, this
tax will be eliminated with effect from January 1986.
10.      Export Code.  Su as to permit exporters to work in a clear and
defined framework and confirm incentives for investment in export production,
while recognizing the obligation of exporters to contribute to the Government
an appropriate portion of the income from their activities, the Government is
preparing a new Export Code.
11.      Tariff Protection Policy.  As it has already stated, the Government's
objective is to encourage increased competitivity, improve the efficiency of
investment and labor productivity. This objective will be realized through a
gradual reduction of the level and dispersion of customs tariffs, so as to
ensure by end-1988 a maximum rate of protection no greater than 25Z.

ANNEX IV B
Page 3 of 11
12.      Special Import Tax.  To achieve the abo4e-mentioned objective, the
Government has reduced the Special Import Tax from 10 to 7.5% in January
1985. Subsequently, the Government will reduce the Special Import Tax from
7.5 to 5Z in January 1986 and intends to eliminate it with effect from January
1987. No customs duty will be increased with a purely fiscal objective to
compensate for the reduction of the special import tax and the elimination of
the statistical export tax.
13.      Maximum Rate of Customs Duty.  The maximum rate of customs duty will
be reduced to 45Z by January 1986.
14.      Rationalization of Tariff Structure and Customs Nomenclature.  The
Customs Directorate and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry have carried out
preparatory work of rationalization to ensure that: i) similar products are
taxed at the same rate; ii) the dispersion of customs duties is reduced; iii)
the level of protection does not exceed 25% by end-1988; iv) the system is
rendered simpler and clearer, including through the suppression of the stamp
duty and/or its integration into customs duties. The new harmonized
nomenclature will be introduced at the latest within a year after the
definitive clarifications from the Customs Cooperation Council are received.
This will be preceded by a restructuring, sector by sector, of the Moroccan
customs nomenclature, with duty rates to permit a definitive ceiling on the
rate of protection of 25%, the whole system to become operational at the
latest by January 1, 1989. A provisional structure of duty rates permitting a
rate of protection not exceeding 25Z, to be used in preparing the definitive
structure, will be prepared in 1985, 86, and 87 according to a calendar and
framework explained to the World Bank.
15.      Non-Tariff Protection.  The Government will continue to pursue the
policy of import liberalization in the future so as to open up the economy
further to increased foreign competition. Already in 1984 a large number of
products were transferred from List B (requiring import licenses) to List A
(free list). This process has been continued in 1985, and will be pursued
according to a timetable explained to the World Bank. In addition, most
products previously in List C (banned from imports) have been transferred from
this list, either to List B, as an interim stage before their transfer to List
A, or directly to List A. These import interdictions will be eliminated by
stages by 1988. The timetable of this process has also been explained to the
World Bank.
16.      As regards protection policy for new investments, the Government has
already explained in paragraph 16 of the letter of December 29, 1984 to the
Bank in the context of the ITPA I loan the principles of granting special
protection in an initial period (maximum of 3 years after completion of the
project); the Government does not propose to grant such protection in the form
of quantitative restrictions, except in exceptional, duly justified cases.

II. Public Investment Program and Public Enterprises
17.      The main objective of policies and actions in this area is the
improvement of the efficiency of resource ucilization in the public sector.
In order to harmonize budget expenditures with resource availability, the
Government accords priority to the rationalization of public investments,
increasing the return on these investments, and addressing the issue of
Government and public enterprise arrears.
Public Investment Program
18.      In the face of the continuing scarcity of financial resources, the
public investment program was substantially reduced in 1983 and 1984 on the
basis of a detailed analysis of investment priorities carried out in
cooperation with the World Bank. Within the framework of the objectives of
developing national resources and employment promotion, the criteria for
project analysis have been: (i) the economic rate of return; (ii) the stage
of physical execution of the project; (iii) the project gestation period; (iv)
the project's contribution to export promotion and efficient import
substitution; (v) the need for budgetary allocations. In function of this
analy3is and considerations of sectoral and inter-sectoral balance, public
investment projects have been classified in three categories: (i) highest
priority projects whose rapid completion would be desirable; (ii) projects
whose implementation could be slowed down; (iii) projects to be postponed or
cancelled. Following from this analysis, the Government cancelled DU 4.6
billion of credits in 1983 and DR 6 billion in 1984.
19.      The rationalization of the public investment program is continuing in
1985. The global envelope of the investment budget was about DH 26.8 billion
at the beginning of this year. After detailed analysis, the Government
intends to cancel DH 4 billion. The control of the budget implies a
practically total avoidance of inscriptions of new projects except if they
would benefit from concessional financing. The Government proposes to use a
significant portion of exceptional bilateral grant aid to reduce payment
arrears. The Government also proposes to review witb the World Bank in
October/November 1985 the investment progrz= for 1986 and subsequent years, so
as to continue rationalization of the program with the application of the
criteria mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
20.      In addition to specific actions and increased control, as regards
public investments, the Government is in the process of effecting a
fundamental reform of the budgeting and planning system.  This new planning
system will involve an annually modifiable plan, with strict prior control by
the Ministries of Finance and the Plan to ensure that only higK priority
projects in keepiug with realistic global budget resource envelopes would be
inscribed. Measures will also be taken to computerize project data, including
estimates of total annual expenliture, amounts of credits available,
commitments and payments, in order to improve follow-up of the financial
implementation of projects and control of expenditures on the investment
budget. The Government will request technical assistance from the World Bank
to design and implement the new system of budgeting and planning investments,

Page 5 of 11
according to a timetable discussed with the World Bank.  The preparation of a
program has already been initiated, and the functional design of the new
system will be prepared during ;ne second half of 1985. The implementation of
the new system is expected before June 30, 1986.
Public Enterprises
21.      The growing importance of public enterprises in the last decade has
led the Government to consider carefully the financial and structural problems
of this sector. After a major, in-depth study in 1979-80 which served as the
basis for a series of actions and programs in this area, in 1984 the
Government analyzed in detail the payables and receivables of the Government
vis-a-vis public enterprises, in order to ascertain the magnitude of arrears.
A program of measures has been prepared sector by sector, to resolve the
structural causes of these arrears. The matrix of arrears as of December 31,
1983 has been completed for some 60 enterprises. Detailed analyses and
sectoral action plans have also been developed for most sectors: energy,
transport, water-supply, trade, mines, sugar, and agriculture. A study of
local collectivities is in progress. An action plan his been designed and is
being implemented to improve the situation of the enterprises and halt growth
of arrears. Several decisions and specifications have been taken in the
context of the sectoral rehabilitation programs. An Interministerial
Committee chaired by the Prime Minister has been created to define a strategy
for the public enterprise sector. A Vigilance Committee has also been created
to propose reform measures, settle disputes, etc. and follow-up on their
implementation.
22.      The matrix of debts and receivables covering 80 enterprises shows a
net deficit of the State to public enterprises of about DH 3.8 billion as of
December 31, 1984. The Government expects to allocate in 1985 and 1986 a
substantial sum to reduce arrears in the shortest possible period. While
respecting the perZormance criteria of the IMF, the Government expects to
reduce its net arrears to public enterprises by DH 1 billion by the end of
1985, and by DE 0.5 billion by June 30, 1986 (the arrears defined according to
the methodology already estab:ished). The Government will furnish to the Bank
in 1985 a detailed breakdown and timetable of settlement of the arrears. The
Vigilance Committee will continue to be responsible for the implementation of
the measures adopted (including revision of prices). The Government will
avoide any fresh increase of these arrears in the future.
23.      The Government also confirms its objective of reducing the overall
amount of transfers to public enterprises. The amount of credits to public
enterprises in the Finance Law has been limited (excluding operating
subsidies) to DH 3.3 billion for investment subsidies and payments for
services of public enterprises to the Government. The actual overall payments
in these categories will be about DH 2.1 billion in 1985. In 1986, the
Government expects to intensify the efforts undertaken in 1984 and 1985 to
improve the performance of public enterprises so as to reduce their financial
dependence on the Government, and to discuss with the Bank the measures to
take in this connection.

24.      The Government renews its request to the World Bank for assistance in
introducing basic structural reforms in the sector of public enterprises, so
as to improve the efficiency of these enterprises and achieve financial and
structural rationalization of their relations with the State, collectivities,
and the private sector. With this objective, the Government will prepare, in
cooperation with the World Bank, a program to carry out: (i) structural
reform of price, subsidy, and financing policies of the enterprises; (ii)
administrative reforms permitting a better control of the efficiency of
enterprise operations and greater enterpise autonomy; and (iii) financial or
physical restructuring of a few key enterprises playing a vital role in the
economy, which can serve as test-cases for the implementation of policy and
administrative reforms in the sector. The Government has named a liaison and
coordination group for these activities. The Government is endeavouring to
progressively increase the proportion of self-financing by public enterprises
of their investments.
25.      Given the great importance throughout the economy of energy and power
tariffs, the Goverument and the Bank have agreed to initiate a study in this
area which will assist the preparation of a proposed Bank public enderprise
sector loan.
III. Financial Sector Reform
26.      The Government has prepared, in collaboration with the World Bank, a
major reform of the financial sector, in order to promote domestic savings and
improve the efficiency of resource allocation. This reform includes a series
of measures aiming at simplifying and easing the regulatory framework,
increased reliance on market mechanisms, encouragement of increased
competition in the sector, progressive elimination of subsidies, reduction of
fragmentation of the financial market and resulting distortions, strengthening
the institutional system, and developing the money market. An important
aspect of this reform, which supports the Government's overall adjustment
policy, is increased recourse by the Treasury to the financial market. The
most important measures of thius reform are summarized in the following
paragraphs.
27.      Interest Rate Policy.  The Government is committed to greater
flexibility of interest rates than in the past. With the exception of certain
preferential rates, notably for export credits and cereal production, the
Government recognizes the objective of maintaining interest rates at levels
which are positive in real terms. Certain interest rates (notably, on
deposits of maturity greater than 12 months) will be freed with effect from
April 1, 1985. The other rates have been transformed into minima (in the case
of deposit rates) and maxima (in the case of lending rates), and the system
has been simplified through a reduction in the number of rates set by the
authorities. The changes in interest rates effective April 1, 1985 are
detailed in the table below.

a/ From April 1, 1985.
28.      The Government has created a Permanent Committee for Interest Rates,
consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Morocco,
and the Professional Association of Moroccan banks, to follow up the evolution
of rates and to ensure that, overall, the rates in force reflect the
conclusions of an analysis of rele-mnt factors, in particular, the current
inflation rate, the liquidity situation, movements in exchange rates and the
balance of payments, international inflation, etc. Each semester this
Commission will prepare a report presenting its conclusions regarding this
objective, and recommending, to the Minister of Finance, if need be,
modification of the rates.
29.      It is to be noted that the interest rates indicated in the table
above, are considered net of taxes. In view of the proposed fiscal reform,
and the introduction of a value added tax (see para. 38 below), lending rates
will be increased by the amount of the value dded tax deductible by borrowers.
30.      In parallel with the freeing of deposit rates, we have examined the
freeing of Lending rates, which also constitutes an objective of the
Government's policy. The need for regulating credit through ceilings in 1985
will not permit us to free before the end of the year lending rates beyond the
ceilings mentioned above. We would like to emphasize our intention to
gradually liberalize lending rates at the same time as credit regulation is
eased. Measures for deregulating credit allocation and liberalizing lending
rates will be reviewed with the World Bank and the IMF before end-1985.

31.      Gradual Elimination of Interest Rate Rebates.  The Government intends
.to eliminate over the medium ^'rm interest rate rebates on medium- and
long-term credits in differea .ectors. As these rebates are granted under
investment codes, their elimination will require passage of a law. The
Government will study, in cnllooration with the World Bank by end-1985 the
measures to reach this objective, with a view to preparing in 1986, a program
to apply the nominal rates to Lhese different sectors benefiting from rebates.
32.      Foreign Exchange Pisk Coverage.  Medium- and long-term loans of
specialized financial institutions (BNDE, CNCA and CIE) are critical to ensure
access to term resources for priority investments. A large part of th'se
resources is mobilized abroad in foreign exchange, and the Government has
assumed responsibility for covering the foreign exchange risks of these three
institutions. The burden of this coverage weighs more and more heavily on the
Treasury, and the Government has therefore decided to transfer a larger
portion of the costs to ultimate borrrowers and the specialized institutions
in order to lighten the burden on the Treasury. It would, however, be
premature to transfer the entire risk to the ultimate borrowers. In function
of these conclusions, the Government has decided to strengthen from June 1,
1985, the system of coverage of foreign exchange risks for foreign currency
loans contracted by the specialized financial institutions, as follows.
'i)    The specialized institutions will pay into a Foreign Exchange
Risk Fund for credit of the Treasury at each of the
institutions concerned, the difference between their lending
rate, and the interest rate on new foreign borrowings, less a
margin sufficient to assure them an adequate profitability;
(ii)   The Foreign Exchange Risk Fund will receive funds from a
commission of 1% on disbursements of new medium- and long-term
credits of the specialized financial institutions, with the
exception of loans for low-cost housing (EBM) and credits to
small farmers (CLCA).
(iii)  The specialized financial irstitutions will assume 2% (insterd
of 1.5Z, till now) of all exchange losses on their foreign
resources acquired after June 1, 1985. (In the case of
exchange gains, the institutions will be credited with 2Z).
These measures will be reviewed every six months, and may be modified by the
Ministry of Finance. The Government will periodically consult with the World
Bank to study the results of these measures, and propose, if need be, their
improvement - the long-term objective being to reduce gradually, with a view
to its eventual elimination, the charge to the Government of exchange-risk
coverage.

Page 9 of 11
33.      The propositions mentioned above only deal with the foreign exchange
risk on lending operations of the specialized financial institutions. The
distortions which would arise from the implicit exchange risk on local
currency loans of commercial banks to importers of equipment and investment
goods have not been considered in the Government's program, for lack of a
complete analysis of the situation. However, the possible impact of this
distortion on public finances remains to be examined. The Government has
therefore decided to initiate a study, by the end of 1985, with Bank support,
on the importance of the implicit exchange risk for public finances, in order
to specify the measures and the possible recommendations to transfer all or a
part of the risk to importers benefiting from such loans.
34.      Oblixatory Placement Rcl:uirements and Reserve Requirements for
Commercial Banks. In order to iacrease the margins of commercial banks on
term-deposits, and hence encourage them to mobilize term-deposits with greater
dynamism, the ratio for obligatory placements by the banks in Treasury bonds
has been modified. The deposit base on which the rate of obligatory placement
is applied was reduced in 1984 throu3h the elimination, from the calculation
of this base, of deposits with a term greaterlthan 12 months. From April 1,
1985, all term deposits and certificates of deposit have been eliminated from
the base of calculation of the obligatory placement requirement; the
obligatory placement rate on sight deposits has been increased from 30 to
35%. In addition term deposits have also been excluded for purposes of
calculation of the reserve requirements of commercial banks.
35.      Allocation of Credit Ceilings to Commercial Banks.  With the
objective of encouraging commercial banks to mobilize savings, the system of
determining credit ceilings will be modified effective June 1, 1985, to take
account of the effort by the banks to mobilize savings.
36.      Bank Commissions.  The monetary authorities have set themselves the
objective of simplifying, clarifying and up-dating bank commissions which have
been in effect since 1975. A detailed study of commissions will be carried
out, in collaboration with concerned institutions, by September 30, 1985, and
communicated to the Bank for analysis and comments; this study would have as
an objective the selection of commissions which would be expressed as maxima;
it will take into account, as much as possible, the cost of operations. The
reform of bank commissions will be effected, at the latest, by January, 1986.
37.      Specific Measures to Encourage Competition Between Specialized
Financial Institutions and the Commercial Banks. In order to strengthen
competition between the banks and the specialized financial institutions, it
would seem appropriate to permit the latter to receive deposits from the
public. The Government's General Secretary has been requested to provide a
legal opinion on whether it would be necessary to amend the laws to achieve
this objective. This opinion will be furnished by end-September 1985. If CIH
and BNDE can be authorized to receive deposits through administrative
measures, the Government will take steps to effect this authorization, at



-69 -                            ANNEX IV B
Page 10 of 11
the latest by January 1986.  In any case, the monetary authorities will take
all appropriate steps to permit the specialized financial institutions to
receive funds from the public through the iss'le of certificates of deposit.
In case the law governing specialized financial institutions needs to be
modified, the Bank will be informed before end-1985 of the next steps which
could be expected. Besides, in order to grant the banks a greater degree of
responsibility and a more important role in medium-term lending, the monetary
authorities have already granted BMCE the right to affix the third signature
on credits. The monetary authorities are also studying the possibility of
permitting other banks to provide the third signature necessary for
rediscounting medium-term loans at the Bank of Morocco. This study will be
reviewed with the World Bank with a view to its implementation effective
January, 1986.
38.      Reform of Taxation Affecting the Financial Sector.  There has already
been a clarification of the conditions under which provisions for risk can be
established by commercial banks, and a reduction of the registration fee on
capital increases of companies whose shares are traded on the stock exchange.
The fiscal reform, whose presentation to Phrliament is expected by mid-1985,
includes important measures concerning the financial sector: (i) the tax on
banking services will be replaced by a value added tax, with, as a result, the
possibility for a commercial enterprise to deduct this tax from its expenses;
(ii) enterprises will have the possibility of re-valuing their assets, which
could lighten their tax burden and increase their self-financing.
39.      Development of the Money Market.  Since 1983, a growing proportion of
the Treasury's financing needs have been met through borrowing on the money
market at market rates. Also, the proportion of refinancing by the Banque du
Maroc at flexible interest rates has continued to increase. In the future,
these trends will be strengthened, in order to develop the money market and
increase the participation of the Treasury in this market. In addition, the
Treasury is seeking to mobilize supplementing resources on the financial
market through the issue of bonds to the general public. In this regard, an
issue in March 1985 for a sum of DH 100 million resulted in subscriptions of
over DH 400 million, and the Treasury intends to repeat this experiment in
1985.
40.      Reform of the Caisse Centrale de Garantie (CCG).  To strengthen the
credit guarantee system, there is need to redefine the role of CCG, and for a
fundamental raform of its financial and organizational structure, including
the procedures and principles of risk coverage by this organization. The
Government is committed to study these issues by end-1985. A consultant will
be appointed by the Government to carry out this study by September 1, 1985,
and the study will be completed and its recommendations implemented during
1986, after discussions with the World Bank.

Monitoring and Progress Reporting
41.      Progress in implementing the program described above will be
monitored by the interministerial committee, established in the context of the
ITPA I program, which will meet regularly to review progress and decide on
appropriate actions to ensure timely implementation of the program. Two
progress reports, summarizing the status of implementation of the program will
be prepared and furnished to the World Bank, the first in early January 1986
and the second in early June 1986.
