MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Impact Evaluation Report on Sri Lanka:
Kurunegala Rural Development Project (Credit 891-CE)
Second Rural Development Project (Credit 1079-CE)
Attached is an impact evaluation report (IER) on two rural development projects in Sri Lanka.
The IDA credits were approved in FY79 and FY81, and closed in FY86 and FY90. The evaluation was
based on a review of Bank files, including project completion and audit reports, field visits to a large
number of project sites, and interviews with beneficiaries and Government and Bank staff. The
evaluation team, led by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), used a variety of participatory
techniques to obtain the views of the principal stakeholders, direct beneficiaries (principally farmers),
line agencies, project managers, and the government.
In the late 1970s, Sri Lanka launched the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) to
support development in districts which had not benefited from major government investments. The
Kurunegala Rural Development Project (KRDP) was the first of these, and attempted to produce a
replicable regional development model, based on multisectoral planning for an entire district, and
centered on agriculture. It was followed by the Second Rural Development Project (SRDP) in Matale
and Puttalam districts. The three districts were among Sri Lanka's poorest, and about 90 percent of their
population lived in rural areas. The projects, supported by IDA credits of US$34 and US$40 million
respectively, financed a range of investments designed to increase farm production and rural incomes.
The projects' objectives were ambitious and their operations extensive and complex. They
centered on agricultural development and included (i) rehabilitating or improving about 800 small
irrigation tanks and 30 larger irrigation schemes; (ii) stepping up subsidized programs for replanting,
intercropping and fertilizing small coconut plantings, and supporting expansion of export crops by
smallholders; and (iii) expanding agricultural facilities and services, including credit, to encourage more
intensive use of agricultural inputs. Complementing these agricultural programs, which accounted for
about two-thirds of costs, were investments in rural infrastructure for health, education, transport, water
supply and electricity.
The evaluation estimated the ERRs for the agricultural components at just under 10 percent,
compared to appraisal estimates ranging from 24 and 34 percent. These shortfalls derived from a range
of causes. Particularly in the KRDP, the extent to which the area planted to paddy could be increased by
rehabilitation of village tanks was greatly overestimated. Design and construction flaws on these small
schemes also reduced benefits. However, yield increases in the schemes assisted were still above
average for the districts and the country. Increases in production of coconuts and export crops also fell
short of targets because of rising labor and fertilizer costs and over-ambitious expectations. The credit
program had mixed results. Short-term loans for inputs were not popular, but there was a high demand
for medium-term loans, particularly for small tractors. However, the objective of creating a credit



2
system to reach a significant share of poor households were not achieved. Almost all the infrastructure
targets were met, and many were exceeded.
The beneficiaries were dissatisfied with some aspects of the agricultural components, yet the
overall goals of raising incomes and improving the living standards of the rural population were partially
met. The beneficiaries clearly saw benefits from the infrastructural components, noting the fact that the
wells improved water quality and improved health, especially among children, and that electrification
opened up opportunities for small business. They felt that the roads were the most useful addition to
their daily lives, especially where roads replaced footpaths. The roads allowed trucks and buses to reach
villages, greatly expanding access to markets and employment opportunities and health and educational
facilities. However, many farmers felt that the projects missed an opportunity by not involving them
more in the design, implementation, and oversight of the rehabilitation works. Discussions with
beneficiaries before and during work were cursory, and conflicts between farmers and contractors were
common. As a result village irrigation facilities are frequently poorly maintained; farmers are reluctant
to maintain facilities which they consideT unsatisfactory, and which they believe the government has a
duty to correct before they assume full responsibility.
One particular strength of the IRDP in Sri Lanka has been the strong effort made from the outset
to learn from the initial experience and modify approaches. The KRDP and SRDP were innovative in
that they relied on existing line agencies and departments to carry out operations, and were in line with
the government's objectives of decentralizing planning and implementation. However, the top down
nature of the initial planning limited the benefits from this. Since the responsible agencies had been
excluded from the original planning process, and project funds remained in the hands of the central
ministries, horizontal coordination was weak.
Three main lessons have been taken from these early projects. First, that flexibility of design is
more effective than a "blueprint" approach for rural development schemes carried out in areas with
varying conditions. Second, that participation by beneficiaries in all phases of a project-including
evaluation-is important for long-term sustainability. Finally, that if the poor are to benefit from such
projects, specific efforts need to be made to target them. Today, the "blueprint" approach has been
replaced by a more flexible, process oriented approach, in which government facilitates the provision of
services, rather than seeking to provide all services on its own, and in which projects follow a one- to
two-year rolling plan, and use monitoring as a planning and management tool.

Preface
The Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) was initiated in the late 1970s
and has been a long-term effort to support the development of rural areas in Sri Lanka. A series
of projects have been undertaken, operating at a district level and financed by different aid
agencies. These have been specifically aimed at assisting the poor and other disadvantaged
groups, and have pioneered a number of participative techniques in project planning and
implementation. A total of 17 districts have been covered by these projects, with activities
precluded in the remaining districts by the ongoing insurrection. The Kurunegala Rural
Development Project supported by the International Development Association (IDA), was
appraised in 1978 and was the first of these projects. Others followed quickly thereafter,
including the Second Rural Development Project also supported by IDA and covering the
districts of Matale and Puttalam, which was appraised in 1979.
This Impact Evaluation Report covers both the Kurunegala and Second Rural
Development Projects. Given the very broad coverage of the projects, it was decided not to try
and review all their aspects, but to concentrate on the components aimed at increasing
agricultural production, which accounted for about two-thirds of the expenditure. Other aspects,
primarily infrastructure, and the overall institutional impact of the projects, were also covered,
but in less detail. Field work was carried out in 1995, primarily by a team led by the Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO). A particular emphasis was placed obtaining input from the
beneficiaries using a variety of participative techniques. The team produced an extensive draft
report based, in addition, on the project completion reports and performance audit reports, the
appraisal reports, loan documents, and on discussions with officials in the relevant ministries and
in the implementing agencies at the district level. The main conclusions of the report were
discussed at a workshop held in Sri Lanka in March, 1996, and organized by the Regional
Development Division of the Ministry of Finance and Development, the coordinating ministry
for the IRDP. This report is based on the report of the FAO team and incorporates the major
issues raised at the workshop.
The kind cooperation and valuable assistance provided by all those who participated in
the group discussions and workshops in Sri Lanka is gratefully acknowledged. Particular thanks
are due to Mr. C. Maliyadde, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Development, and
Mr. S. Amarasekara, Director General of Regional Development, without whose support the
study would not have been possible.

Executive Summary
The Projects
1.    In the late 1970s, the government of Sri Lanka launched the Integrated Rural
Development Programme (IRDP) with several ambitious objectives: to decentralize planning and
implementation, increase rural incomes in districts with a large proportion of low-income rural
residents, and create needed infrastructure to reduce disparities within districts. The initiative
concentrated its projects in districts-some of them the country's poorest-that had not
benefited from major government investments. This report analyzes the impact of two of these
projects: the Kurunegala Rural Development Project (KRDP) and the Second Rural
Development Project (SRDP). The KRDP and SRDP emphasized directly productive
investments; reductions in intraregional disparities; financial, institutional, and technical
replicability; and labor-intensive rehabilitation works (rather than new construction) that would
provide immediate returns.
2.     The KRDP (total cost US$34 million) was approved in 1979 and was the first attempt at
multisectoral planning for an entire district, although the end result was seen as a compromise
between comprehensiveness and manageability. The project was designed to produce a
replicable regional development model for raising productivity, employment, incomes, and
living standards for the rural population. Because of the importance of agriculture in the
Kurunegala District, the KRDP focused on the agricultural sector, particularly on measures that
would rehabilitate the production base for paddy and coconut production and improve support
services. Funding for institutional and infrastructure development was provided through
subcomponents designed to:
* modernize irrigation and water management;
* rehabilitate and replant coconut holdings:
* improve agricultural extension services;
* increase supplies of agricultural inputs;
* expand credit operation and resources;
* improve rural roads and water and electricity supplies;
* upgrade educational and health facilities in rural areas; and
* establish project coordination and monitoring capabilities.
3.     The SRDP, with a total cost US$40 million, was approved in 1981. It concentrated on
the districts of Matale and Puttalam, situated to the east and west of Kurunegala, respectively.
The objectives of the SRDP closely followed those of the KRDP but included three additional
components that focused on forestry, fisheries (in Puttalam), and export agriculture crops (EACs,
in Matale). The SRDP did not seek to strengthen extension services, however.
4.     Both projects were to be implemented over five years but had to be extended, the KRDP
for two years and the SRDP for four. The KRDP experienced staff shortages in the major
implementing agencies and problems with procurement and funding that delayed the project in

devaluation of the rupee during the life of the project had greatly increased the amount of available local funds.

its initial stages. The SRDP also experienced staff shortages in implementing agencies, problems
with procurement, and severe budgetary constraints that resulted in shortages of counterpart
funds. In addition, the security situation in Sri Lanka worsened in the project's later years,
halting some of the work. The Kurunegala project was the subject of an performance audit report
(PAR) in 1991. The SRDP has not been audited, but both projects received satisfactory ratings in
Project Completion Reports (PCRs), published in 1989 and 1991, respectively. The impact
evaluation corroborates but qualifies the PCR ratings.
The Impact Evaluation
5.     Given the multiplicity of components under each project, it was feasible only to select
the most important, measured in terms of cost, for detailed examination. The evaluation assesses
the outcome, impact, and sustainability of the major productive components, which accounted
for about 80 percent of expenditure in the KRDP and 60 percent in the SRDP; irrigation
rehabilitation and associated agricultural production; coconut and export agriculture crop (EAC)
rehabilitation and improvement; and credit. Although rural roads, water supply, electrification,
and project coordination and management are also reviewed, the field surveys for these
components were less intensive than for the others.
6.     The goal of the evaluation team was not only to measure statistical outcomes but also to
assess the developments the projects achieved at the microeconomic level-that is, to determine
the changes brought about by the projects in "real-life" situations and to learn from both the
successes and failures. In keeping with this goal, the evaluation team did more than just gather
statistical data. It also sought the views of principal stakeholders, direct beneficiaries, line
agencies, project managers, and the government itself. The methods used to gather this
information, which ranged from full-scale participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) to more
conventional surveys, are outlined in annex 1.
7.     The target districts have been undergoing rapid economic change in the 15 years since
the projects were initiated. National economic policy has emphasized the growth of export-
oriented manufacturing activities, and nonfarm employment has expanded in all three districts,
parts of which lie near the industrial "estates" that have been developed close to the Colombo
airport. Economic opportunities for the rural populations in the target districts have thus been
expanding for reasons that lie outside the realm of the projects. To the extent possible, these
considerations have also been taken into account.
What the Projects Achieved
8.    The projects' operations were extensive and complex, and the project objectives
ambitious, sometimes overly so. Despite the poor showing of some of the productive
components, beneficiaries clearly recognized the value of assets such as extension services, new
tractors, and infrastructure (especially roads), faulting the projects most for their failure to
include farmers in project planning and design. The two projects also provided solid lessons for
later initiatives.
9.    Production. Neither project met its productivity targets. In the case of paddy, the gains in
yields and cropped areas were below appraisal targets for several reasons. First, the appraisal
targets were overambitious, based as they were on inaccurate information, especially in the



15
KRDP. Second, the quality of the rehabilitation work was not good enough, as beneficiaries
pointed out. As a result, the quality of operation and maintenance (O&M), especially in minor
irrigation schemes, was poor, not only because of the inferior construction but because farmers
were unwilling to maintain what they perceived as low-quality systems. Third, the appraisal
disregarded countrywide trends in yields and assumed instead that all increases in paddy
production could be attributed to the projects themselves. Despite these drawbacks, the
evaluation concludes that there were increases in yields in the schemes improved under the
projects over and above the change in average national yields.
10.    Incremental production of EACs and coconuts also fell short of appraisal expectations
for two reasons: the rising costs of inputs (especially hired labor and fertilizer) relative to
product prices, which reduced farmers' interest in the crops; and overambitious production
expectations, based on faulty assumptions. Although the returns to EACs fall far short of
appraisal targets, the component achieved excellent results at the farm level.
11.    Credit. The two main elements of the credit programs had different outcomes. The
success of medium-term credit, particularly for the purchase of two-wheel tractors, greatly
exceeded expectations. The number of short-term loans for cultivation was below expectations,
largely because most farmers preferred to borTow from informal sources, which were more
readily accessible and did not have cumbersome procedures. The project objective of developing
a financially viable credit system that would reach a significant proportion of farmers,
particularly those with the smaller holdings was not achieved. While the number of farmers
obtaining credit from formal institutions increased, it never exceeded 3 percent of the rural
population (presumably the most affluent rural residents).
12.    Infrastructure. Almost all of the physical targets for the construction of physical and
social infrastructure were met and in many cases exceeded (table 2) partly because the
implementation periods were extended and additional local currency became available. The
largest single element of these components was roads. Some 174 miles of new roads were
constructed under the KRDP, greatly improving access to villages, irrigation facilities, and
schools. The SRDP concentrated on rehabilitating or upgrading around 400 miles of existing
roads. Other infrastructure projects varied widely and included village electrification schemes,
wells and tubewells to supply domestic water, equipment and residential quarters for schools and
vocational training centers, and equipment for hospitals and other health facilities. Beneficiaries
liked these assets, citing the increased employment opportunities the roads made possible and the
improved training facilities as being especially valuable.
The Economic Impact
13.    The evaluation of the projects' economic impact attempted to address three questions:
whether the project interventions were economically viable; how the changing system of
incentives affected farmers' productivity; and whether the investments were sound in light of the
economic events of the last 15 years. In answering the first question, the analysis attempts to
determine what would have happened in the target districts without the projects. Separate
2. For example, the appraisals assumed that the productivity of all coconut plantings in the districts would increase as a
result of the projects, although the projects directly affected only one-third of the coconut area; that beneficiaries who
did not receive all installments of the investment package would achieve the same productivity levels as those who did;
and that improved management practices would be continued when the projects ended.



16
economic rates of return (ERRs) are calculated for the productive components and the projects
overall. The ERRs show that paddy performed better than coconuts and EACs, although both
rates of return (and that of the project in general) hovered just below 10 percent and far below
the anticipated levels (32 percent for the KRDP overall and 17 percent for the SRDP).
14.    To respond to the second question, the assessment considered the effect of domestic and
exogenous factors influencing Sri Lanka's economy during the life of the projects: inflation,
shifts in the terms of trade, and falling international prices. To calculate changes in the structure
of production costs and the share of each cost item in the value of production, the analysis
applied ratios derived from current prices to data on yields and inputs, using a three-year
arithmetic average. The results show that changes in relative prices negatively affected producers
of paddy and coconut, and that commercial producers felt the impact much more than
smallholders. Small producers felt the impact throi gh a decline in the real value of their returns,
as paddy prices failed to keep up with inflation. Producers of cocoa, coffee, and peppers fared
somewhat better, as real income per acre increased for these crops.
15.    To determine the economic viability of public support for the production of paddy, the
analysis uses the domestic resource cost (DRC) coefficient, or the cost of the domestic resources
required to save one unit of foreign exchange earnings. Taking into account the cost of the
irrigation rehabilitation works, the estimated DRC coefficient for rice production in Kurunegala
in 1994 was about 1.0 for subsistence purposes and about 1.3 for urban use. That is, a net gain of
one rupee's worth of foreign exchange (at the current exchange rate) required between 1.0 and
1.3 rupee's worth of domestic resources.
The Socioeconomic Impact
16.    The evaluation assesses project effects at both the district and household levels. While it
is clear that important equity issues affected the distribution of benefits and that beneficiaries
clearly were dissatisfied with some aspects of the productive components, the overall goals of
reducing disparities within districts, raising the incomes of rural households, and improving the
living standards of rural populations were partially met. The evaluation examined the
distribution of benefits, the projects' effects on regional disparities within districts, and the
impact of specific components on households. The analysis uses two methods of assessing the
projects' impact on households: farm models representing the situations of typical holdings with
and without project interventions, and estimates from beneficiaries of changes in sources of their
incomes after the projects.
17.    Productive components. Beneficiaries recognized that the rehabilitated irrigation
schemes had made more water available and increased the number and size of irrigated areas,
allowing farmers to increase yields and grow a second crop in the Yala (spring monsoon) season.
But many expressed dissatisfaction with the rehabilitation work, citing most frequently the fact
that farmers had not been consulted about the schemes during project implementation, so that
many practical concerns were never addressed and users did not feel a sense of ownership of the
assets. Farmers did feel positive about the projects' efforts to improve farming practices and
introduce new crops, adopting many of the suggested improvements.
18.    To estimate changes in yields, the evaluation team used data on holding size, cropped
areas, technologies used, and yields to construct a series of farm models representing the pre-
and postproject situations for typical holdings. These models were in turn used to estimate



17
incomes from cultivation with and without project interventions. For the paddy farmers in
Kurunegala, for example, income from cropping was estimated at about SL Rs 17,000 (based on
1994 prices) for project participants, or about SL Rs 1,100 more than it would have been without
the project. However, the estimates of without-project yields reflect the fact that most small
irrigation schemes were rehabilitated with public support, so that the estimated increments
represent the minimum benefits directly attributable to the project.
19.    For the coconut and EAC programs, the on-farm effects were more dramatic. For the
typical participant in the coconut rehabilitation program, net income from 4 acres of coconuts
was estimated at about SL Rs 30,000, or about SL Rs 8,500 more than for nonparticipants.
Because most EACs are perennial crops, they provide a substantial return once they reach
maturity. The overall effect of the introduction of EACs was most pronounced in Matale, where
wage labor as a share of household income dropped from 28 to 6 percent after the project and the
share of EACs in total income rose to 22 percent.
20.    A sample of beneficiaries queried about income composition said that despite the
increases in yields and production in the project areas over the past two decades, the share of
paddy in their overall income has fallen (largely due to price fluctuations) and the share of off-
farm income increased. Combining this evidence with data from the farm models suggests that in
the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts (where growth in off-farm employment has been marked),
increased crop production attributable to the project has been responsible for between 20 and 30
percent of the increase in incomes in beneficiary households. In Matale, where crops other than
paddy have expanded rapidly, the corresponding figure may be greater than 50 percent.
21.    Quality of life. According to the beneficiaries, the infrastructure built and upgraded by
the projects has had a positive impact on the quality of rural life in all three districts.
Beneficiaries said the roads were as the most useful addition to their daily lives, especially in
areas where new roads replaced footpaths. The roads allowed buses and trucks to reach villages
and permitted villagers to travel to other areas, expanding opportunities for employment and
greatly improving access to markets and health and educational facilities. The small
electrification schemes, which fostered the expansion or development of small and medium-
sized village enterprises, created an estimated 2,000 jobs in the three districts.
22.    Beneficiaries also cited the wells as a distinct improvement over previous sources of
water. Many said that the time needed to fetch water had been significantly reduced and that the
quality of the water had improved. The cleaner water had helped to improve health, especially
among children. However, because of design flaws, the original pumps rusted and have again
been rehabilitated only with the help of other donors and nongovemmental organization (NGOs).
Beneficiaries again cited the original projects' failure to include users (in this case, water user
groups) in the planning and implementation phases as the primary reason for the problems with
the wells.
23.    The distribution of benefits. While the original projects did not have specific poverty
alleviation goals (a shortcoming rectified in subsequent projects), it was expected that the
majority of the beneficiaries would be smallholders with 2 acres or less and household incomes
below the poverty level (as it was then defined). However, the impact evaluation finds that the
majority of the beneficiaries had holdings bigger than 2 acres, particularly the coconut growers,
so that the projects did not have the anticipated direct impact on the smallest farms and poorest
rural residents.



18
Sustainability
24.   The sustainability of the assets created under the projects is uncertain. The irrigation
structures have deteriorated considerably for a variety of reasons, including inadequate O&M,
insufficient hydrological data, shortfalls in preliminary studies, a shortage of experienced
contractors, poor quality control during implementation, and a lack of beneficiary involvement.
The technical evaluation determined that the major schemes, which were supervised more
closely during rehabilitation, have been maintained more regularly, and have undergone
extensive postproject rehabilitation, are in better physical condition than the minor schemes. All
11 KRDP schemes and 12 of the 15 SRDP schemes have been rehabilitated again or improved by
projects involving other donor agencies, while only 10-33 percent of the minor schemes have
received such attention.
25.    Operation and Maintenance. Qualitative indicators were used to gauge O&M. Mission
members and farmers jointly assessed maintenance, using patterns of water distribution and a
water plan as proxies for good water management. Responsibility for O&M now lies largely with
user groups. While most beneficiaries interviewed recognized that the rehabilitated schemes had
increased the availability of water and the size of arable areas, thus raising crop yields and
allowing farmers to grow a second annual crop, standards of maintenance were noticeably poor,
particularly in minor schemes. Because farmers were not involved in the original projects, they
lack a sense of ownership of the assets and have been reluctant to care for the rehabilitated
works. They also expressed discontent with the rehabilitation work itself, which most felt could
have been improved had the farmers been invited to participate. In the focus groups, farmers
agreed with the results of the technical evaluation and rated as poor the quality of fully one-half
to two-thirds of the completed work. The majority of farmers also felt that the government
should make further repairs before turning the schemes over to users.
26.    Water management in major schemes was again found to be better than in minor
schemes because all the major schemes visited had been involved in subsequent government
projects aimed at improving O&M. In general, the poor O&M in minor schemes was the result
of institutional difficulties (specifically conflicts between the ID and the DAS) and limitations in
project design and implementation (primarily the lack of user involvement in the original
projects). DI staff members cited severe budgetary constraints as one of the primary reasons for
poor overall O&M: the amounts originally allocated for maintenance were not sufficient to keep
the schemes in good repair.
27.    Water user groups. Today, the most important factor in maintaining the projects and
ensuring their sustainability, is the involvement of user groups. The original projects did not
encourage the involvement of such groups, a lesson leamed by subsequent IRDP initiatives.
Once it recognized the problem, the govemment initially attempted to promote user groups, but
farmers saw these groups as imposed from the outside and did not actively participate. Although
later NGO- and donor-supported projects have also encouraged the formation of farmer
organizations, the most successful groups have been initiated and are run by the users
themselves.
Institutional Impact
28.   The KRDP and SRDP were innovative in relying on existing line agencies and
departments (some 20 in the KRDP and 25 in the SRDP) to implement project activities and



19
operated in line with the government's objectives of decentralizing planning and budgetary
matters.
29.   Focus groups made up of project staff and workers from implementing agencies assessed
the projects' strengths and weaknesses. Participants in these groups cited efforts to improve the
implementation capacity of line agencies as the projects' greatest strength, placing the results of
this component far above those of the productive and more technical elements. Yet many of the
same issues that arose during the assessments of the productive components also surfaced during
the evaluation of the project's effects on local institutions. Project funds remained in the hand of
the responsible ministry, inhibiting decentralized decisionmaking; the projects lacked strong
management systems; and the ambitious quantitative targets far over-reached the line agencies'
implementation capacity. Moreover, planning and coordination of agencies was weak, largely
because the responsible agencies had been excluded from the original planning process.
30.   In terms of replicability, the KRDP and SRDP failed to provide a useful model, for two
reasons. First, the projects made no transitional arrangements for continued funding of the assets
the projects created. Second, neither the KRDP nor the SRDP included beneficiaries in project
planning and design, so that beneficiaries had not developed a sense of ownership of the projects
and therefore were not inclined to maintain them. These shortcomings became important lessons
for later projects. On the other hand, some "blueprint" elements were almost inevitable, given
that the KRDP was the first multilaterally funded integrated rural development project IRDP in
Sri Lanka, and the SRDP followed soon after. Thus, there was no precedent to follow. The result,
however, was a top-down approach to design and implementation and a focus on targets.
31.   Today, the IRDP is viewed as highly successful. Since the KRDP and SRDP were
introduced, 16 further projects have been initiated, and 4 more are planned. The process of
decentralization has continued, and the projects actively involve the private sector and Non
Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Two key aspects of the KRDP and SRDP that have been
applied in later projects are the multisectoral, integrated approach to district-level planning and
the utilization of existing institutions. Some aspects of the two early projects that created the
most serious implementation problems-in particular the blueprint approach, the failure to
involve beneficiaries, and the absence of a focus on poverty alleviation-have been corrected in
subsequent initiatives. Current projects are poverty oriented, encourage beneficiary participation,
use process rather than blueprint planning methods, and see monitoring as a management tool. In
short, the lessons learned from the KRDP and SRDP have played a significant role in the design
of subsequent projects.
Overall Assessment
32.   The findings outlined above indicate that from both a quantitative and a qualitative
viewpoint, the projects' performance has been mixed. From a purely economic point of view, the
ERRs for the productive components are generally below the traditional cutoff point (10 percent)
for a satisfactory rating. In addition, the quality of the initial rehabilitation works was poor and
the subsequent O&M insufficient, as project beneficiaries frequently pointed out. The evaluation
emphasizes the primary problems behind the poor performance of the KRDP and SRDP:
overoptimistic Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) targets (often based on faulty assumptions and
information), over-attribution of production increases to project actions, lack of beneficiary
involvement, poor supervision, and an absence of transitional planning, among other things. But
despite the projects' shortcomings, some successes emerged: paddy yields in the small irrigation



20
schemes rehabilitated under the projects proved to be above average for the districts, and had
increased more rapidly than in the country as a whole; the infrastructure projects provided
significant benefits; and the line agencies involved in implementing the projects expanded their
implementation capacity considerably. On balance, therefore, the impact of the projects can be
considered as marginally satisfactory.
33.   While the approach to rural development in Sri Lanka has evolved considerably since the
KRDP and SRDP were initiated, the dynamics of the two projects have had a profound effect on
the design and implementation of later initiatives. The projects were watched closely, and while
they did not provide the replicable model the IRDP had been seeking, they did provide valuable
lessons that have guided the program since. These relate primarily to the desirability of having
greater flexibility in design and implementation, which has been an increasing hallmark of the
program over the past decade.



21
1.  Introduction
1.1    In the mid- I 970s, the government of Sri Lanka launched the Integrated Rural
Development Programme (IRDP) to expand its development efforts to relatively neglected rural
areas. The two projects developed under the IRDP that are examined here include the first
districtwide effort at multisectoral planning in the Kurunegala district and a similar follow-on
project in the two districts bordering Kurunegala, Matale and Puttalam.I All three districts are
among Sri Lanka's poorest, and approximately 90 percent of their populations are rural.
1.2    The Kurunegala Rural Development Project (KRDP) and the Second Rural Development
Project (SRDP) grew out of the government's belief that the economic potential of rural areas
was not being used to its fullest. By tapping into this potential, the government hoped to increase
productivity, expand employment opportunities, and thus raise rural residents' incomes. The
KRDP and SRDP approached the situation from two angles. Because the majority of residents in
the project areas have always been smallholder farmers working plots of less than two acres, the
projects concentrated on raising agricultural productivity and providing basic services such as
clean water and good roads. Second, they aimed to strengthen local institutions involved in
development. Ultimately, they aimed to create a sustainable replicable model of districtwide
development.
1.3    This evaluation asks whether the projects succeeded in their aims and why they
succeeded or failed precisely where they did. The assessment was undertaken in light of the
KRDP and SRDP's effect on later projects, as the many problems these early efforts experienced
did help the IRDP improve the design of its later projects significantly, particularly in terms of
beneficiary participation (chapter 6). The scope of the assessment is restricted to the major
productive components (irrigation, coconuts, and export agriculture crops [EACs]), social
infrastructure subprojects (rural roads, water, health, and electrification), and institution
building. It examines issues of equity in the distribution of benefits but does not focus on gender
concerns except where beneficiaries specifically mentioned the positive effects for women.
1.4    The evaluation team set out not just to measure the projects' economic effects but also to
interpret the dynamics of project activities-that is, changes in the development process
generated by the projects. The team made particular use of participatory techniques that focused
on the beneficiaries' perceptions and sought the views of other stakeholders, including line
agencies, project managers, and the government (annex 2).
1.5    Ultimately, the most successful components, as judged by the beneficiaries' appreciation
of them, would be not the productive components but the social infrastructure that resulted from
the projects. Plagued by design flaws (including overestimates and a shortage of accurate

information), the production generated by the agricultural components was lower than had been
expected. Limited beneficiary involvement meant that farmers felt little sense of ownership of
projects assets. And because farmers play the key role in the operation and maintenance (O&M)
of the schemes, many project assets are in disrepair or have had to be rehabilitated by other
groups (chapter 5). Some crop improvement schemes failed because of factors beyond the
projects' control, including price hikes for some important inputs such as fertilizer.
1.6    But the evaluation team found that despite these failures, beneficiaries in the project
areas appreciated many of the KRDP and SRDP's innovations. On the purely economic side,
yields did not meet the initial estimates but did show an increase over estimated yields without
project intervention (chapter 3). The incomes of many beneficiary households rose, although not
always because of increases in agricultural productivity: in some cases, additional outside
employment opportunities supplemented farm income (chapter 4). In other areas, farmers were
able to use new crops to improve their income from farming and release household members
from outside wage labor. And beneficiaries made clear their appreciation of the new roads that
increased access to employment opportunities (especially for women) and the clean water that
improved their children's health.
1.7    The evaluation team also found that grassroots farmer organizations initiated after the
projects ended have assumed responsibility for O&M of some project assets (chapter 5). This
positive development has increased the likelihood that project assets will be maintained. The
most significant development in terms of sustainability, however, has been the increased
institutional capacity to develop and manage rural development projects (chapter 6).
1.8    The full report of the evaluation team presents their detailed findings and analyses. The
main conclusions of that report formed the basis of a workshop held in Sri Lanka in March 1996.
This report draws heavily upon the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report and also
reflects the discussions of the workshop which are summarized in annex 4. It aims to highlight
the principle findings and conclusions, and to place them in the context of the evolution of the
approach to rural development in Sri Lanka.

2.   The Projects
2.1    The KRDP and SRDP included 12 components but did not claim to cover all aspects of
district development. Rather, they were seen as representing a pragmatic compromise between
comprehensiveness and manageability. Reflecting the objectives of the IRDP, they emphasized
directly productive investments; reductions in intraregional disparities; financial, institutional,
and technical replicability; and labor-intensive, quick-yielding rehabilitation works rather than
new construction.
2.2    The three districts in which the two projects were implemented lie in northwestern Sri
Lanka (see map IBRD 28408). Their climate is tropical, with only slight variations in
temperature but heavy, variable rainfall that ranges from less than 1,500 mm in the drier northern
zones to more than 2,000 mm in the southernmost areas on the fringes of the central highlands.
The three districts had a combined population of almost 2 million in 1980 (about 14 percent of
the national total). Population density varies from fewer than 200 people per square mile in the
drier areas to over 1,000 per square mile in the wetter south (annex 3, table 1).
2.3    The economy and society revolve around small-scale agriculture. In 1982, roughly two-
thirds of the rural households had holdings of less than two acres, and less than 3 percent had
more than 10 acres (annex 3, table 2). The primary staple crop has always been paddy, grown on
seasonally flooded land. Coconut is the main cash crop and is planted mainly in the more humid
upland areas that are not flooded. Other perennial crops such as coffee, cocoa, and pepper and
other spices-usually referred to EACs-are also grown on a small scale, mainly in the wetter
areas of Matale. A range of other annual crops, such as grams and onions, are grown for home
consumption and sale.
The Kurunegala Rural Development Project (KRDP)
2.4    The KRDP was the first project in Sri Lanka to support the integrated development of an
entire district, and aimed to increase employment opportunities and thus raise the productivity,
incomes, and living standards of rural populations. The main thrust was the development of
agriculture, in particular the rehabilitation of the production base for paddy and coconuts and the
strengthening of agricultural support services. Complementing this expenditure on directly
productive activities, which at appraisal accounted for over 78 percent of the base costs, were
limited investments designed to improve health care and educational services, transportation, and
water and electricity supplies to rural areas.
2.5    At appraisal it was agreed that more than two-thirds of the project beneficiaries would be
small farmers with operational holdings of three acres or less and annual per capita incomes of
less than US$50 equivalent. Infrastructure was to be developed in those areas of the district that
most needed it in order to reduce disparities within Kurunegala itself. The appraisal noted,
however, that in view of the prevailing system of land ownership, only about one-third of the
project's benefits would accrue to the district's poorest residents.

Components
2.6    The project's 12 components covered a range of activities that included (a) improving
irrigation and water management, in particular the rehabilitation and upgrading of 500 small
tanks and 9 medium-sized irrigation schemes to increase paddy production;4 (b) expanding
existing programs for replanting, intercropping, and fertilizing smallholder coconut plantations;
(c) upgrading agricultural extension services; (d) improving supplies of agricultural inputs; (e)
making credit more readily available by providing funds for specific types of lending; (f)
upgrading and expanding rural roads and water and electricity supplies; (g) increasing the
number of rural health care and educational facilities; and (h) establishing project coordination
and monitoring capabilities (see table 2.1). At appraisal, the ERR for the project's productive
components was estimated at 32 percent.

Implementing the Project
2.7     The project was designed to utilize existing agencies rather than to create a new
institutional setup. About 20 agencies from 12 ministries were involved in implementing the
various components, but the Ministry of Finance, Planning, Ethnic Affairs and National
Integration (MFPEA & NI) held overall responsibility. A project office headed by a project
director was in charge of monitoring, supervising, and coordinating the work programs of
agencies in the field (figure 2.1).
2.8     For the purpose of project coordination, a project steering committee was established at
the national level and a project coordinating committee at the district level.5
2.9     The life of the project was originally to be five years, from mid- 1979 to mid- 1984. But
procurement and budgetary problems and manpower shortages in the major implementing
agencies delayed the start of implementation until 1980. As a result, the closing date was
extended twice, each time by one year (to 1986), to enable the project to meet most of its targets
(see annex 1, table I for details of physical targets and achievements). Reportedly, the main
reasons for the slow startup were delays in procuring equipment and vehicles (the result of the
implementing agencies' lack of familiarity with the World Bank's international competitive
bidding procedures and a shortage of staff (especially in the Department of Irrigation). The
actual disbursement was US$17.1 million, about 86 percent of the total IDA credit of US$20
million.
The Second Rural Development Project (SRDP)
2.10    Designed to cover the districts of Puttalam and Matale, the SRDP had broadly the same
objectives as the KRDP but placed more emphasis on infrastructure. The SAR assumed that two-
thirds of the SRDP's beneficiaries would be farmers with holdings of up to 2 acres and annual
per capita incomes below the poverty level of US$75. As with the KRDP, the appraisal noted
that in view of the prevailing tenure pattern, only about one-third of the project's direct benefits
were likely to accrue to this target group. The SRDP was approved in 1981, with a total cost of
US$40 million.
5. The steering committee comprised the heads of responsible central government agencies and departments, the
government agent for the district, and the project director. It was chaired by the MFPEA & NI's secretary, with t he
director of the ministry's Regional Development Division (RDD) as member secretary. The committee met every three
months to resolve project-related policy issues, implementation bottlenecks, and coordination problems that could not
be resolved at the district level. The project coordinating committee, comprising district heads of the implementing
agencies and departments and chaired by the district minister with the project director as member secretary, met once a
month to discuss and resolve interdepartmental coordination problems.

Components
2.11   Like the KRDP, the SRDP focused on (a) improving irrigation and water management;
(b) rehabilitating and replanting coconut; (c) increasing supplies of agricultural inputs; (d)
making credit more readily available; (e) improving rural roads and water and electricity
supplies; (f) upgrading rural educational and health care facilities; and (g) establishing project
coordination and monitoring capabilities (table 2.2). In addition, the SRDP had three components
not included in the KRDP: forestry (in both districts); fisheries landing and shore facilities in
Puttalam; and, in Matale, an EAC component that replaced the coconut component. Unlike the
KRDP, the SRDP did not seek to strengthen the extension service. (Details of the targets and
achievements of the proojects are shown in annex 1, table 2.) At appraisal, the ERR for the
project's productive component was estimated at 17 percent (18 percent for Matale and 15
percent for Puttalam).
Implementing the Project
2.12   The project was implemented by 25 agencies from 12 ministries in conjunction with 2
banks. Although the SRDP entailed a single loan agreement, in effect it consisted of two separate
projects, one for each district, each with its own project director and management unit as well as
its own account. Implementation was planned for five years (mid-1981 to mid-1986) but was
extended for four additional years.
2.13   The physical targets set at appraisal were met some 18 months after the project's original
closing date, but further extensions were granted so that the project could more fully utilize the
IDA credit, the local currency equivalent of which had increased substantially because of the
depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee.6 Although the actual loan disbursement amounted to SDR
22.86 million (US$26.3 million, or about 89 percent of the total IDA credit), actual project costs
in local currency were about 33 percent higher than appraisal estimates, the result of domestic
inflation and the extended project implementation. In terms of the U.S. dollar, however, actual
costs were lower (US$39.3 million) compared with the appraisal estimate (US$50 million).
6. As a result, in several of the project's components, the actual physical achievement exceeded the appraisal target
(see annex 1, table 2).

3.  Agricultural Production Performance
3.1    The central objective of the two projects was to increase the incomes and welfare of
rural households, particularly smallholders, by stimulating agricultural production. About two-
thirds of project expenditures were earmarked for this purpose. Efforts focused on expanding
production of the most widely grown crops (paddy rice and coconuts) and of potential EACs
suitable for smallholder production (coffee, cocoa, and pepper). About 30 percent of the funds
for agriculture in the two projects was devoted to providing credit for agricultural investment.
This chapter discusses the physical outcomes and the macroeconomic implications of these
efforts.
A. Production Impact
Paddy
3.2    To increase rice production, the projects focused on improving existing irrigation
schemes, in particular minor (village) schemes-generally a small impoundment, or "tank," that
collects water in the wettest season as a supplementary source of water for the late stages of the
growing period. These schemes generally provided water for an area of between 20 and 150
acres. Some medium-sized schemes covering around 700 acres each were also rehabilitated.
3.3    The results of the field evaluation show that the additional paddy production resulting
from these works is significantly less than had been forecast at appraisal, because the
assumptions on which the appraisal was based proved to be overoptimistic. The area of land
receiving improved water supply, the intensity of cropping on that land, and the increment of
yield which can be attributed to the projects, were all less than expected.
3.4   Incremental and cropped areas in the rehabilitated schemes were below appraisal
targets. The overall expansion of both irrigable and cropped area under the KRDP was 43
percent and 49 percent below the SAR targets, respectively (table 3.1). For minor schemes, the
relatively poor achievements (69 percent lower than the SAR estimates) largely account for the
small overall increase in irrigable and cropped area. Several factors affected the results: a) the
recurrent droughts of the late 1980s; b) inadequate downstream development work; c) the
inadequacy of the water management component; and most important d) the SAR's unrealistic
targets, which were based on inaccurate information. The SAR estimated that about 500 minor
schemes could be rehabilitated, with an initial irrigable area of 70,000 acres, and that this area
could then be increased by 21 percent. In fact, it now appears that the 455 schemes which were
rehabilitated initially only commanded about 23,100 acres of land. With rehabilitation, the total
irrigable area did increase by about 24 percent, or slightly more than the SAR anticipated but in
actual acreage, this amount equals only about half the anticipated incremental acreage. The same
holds true for the cropped area (for details see annex 3, table 3).7
3.5   In contrast, the number of schemes rehabilitated under the SRDP exceeded appraisal
targets by 50 percent because of the extended project period (para. 2.3). The irrigable area
increased 41 percent more than had been anticipated at appraisal (6 percent in Matale and 59
7. In reality, the KRDP's project designers expected the project to have an impact on the whole district.



30
percent in Puttalam) and the cropped area by 9 percent more (11 percent less than anticipated in
Matale, but nearly 20 percent more than expected in Puttalam).
3.6    Cropping intensity in both projects was only slightly below SAR expectations, except in
Puttalam. There it was 25 percent lower than anticipated, because several minor schemes were
sited on flat lands (some below sea level) that are often flooded during the rainy season. Only
one crop is grown in these areas between the two wet seasons.
3.7    The original estimates of paddy yields were overoptimistic. When the incremental
contribution of the projects to paddy yields (as calculated by the mission) is compared with
completion estimates, two points stand out (table 3.2).8 First, there is a positive incremental
contribution in all cases of about 60-90 kg/acre. Second, this increase is below appraisal
estimates, primarily because both these estimates of the incremental impact of the projects were
overoptimistic. They assumed that yields would not increase at all without the projects.
3.8    From 1979 to 1987, paddy yields first increased in Sri Lanka and then began to stagnate
and, in some areas, to decline slightly. Comparison of the evolution of yields in the project
districts with those in the Sri Lanka as a whole supports the conclusion that, broadly speaking,
increases in yields in the project districts were as high (if not higher) than those at the national
level (table 3.3). The increase in yields was greatest in the minor schemes in the project areas,
demonstrating the value of the increased availability of water resulting from the rehabilitation
works carried out under the project.
3.9    On the basis of these estimates of incremental areas and yields, this evaluation has
estimated yearly incremental production of paddy at about 16,600 metric tons/year under the
KRDP; and at 8,331 tons under the SRDP (annex 3, table 4).9 These figures are substantially
lower than the SAR projections (56,000 tons and 24,000 tons respectively).
Coconut
3.10 Yearly incremental coconut production resulting from the KRDP has been estimated by
this study at 65.9 million coconuts, or an average incremental productivity of 507 coconuts per
acre. This estimate is 57 percent lower than SAR estimates and 31 percent lower than PCR
estimates. Estimates of incremental coconut production in the Puttalam District resulting from
the SRDP also fall short of appraisal targets, amounting to 17.4 million-33 percent and 38
percent below SAR and PCR estimates.
8. Table 2, annex 3 provides the details by discrete years.
9. See annex 3. Detailed incremental production attributable to the projects in each district appears in tables 3-5 and
representative crop budgets in tables 6-17.

3.11   The appraisal report identified three constraints to increased productivity of coconut
groves: a high percentage of overage palms, a lack of moisture in the soils of the semiwet and
dry zones, and soil erosion in the semiwet and wet zones. The projects aimed to reduce these
constraints by subsidizing the replanting or underplanting of existing coconut palms and new



33
planting in home gardens; I0rehabilitating coconut lands with drains, contour ridges (soil bunds),
and husk pits to conserve soil and moisture; increasing productivity with fertilizers; and
intercropping coconut palms with export crops. In addition, the projects were to train farmers,
strengthen the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) and establish nurseries to raise the quality of
coconut planting material.
3.12    What the components achieved. The Regional Offices of the Coconut Cultivation Board
(CCB) for the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts implemented these components. The maximum
holding size (under single private ownership) eligible for the schemes was 50 acres. In
quantitative terms, the rehabilitation scheme proved the most successful, exceeding the SAR
target by 33 percent in the KRDP and by 112 percent in the SRDP, largely because farrners
received a subsidy that was paid in one installment and was relatively easy to obtain (table 3.4).
The subsidized replanting and underplanting schemes fell just short of their targets in
Kurunegala and exceeded them by 62 percent in the Puttalam. But the fertilizer scheme, which
relied on credit, reached only 14 percent of the SAR targets set for the KRDP because of the high
price of fertilizer relative to the fluctuating farm-gate price of coconuts, the lagged response to
fertilizer use, the tedious procedures involved in obtaining credit, and the farmers' fear that they
would be unable to repay the loans. The coconut intercropping scheme, which was based on
intercropping with EACs, was also unsuccessful for a number of reasons: the semiwet and dry
zones of both districts proved to be unsuited to the cultivation of these crops; there was a lack of
coordination among the agencies concemed; 1 ' farmers with 1-2.5 acre holdings were reluctant to
use busy family members for the labor-intensive cultivation EACs require; and managers for this
type of cultivation in holdings of 20 acres and above were scarce.12

10. In Puttalam this scheme was added during implementation.
I 1. Good examples are the absence of recommendations on the appropriate timing of coconut planting and intercropping,
which were under the responsibility of the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) and the Department of Export Agriculture
(DEA), respectively; and the overlapping jurisdiction of extension support by the CCB, DEA, and DoA.

3.13   Production from project schemes. Study estimates of incremental coconut production for
each project take into account both field information and the factors just discussed. Two
productivity levels were used for these calculations: one for beneficiaries who received all the
subsidy installments or continued maintaining drains (total participators), and one for those who
did not receive the total number of installments or stopped maintaining drains (partial
participators) (table 3.5).

3.14   Two unrealistic assumptions used in both the SAR and PCR account for the large
discrepancy between the appraisal and current estimates of incremental yields. The first was that
beneficiaries who did not obtain all the installments of the coconut underplanting and replanting
subsidy schemes would achieve the same productivity level as those who did. The drop out rate was
high (annex 3, table 5). Less than half of those who registered for the planting / underplanting
schemes qualified for the second installment and only about I percent for the fourth. The main
reason for this was the inability or reluctance of farmers to uproot senile or excessive palms, and
carry out required maintenance of underplanted palms. Some beneficiaries also said that the long
delay before the first installment was paid led to farmers losing interest and dropping out.
3.15   The second maintained that the majority of beneficiaries would continue to use the
improved management practices (applying fertilizer, weeding, and conserving soil and moisture
through drains and husk pits) recommended by the CCB after the subsidies were ended. In spite
of the impressive quantitative achievements of the rehabilitation, replanting, and underplanting
schemes, beneficiaries have not continued with recommended practices. For example, only 11
percent of the beneficiaries of the rehabilitation scheme have continued to maintain drains. Some
30 percent maintained drains only during the project period, and 59 percent did not maintain
them at all (annex 3, table 6). According to the farmers interviewed, the major reason for not
maintaining drains was the escalating cost of labor. Another reason may have been that not all
the subsidized drains were needed.13 Further, according to data from the CCB, only about 34
percent of the original participants in the KRDP replanting and underplanting schemes qualified
for the second credit installment, about 17 percent for the third, and just one percent for the last
one. Similarly, only 48 percent of the original participants in the SRDP qualified for the second
installment, 15 percent for the third, and 1.1 percent for the fourth and last one (table 3, annex 4).
Those who did not qualify were unable and/or reluctant to uproot senile or excessive plants and
13. The construction of contour drains was popular in that it gave the farmers additional labor wages during the off-
season. In addition, if the objective of the contour drains was to intercept surface runoff and increase infiltration so as
to reduce erosion, maintaining them in a clean condition was unnecessary.



35
to maintain underplanted palms properly.'4 Several beneficiaries also mentioned the serious
delays in receiving the first installment as a reason for dropping out of the scheme.
3.16   Appraisal estimates also assumed that the entire coconut area in the three districts
(370,000 ac) would benefit from the coconut development component. The completion report for
the KRDP revised the appraisal projections of incremental area but increased the incremental
production estimates, on the assumption that deteriorating husbandry practices and old
unproductive palms would cause annual yields in the without-project scenario to decline
considerably. However, this assumed decline in yields (which was criticized by the performance
audit report) was unjustified. National figures on area and coconut production indicate that,
while the cultivated area declined from 1.05 million acres to 0.93 million acres in 1980-94,
production fluctuated widely (figure 3.1). A three-year moving average of yields data shows a
statistically insignificant increase of 1.2 percent per annum. The figures suggest that yields
countrywide have not changed and may even have increased slightly.

3.17   The KRDP did not include any support for EACs, and the SRDP effort was confined to
Matale District.15 The Department of Export Agriculture (DEA) implemented the component,
which planned to expand cultivated areas and improve production techniques. Specifically, the
component aimed to establish the EAC Central Plant Nursery to supply quality planting material
for pepper, coffee, cocoa, cloves, and cardamom; implement subsidy schemes for new plantings
of cocoa, pepper, coffee, and cloves, for home gardens (less than 0.5 acre) planted with a mixture
of EACs, and for holdings of more than 0.5 acres planted with a mixture of EACs; establish a
cardamom research center for the study of the genetics and multiplication of cardamom; and
14. The Coconut Research Institute (CR1) has scientifically established that old, senile trees should be removed in
order to obtain maximum productivity from an underplanted holding.
15. The borrower in its comments writes that under the ICRDP five nurseries were established to provide planting
material to the CCB, although this had not been provided for at appraisal.

install a cocoa dryer to encourage growers to produce high-quality fermented cocoa beans. 16 The
maximum holding size (under single private ownership) for which assistance was given was 50
acres.
3.18    What the program achieved. The targets for this component included planting or
replanting pure stands of cocoa, cardamom, pepper, coffee, cloves, and nutmeg on 7,890 acres
and planting EACs on 290 acres of existing home gardens. It was estimated the total area planted
with EACs at 10,525 acres, about 38 percent higher than the appraisal target. However,
secondary data from the DEA record an incremental area of only 4,205 acres, or about 55 percent
of the target (table 2.7). 17
3.19    The main reason for the difference in total incremental areas is that the PCR assumed
that the total area for which subsidy permits had been issued was the developed area. Because
this method overestimated the program's impact, two adjustments were made. First, the farmers
who dropped out of the subsidy schemes after taking the first installment were deducted from the
total number of farmers who received the first installment, as most of these dropouts were
unlikely to have continued with EAC cultivation. Second, the area was deflated for the overall
plant mortality rate. 18

3.20   Productivity increases. Data on productivity from the mission's field survey are notably
lower than SAR figures and are corroborated by secondary sources. The main reasons for the
discrepancy are much the same as those for the discrepancies in the coconut component. The
SAR for the SRDP assumed that the component's beneficiaries would continue with the DEA's
recommended management practices. However, only a small percentage of beneficiaries did so
after project support ceased, largely because of escalating rural wages, increases in fertilizer prices,
16. However, the dryer has not been widely utilized (it never reached 50 percent of its capacity) because of a lack of
financial incentives among growers and is now completely in disuse.
17. See table 10, annex 4 for details of the estimation.

and fluctuating prices for coconut and EACs (annex 3, table 7). At appraisal it was also assumed
that EACs would be planted as pure stands with corresponding yield levels. But almost all the
beneficiaries have interplanted to maximize the use of land, decreasing the productivity of
individual EACs while increasing overall returns.'9

areas developed for EACs and of productivity levels. Except for cloves and coffee, yields
recorded for all the other crops are lower than appraisal estimates.
B. Economic Analysis
3.23   The evaluation of the projects' economic impact attempted to answer three questions:
whether the projects interventions were economically viable, how the changing economic
environment affected this, and whether the approach adopted of rice and coconut improvement
production made sense. The results of the analysis showed that, from an economic point of view,
paddy performed better than coconuts or EACs, although the rates of return are generally below
10 percent, the generally accepted level for satisfactory performance. Over the life of the project
changes in relative prices negatively affected producers of paddy and coconuts, although EACs
performed somewhat better. Estimation of the domestic research cost (DRC) of production of
paddy indicated that improvement of overall irrigation schemes remains marginally attractive.
But analysis of the technologies promoted by the projects for coconuts indicate that they appear
unattractive to farmers given the wide price fluctuations which characterize the coconut market
in Sri Lanka.
19. Many smallholders in the wet zone (Matale and Kandy districts in particular) maintain a very high crop intensity on
uplands to maximize the use of this scarce resource. A typical farming model is the Kandyan Homegardens in the Kandy
District and the wetter areas of Matale.

Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
Paddy
3.24    Separate ERRs have been estimated for the individual productive components studied in
the two projects and for these components combined (table 3.8). Two ERRs have been calculated
for the paddy component:
(a)     A rate of return based on the without-project scenario that assumes the projects'
benefits are the result of the difference between the production increases
recorded in the project areas and the production increases recorded in the
nonproject areas of the same districts. Since these areas benefited from
investments made by other donors, this ERR tends to underestimate the projects'
benefits.
(b)     A rate of return based on the assumption that all production increases in the
project areas since the start of the projects can be credited to the projects'
interventions. This ERR overestimates project benefits.
The true ERR lies somewhere between the two estimates.

a. Case A = Incremental benefits are the result of the difference between production increases in project areas and
production increases in the nonproject areas of the same district.
b. Case B = All production increases over and above the level of the preproject situation are credited to the projects.
Note: The analysis uses three years (1980, 1987, and 1994) for which reasonably reliable data on crop yields and input
use could be collected. In all the estimates, the current prices are the three-year arithmetic averages, which are used
to smooth the impact of annual fluctuations in the value of inputs and outputs. Figures for the intervening years have
been interpolated linearly.
3.25    For both projects, the reestimated ERRs are significantly lower than the anticipated
levels of return. At appraisal the ERRs estimated for the KRDP were between 25 and 50 percent,
depending on the assumptions used, while, for the SRDP, returns to the rehabilitation of minor
schemes were estimated at 19 percent for Matale and 18 percent for Puttalam, and for major
schemes at 35 percent and 17 percent, respectively.



39
Coconut
3.26   The reestimated ERRs are below 10 percent for both projects, compared with appraisal
estimates of above 25 percent for the KRDP and 40 percent for SRDP (Puttalam only). The
ERRs are based on a without-project scenario that assumes an unchanged preproject situation.
The farming practices the projects recommended have not been maintained, contributing to this
crop's less-than-satisfactory performance.
EACs
3.27   The reestimated ERR for EACs in the SRDP (5 percent) is similarly below the appraisal
estimate for the project (21 percent). The reestimated ERR is at odds with the excellent financial
results obtained at farm level, suggesting that the design of this component was not cost-
effective.
All productive components
3.28   The ERR for all the productive components of the KRDP and SRDP is less than 10
percent, even using the optimistic assumption that the project generated all improvements. This
disappointing outcome compares unfavorably with earlier estimates of 34 percent for the KRDP
and 23 percent for the SRDP.  The benefits of the social infrastructure the project created were
not included in the appraisal calculations of the ERR and have not been quantified in the impact
evaluation. Yet respondents rated these infrastructure investments, particularly rural
electrification, among the most significant project benefits (see chapter 4).
The Economic Environment
3.29   The results of the projects efforts at promoting diversification away from rice and
coconuts indicate that farmers are interested and do respond when there is a clear incentive.
However, actual performance of these crops was below expectations. This indicates that the
problem is not with inadequate knowledge of technologies, but rather with the perception of
uncertain profitability. Prices for most crops fluctuate widely and in these circumstances farmers
need evidence of enough 'good' seasons to take up a new product, or of clear improvements in
yield to adopt more expensive technologies for an existing one. The private sector is active in
marketing, but other studies have indicated the difficulties caused by erratic policies, e.g., in
importation of chilies, onions and potatoes, and by inadequate wholesale facilities, e.g., for
perishable fruits and vegetables.  These problems aggravate price fluctuations at the farm level
and discourage increased production.
3.30   Changes in Sri Lanka's overall economic situation, particularly escalating labor costs
and the collapse of international market prices for important export crops, also diminished the
success of the projects' agricultural components. In the 1980s, sizable private sector investments
(encouraged by the government's 1977 liberalization policies) significantly expanded
opportunities for nonfarm employment in rural areas. Simultaneously, the government adopted a
20. When the costs of social infrastructure-water supply, roads, health and educational facilities-are also included,
the appraisal estimates of the ERR for the entire projects dropped, to 32 and 17 percent, respectively.

policy of nonintervention in labor markets to further encourage private investment and began
emphasizing exports, employment creation, and infrastructural development. Rural wages
jumped, but not agricultural prices, which failed to keep pace with inflation. In this environment,
many small farmers were reluctant to give up lucrative wage labor to experiment with new crops
and farming techniques.
3.31    The country experienced considerable price inflation between 1980 and 1994. The farm-
gate prices of paddy, coconut, and coffee generally followed the same trends as living and labor
costs from 1980-91 but fell considerably in 1993 and 1994 (figure 3.2).22 But throughout the
1980s, the terms of trade were turning against Sri Lanka's farmers (figure 3.3). Between 1980-
82 and 1990-92, intemational prices fell (in real terms) by about 52 percent for paddy, 24
percent for copra, 45 percent for coffee, and 46 percent for cocoa.23 Paddy and coconut
producers were the most seriously affected, and commercial growers with higher input
requirements fared worse than small farmers.

3.32    In the late 1980s, paddy yields began to stagnate, the result of low rainfall, civil unrest,
and, most important, the fact that new technologies able to generate immediate increases in
output had already been exploited. The financial price of inputs other than labor (particularly
fertilizer) also increased considerably with the devaluation of the rupee and the abolition of
subsidies. The abolition of the fertilizer subsidy, however, probably had a marginal impact on
paddy production: although the share of fertilizer in the value of production doubled, it remained
below 10 percent in 1994. EACs were affected less than other crops.
22. Relative to the cost of living and labor, coffee and cocoa prices have lagged considerably since 1987. Pepper prices
showed an exceptional buoyancy in the mid-1980s, followed by a drastic realignment and a slight recovery in 1993-
94.

The Appropriateness of the Approaches Used
3.33    Paddy. The major focus of the project in rice production was in upgrading minor (village
level) irrigation systems. The appropriateness of this approach was assessed through the
estimation of the DRC coefficients. I Crop budgets for Maha season in Kurunegala were used to
32
estimate DRCs over the life of the project.  For the minor schemes, since rice from such areas is
used primarily for home consumption, the cost of transport and related items was not included.
This showed that, taking into account the capital costs of rehabilitation, the DRC increased from
0.89 in 1987 to 1.0 in 1994. This indicates that the rehabilitation of minor schemes has been
attractive but that this has been eroding over time.
3.34    The DRC for paddy has been tested for a range of assumptions about the adjusted value
of foreign exchange and the conversion factor applied to domestic prices. These do not greatly
affect the estimates. However, the DRC would increase significantly if a much higher value were
assumed for the use of land, or a lower international market price were used as reference, or a
much higher investment cost per unit of land had been envisaged, and/or the cost of resources
used in the transport, wholesaling, and distribution of rice to major urban centers had been
included.
31. The domestic resource cost coefficient is generally used in sector price analysis to measure efficiency in the use of
resources. The further the coefficients drop below 1, the greater the economic benefit and comparative advantage. For
details, see 1. Tsakok, Agricultural Price Policy, Cornell University Press, 1990.
32. This analysis is straightforward with respect to current production benefits and costs, since it is carried out at
current prices. In estimating the economic value of output and inputs, all crops produced and seeds, fertilizers,
chemicals, and contract services (essentially mechanized farming operations) used were considered as tradables, and
the appropriate share of foreign exchange component has been used to adjust for the overvaluation of the national
currency. Nontradable items include the value of labor and land use, which is estimated to be the residual value at
economic prices (output less production costs) of the best alternative crop that could be grown on the same land.
Recovered on-farm investment costs and of project expenditures have been included. The inclusion of a capital
recovery factor related to investment costs is more complex, involving the reevaluation of expenditures undertaken
during a period when (with the indexes used) domestic price inflation and changes in the terms of trade caused serious
distortions.



42
3.35    Coconuts. The approach to increasing coconut production was to provide financial
incentives for replanting or new planing by small-scale producers and for a range of "improved"
technologies. However, as noted above (paras. 3.12-3.13), farmers did not, in general, follow
through with these technologies, for which the yield benefits were modest. They adopted them
only in response to government subsidies, and abandoned them when the subsidies stopped.
Coconut prices in Sri Lanka have traditionally been subject to wide year-to-year fluctuations. In
this situation the choice for a farmer is not simple. The cost of the new technology is known, the
likely benefits are highly uncertain. An analytic technique which attempts to take this into
account shows that, ex ante, without subsidies, the traditional technologies are likely to be
judged better by farmers under almost all likely conditions.26 Even with subsidies, the expected
net benefits from the new technologies were not unambiguous. Thus it is not surprising that
farmer interest was tepid, and the proposed technologies were abandoned when subsidies
ceased.27
C. Agricultural Support Services
3.36    Some 30 percent of funds earmarked for agriculture were devoted to strengthening
support services for input supply, extension, and credit. Results of these efforts were, however,
mixed. Farmers were generally aware of technologies promoted by extension, but their use was
only partial. The credit program led to much greater purchase of tractors (especially of the two-
wheeled variety) than expected, but uptake of production loans lagged, and the impact of the
project on the credit system was limited.
Input Supply
3.37    The projects constructed multipurpose cooperatives and agrarian service centers and
rehabilitated fertilizer stores to facilitate the supply of inputs for paddy production. Under the
KRDP, 57 such stores had been constructed by project completion, compared with the appraisal
target of 80. Under the SRDP, the project provided funds to improve facilities for the sale and
storage of fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds.28 Yet farmers purchased a large volume of inputs
from the local traders who became ubiquitous in the countryside after 1977. A paddy seed
processing center with a capacity of 2 tons was built in 1983 under the KRDP, for instance, but
field mission findings indicate that over two-thirds of the farmers generally obtained their seeds
from private sources.29 The farmers interviewed cited convenient credit arrangements and, in the
26. See J. R. Anderson and J. L. Dillon. Risk Analysis in Dryland Farming Systems, FAO. 1992 Chapter 3. When
farmers are considering whether to adopt a new technology, they may be reasonably certain of the costs involved (e.g.
for improved seeds or fertilizer, or for any additional cultivation required). However, the benefits are likely to be
highly uncertain. The farmer has to compare a range of likely outcomes from his traditional technology, based on his
experience, and another range based on the new technology which is enveloped in uncertainty. A recently developed
analytic technique, stochastic efficiency analysis, provides an approach to estimating these distributions. Using this
approach, and taking expected revenue fluctuations into account, the analysis indicates that the farmer's expected net
revenue from using traditional technologies for coconut exceeds that from the proposed technologies over almost all
the range of likely outcomes, if the new technologies are not subsidized. When subsidized, the proposed technologies
are better over little more than half the range of expected outcomes.
27. In the last year or two, interest in coconut timber has increased greatly. If this continues, it is likely to change the
economies of the crop and make the replacement of old palms more attractive.
28. Funds for a total of 105 such facilities were allocated, and 96 facilities were improved under the project.
29. The government has encouraged and trained many farmers to grow high-quality seeds and to sell them to their
fellow farmers.



43
case of the seed processing center, the fact that seeds were not always available when needed, as
the major reason for patronizing private traders.30
Agricultural Extension
3.38    The KRDP planned to reorganize and strengthen extension services to complement the
nationwide extension efforts of the Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project
(AEARP), which was also financed by the World Bank. The SRDP did not make any provision
for strengthening extension services. A range of practices were promoted by extension services
over the project period, with varying degrees of success (box 3.1).
3.39   The unified extension service anticipated at appraisal did not materialize. The advisory
services of the CCB, the Department of Agriculture (DoA), and the Department of Animal
Husbandry continued to offer technical advice independently of one another, with adverse effects
on the implementation of some components. As late as 1986, only 17 DEA extension workers
(out of the 50 unified extension workers envisaged at appraisal) had been posted, reportedly
because of delays in approval from the Treasury and a lack of qualified personnel.3I
3.40    Staff mobility and accommodations were improved under the two projects. However,
over 70 percent of the quarters built under the KRDP for field staff were never occupied,
reportedly because basic amenities such as educational facilities, electricity, and medical
32
services were lacking in the designated areas.
Credit
3.41    In both projects, the credit component accounted for the second-largest share of project
costs (29.4 percent in the KRDP and 19.7 percent in the SRDP). Because farmers in the project
areas traditionally had difficulty obtaining credit, the component aimed to develop a financially
viable credit system that would reach a significant proportion of them.33 At appraisal, two
primary constraints were identified: weaknesses in the agricultural credit system, and the lenient
attitude of successive governments toward regular defaulters. The recovery rate for short-term
production loans was around 60 percent, a situation that seriously depleted government funds. In
1979 the government temporarily discontinued default guarantees in order to give lending
institutions an incentive to encourage credit discipline, leading to a credit shortfall.
3.42    Credit funds for both projects were channeled through the People's Bank and the Bank
of Ceylon. The Central Bank provided 1 00-percent refinancing facilities for short-term crop
loans at 2 percent annual interest and default guarantees of up to 75 percent. For medium-termn
loans, the Central Bank provided 70 percent refinancing facilities at rediscount rates ranging
from 4 to 9 percent.

but not enough information was available to assess its sustainability.

44
Box 3.1: The Extension Service's "Messages": Good Farming Practices
During the project period, the extension service promoted a number of "messages" to
farmers in the three project districts in an effort to improve farming practices.
Farmers were encouraged to switch to modern machinery. While the overwhelming
majority of paddy farmers (over 80 percent) had been using buffalo before the project, by 1995
two-wheel and four-wheel tractors had replaced animals, and only about 20 percent of farmers in
Kurunegala and Puttalam continued to use buffalo. In Matale, only about half the farmers
switched to tractors. The farmers interviewed in Matale cited either the fact that the tractors were
not available when they were needed or a shortage of cash for renting them as the main reasons
for continuing to use buffalo. For the most part, however, the two-wheel tractor credit scheme
did facilitate the switch to modem farm machinery.
Farmers were urged to adopt early-maturing varieties. Virtually all the farmers
interviewed were already growing high-yielding varieties before the projects, but in general these
varieties matured rather late (after four months). In the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts, the
proportion of farmers utilizing three-month varieties doubled between the preproject period and
1995, while in Matale it trebled. For most farmers, adopting these varieties was a strategy to
decrease the risk of moisture loss in case of drought.
Farmers were encouraged to establish crops on time. This message had some effect but
did not produce the expected results. The proportion of farmers establishing crops between mid-
October and mid-November increased compared with the preproject period, but a large
proportion of farmers continued to wait until late November or even mid-December to establish
crops. Farmers cited land fragmentation, multiple ownership in several tanks of the cascade
system,a and, at times, a lack of either animals or tractors as the main reasons for the delay. In
addition, given the uncertainty about the onset of the full rainy season, farmers tend to wait till
the season is well advanced for fear of losing seeds.
Farmers were urged to transplant. The DoA promoted specific extension messages
concerning improved methods for raising paddy nursery. During the later part of the KRDP, a
transplanting machine from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was introduced in
the area but was not very successful. Broadcasting sowing was found to be practically the only
method of establishing stands. The scarcity and high costs of labor were the farmers' main
reasons for not adopting transplanting, as similar yield levels could be achieved with proper
weed control.
Farmers were encouraged to usefertilizers. Fertilizer use increased substantially until
about 1987-88 and then stagnated or increased very little. In practically all cases, the amount of
fertilizer and the mix used did not conform to recommended practices. The farmers gave as their
major reasons for not adhering to recommended practices cost differentials among different
types of fertilizers and the overall increase in the cost of these inputs. Meanwhile, herbicide use
increased substantially: all the farmers interviewed used herbicide as a mean of curtailing labor
costs.
a In general, most minor schemes in the three project areas belong to a series of adjacent and interconnected tanks,
referred to as a "tank cascade system." Although farmers have small plots in each tank, most of them own several plots
in the whole system. The Agrarian Research and Training Institute's (ARTI's) ex post evaluation of the KRDP
indicated that 78 percent of the farmers interviewed had plots in several adjoining schemes.



45
To foster credit discipline, the project also planned to strengthen efforts by the People's Bank
and the Bank of Ceylon to recover or reschedule overdue loans (about SL Rs 16 millions in
Kurunegala, SL Rs 9.7 in Matale, and SL Rs 15 million in Puttalam).
3.43   In terms of the number of loans granted, cultivation loans were by far the most
important. In terms of value, cultivation loans remained the most important in Puttalam and
Matale, but in Kurunegala the amount loaned for two-wheel tractors was slightly higher than the
amount loaned for cultivation (table 3.9). Loans for the two-wheel tractor scheme considerably
exceeded SAR targets in Kurunegala and Matale. The staff of the banks and the farmers
interviewed believed that the two-wheel tractor scheme was the most successful because this
type of tractor has several advantages: it can be used for a variety of agricultural tasks (and on
very small plots), as well as for transportation and other nonagricultural activities throughout the
year; it is easy to operate; and it is not too expensive.
3.44   It was unanimously recognized that cultivation loans had very poor results, including
delays in repayment and high default rates. Several branch managers of participating banks
mentioned that they offered these loans only because the Central Bank provided guarantees.
According to an evaluation carried out in 1985-86, the majority of the loans granted for paddy in
Kurunegala (64 percent) were for production under major irrigation schemes. 4 The same survey
indicated that only 33 percent of the farmers interviewed had used institutional credit; the
remaining 67 percent were either not eligible (18 percent), had defaulted before (12 percent), did
not have guarantors (12 percent), were not interested (12 percent), thought there were too many
delays in lending (10 percent), failed to get crop insurance (9 percent), or had other reasons for
not participating (25 percent). Farmers complained about the excessive number of visits they had
to make to banks in order to get a loan (as many as six visits to banks that might be as far as ten
miles away).

procedures for obtaining the bank loans; the long period before these perennial crops would
guarantee income (which made the loans appear risky to farmers); and the loan repayments
themselves, which many felt were not in line with the income the crops generated. Some farmers
stated that they had not known about the scheme; others had mortgaged standing crops; and in
any case EAC cultivators received subsidies from the DEA.

4.  Socioeconomic Impact
4.1     The KRDP and SRDP aimed not only to increase agricultural productivity (see
chapter 3) but also to raise the incomes and living standards of project beneficiaries. This chapter
scrutinizes the impact of the major project components on income levels and living conditions in
the project areas. It presents the views of project beneficiaries for each major component as
important indicators of the projects' success. The analysis uses information from beneficiaries as
well as economic models based on estimates of farm income.
4.2     From the beneficiaries' viewpoint, the projects provided distinct benefits but did not
involve farmers enough in planning and design. While people appreciated the improved
technologies and especially the social infrastructure, they objected to the "top down" approach
the projects employed. The analysis of the available data also produced mixed results. While
increased production from irrigable areas, improved technologies, and crop diversification raised
incomes somewhat, the gains were relatively modest. Overall, the projects' weaknesses highlight
the need for more participatory "process-oriented" planning and more stringent preproject
analysis.
A. The Impact at the Household Level
4.3     To assess the impact of the irrigation and major productive components on household
income, the study adopted two approaches.35 The first used information from beneficiaries to
assess changes in the distribution of the incomes of beneficiary households. The second used
data on holding size, cropped areas, technologies used, and yields to construct a series of farm
models representing the situations of typical holdings with and without project intervention. The
models generated estimates of crop-based incomes with and without project interventions.
Irrigation
Views of the beneficiaries
4.4     The majority of the beneficiaries interviewed recognized that the rehabilitation of the
irrigation schemes had had a positive impact in terms of the availability of water and the
increases in the number and size of irrigated areas. Ultimately, the rehabilitation schemes
increased crop yields and allowed farmers to grow a second crop during the Yala (spring
35. Unfortunately, a lack of data constrained efforts to assess the impact of irrigation and the major productive
components (paddy, coconuts, and EACs) on household income. Although ARTl conducted a baseline survey and a
postproject evaluation of the KRDP, the information collected could not be compared, since the two surveys used
different samples and methodologies and comparable secondary data do not exist. In spite of the fact that both the
Department of Census and Statistics and the Central Bank regularly carried out detailed surveys of income and
expenditures, data disaggregated at the district level exist only for 1990 and 1991. Earlier data were collected either at
the national level and disaggregated by rural, urban, and estate households or by large regions comprising several
districts.

monsoon) season. In a good season, farmers grew paddy during this period; otherwise, they grew
other crops on a bethma system.36
4.5    In the eyes of the beneficiaries, however, several factors have diminished the impact of
the rehabilitation, including the lack of beneficiary involvement in project design and
implementation; inadequate attention to downstream work during rehabilitation; a drought in the
late 1 980s; and inadequate maintenance. The lack of beneficiary involvement is the most
important factor. As concerned officials pointed out, the design of the Kurunegala project was
discussed with beneficiaries only after implementation was well under way. For the SRDP, a
preliminary meeting held with beneficiaries prior to project design was followed by a ratification
meeting to explain the scope of the work envisaged. These meetings provided an opportunity for
the farmers to express their concerns, but budget constraints meant that these important issues
could not always be accommodated.
4.6    According to the majority of the farmers interviewed, when the actual implementation
took place, farmers often raised practical issues and concerns that were not adequately addressed.
The overwhelming majority felt that the project had missed an opportunity by not involving
them more in the design, implementation, and oversight of the rehabilitation works. They also
generally felt that, being physically close to the schemes, they could have exercised quality
control over the rehabilitation works, something that had proved difficult for the executing
agencies. Farmers had had conflicts with contractors in more than half the schemes visited,
seriously diminishing the beneficiaries' sense of ownership of the projects. Since the
rehabilitation works were not up to the farmers' expectations, the farmers had made their
commitment conditional on additional "properly executed" rehabilitation that involved
beneficiaries in all phases of the work. The mission found that when additional rehabilitation
works had taken place with assistance from international donors or NGOs, and when farmers had
been associated in all stages of the work, the farmers were maintaining the structures properly. In
a few cases, they had even contributed group funds to the rehabilitation of the schemes.
4.7    Beneficiaries felt positive about the availability of improved seed varieties and the
extension advice, which had assisted farmers in improving crop management practices. Even the
beneficiaries of the SRDP, which did not include a specific extension component, shared this
feeling. Beneficiaries also felt positive about the introduction of early maturing varieties and
some other field crops (OFCs), which had helped to diversify farmers' sources of income.
Incomes from typical paddy and other field crop (OFC) holdings
4.8    The assessment categorized paddy farmers into six types and developed farm models for
each (annex 3, table 8). Household and incremental income derived from cropping activities and
returns to family labor varied according to the crop mix, the size of the farm, and the
agroecological zone (table 4.1). As expected, farmers in Matale who cultivated big onions
enjoyed the highest incomes and returns to labor. The cropping incomes of other farmers ranged
from SL Rs 16,900 (in 1995 prices) for farmers in Kurunegala's dry and semidry zones to SL Rs
5,300 for farmers in Puttalam's major irrigation schemes.
36. The irrigable area changes from yearly owing to variations in the amount of available water. Under the bethma
system, a portion of the irrigable area closest to the embankment is shared among the farms that cultivate plots in the
tank's command area.

4.9    Calculations of the projects' incremental benefits do not take into account the
incremental production of other lowland farm crops except in Matale, because the field
investigation found that the amounts were not significant. Estimates of financial returns at the
household level in all three project areas do include other field crop (OFC) production.
Changes in income sources
4.10   Before the KRDP, agriculture constituted the main source of paddy beneficiaries'
income in Kurunegala (about 65 percent). Paddy accounted for about one-third of total income,
while wage labor and other jobs provided the rest (figure 4.1). In Matale, beneficiaries of the
paddy component relied more heavily on agriculture as their main source of income before the
SRDP was implemented, and in particular on paddy, which accounted for nearly half of their
income. Agriculture also played a prominent role in Puttalam, providing over half of
beneficiaries' preproject income, but other jobs and wage labor were already providing a large
share (43 percent).
4.11       As a result of increased prices for inputs and labor and decreases in the real farm-
gate price of paddy, the share of income from paddy in the overall composition of household
income had decreased in all three districts at project completion-in Kurunegala by 5 percent, in
Matale by 23 percent, and in Puttalam by 2 percent (figure 4.1). Vegetables and OFCs
compensated for the decrease in Matale, where the share of these crops increased by 16 percent.
In Puttalam, the decrease was partly offset by coconut and vegetables, income from which
increased by 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively. In spite of the decrease in paddy, however, it
remains the most important source of income for small farmers in all three districts.

Coconuts and EACs
Views of the beneficiaries
4.12   In general, the beneficiaries looked positively on the coconut and EAC subsidy schemes.
Farmers particularly appreciated the availability of good planting material, especially after the
first few years of project implementation. Like paddy farmers, these beneficiaries acknowledged
the positive role of extension services in their improved management practices. But this positive
outlook has been tarnished somewhat by decreases in farm-gate prices (especially for coconuts)
in recent years, and by the general feeling that farmers with medium-sized and large holdings
benefited the most from these schemes. In addition, most of the beneficiaries of the
underplanting and replanting schemes were convinced that making payments conditional on the
cutting down of old trees was unrealistic, since yields from older trees also increased, because of
the fertilizer being applied to new replacement palms.
4.13   Beneficiaries also felt that the high costs of inputs and labor were preventing them from
continuing with improved management practices. Because of the wide fluctuations in farm-gate
prices, the majority of farmers who had planted EACs felt that the incremental income these
crops provided sometimes did not compensate for the cost of the labor required to harvest them.
The prices of cardamom and cloves had fallen so far that farmers were no longer harvesting
these crops. Most of the beneficiaries, especially those in the home-garden scheme, indicated
that they were participating only because of the subsidy. Had they been given a choice, they
would have preferred different crops. The most frequently heard comment was "why did they not
ask us what we wanted to plant?" These findings point to the need for a more flexible approach
in project design and implementation and for diagnostic studies during project design and
implementation.37
Incomes from typical holdings
4.14        The mission classified coconut holdings in Kurunegala and Puttalam into four
groups based on types of inputs and management styles (table 4.3). The highest incremental
income was realized in households having the largest holdings (the semicommercial and estate
37. The borrower in its comments writes that participation was voluntary, so that there was effectively a choice, and
that the package was based on farmers' preferences as expressed at the time, even if the individual beneficiary thereby
had a limited choice.

models). The incremental income for the smallholders' model, which accounted for nearly 60
percent of the beneficiaries, was also significant.

coconuts, and incremental income due to the project was thus overestimated.

4.15   Farm models were derived from three categories of EACs holdings: smallholder pepper,
smallholder coffee, and semicommercial cocoa, which prevailed in Matale (table 4.4). 38 The
coffee model has the highest returns to family labor and the cocoa semicommercial model the
lowest (owing to the sharp decline in the farm-gate price of cocoa in the last few years).

Changes in income sources
4.16   In Puttalam, agriculture accounted for nearly two-thirds of coconut farmers' preproject
income, while wages and other jobs accounted for the rest (figure 4.2). In spite of the escalating
prices of inputs and labor in the district, the share of income from coconuts, on average,
increased by 10 percent during the project period.39 On the whole, the project had a positive
impact on beneficiaries, contributing to the establishment of more stable and diversified farming
systems. While the farner groups interviewed indicated that before the project period they had
obtained more than 10 percent of their income from shifting cultivation, that practice had
essentially died out because of increasing pressure on land.
3 8. Given the complexity of the farming systems in which EACs are established, it was not possible to estimate the net
incremental income.
39. Comparable data are not available for Kurunegala.



53
4.17   The impact of EACs on family incomes in Matale is evident in the changed share of
crops in household income after the projects (figure 4.3). Prior to the introduction of EACs, the
interviewed beneficiaries of this scheme were deriving nearly 60 percent of their income from
wage labor. Broadly speaking, pepper, coffee, and cocoa-crops that generated no income before
the project-now account for 22 percent of these beneficiaries' income. This is a positive
development since wage labor, which contributed 28 percent to family income before the
projects, diminished to 6 percent afterward. Wage labor is an unstable income source and has an
unfavorable impact on the farming system because farms tend to be neglected when family
members take other jobs. Essentially, the survival strategy of coconut and EAC growers is quite
rational. In view of the escalating costs of inputs and of labor, they use very few inputs, keeping
production costs to the barest minimum even at the risk of decreased yields.
B. Social Infrastructure
4.18   The objective of the social infrastructure component was to improve the living standards
of the rural population in the three districts. Although these components accounted for a
relatively small percentage of total costs (less than a quarter), they provided needed structures
that have raised the quality of life for rural residents. The KRDP, for example, developed 174
miles of roads (120 miles of rural roads, 8 miles of school feeder roads, and 46 miles of tank
feeder roads), compared with the appraisal estimate of 130; constructed 400 shallow wells (200
tubewells dug for groundwater exploration were converted into drinking water wells); provided
educational facilities and equipment; built staff quarters and offices; provided electricity for 4
existing health facilities; and implemented 13 rural electrification schemes.
4.19   Roads were the third-largest component in the SRDP, accounting for 13 percent of total
project costs, with targets of 144 miles of feeder roads, 175 miles of rural roads, and 7 miles of
new roads. Achievements exceeded targets: 147 miles of feeder roads were upgraded (122 in
Matale and 25 in Puttalam), 229 miles of access roads improved (85 in Matale and 144 in
Puttalam), and 28 miles of fishery roads built or upgraded (in Puttalam). In addition, the project
provided funds to Matale's Road Development Authority and local government to maintain 325
miles of feeder roads.40 In Matale, 100 tubewells were constructed and fitted with hand pumps.
In Puttalam, 150 dug wells fitted with hand pumps were constructed, three water supply schemes
implemented, and 92 of the test wells converted into tubewells.

Roads have provided rural residents with new opportunities
4.20    The beneficiaries had a positive perception of the rehabilitation and construction of
roads, which they said raised their standard of living in two important ways:
*   First, the new and repaired roads improved the flow of supplies and services by
allowing buses and trucks more and easier freedom of movement. As agricultural
inputs and consumer goods reached remote villages, small shops opened (an average of
two per village), providing new sources of employment. The buses and trucks provided
farmers with easy access to markets for agricultural produce, a particularly important



55
development in Matale and Puttalam, where some areas roads had been without roads
altogether. 41
* Second, buses and other vehicles began using the newly improved roads, facilitating
access to towns and increasing employment opportunities. The villagers interviewed
(especially women) said that the new access roads, especially in remote areas, allowed
prospective employers to reach villages with offers of employment elsewhere, even in
other parts of the world, such as the Middle East. The roads also facilitated access to
educational and health services, especially in areas where access roads replaced
footpaths.
4.21    Despite these positive achievements, however, this component suffered from several
constraints, especially under the SRDP: shoddy construction and rehabilitation (the result of
inadequate supervision), shortages of construction material, and procurement delays. The
deterioration of the security situation in the later years of the SRDP's implementation
contributed to the problems with supervision by preventing contractors and supervisors from
accessing project sites. In all three districts, insufficient attention to surface drainage, including
lead and tail channels of cross-drainage structures, has resulted in silted side drains and runnels
in road platforms that cause serious overflows during the rainy seasons. Funding shortages have
severely restricted routine maintenance, contributing to the ongoing degradation.42 The problem
is worst in Matale, where about half of the roads inspected have been poorly maintained and
inadequate investigations of subgrade soils and design deficiencies have made some roads
unusable.43 At impact evaluation, roughly 40 percent of the carriageway and 30 percent of the
platforms of the roads inspected in Matale were in poor condition.44
Improved water supply means healthier children
4.22    Most beneficiaries interviewed had a very positive view of the improved access to clean
water. Prior to the projects, most villages were two to three miles from the nearest water source;
the intervention generally reduced that distance to one mile or less, reducing the time spent
fetching the water and allowing people to use more. The quality of water also improved,
especially in the first few years after the new wells and pipes were installed. Villagers
emphasized that the number of children affected by diarrhea had decreased considerably since
the implementation of the water supply schemes. In addition to providing wells, the SRDP in
Puttalam constructed three rural water supply schemes that also improved the quantity and
quality of available water and improved overall health.
4.23    Despite these benefits, many of the wells constructed under the project deteriorated after
project completion and required extensive renovation. Although caretakers had been appointed,
41. Beneficiaries particularly noted the construction of the bridge across the Lunu Oya on the Thoduwawa-Iranwila road,
and of the Kahalpityia road, both in Puttalam; both considerably improved the marketing of fish, which had been severely
constrained. The latter road had a secondary impact not foreseen at appraisal: by allowing the free flow of inputs and
outputs, it facilitated the cultivation of red onions, which the DOA had introduced to the area independently of the project.
42. The Road Development Authority and the Provincial Engineering Department maintain all feeder roads, and the
Department of Local Government has responsibility for local roads.
43. Y.K. Murthy, Achievements and Major Problems in SRDP, April 1991.
44. Altogether 22 roads were inspected at impact evaluation: 6 in Kurunegala, 8 in Matale, and 8 in Puttalam.



56
funds for maintenance were not available. The high concentration of iron and CO2 in the water,
plus the low pH, caused corrosion in the galvanized iron casings and iron parts of the hand
pumps that in turn contaminated water in wells built under the two projects. Reportedly, some
villagers abandoned the tubewells altogether and removed the concrete covers of the shallow
wells.45 In all three districts, the situation has been remedied through projects funded by other
sources. In Kurunegala, wells were rehabilitated with UNICEF and the German donor agency
GTZ funding, and 255 water user groups were promoted. In Matale, most of the wells were
handed over to DANIDA (Denmark) for remedial measures. In Puttalam, GTZ financed the
replacement of pipes in 133 wells, promoted water user groups, and trained committee members.
The quality of the water on balance was average, although it was still reportedly poor in roughly
20 percent of the wells visited.
Educationalfacilities
4.24   Under the KRDP, this component aimed to improve the quality of education, strengthen
facilities for vocational and technical education, improve the utilization of smaller outlying
schools, and reduce intradistrict disparities in educational opportunities. The project would
provide science and craft training equipment, construct living quarters for teachers and science
laboratories, and expand seven secondary schools. The SRDP's component was designed to
improve science, agriculture, and technical training in the public school system; to attract more
qualified teachers to remote areas; and to upgrade selected senior secondary schools. The actual
achievements included facilities and improvements not envisaged at appraisal (a woodworking
training center and the renovation of existing weaving centers, for instance).446
4.25    Since the projects provided equipment and labs to existing schools, it was difficult, after
so many years, to elicit the views of beneficiaries. Students who may have benefited from this
intervention were difficult to trace and their parents no longer remembered it.47 Selected
indicators point to a general improvement in the overall educational situation in the three
districts. For example, dropout rates decreased in Puttalam, and to a lesser degree in Kurunegala,
much faster than in the country as a whole (annex 3, table 9).
4.26   Many of the educational facilities improved under the projects were secondary schools
(annex 3, table 10). Between 1987 and 1991, the number of secondary school pupils increased
proportionately more in the three project districts, especially in Puttalam, than it did nationwide,
despite the dramatic increases across the country.48 These positive changes cannot be attributed
to the projects alone, but the projects almost certainly had some influence.
4.27   In areas where new facilities had been established, the mission team was better able to
elicit beneficiaries' perceptions. Trainees of the vocational carpentry center in Matale, for
example, felt that the skills they were acquiring would improve their employment opportunities,
even though they were aware that only 50 percent of former trainees had found better jobs.49

They felt that, given the general youth unemployment situation prevailing in the country, such
facilities are essential and that the needs of unemployed youths should be addressed through
skills training and accompanying measures to help them find work in the small enterprise sector.
In addition, they felt that vocational training was benefiting the poor, most of whom cannot
afford secondary education.
4.28   Although the component exceeded physical targets, standards were not very high. While
the supplies (mostly equipment for the science laboratories) were a useful contribution to several
schools, survey reports point out that some educational facilities, especially in remote areas,
were not used during the project period because of a shortage of science teachers.50 The results
under the SRDP were similar to those under the KRDP: construction standards were not very
high, some teachers' quarters (especially those in remote areas) were not utilized, and some
schools did not have science teachers to teach in the labs and workshops the project provided.
According to the Educational Census, as late as 1986 Puttalam had only 19 science teachers-
both qualified and unqualified-and Matale 72. Several of the quarters and many labs have not
been properly maintained owing to lack of funds. But after initial difficulties owing to the
shortage of qualified teachers, the much-needed vocational training centers built in Matale
appear to be functioning well.
Health Facilities
4.29   Both projects upgraded existing facilities, created new maternity wards and health
centers in rural areas, and provided residential quarters to house doctors and nurse-midwives,
who had not been available before. The rural health centers in general and the maternity wards in
particular contributed to the overall increase in beneficiaries' health.
4.30   Indeed, secondary health data indicate an overall improvement in the general health of
the population at large (see annex 3, tables 11-12). But nutritional surveys of children carried out
in 1980-82 and 1988-89 over 22 districts indicate that the incidence of wasting (low weight for
height) in the intervening years had remained stationary in Puttalam, increased slightly in
Kurunegala against a 4.5 percent increase countrywide, and increased a disturbing 15 percent in
Matale (annex 3, table 13). Further, the incidence of stunting (low height for age) remained
unchanged for the three districts as well as for the country as a whole.
Rural electrification has helped create new enterprises
4.31   Under the project, 17 rural electrification schemes were established (4 involving
hospitals) in Kurunegala. The number of customers served in 1994 exceeded targets (1,530
domestic and 393 commercial connections), reaching 4,400 and 742, respectively, because of
high demand and expanded capacity (table 4.8). Although only 10 rural electrification schemes
were initially planned under the SRDP, 80 were built, 10 in Matale and 70 in Puttalam. The
number of domestic consumers in Matale also exceeded the targets set (1,280 domestic and 195
commercial consumers); in 1994, the component made some 1,850 domestic and 330
50. KRDP, "A Survey of the Facilities Supplied Under the Education Component of the Project," Project Office, pp.
6-7 (undated).

commercial connections. Also in Puttalam, domestic private connections climbed above the
target of 2,240, while commercial connections reached 641 (the target was 226).51
4.32   Because private connections are expensive in Sri Lanka, most domestic connections are
limited to residents of dwellings contiguous to commercial buildings served by the schemes.52
Electricity schemes have contributed to the emergence of many small-scale industries, such as
paddy mills and welding shops, and a few medium-sized enterprises, including timber sawing
and coir mills, that have created employment in rural areas. Some existing enterprises have
improved their performance by obtaining electricity, but more new ones have emerged with the
introduction of electricity.

C. Employment Generation
4.33   This study was able to give only limited consideration to the issue of how many jobs the
projects generated. In general, the types of jobs can be categorized as follows: (a) wage labor
generated by the construction and rehabilitation of all physical infrastructure under the project;
(b) incremental labor due to improvements and changes in farming practices; and (c) direct and
indirect employment generated by project activities such as rural electrification and by increased
economic activity from multiplier effects.
4.34   The mission estimated the amounts of wage labor generated by irrigation rehabilitation
work, which constituted the largest item in both projects. These were as follows: roughly 1.1
million person-days of wage labor in Kurunegala, 445,000 in Matale, and 957,000 in Puttalam
(annex 2, table 6). Incremental labor was calculated on the basis of the incremental areas for
each crop, but such calculations assumed that beneficiaries were unemployed before the project.
Data from changes in income sources show that farmers were in fact engaged in a host of off-
farm activities; in some instances, they may have switched activities as a result of the projects,
while in others there could be genuine incremental employment.
4.35   The mission's field investigations indicated that each rural electrification scheme
generated about 20 additional jobs; on that basis, about 280 new jobs were generated in
Kurunegala, 200 in Matale, and 1,400 in Puttalam as a result of the rural electrification
components. Existing enterprises also increased their business volume and revenues from 10

percent to 15 percent as a result of rural electrification. The indirect employment generated by
the multiplier effect could not be estimated.
D. Equity Issues
4.36   At anticipated it was anticipated that the KRDP would benefit primarily small farmers
working no more than 3 acres and living on incomes of less than US$50. Social infrastructure
projects would be implemented in those areas of the districts most in need, reducing intradistrict
disparities. The SRDP was expected to serve the same proportion of small farmers (two-thirds of
beneficiaries), but these would be working up to only 2 acres and would have incomes below
US$75 per annum. Both appraisals noted that in view of the prevailing tenure pattem, only about
one-third of the projects' direct benefits were expected to accrue to the target group.
Profile of Beneficiaries
4.37   Information on the holdings of beneficiaries of the irrigation component is inconsistent.
According to the project offices, more than 60 percent of the beneficiaries had holdings of 1 acre
or less, and the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI) suggests that about 70 percent
of the beneficiaries of this component in Kurunegala had holdings of less than 0.5 acres.
However, these figures apply only to ownership in one rehabilitated tank. Most respondents
operated plots in several schemes in the cascade system, and, according to the mission sample,
when these additional plots are taken into account, the size of beneficiaries' holdings changes
considerably.J3 The proportion of beneficiaries in Kurunegala with holdings of 3 acres or more
rises from 20 percent when ownership in only one rehabilitated tank is considered to 42 percent
when ownership is calculated for holdings in the whole system. Corresponding figures for
Matale are 19 percent and 39 percent, respectively; for Puttalam, 25 percent and 40 percent.
Although most of the beneficiaries of the irrigation component were smallholders, the proportion
of relatively better-off beneficiaries was larger than anticipated at appraisal.
4.38   According to field data, 44 percent of the beneficiaries of the coconut subsidy schemes
in the KRDP had holdings of 3 acres or more.54 Similarly, in Puttalam, although the average size
of beneficiaries' holdings was 2.9 acres, the average holding size of those who benefited from
the rehabilitation scheme (49 percent of all beneficiaries) was 4.2 acres.55 Detailed secondary
data obtained by the mission for one division in this district corroborated this information: 48
percent of the 90 beneficiaries in that division had holdings of 5 acres or more.
4.39   Most of the subsidy schemes for EACs seem to have benefited smallholders, since the
average size of the holdings under most of these schemes was between 1 and 2 acres. Only the
cocoa subsidy scheme seems to have benefited semicommercial farmers with holdings of more
than 3 acres.
53. Farmers reported operating plots in up to five different tank systems.
54. ARTI's postproject evaluation indicates that 50 percent of the beneficiaries of the replanting/underplanting scheme
were operating holdings of more 3 acres. ARTI, p.75.
55. Average holding size for the district in 1982 was 2.4 acres.



60
4.40   The socioeconomic profile of loan beneficiaries under the credit schemes was similar in
the two projects. Beneficiaries of loans for the cultivation of paddy and OFCs were generally
smallholders with holdings of between 1 and 3 acres (40-50 percent), and most loans for inputs
for coconut development went to beneficiaries with holdings of 5 acres or more (nearly 80
percent). Loans for two-wheel tractors benefited primarily middle-income farmers with more
than 5 acres of cultivated land. Loans for four-wheel tractors were generally given to farmers
engaged in activities other than farming, such as commerce or transport, who were considered
wealthy by local standards. The majority of poor smallholders did not benefit from the credit
schemes, although some of them may have benefited indirectly from the increased availability of
tractors in the area.
E. The Projects' Effect on Regional Disparities
4.41   Irrigation. In selecting minor schemes to be rehabilitated, both projects emphasized
serving the dry and semidry zones, which were widely recognized as being the poorest. Matale
had the largest proportion of tanks rehabilitated in these zones (68 percent), Puttalam the next
largest (61 percent), and Kurunegala the smallest (58 percent). In Kurunegala, the same number
of major schemes was rehabilitated of the dry and semidry zones, but slightly more total area
was rehabilitated in the semidry zone (55 percent). All the major schemes rehabilitated in Matale
under the SRDP were in the dry and semidry zones; in Puttalam, 79 percent of the schemes
rehabilitated (accounting for 74 percent of total rehabilitated area) were in the dry and semidry
zones.
4.42   Infrastructure. Most of the roads rehabilitated under the KRDP were also located in the
dry and semidry zones and may therefore have contributed to a decrease in intraregional
disparities. Rural electrification schemes provided a counterbalance, since all but two of them
were sited in the wet and semiwet zones. In Matale, the majority of the rural roads rehabilitated
were in the wet and semiwet areas, but the rehabilitated feeder roads were spread almost equally
across all zones. Similarly, the rural electrification schemes were roughly proportionally sited in
all zones. In Puttalam, however, the majority of the rehabilitated roads and rural electrification
schemes were in the comparatively better-off southern part of the district. In view of these facts,
the projects' contribution to decreasing regional disparities may have been larger in Matale than
in the other two districts.

5.    Sustainability
5.1    This chapter presents the evaluation team's findings on the sustainability of the
agricultural components of the projects, particularly the rehabilitated irrigation systems. Because
the sustainability of these systems depends largely on the quality of the O&M, the analysis
examines the issues surrounding O&M during and after the projects. Key to this discussion are
local water user groups and farmer organizations (FOs), which, although not actively supported
during the project cycle, have since become effective on the grassroots level in some schemes.
Finally, the chapter briefly discusses the sustainability of other project activities related to
agriculture.
A. Current Status of the Project Irrigation Schemes
5.2   In general, the evaluation found that the rehabilitated headworks and downstream works
had deteriorated significantly. The mission evaluated 34 schemes-14 in Kurunegala, 8 in
Matale, and 12 in Puttalam-using technical evaluations and interviews with beneficiaries
(table 5.1).

Note: The following scores were used: good = 2; average = 1; poor = 0.
Source: Mission field data.
5.3    Several factors account for the physical deterioration of the structures:
inadequate maintenance;
insufficient hydrological data for estimating flood discharge, especially for
minor schemes;
shortfalls in the studies, especially for minor schemes, with respect to both
headworks (tank capacity, spill, approaches and tail canals, and foundations in



62
diversion schemes) and downstream works (improvements and placement of
canals and farm turn-outs);
*      a dearth of experienced contractors;56
*       inadequate quality control by the implementing agency during construction, in
part because of the KRDP's extremely ambitious targets and in part because the
minor schemes in both projects were remote and widely scattered;57
*      the absence of an institutional mechanism during design and implementation to
express farmers' needs; and
*      for the KRDP, price inflation that made the sum allocated per acre insufficient to
carry out the rehabilitation work according to specifications. 58
5.4     The findings of the technical evaluation showed that, with the exception of Puttalam, the
overall physical status of major schemes was better than that of minor schemes; that the
structures in the minor schemes had deteriorated quickly; and that, in the minor schemes, the
downstream works were in far worse condition than the headworks. Three factors in particular
may account for the better physical status of major schemes: the comparatively higher standards
of the rehabilitation work, which was more closely supervised; regular (albeit limited)
maintenance; and the fact that additional rehabilitation and/or improvement works were carried
out after the projects were closed.
5.5    Many of the minor schemes are part of a cascade system comprising three to six small
tanks. Sometimes the water distributed from a rehabilitated tank in the system reaches the
command area of an adjoining one, adversely affecting the water balance in some plots and often
causing occasional or semipermanent flooding that has caused landowners to take negative
remedial actions, such as attempting to close off channels.
5.6    During field visits, mission staff elicited the beneficiaries' assessment of the quality of
the rehabilitation work, using focused group discussions that included drawing visuals such as
maps. In all cases, the mission team recorded the group's assessment of each item only after the
group had reached agreement. Findings from these focus groups were also synthesized at the
district level (table 5.2). In general, farmers in the groups agreed with the results of the technical
evaluation concerning the quality of the rehabilitation work, except that the farmers were
concerned primarily with the schemes closest to their own fields. In minor schemes, downstream
work received the poorest rating, especially the siting and number of farm turnouts (a problem
that could have been reduced if more farmers had been involved in the design process). Of the
headwork in minor schemes, the rehabilitation of bunds was judged to be the poorest. In major
schemes, the rehabilitation of headworks received a better rating (all but the schemes in Puttalam
received average to good ratings). The rehabilitation of secondary canals, however, did not fare
as well: half of the rehabilitated schemes in all three districts were rated as poor.

Engineering Works, World Bank, 1991, p. 10.
57. Murphy, 1991, and farmers interviewed by the impact evaluation team.
58. Although this sum was revised upward in the course of project implementation, the increase was insufficient to
cover the higher costs. Price contingency provisions made at appraisal proved inadequate to cover the increases in prices.

5.7    All 11 major schemes rehabilitated under the KRDP and 12 of the 15 schemes
rehabilitated under the SRDP in Puttalam have been the object of further rehabilitation or
improvement under the Asian Development Bank-financed Water Resources Development
Project (WRDP) or the IDA-financed National Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (NIRP).59 Of the
minor schemes, some 10 percent of those visited in Kurunegala, 33 percent of those in Matale,
and 10 percent of those in Puttalam had been rehabilitated again in the years after the project
ended, with the assistance of other donors (such as the World Food Program) or NGOs. As of the
end of 1995, 66 (or 16 percent) of the all the minor schemes rehabilitated under the KRDP and
10 percent of those rehabilitated under the SRDP (including those the evaluation team did not
visit) had been or were slated to be rehabilitated again. The Irrigation Department (ID) staff cited
two reasons further rehabilitation had been required. First, the initial ceiling on rehabilitation
costs per acre had been too low, and therefore additional funding sources had to be found to
complete the rehabilitation to satisfactory standards. Second, maintenance funds have simply
been inadequate. The minimum cost of maintaining major irrigation systems is currently
estimated at SL Rs 600/acre per year; in 1995, the average per-acre provision for O&M was SL
Rs 174.60
5.8    This finding is by no means unique to the KRDP and SRDP. Of 200 projects evaluated
for a World Bank review of experience with irrigation, 50 percent were wholly or partially
concerned with financing rehabilitation made necessary largely by inadequate maintenance.  In
areas where the state takes a role in irrigation and the users are not solely responsible for
maintaining a system, there is usually resistance to paying for services, especially if users can
59. While the number of schemes rehabilitated by ongoing projects such as the WRDP and the NIRP is documented,
no reliable information is available on the number of schemes re-rehabilitated with the support of nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), even though both international and local nongovernmental organizations are actively involved
in this work in the project areas.

claim that the system performs poorly. If funding (especially external concessional funding) is
available, the incentive is to limit maintenance and then rehabilitate.
Operation and Maintenance
5.9    The appraisal reports for both projects identified poor management practices, insufficient
control of water allocation, improper operation of head and downstream structures, and the large
amount of water wasted as major constraints to irrigation improvement. Although the reports
stressed the need for better water management practices, they did not give any details of how the
improvements were to be made, offered no strategy for allocating water in seasons of low
rainfall, and failed to provide an institutional mechanism for involving beneficiaries in O&M, a
shortcoming that was of particular significance for the minor schemes.
5.10   For major schemes, considerable improvements in seasonal water availability had been
anticipated. The records of the ID on discharge measurement are scanty but suggest that
improvements did occur in all three districts. (No records were kept for minor schemes.) For
evaluative purposes, qualitative indicators were used to gauge O&M. Patterns of water
distribution and the adoption or existence of a water plan were used as proxies for good water
management. Maintenance was jointly assessed by technically competent mission members and
farmers, who judged its quality during transect walks (table 5.3).62

5.11   Water management in major schemes was found to be considerably better than it was in
minor schemes, quite possibly because all the major schemes visited were involved in the ID's
Integrated Management of Major Agricultural Schemes (INMAS) or Management of Irrigation
System (MANIS) programs (box 5.1). These government-sponsored programs provided
additional inputs aimed at improving O&M. In the minor schemes, the quality of maintenance
was poor. In the years after the projects were implemented, beneficiaries had been given
62. Frequency of maintenance was not found a good indicator as, in nearly all schemes visited, maintenance was

responsibility for maintenance, but several factors proved difficult to overcome: discontent with
the rehabilitation work itself, the lack of a sense of ownership stemming from the original
projects' failure to include beneficiaries in planning and implementation, and the absence of
motivated grassroots institutions. Although several of the schemes had adopted rotational water
allocation (as opposed to traditional continuous flow) during or after the project, very few had a
water plan. Most farmers felt that it was government's responsibility to repair deteriorated
schemes, since, in their view, the initial rehabilitation work had been substandard.
5.12   In general, the poor maintenance of these schemes can be attributed to two factors:
institutional difficulties and limitations in project design and implementation.
5.13   Institutional dificulties. The ID and the Department of Agrarian Services (DAS) share
responsibility for irrigation in Sri Lanka. Construction and rehabilitation of all but the smallest
tanks, water management, and O&M of the major schemes are the responsibility of the ID.
Because water management and O&M of minor schemes were the responsibility of DAS until
1989, all minor schemes were to be handed over to DAS for O&M after rehabilitation had been
completed.63 But the DAS lacked the technical expertise as well as the implementation capacity
Box 5.1: A Farmers' Organization Promoted under INMAS (Hakcwatuna Oya Major Irrigation
Scheme)
Before INMAS. In this major scheme in Kurunegala, the Water Management Division of the ID
made a first attempt at involving users in water management. The department aimed to improve the
conveyance system, as well as to introduce a rotational water distribution system. The ID employed
institutional organizers to help farmers form water users' groups at the level of field and distributary
channels.
During INMAS. The division made a second attempt to involve farmers in 1989-90. In principle,
farmers were organized into water committees under a part-time project manager from the ID.
After INMAS. The division made a third (and more concerted) effort to systematize farmer
participation through management committees that were given responsibility for distributing water through
INMAS (see annex 1). Headed by a part-time project manager, the management committees consisted of
field officers of line departments-technical officers from the ID, agricultural officers from the DOA, and
divisional officers from the DAS. The initial goal of collecting water taxes was abandoned.
INMAS has promoted FOs at the primary (turnout), secondary (distributary channel or subproject
committee) and tertiary (project committee) levels to oversee water distribution and maintain the system.
These groups elect representatives to the management committees. Presently, 6 farmer representatives sit
on 13 distribution channel committees. They are involved in the decisionmaking process for water
distribution and canal maintenance and in programming production. Gates at the tertiary and secondary
levels are opened by a caretaker paid by the ID, and a rotational water distribution system exists. The FOs
seem enthusiastic about the concept of shared management but feel they need further training in O&M.
63. Since 1990, maintenance of minor schemes has been the responsibility of the Provincial Engineering Department;
however, DAS has retained responsibility for water management and some maintenance.

to carry out O&M in the early years of pro'ect implementation and often required repairs or
supplementary works prior to the transfer. 4 The DAS was also reluctant to assume responsibility
for tanks that were not in good condition, a problem that proved especially severe in Kurunegala.
Moreover, the original implementation program for the KRDP did not include provisions for
downstream development, an omission that was eventually rectified in 1983 but that caused
additional delays in handing over the rehabilitated schemes to DAS. By 1983, only 28 percent of
the rehabilitated tanks under the KRDP had been handed over, although the situation improved
considerably later on with the start-up of downstream works and the strengthening of DAS
technical cadres. But at the end of the disbursement period, only 58 percent of the rehabilitated
tanks had been transferred to the DAS.65 Similar delays in transferring the minor schemes
occurred in both Matale and Puttalam but were eased by several factors, primarily a longer
implementation period and pragmatic responses to the lessons learned from the KRDP.
5.14    Limitations in project design and implementation. The unrealistic model of water
management envisaged at appraisal for the KRDP and the lack of beneficiary involvement in the
planning and implementation of rehabilitation work were the major problems. These design
limitations could have been overcome during project implementation had there been enough
flexibility in the project or interest in the issue.66
5.15    The model for water management to be applied under the KRDP was based on
information for only one tank (Walagambahuwa) located in the relatively humid part of the dry
zone. This model called for early dry sowing in the Maha (fall monsoon) season of early
maturing varieties of paddy, with minimum water from the tank issued on a rotational basis as
supplementary irrigation. The water saved in Maha would allow for a second crop of paddy or
other field crops in Yala. Although the information was relatively complete, the model was in
reality inappropriate and was not adopted for a number of reasons: a) the risk of crop failure
associated with dry seeding in areas of erratic rainfall (in such conditions, farmers delay sowing
until tanks have sufficient water stored);67 b) the rather favorable characteristics of the
Walagambahuwa tank (a large catchment, a small command area, and room to store water at
about 10 acre ft./acre of cultivated area) were not representative of most of the tanks to be
rehabilitated; and c) the lack of awareness of farmers and implementors of the requirements of
68
the model.
64. DAS was entrusted with O&M only in 1978. The problem of repairs and additional works plagued most
rehabilitation projects for minor schemes until recently.
65. DAS: Taking Over the Tanks from the Inigation Department, Kurunegala, 1985, p. 1.
66. The Matara Rural Development Project, patterned after the KRDP, changed its design features in the course of project
implementation to allow for beneficiary participation.
67. Field observations confirmed that although the majority of the farmers had adopted early maturing crop varieties, the
cropping calendar was not advanced to any significant extent and dry seeding was not practiced, findings that confirm
those of an earlier evaluation carried out by ARTI (ARTI, Evaluation of the Irrigation and Water Management Component,
Research Study No. 74, 1986).
68. A study undertaken by the International Irrigation Management Insatiate (IIMI) notes that improving irrigation
management requires not only an organizational structure but also an operational plan and a clearly identified rotation
schedule that gives farmer groups a clear role and responds to farmers' needs. See Ekanayoke and Groenfeldt ,1990,

5.16   In keeping with development thinking at the time of their conception, the KRDP and
SRDP did not seek to strengthen grassroots farmers' organizations (FOs). As has been noted, the
projects did not involve beneficiaries in design and implementation and made no provision for
introducing much-needed improvements in O&M practices. The lack of effective encouragement
for grassroots organizations, particularly in the areas of irrigation and water supply, is now seen
as posing a key risk to the sustainability of project assets, especially in combination with the
poor condition of many schemes and the absence of water charges for both major and minor
schemes. Without the funds such charges would bring in, O&M must be financed entirely from
scarce and fluctuating budgetary allocations for repairs and maintenance.
The Role of Farmers' Organizations
5.17   Today, the scarcity of government funds means that user groups need to play the leading
role in O&M. Yet the mission found that only one-fourth of the major and one-fifth of the minor
irrigation schemes visited were benefiting from the involvement of effective FOs. Since the
thinking on this issue has changed significantly since the projects' inception, a brief review of
overall irrigation policy and the enabling legislation is provided here.69
5.18   Traditionally, water management and O&M for irrigation schemes in Sri Lanka have
been the responsibility of farmers, who select an overseer (Vel Vidane, generally an owner-
cultivator and often a respected traditional leader) to supervise water management, assign routine
maintenance and minor repair tasks, and resolve conflicts. He was generally paid in kind for
services rendered. Govemment support was confined largely to arranging precultivation
meetings that revolved around the resolution of water disputes and undertaking major repairs.
5.19   Since the 1 960s, however, increased government intervention and changes in agency
responsibility have eroded the traditional system without replacing it with an effective
alternative. Greater administrative intervention has not been associated with any significant
increase in funding. By and large, physical facilities have deteriorated. In major irrigation
schemes, the government recognized that the schemes were deteriorating and, in 1984,
introduced water charges to pay for O&M.70 Fees were collected (with some difficulty) until
1987, when civil strife and political unrest forced the government to eliminate the charges.
Meanwhile, the INMAS program, which sought to foster joint management by the government
and local farmers, was introduced on a pilot basis in 25 major schemes. INMAS promoted FOs,
whose members assumed responsibility for the O&M of distributary and field channels, while
staff paid by the newly created Irrigation Management Division took care of the rest of the
system. Programs similar to INMAS have since been introduced in other major irrigation
,schemes with various degrees of success.71
5.20   For minor schemes, tank committees were set up by the DAS. Headed by a DAS
cultivation officer, these committees comprised an agricultural instructor from the DOA, a
technical assistant from the ID, a divisional officer, and a few farmers selected by DAS. But
because farmers viewed these committees as imposed from the outside, few became functional
and most were short-lived. The traditional system continued to erode in the absence of an

effective altemative. Thus, there was no effective institutional mechanism for channeling
farmers' views during the KRDP and SRDP. Early in the SRDP (see chapter 4) and at a later
stage in the KRDP, farmers were invited to comment on project design, but the evaluation
mission's field work brought out very clearly the fact that these meetings were insufficient to
foster a sense of ownership of the rehabilitation work among the beneficiaries.
5.21   The need for a more participatory approach to irrigation management was officially
addressed in the 1991 amendment to the Agrarian Service Act, which granted FOs legal
recognition. Although this initiative was extremely important, it provided neither a strategy nor
guidelines for the DAS to follow in promoting FOs. The challenge now is to facilitate and
institutionalize a process through which farmers can create responsive local organizations. But as
one analyst has noted, "More often than not, this is hardly found in state-sponsored organizing
processes. In general, FOs are formed by field officials, not to fulfill farmer needs, but merely to
follow orders or guidelines from above. The learning process of institutional building needs to be
institutionalized. 72
5.22   FOs in major schemes today. Among major schemes in the KRDP, 25 percent of the FOs
were rated as fully effective, 50 percent as average, and 25 percent as poor. All of the FOs in
major SRDP schemes were rated as average. The evaluation team attributes this somewhat
improved situation largely to the nationwide programs started during the 1980s to promote FOs
rather than to the KRDP and SRDP. Concerted and sustained efforts are needed to make FOs
viable and functional, especially when such initiatives come from outside local areas (box 5.1).
5.23   FOs in minor schemes today. In Kurunegala, the evaluation mission found that among
the minor irrigation schemes rehabilitated, only 20 percent had fully effective FOs. Some 20
percent had what were described as "average" FOs, and the rest had poor organizations or none
at all.73 In Matale, 17 percent of the FOs were rated as fully effective, 19 percent as average, and
the rest as poor. In Puttalam, 10 percent were rated as fully effective, 20 percent as average, and
the rest as poor (box 5.2).
5.24   The overall irrigation policy and enabling legislation prevailing during project
implementation clearly did not encourage the promotion of strong FOs in minor schemes. More
careful project design and/or bold steps during the implementation of the KRDP and SRDP
might have offset these inadequacies, but the lack of beneficiary involvement precluded this
possibility. The top-down approach of both projects and their overambitious physical targets
contributed to the farmers' lack of commitment to maintenance.
5.25   All the strong FOs the evaluation team encountered had evolved as a result of the
farmers' own initiatives (box 5.3).
72. C.M. Wijayaratna, "Sustainability of Farmers' Organizations," in Economic Review, Special Issue, From Bureaucracy
to People, Vol. 20, No. 6, Colombo, September 1994, pp. 25-28.
73. Indicators used to evaluate the status of the FOs were the frequency of and attendance at meetings, the existence and
utilization of a group fund for O&M as a proxy for commitment by the FO, and an assessment of the FO by its own
members.

Box 5.2: Farmer Organizations for Irrigation Management: The Most Common Situation
(Mahagalkadawala Tank)
Before the project. Prior to the KRDP, a traditional Vel Vidane attended to O&M matters
in this minor scheme in Kurunegala.
During the project. Rehabilitation started in 1979, and in 1980 the DAS initiated a
cultivation committee comprising a cultivation officer from the DAS, an agricultural instructor
from the DOA, a technical assistant from the ID, a divisional officer, and selected farmer
representatives who appointed a water manager. The manager was paid an in-kind salary for
opening the gates and attending to water management. Farmers regarded this committee as a
government creation.
After the project. In 1991, the post of cultivation officer was abolished, and since the
cultivation committee had depended on this officer, it lapsed soon afterwards. In 1992 the water
manager left his post, reportedly because farmers were no longer paying his salary. Currently,
water is issued by a farmer selected just to open and close the gates. There is no water
management system, water flows continuously, and farmers take as much water as they need
when they wish.
Water Supply
5.26   Water supply was the component in both the KRDP and SRDP that could have benefited
most from the involvement of FOs in planning and implementation. In practice, caretakers were
selected and given limited training in maintaining water pumps, but the project made no attempt
to nurture a sense of community responsibility. This approach did not prove effective, especially
in view of the corrosion of the casings and tubes because of lack of maintenance.
5.27   Subsequent projects (funded by GTZ and UNICEF in Kurunegala and Puttalam and by
DANIDA in Matale) have promoted and trained water users' associations (in addition to
replacing the corroded parts of the pumps). The local and central authorities' recognition of the
need for farmer participation and the steps that have been taken to involve other fuinding
agencies are evidence of the government's concern for maintaining and improving the
investments made under the projects.
B. Crop Production
5.28   The sustainability of the improvements in productivity resulting from the two projects
depends on the continued use of improved crop management practices. The practices of paddy
farmers are, broadly speaking, sustainable within the limits of existing technology, even though
farmers have increased the use of herbicides to overcome peak labor shortages.



70
Box 5.3: An Effective, Self-Initiated Farmers' Organization (Bayawa Farmer
Organization)
Before the project. Before 1970, water management and maintenance decisions in this
minor scheme in Kurunegala had been made by the Vel Vidane and implemented by farmers. In
the 1 970s, the DAS set up a cultivation committee comprising a cultivation officer from the
DAS, an agricultural instructor from the DOA, a technical assistant from the ID, a divisional
officer, and farmers selected by the DAS. The committee held cultivation (kanna) meetings and
made decisions on water distribution and maintenance. Farmers regarded this committee as a
government creation, and while field-to-field water distribution was reported, farmers paid little
attention to maintenance.
During the project. The cultivation committee changed composition under the project.
Farmer representatives were elected, but the cultivation officer played the key role in initiating
kanna meetings and making decisions. Contractors who did not interact with farmers did most of
the project rehabilitation work, and although the farmers complained about faulty construction,
the contractors paid no attention. Farm turnouts were inadequate and so narrow that a mammotty
could not be used to clean them. Water was insufficient, so that the tail end of the channels did
not receive adequate water. The farmers were unhappy with the water distribution system, since
the cultivation committee decided how the water should be allocated and the DAS-selected
farmer representatives implemented the committee's decision. The restructured committee was
again perceived as emanating from outside.
After the project. In 1990, the DAS promoted a new farmers' organization. Monthly
meetings were held, but they were not effective because the FO was once again initiated from the
outside. The farmer representatives implemented the FO's water management decisions, and
farmers performed O&M.
In 1994, farmers revitalized the FO on their own initiative. Membership fees of SL Rs 5
per person were collected; a group fund was established and a bank account opened. The group
fund is used to maintain and make minor repairs to structures and to pay the water manager (SL
Rs 1,000 per harvesting season). Reportedly, SL Rs 3,700 from the group fund was used to repair
sluice gates. The FO prepared plans for water distribution, and therefore no conflicts have arisen.
Monthly and kanna meetings are well attended. Farmer representatives, namely the chairman of
the FO and the Vel Vidane, participated in a DAS-sponsored one-day training program on
fertilizer use, new paddy varieties, water management, and field crops other than paddy.
This arrangement appears to be an effective way of ensuring that water is distributed
fairly. Channels are maintained and water is regulated head to tail, although the tail ends do not
yet have adequate water. Currently, water is issued at ten-day intervals for three days at a stretch.
5.29   On the other hand, the majority of coconut and EAC farmners discontinued soil
conservation practices, weeding, and fertilizer application after the projects. According to the
beneficiaries, escalating rural wage rates, increases in fertilizer prices, and fluctuating prices for
coconuts and EACs were responsible for this shift. In particular, price changes have had an
unfavorable impact on the sustainability of crop management practices and consequently on the
productivity levels of coconut and EACs. As a result, it will be difficult for beneficiaries to
maintain the yield levels on which the assessment of project benefits had been predicated. The
recent reintroduction of the fertilizer subsidy could reverse this trend, but it is still too early to
tell. One unfortunate consequence of the current situation is that paddy farmers' increased use of
herbicides could have adverse long-term environmental effects.



71
5.30   For coconuts, crop establishment has been fairly satisfactory, with the density of palms
often above the recommended level. EAC stands, however, generally have less than the
recommended plant density; if additional plant mortality were to occur (for instance, because of
drought or disease), the sustainability of these plantings could be jeopardized. The erratic prices
of pepper, coffee, and cocoa during the postproject period were cited as the main reason for not
maintaining crop densities and following other recommended practices.
C. Support Services
5.31   The main support service provided under the projects was extension. As a result of
changes in the agricultural extension service and the abolition of field workers, farmers now
receive far less extension advice than they did during the projects. With respect to paddy
cultivation, however, they have learned some of the most important extension messages, such as
the importance of adopting early maturing varieties, and there is no reason to expect a reversion
to previous practices (box 3.1). Although the success of some OFCs (such as big onions in
Matale and red onions in Puttalam) is directly related to their profitability, the introduction of
improved technologies by project extension staff undoubtedly helped.
5.32   The beneficiaries of subsidy schemes for coconuts and EACs mentioned that the number
of visits made by the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) and EAC extension officers had dropped
drastically since the project closed. The reaction of extension personnel to this claim has been
that budget limitations on travel and subsistence and the need to participate in other
nonextension activities preclude maintaining the same level of supervision. As the subsidy
schemes have ended, it is no longer mandatory for the service to visit the beneficiaries, except to
deliver extension messages.
5.33   The fundamental questions here are whether farmers can sustain the improved practices
promoted by the extension service without subsidies, and whether the government has the
resources to support the extension system at the level maintained during project implementation.
In view of the decreases in farm-gate prices for agricultural output, the answer to the first
question is probably not; the answer to the second question is definitely not. In the mid- 1 980s,
after the government realized that agricultural extension accounted for nearly I percent of
agricultural GDP (staff salaries alone were about 85 percent of operating costs), expenditures for
the extension service were cut drastically.
5.34   The KRDP and SRDP provided another important support service: they supplied
agricultural inputs, namely planting materials and seeds. The nurseries established to supply
9oconut seedlings and other planting material are still functioning and appear to be sustainable,
but only on a reduced scale. As expected, the demand for planting materials is not as high as it
was during the project period. Since responsible institutions are in charge of the nurseries, the
quality of the material has been maintained. The seed center built under the KRDP seems to
suffer from constraints on production scheduling and marketing. Privatizing the center would not
only remove these constraints but could ensure the facility's sustainability.
D. Credit
5.35   Central Bank refinancing. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has traditionally subsidized
agricultural loans. Funds from the projects were provided to institutions for on-lending at low



72
nominal interest rates (around 6 percent; the Central Bank assumed unpaid loans). This system
has resulted in a significant transfer of resources to the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank,
which have used this mechanism to recover from losses caused by bad debts.74 In view of the
strategic role of paddy in the country, the Central Bank normally refinanced only paddy
cultivation loans. The projects provided resources for refinancing for all types of loans. Although
the new refinancing system has both strategic and political significance, it is not sustainable, and
the projects did not introduce any substantial innovative feature in the credit system (for
example, linking savings to credit). Such innovations, if successful, could have been replicated
elsewhere, contributing to the sustainability of the agricultural credit system.
5.36   Interest rates. The interest rates charged to farmers by participating banks were between
9 percent (for short-term loans) and 14 percent (for medium-term loans). But because inflation in
the 1980s averaged 13 percent (17.1 percent in 1980-84 and 8.5 percent in 1985-89), the system
was operating with very low (and often) negative real interest rates, a factor that militates against
sustainability.
5.37    The sustainability of the main assets created under the project is uncertain. The irrigation
structures have deteriorated considerably for a variety of reasons, including shortfalls in
preliminary studies, a shortage of experienced contractors, a lack of beneficiary involvement,
poor quality control during implementation and inadequate O&M. Because of limited farmer
involvement in the rehabilitation work, they lack a sense of ownership of the assets and have
been reluctant to care for the rehabilitated works, and the majority interviewed felt that further
repaiTs should be made before the schemes are turned over to the users. The sustainability of
other agricultural elements of the project is related to the public finance situation. Extension
visits have been cut back because of budget cutbacks, and reduction of subsidies has led to a cut-
back in fertilizer usage for some crops. The credit system was also heavily dependent upon a
sharing of risk which is not sustainable in the long term.
74. The Central Bank recognized the need for adjustments in the refinancing and loan interest rates only in 1989. In 1990 it
raised the rates for cultivation loans from 9 to 12 percent, and similar increases were imposed for medium- and long-term
loans under the various schemes. At the same time, the refinancing rate was adjusted upwards, from 1.5 percent to 4.5
percent for short-term agricultural loans (Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 1990).



73
6.    Institutional Impact
6.1    KRDP and SRDP were innovative in their reliance on existing line agencies and
departments to implement project activities. Their arrangements for implementation were in
keeping with the government's efforts to empower district administrations, decentralize the
capital budget, and promote village-level development initiatives. The projects were expected to
strengthen the implementation and planning capacity of line agencies and departments, ensure
coordination among them, and assist the process of decentralized decisionmaking.
6.2    This chapter discusses the projects' successes and failures in promoting institutional
development. Section A traces the effects of the KRDP and SRDP on government agencies and
the management of rural development. Section B highlights some design flaws and the ways in
which these flaws affected project implementation. Section C views the experiences of the two
projects in the context of today's IRDP and describes how the lessons learned from the projects
have helped shape the program's goals and the means of achieving them.
A. The Impact on Line Agencies and the Management of Rural Development
6.3    The effect on implementation capacity. The impact evaluation found that the
implementation capacity of the line agencies in all three districts was indeed strengthened. Some
20 agencies were involved in implementing the KRDP and 25 in coordinating the SRDP. The
projects provided the agencies with vehicles, equipment, physical infrastructure, and some staff
training, improving staff mobility and overall performance. Agency staff and project offices
stated that strengthening the implementation capaciy' of line agencies was the projects' most
important contribution to institutional development. 5They cited financial assistance, increased
staff numbers, and physical assets as particularly valuable. As the projects' second most
important achievement in institutional development, staff pointed to the projects' success in
motivating officers through incentives, mobility, and training (table 6.1).
6.4    The effect on planning capacity. Improvements in planning capacity, by contrast, were
limited. The role of the responsible agencies was confined to executing targets set by the SAR
and reinforced by World Bank supervision missions. In interviews, staff of the Regional
Development Division (RDD) explained that the projects' centrally controlled "blueprint"
approach had left no space for review and adaptive planning and noted that the lesson-which
was taken up in subsequent projects-was to leave more scope for adaptive decisionmaking
during implementation.
75. A one-day workshop was held in each of the three districts for the implementing agencies, including the banks
involved in the projects' credit components and the project officers, to assess the projects' strengths and weaknesses.
Each workshop brought together about 30 people. The results are sunmmarized in table 6.1. For details on the
methodology used, see annex 2.

Note: Percentages show the number of times a specific item was cited by workshop participants. The number of

6.5     The effect on coordination. Vertical coordination was successful, as each implementing
agency coordinated its work with a project office, but horizontal coordination was never really
adequate (see table 6.1). Those project components that most required effective coordination
among several agencies and departments registered conspicuously lower levels of achievement
than other components. In light of this outcome, the initial assumption that effective coordination
could be achieved through committees appears somewhat naive. Effective coordination implies
that the staff of the agencies in question jointly plan their work program at the field level, feel a
sense of ownership of their program, and fully commit themselves to implementing it, something
that does not appear to have occurred in either the KRDP or the SRDP.  Although the SARs
76. The oft-decried lack of coordination between the Irrigation Department (ID) and the Department of Agrarian
Services (DAS) is perhaps the best example. Had the DAS been involved in planning the rehabilitation of irrigation
facilities, many of the coordination problems that complicated the implementation of these components might not have
arisen.



75
rightly identified the risk to the projects of assuming that this level of coordination was in fact
feasible, they made no provisions to minimize the risk.
B. Some Design Flaws and Their Effects
6.6    In both projects, the control offunds by the MFPEA & NI inhibited genuinely
decentralized decisionmaking. What was needed was a decentralized system that gave districts
primary responsibility for project implementation, combined with an appropriate financial
control mechanism at both the district and the central levels. Such an arrangement not only
would have made implementation easier but would have supported the development of
decisionmaking capabilities at the district level.
6.7    The projects also lacked a strong management system. Hindsight suggests that flaws in
the projects' organizational design hampered both smooth implementation and timely project
execution. The projects' management system did not clearly define the roles, responsibilities,
and coordination arrangements for all major players. Those responsible for today's regional
development projects acknowledge that establishing an efficient management system for projects
that involve a number of agencies is still a challenge.
6.8    Another weakness in the projects' design, which came to be reflected in delays in project
implementation, was the mismatch between the ambitious quantitative targets and the
implementation capacity of the line agencies. Given their blueprint approach, which left little
flexibility in implementation, the projects could have benefited from a sound scheduling
exercise. Such an exercise, including an analysis of the administrative and financial actions
needed before project start-up, might have revealed rather quickly the borrower's unfamiliarity
with (for example) the World Bank's international competitive bidding procedures and pointed to
the need for remedial actions (para. 1.19). In practice, such difficulties were not revealed until at
least a year into project implementation.
6.9    Project planners did not consider how benefits would be sustained after the projects
closed, limiting the potentialfor replication. Many of the line agency and project staff felt either
that the government should have provided funds to maintain the assets created under the projects
or that the projects should have provided for follow-up activities (table 6.1). But as RDD staff
pointed out in interviews, the projects themselves provided more than half the funds spent in the
three districts during the project period, and it was unrealistic to think that the agencies
concerned could make this kind of financial commitment. Indeed, inadequate budgetary
allocations subsequently exacerbated O&M problems. Line agency and project staff also noted
that because farmers' needs and constraints were not taken into account in planning the project
interventions, farmers were not prepared to maintain the assets created, particularly in the minor
irrigation schemes (see chapter 5). Interviews with staff of the RDD reinforced this point.
6.10   The experience of the two projects underscores the importance of thoroughly planning
transitional arrangements. Today it is recognized that both public sector agencies and local user
77. Procedures for flow of funds were as follows: the MFPEA & NI would release funds to the implementing agencies
through the project office, reimbursing the agencies for expenses such as staff salaries, allowances, and contract payments.
The project director would settle all other payments after receiving certified documentation from the implementing
agencies.



76
groups have important roles to play in O&M.78 For services that only the public sector can
provide, permanent institutional mechanisms and funding for operational phases need to be
decided well in advance. In addition, project planning and design need to provide for the
involvement of beneficiaries in the form of user groups in order to develop a sense of community
ownership of project assets. Assets created under the KRDP and SRDP have suffered because of
the lack of effective community-based organizations willing to assume responsibility for O&M.
As chapter 5 describes, the government and NGOs have made repeated efforts to build up user
groups willing to perform ongoing O&M on project assets. But the most effective groups are
those formed by the users themselves.
C. Rural Development in Sri Lanka Today
6.11   Since the KRDP and SRDP were introduced, 16 further projects have been initiated
under the IRDP in Sri Lanka, all with international assistance, and 4 more are planned. Today,
the IRDP has initiatives in 15 of the country's 24 districts, and the program is viewed in Sri
Lanka as highly successful overall.
6.12   The process of decentralization has continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s.
Provincial and divisional authorities have been given more responsibility, and elected local
government bodies have been incorporated into a multitiered structure for rural development
planning.79 Meanwhile, economic liberalization has reduced the roles that government and
public sector investment are expected to play in development. Today's rural development
projects put more emphasis than their predecessors on involving the private sector and NGOs in
rural development, with the government facilitating the provision of services rather than seeking
to provide them all itself.
6.13   A key lesson from the two World Bank-supported rural development projects that has
been applied in all Sri Lanka's subsequent initiatives is the usefulness of using a multisectoral,
integrated approach to address the problems of a rural district. According to the director of the
RDD, this lesson has been one of the most significant to emerge from these two projects.
Another has been the importance of relying on the existing institutional structure rather than on
specially established project implementing agencies. In the subsequent projects, the project
offices have remained primarily technical and financial resource centers that coordinate and
facilitate rather than implement project initiatives; they maintain informal authority over the
work of implementing agencies through their control of project funds.
6.14   Some important aspects of the approach used in the KRDP and SRDP were recognized
as disadvantages early on. In particular, the lack of explicit concern for poverty alleviation, the
absence of any provisions for including farmers in project design and implementation, and the
"blueprint" approach have all been shed in subsequent projects. The initial basis for these
changes in program orientation came from projects funded by bilateral agencies in Hambantota
(NORAD-Norwegian Agency for Internatinal Development) and Matara (SIDA-Swedish
International Development Authority) that were started soon after KRDP. These projects had at
78. The borrower in its comments writes that, in minor irrigation schemes, the governent's only role is to provide
guidance.

77
first modeled their interventions on the KRDP's, but the projects were later divided into phases,
permitting a more flexible approach to planning. Thus, when experience began to show the need
for explicit concem with poverty alleviation and for encouraging beneficiary participation in
decisionmaking, project managers were able to change the composition of their activities
accordingly.
6.15   Building on the experience of these and subsequent bilaterally funded projects, today's
rural development projects increasingly center on the needs of beneficiaries. They use more
participatory, "bottom-up" methods for identifying needs and ways to meet them and incorporate
a "process approach" to implementation. Because of the success of such approaches, which are
still evolving within today's projects, they have been integrated into Sri Lanka's mainstream
development programs, including national poverty alleviation programs such as the Janasaviya
Trust Fund now being assisted by the World Bank.
6.16   In a retrospective look at the IRDP as a whole, the RDD itself notes, "The main factors
in the success of the IRDP have been its simple approach, flexible program objectives, popular
participation, political recognition, use of local resources, improved project management,
effective coordination and monitoring, regular follow up, and a flexible approach to planning and
implementation" (Amarasekera 1995). Important factors in the program's success are
discussed below.
Current Projects Are Poverty Oriented
6.17   The KRDP and SRDP analyzed the needs of each district from a sectoral perspective. In
effect, they treated the whole rural population of the region as the target group, making no
specific attempts to identify and focus development efforts on the poor. By the mid-1980s,
however, it had become increasingly clear that the benefits of the IRDP were unevenly
distributed. The emphasis on smallholder production meant that only households with adequate
land benefited directly from the projects. Households with few productive assets-the landless,
those with very small holdings, and the unemployedenefited only marginally, if at all.81
Project activities needed to be selectively targeted if the most disadvantaged groups were to
benefit. Thus, when the second phase of the Matara project began in 1984 after a 1982 evaluation
by SIDA, it included activities with a clear focus on women, plantation workers, food stamp
recipients, and the handicapped. Other bilaterally funded projects have moved in the same
direction.
6.18   Today, efforts to raise agricultural productivity and to protect the welfare of the most
vulnerable groups are accompanied by initiatives to diversify the rural economy and promote
nonfarm rural employment. Building on past experience in promoting both agricultural and
nonagricultural microenterprises at the community level, the IRDP now stresses broad-based
enterprise development. This objective is generally pursued in conjunction with measures aimed at
strengthening planning capacity at the local, divisional, and regional levels, with a view to
80. See S. Amarasekera, Preface to Integrated Rural Development Programme: Fifteen Years of Experience in Sri
Lanka.

Evolution, 1993.

encouraging associated investments in complementary sectors in order to maximize the overall
impact of each program.82
Current Projects Encourage Participation
6.19   Working though the progressively decentralized administrative structure, participatory
planning has been introduced for rural development, and today beneficiary participation in
development activities is a key objective of Sri Lanka's rural development policy. Instead of
designing interventions from the top-down, as in the KRDP and SRDP, today's projects
incorporate bottom-up initiatives conceived and requested by beneficiaries. Participation is seen
to have clear advantages: people get what they want (within the limits of available resources),
and they are committed to maintaining assets created under the projects.
6.20   Starting with the Moneragala project (supported by NORAD) in the mid-I 980s,
bilaterally funded IRDPs began adopting participatory approaches, and by 1990 the entire IRDP
had incorporated participatory elements into project design. Most projects undertake the
following activities to promote community mobilization and participatory village planning:
e  they identify target communities or settlement clusters and potential "social
mobilizers" within them;
e  they create awareness through social mobilization;
*  they organize people for mutual support and community development through, for
example, interest groups, producer groups, and village forums;
*  they establish group savings funds and build up financial management capacity and
creditworthiness;
*  they identify potentials and constraints through participatory rural appraisal and
group discussion and develop available farm and nonfarm resources through
individual and group initiatives such as labor exchanges;
*  they provide training and other support for resource development;
*  they organize community development activities and programs; and
*  they incorporate village development plans into subregional or divisional
development plans.
Current Projects Use Process Planning
6.21   The KRDP and SRDP left very little room for design changes once implementation was
under way. Today, the blueprint approach characteristic of these projects has been replaced by a
more flexible, process-oriented approach. The initial rejection of the blueprint approach in the
bilaterally funded projects in the mid-1 980s caused a sharp swing towards process-based
82. For instance, a business information and services system is being set up on a pilot basis in the southem region.



79
planning. But the result was found to provide too little perspective and direction, and the
approach was modified. Today, the IRDP uses process planning in a defined framework. Thus,
within the structure provided by medium-term perspective planning, projects follow one- to two-
year rolling plans with targets, using a flexible, learning-by-doing approach that relies heavily on
popular participation. This system is flexible enough for projects to modify the choice and design
of activities, depending on the needs of beneficiaries, and it leaves the project open-ended in
terms of inputs, outputs, and implementation schedule. At annual and midterm review meetings,
the RDD's project office managers and representatives from bilateral agency headquarters assess
progress and adjust plans within the medium-term perspective. And every two months, progress
is reviewed by all project directors and the director of RDD. These meetings encourage regular
self-appraisal and provide opportunities for learning, adaptive planning, and cross-fertilization.
6.22   Sri Lanka is a microcosm of the debate about how to reconcile bottom-up and top-down
approaches to project management. In particular, IRDP managers point out the tension that arises
between the need for popular participation and the need to make sizable transfers through the
rural development program, whose perfornance is judged by the ministry that manages it (the
MFPEA & NI) and the international agencies that support it.83
6.23   Process-oriented approaches call for longer implementation periods and a more gradual
buildup of activities than characterized the Bank-supported projects. Experience shows that the
process-oriented, bottom-up modes of development in use in today's IRDP initiatives require a
good deal of time for pilot testing, for training villages in participatory methods, and for building
up community organizations. Project managers stress that villages need considerable assistance
in community development before they can develop the absorptive capacity to utilize available
outside resources effectively. In the view of many of the project managers, a key task of rural
development projects-one that cannot be hurried-is to lay the foundation for such efforts.
6.24   The new approaches have implications not only for the time span of projects but also for
the character of the relationship between projects and international assistance agencies. Projects
that rely heavily on process planning need to be able to interact with these agencies on a flexible,
ongoing basis. Often an iterative process is needed that uses targets but also allows room to
adjust program design when constructive feedback is received. The norm in today's programs is
for bilateral agencies to place one to three RDD-approved advisors (for example, planning and
"4green sector" advisors) in each project to offer technical guidance throughout the project's
lifespan. This method contrasts sharply with the twice-yearly supervision missions of the KRDP
and SRDP-missions that invariably focused only on assessing progress toward physical targets.
Current Projects Use Monitoring as a Management Tool
6.25   The KRDP and SRDP monitored only inputs, financial flows, and progress toward
physical targets. In process-oriented approaches, monitoring needs to play a central role and to
be concerned with project performance and effects. Project managers note that if monitoring is to
fulfill its potential as a management tool, monitoring systems and indicators need to be
developed by project management cells in collaboration with intended beneficiaries. This
collaborative approach helps to ensure that the really significant variables are chosen for
83. See also, for example, Mick Moore, Yoga Rasanayagam, and K.W. Tikakaratne, Moneragala District Integrated
Rural Development Programme: Mid-term Programme Review, Report to the Norwegian Agency for Development
Cooperation and the MFPEA & NI, government of Sri Lanka, February 1995.

monitoring and that staff and beneficiaries have a strong enough sense of ownership of the
monitoring effort to carry out monitoring effectively. The concern at the national level with
generating comparable data across projects is valid, but in practice it can detract from the value
of monitoring as a management tool.

Methodologies Used In Field Investigation
1.    The field work related to the study was carried out in two stages. An initial
reconnaissance mission was undertaken in March 1995, and the main mission in June/July of that
year. Following the first mission project-related data and secondary data were gathered by the
respective project officers and staff from executing agencies in the three districts. In addition,
project staff carried out a 10 percent sample survey of the rehabilitated minor irrigation schemes,
in order to check the secondary data on this topic.
2.    The following were the main sources of secondary data:
*  General census and statistics from the Department of Census and Statistics, Ministry
of Finance and Planning, and Ethnic Affairs and National Integration (former
Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation);
*  Census data and related information from the Department of Agriculture and
statistical information from the Department of Irrigation concerning changes in
command areas, cropped areas, and costs of the rehabilitated schemes;
*  Data reports from other line Ministries such as Department of Export Agriculture,
Department of Agrarian Services, Coconut Research Institute, Ministry of Health,
Ministry of Education, and Department of Highways;
*  Regional Department Centres of the Department of Census and Statistics at
Kurunegala, Puttalam and Matale;
*  Regional Centres of line agencies such as Coconut Cultivation Board, Road
Development Authority, Electricity Board, People's Bank and Bank of Ceylon;
*  Documentation and Progress Reports of the respective Project Offices-Kurunegala,
Puttalam and Matale;
*  IFAD, "Sri Lanka: Kurunegala Smallholder Conservation Farming Project,
Household Case Studies," 1991;
*  Resource Development Consultants, "Report on the Socio-Economic and Baseline
Survey," Sri Lanka, North Western Province, 1991; and
* Chief Ministry NWP, "Resource Profile Survey in North Western Province," 1990.
Field investigations
3.    During the main mission, field investigation was principally undertaken using
participatory methods/tools/techniques involving project beneficiaries, particularly farmers. The
adoption of a participatory approach provided an opportunity for the beneficiaries and other



89                                    Annex 2
stakeholders to interact freely with mission members within a semi-structured setting. The
methods used to collect information in different areas of interest is shown in table 1.

electrification etc.
4.    Complementary to the above-mentioned tools and techniques of participatory
information generation, the following methods were also used:



91                                 Annex 2
*  Physical checks/ observations. Particularly with regard to physical infrastructure in
connection with rehabilitated irrigation structures/social infrastructure, spot checks
by technically competent mission members along with farmers or officers concerned
were utilized.
*  Key informants in the form of village leaders or field officers helped to establish
the nature of the project interventions. Such informants were either met on pre-
arrangements or randomly selected from among those met in the field, who were
found to be knowledgeable.
*  Transect-walks were also used for informal observations of rehabilitated irrigation
structures, farming systems in relation to lowland cultivation and to coconut,
agricultural export crops or any other issue as indicated by the farmers in the field.
Mission members with technical competence could make use of such informal visits
for direct observations/assessments.
*  Focus group interviews was a commonly used technique with the random samples
of farmers/villagers during the field visits. The interviews were based on a thematic
outline but yet adequately open-ended for ensuring participation and free expression.
Selection of Field Samples
5.    Field samples, as far as possible, were selected on the basis of agro-ecological zone and
the scale or type of program. In the cases of coconut and AECs, the type of subsidy scheme and
the size of the land holding was taken into consideration.
6.    Paddy. In selecting the field samples in the three projects, while taking into
consideration minor and major/medium schemes, the different agro-ecological zones-wet,
semi-wet, semi-dry, and dry-provided the sample framework. The sample of schemes visited
by district and type of scheme is shown in table 2.
7.     Coconut. Samples were selected in such a way to ensure representation of both
smallholders and larger operations benefiting from the subsidy schemes. Samples from dry,
intermediate and wet zone were included for field investigation in order to observe the
differential impact of the subsidy schemes.
8.    Social infrastructure. No systematic sampling method was used, except for rural
electrification, where schemes were randomly selected. Infrastructure constructed under the
projects was visited in connection with visits to locations selected for representativeness in
production components, such as irrigation rehabilitation, export agriculture schemes/coconut
subsidy schemes.
Survey ofAgricultural Practices
9.    During the PRA exercise a more formal survey of crop management practices in the
lowlands prior, during, and after project, was also carried out by the mission agronomist in the
irrigation schemes visited by the evaluation team.

and failures/weaknesses of the project. The responses were collected and categorized into
clusters of ideas which were finally combined in tabular form. The free and open discussions

Dissemination Workshop on Results of Impact Evaluation:
Summary of Discussions
1.    Group discussions at the workshop focused on how approaches to rural development had
changed since KRDP and SRDP were designed, and on the implications of experience with these
projects for future rural development efforts.
Project Design
2.    Goals. Participants contrasted the early projects' production oriented goals (with more
than four fifths of expenditures devoted to productive components) with today's concern for
balancing output growth with equity in rural development. Current integrated rural development
projects (IRDPs) have replaced the focus on specific commodities with a more holistic approach,
in which the farm is seen as a totality and in which investments in social infrastructure and
human development play important roles. Interventions are more demand-driven and more
sensitive to local resources and constraints, and they increasingly center on the needs of poverty
groups. For the future, participants noted that small enterprise development-particularly in
agribusiness-and efforts to keep rural savings available for investment in rural areas, rather
than having them flow to cities, need more attention than they have received so far.
3.    Definition of goals. Participants noted that the rural population is not wholly made up of
farmers, and that even among farmers, needs can vary widely. They emphasized the need for a
baseline analysis of the needs, resources, diversity, and limitations of the population before
beginning to plan a project.
4.    From today's vantage point, participants saw the lack of popular participation in the
early projects as a design flaw. The IRDPs have evolved since KRDP and SRDP were
implemented; instead of designing interventions "top down," today's projects incorporate
"bottom up" initiatives conceived and requested by beneficiaries. There is more emphasis than in
the early projects on involving the private sector and nongovemmental organizations, with
govemment facilitating the provision of services, where possible, rather than seeking to provide
all of them itself.
5.    Participants also explained that the blueprint approach of the early projects has been
replaced by a more flexible, process oriented approach. Within an agreed structure given by
medium-term perspective planning, projects follow one to two year rolling plans, with targets,
using a flexible, learning-by-doing approach that relies heavily on people's participation.
(Participants noted that the rural development approach had first swung sharply away from
"blueprinting" to a heavily process-oriented approach. This had been found to give too little
perspective and direction and thus had been replaced by today's combination of blueprint and
process.)
6.    The discussants also emphasized that process-oriented approaches are not readily
compatible with the World Bank's typical project cycle and procedures. These approaches call
for much longer implementation periods, more gradual build up of activities, and closer
involvement of the assistance agency during implementation than has been customary in projects
supported by the Bank.

7.    Designingfor sustainability. In the early projects, participants noted, the sustainability of
benefits had not been accorded the priority now seen as vital. In the farming components of
projects, participants pointed out that the managementpractices introduced had not been
sustained, and hence that the targeted achievements were not being realized. Reasons included
fluctuating and declining output prices, and a reduced push by extension services.
8.    Participants also pointed to the lack of an institutional mechanism to sustain initiatives
after project closure. Funds, staff, and management had all been withdrawn and not replaced,
while for operation and maintenance, beneficiaries and implementing agencies expected funding
to continue coming from external sources.
9.     Experience had shown that institutional arrangements to ensure sustainable maintenance
arrangements need to be planned at the design stage. Participants emphasized that both public
sector agencies and village level organizations need to play roles here. An arrangement that
holds promise is to strengthen community based organizations. In today's projects and in future,
empowered groups of villagers (such as tank committees, farmer organizations, water user
groups) will be expected to assume responsibility for operating and maintaining physical
facilities at the village level. But for services that can only be provided by the public sector,
phasing-out arrangements, including institutional mechanisms and funding, need to be made.
Implementation Strategy
10.   Management system. Lack of a well functioning management system with clear roles,
responsibilities, and coordination arrangements, had hampered the implementation of the earlier
projects. KRDP and SRDP were coordinated by a national Steering Committee and District
Coordination Committee, and each was managed by a Project Office. Participants pointed out
that achieving an efficient management system, where so many different agencies are involved,
is still a challenge for the IRDP program today. They contrasted the experience of the Mahaweli
Authority; this specially created "higher level" agency did not share the coordination problems
of the regular line agencies.
11.   Relations with assistance agencies. Participants drew attention to the continuous
interaction with bilateral agencies that has been typical in the IRDPs funded by these agencies.
They contrasted this with the more superficial supervision work, focusing mainly on progress
toward physical targets, that was done by the World Bank in the early projects. They also
stressed the value of the mid-term reviews that have been typical in bilaterally funded IRDPs.
They noted that future projects, with their expected large element of process planning, would
require a continuous and flexible interaction with assistance agencies that has not been the norm
for the multilateral banks.
12.   Monitoring. Though the KRDP and SRDP monitored only inputs and financial flows,
and the progress being made toward physical targets, participants recognized that in process
oriented approaches, monitoring needs to play a central role and to be concerned with project
performance and effects. Discussing the design of monitoring, they stressed the need for
monitoring systems and indicators to be developed by project management cells, in collaboration
with projects' intended beneficiaries. Their experience showed that this helps to ensure that the
really significant variables are chosen for monitoring, and also that staff and beneficiaries have
enough "ownership" of the monitoring effort to carry it out effectively. They noted that the



103                                Annex 4
concern, at the national level, with generating data comparable across projects, is a valid one but
can in practice detract from the value of monitoring as a management tool.
Support Measures: Human Resource Development
13.    Capacity building. The early projects did not emphasize capacity building at the local
level. Participants felt that future rural development strategy should carry forward today's
emphasis on capacity building and empowerment of local people, with the public sector seeing
village-level institutions as partners in development. Their experience showed that this approach
called for efforts to help develop the capacity of intended beneficiaries, for example through
farmer training, teacher upgrading, and development of skills in rural mobilization. To work to
their best advantage, they noted, these efforts need to permeate the entire project approach, rather
than being organized as separate components. For the future, there also needs to be more
recognition of the need to strengthen the skills-both in technical disciplines and in working
cooperatively with rural communities-of project and line agency staff.

Observations bv NI/Plan Imolementation Ethnic Affairs

Kurunegala Rural Development Project (Credit S91-CE)
& Second Rural Development Project( Credit 1079-CE)
LInpact Evaluation Report
The contents of the evaluation report is generally acceptable to this Mvilistrv. We, however. wish
to bring to your notice the following observations.
Overall comments
*     The report, in certain instances, has over emphasized the qualiry of construction
works in relation to roads irrigation and buildings etc. rather than evaluating the
socio economic impact of project activities (P.71-para 4.22, 4.24- P.85 oara 5.2
and table 5. 1)
*     The achievements gained by activities carried out in the livestock and fisheries
sectors arer not given due consideration.
*     It is not correct to state that horizontal coordination was never really attained
(P.1o6 Para 6.5)  a satisfactory level of coordination was attained be:een
agencies involved at district and divisional level.
*     Certain inferences have been drawn over uhe inforr.ation given by the people.
Thev usuallv do not remember 10- 15 vears back very well. They alwavs tend
to express concern on what has not been done, rather than what has been done.
The participatory approach in evaluation is not bad. but must be used with
caution. There is greater possibilirv for personel, and individual interest concern,
prejudices and subjective estimations to creep in to the process.
Irrigation Component
1.    Despite all the achievement in the paddv production, (increase in acreage.
increase in vields, better water managemen; etc.) it is contradictor, to state that
the farmers are reluctant to undertake maintenance of rehabilitation schemes due
to quality of rehabilitation and not consu1ling farrmers during planning and
implementation stage.



Annex 5                                 106
Before rehabilitation of a tank plarning meetings and ratification meetings were
held with respective farrmers with the representatives of ID and DAS.
The most significant reason for this plight is socio-political changes and eroding
of traditional values in all spheres of life over the last several decades as stated
in p.2 of the memorandurn to the executive Directors and President.
Contribution of paddv for Household income (67.4.11)
Decrease of Household income from paddy cannot be attributed to project, but
to other external factors such as increased prices of agricultural inputs and
decreased paddy prices etc.
IRDP Puttalam
Due to project interventions remarkable improvement in the socio economic
profile of puttalam district was achieved. This is highly visible in the following
areas.
-Increase student population
-Decrease drop outs
-Improvement of quality of education
-Improvement of health conditions
-Development of rural social infrastructure
-Development of agriculture, includina livestock and fisheries
-Emergence of new settlements in remote areas
*     Socio economic impact over the rural population attributed to IRDP Puttalam was not
adequately stressed.
*     Purely because of project intervention, Kalpitiya perLinsula itself which was a barren land
before the project became a fully agriculturally developed land segment.
On the whole, living conditions and quality of lives have improved in the district. This
factor should be emphasized.
*     In addicion. out of the savings of project funds (Puttalam) following activities which
were not in the SAR were carried out
1. Toduwawa Bridue
2. 72 Rural Electrification Schemes
3. 75 Gravel Roads
4. Constructions of additional number of tube wells



107                             Annex 5
The above activities were completed within the project period and the project budget and
generated valuable socio economic results over the rural population.
Individual Departmental comments, (without editing) are also attached.
We have no objection to publish the report subject to the above observations.
