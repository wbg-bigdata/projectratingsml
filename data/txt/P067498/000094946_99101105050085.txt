A: Project Development Objective: (see Annex 1)
1. Project development objective:
The objective of the project is to assist the Government of Senegal (GoS) in its efforts to prevent
disruptions in the country's economic and financial sectors as a result of the Year 2000 "bug."
In particular, the project's focus is to assist the GoS in its efforts to prevent or mnimize Year 2000
(Y2K) induced failures in its government revenue and expenditure systems, customs systems, health,
and critical infiastructures (such as telecommunications, electricity, transport, water, financial
institutions, and postal services).
2. Key performance indicators:
The key performance indicators for this project would be:
(a) No major disruptions in critical services (such as water, electricity, telecommunications,
transport, customs, taxes, salaries payment, financial institutions, and postal services) will
occur during the first quarter of Year 2000 as a result of the Y2K bug.
(b) No significant decrease in activity caused by the Y2K bug will occur in the three large
computer centers (Finance, Interior, Customs) beyond April 1, 2000.
These indicators will be split into more precise ones, and methods of assessing detailed results will be
defined during conception of contingency plans (national and sector specific).
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project:
(see Annex 1)
CAS Document: NO 17269-SE, December 29, 1997
Date of latest CAS discussion: January 29, 1998
The CAS puts considerable emphasis on macroeconomic stability, improved private sector
environment, and alleviation of infrastructure botflenecks. Inplementing a Y2K project will reduce
potential risks to all of the above objectives.
Economic and Financial Policy Framework Paper. 1999-2001, June 4, 1999
This paper states, in particular, that the GoS intends to implement policies to sustain strong, durable,
diversified and balanced growth. It will accelerate the reforms in the water, transport, and energy
sectors. The Y2K project's objective is to ensure that strategic sectors will avoid major disruptions due
to the Y2K bug that can slow sustainable improvement of functioning of these sectors and negatively
impact private business activity.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The Y2K problem stems from the fact that many computerized and digital systems could malfumction
because of failure to properly process the correct date as the century changes.
2.1 Mdw SectorIssues
Although the problem is technically simple, it poses a significant financial and management burden due
to the resource-intensive nature of the process and the number of actors concemed.



Page 3
In almost all economic activities (public and private), electronic or computer-based systems are used
for processing and storing information. Failure or errors in processing that may not be identified
immediately can provoke major malfunctions that may stop or deteriorate the functioning of major
economic activities themselves. This is the case in Senegal where many activities cannot be maintained
without the help of reliable electronic or computer-based systems.
Aware of the problem caused by Y2K bug risks, the GoS set up a Y2K institutional framework in
January 1999, under which a National Y2K Steering Committee has carried out or coordinated the
identification of key risk exposures in the following areas:
(a) Government-managed operations (revenue and expediture, civil service payroll and
pension, management of passports, visas, identity cards, and customs systems);
(b) Dysfunction in ministries and public adminisaions for day-to-day office automation
processes related to services provided to the population;
(c) State-owned enterprises in charge of water treatment, railways, postal services, ports, air
and maritime traffic control, etc.';
(d) Health services;
(e) Private sector in charge of strategic infrastructure services (power, energy,
telecommunications, transport);
(f) Manufacturing imdustry and, in particular, small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and
(g) Financial sector.
Almost all Y2K inventories have been completed and appraised by seven sector-specific tchnical
commissions, and actions to correct or replace critical systems non-compliant with Y2K have been
implemented since March 1999 or earlier.
2.2 GovernmentStrategy
The National Y2K Steering Committee (Comite de Pilotage du projet "Passage du Senegal a I 'An
2000') was established on January 6, 1999 by decree of the Prime Minister. This Committee (CdP) is
chaired by the Minister of Scientific Research and Technology (MSRT). CdP was given the task of
defining and implementing a National Y2K Strategic Plan; it is the regulatory, monitoring, and
decision-making body on all Y2K matters. Weeldy reports are presented to Government meetings.
CdP's mission is to:
(a) ensure that the key sectors of the national economy are not affected by the Y2K bug;
(b) raise awareness among different segments of the Senegalese society; and
(c) disseminate information on Y2K issues.
This committee is also in charge of assessing financal needs and seeking sources of funding in
cooperation with the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Planning (MEFP).
A National Y2K Coordination Committee (Comite de Coordinaffon du projet "Passage du Senegal a
I 'an 2000') was created simultaneously by the same decree. Its mission is to coordinate the activities
IEnterprises in other sectors will also be eligible for project support.
2An Internet-based Y2K Resource Center has been created to provide eqipment and software testing and
other information.

of seven technical commissions (Public Sector and Adiniions, Financial Sector, SMEs, Industry,
Strategic Activities, Health and Environment, and Security), to manage the Y2K Resource Center, and
to set the agenda for CdP meetings. The commission in charge of security issues was created more
recently, and is chaired by the Ministry of Defense.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Priority is given to addressing Y2K risk exposures in the most vital operations for the economy, which
are:
* Overall functioiing of critical activities in the country
*   Public Administration and Finance
* Strategic Sectors, public and private (water, energy, telecommunications, transport, financial
services)
* Health
*   Industry, in particular SMEs
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components: (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a
detailed cost breakdown)
The GoS has requested a Y2K Credit in the amount of US$10.15 million equivalent from the World
Bank. This Credit will assist the Government in its efforts to mitigate Y2K risks in its critical financial
and public service operations.
Financial and human resource shortages in Senegal's Y2K program make the Bank's assistance
necessary. Given the short time remaining before January 2000, it is unrealistic to design a project that
will cover all needs of all sectors of the economy. Therefore, the efforts are focused on those areas and
priorities that are vital to the economy and are still non-Y2K compliant.
These include:
(a) Public sector's large computer systems' centers. They are in charge of vital information
systems dealing with government financial revenue and expenditure, population official
registration and documents, and customs. In particular, customs' operations are critical for
the economy, and adequate resources must be allocated to assess their Y2K compliance
and to meet any remediation and contingency plans needs.
(b) Senegalese ministries and public administrations that may face disruptions in their daily
functioning due to failure in office automation tools and database servers. According to a
review carried out by the Public Sector and A inins Commission for 14
institutions, around 75% of their total computer inventory of 2500 pieces is non-compliant,
and 15% will have to be replaced.
(c) State-owned enterprises, including railways and postal services, that have started their
Y2K remediation process but require more funds to cover their needs.
(d) Health is an area where electronic and computer-based administrative and medical
equipment require closer examination. The synthesis of recent surveys to make an
inventory of Y2K bug problems is under review and validation; and, at this stage, only a

(e) Privatized basic infastructure service providers (water, electricity and telecommunications
compames) have been very active in fixing their Y2K problems. This is maily because
these operations are managed by inteional partner companies. Although there is a high
degree of Y2K readiness in these operations, the Govermnent nevertheless needs to ensure
and verify that all such systems are fully compliant. This work will be carried out in the
first assessment phase of national and sector-specific contingency plans (Component 3).
(f) The scope of potential Y2K risks in private sector operations, especially in small and
medium enterprises (SMEs), is not covered well at this point. Building awareness and
disseminating information is a continuous process. The project will include actions and
means for strengthening the capacity of Y2K coordination to adequately monitor the
readiness status and to assess the potential Y2K risks for SMEs and industries.
The project will cover the most urgent priorities (identified as priority number one) that represent
around 50% of the total needs identified. It is assumed that this approach will allow Senegalese
adminiations and public services to provide daily services offered to the population, and to carry out
their own management under satisfactory conditions.
1.1 Project Components Descripfon
This project will reinforce and accelerate ongoing work carried out by the GoS since the beginning of
1999. It will take into account the existing Y2K institutional framework and ongoing actions.
Due to the specific deadline of Decenber 31, 1999 and the Y2K bug context, the project's time frame
will be split into four phases:
Phase 1 will cover urgent actions already started or to be started before the end of October
1999. A Project Preparation Facility advance (PPF) of US$750,000 and retroactive financing
up to US$2 million (20% of the total amount of the project) were approved in order to cover
urgent actions already identified.
Phase 2 will cover actions to be implemented prior to December 31, 1999. As al identified
actions cannot be implemented by this date, activities identfied as highly critical by inventory
and contingency plan sudies have been selected, and corresponding actions will be
implemented by end-1999.
Phase 3 wiU cover actions to be implemented before March 31, 2000. This will correspond to
the continuation of already identified needs in less critical activities and to remediate actual
dysfunctions due to the Y2K bug. During that period, contigency plans will have to be
targeted to mitigate these eventual dysfunctions in critical areas at national or sector-specific
levels.
Phase 4 (April to December 2000) wiU cover actions dealing with consolidation and
modernization of computer systems and infrastructures already upgraded for Y2K. Several
needs have been identified in enlarging network and open systems infrastructures and allowing
more decentralizaion of administration operations. The Project Management Unit (PMU) will
select actions according to government priorities and available financing. However, all actions
will have to be implemented before end-December 2000 so that the last disbursements can be
completed by June 2001.
Some actions have yet to be identified, so flexibility is provided to the project to permit the PMU to
adapt schedule and budget to real priorities, in line with the project's four phases as described above.
A detailed Implementation Plan is provided in Annex 8 and wiU be adjusted regularly according to the
progress of the project with regard to actual needs.



Pag 6
The project will be composed of three components: Project Managmet Strengtiening, Public Sector
Remediation, and National and Sector-specific Contingency Plans.
Component 1: Project Management Strenathenina
The PMU will be in charge of the following main tasks:
(a) overall supervision of the project, reporting weeldy to the Y2K Project Steering Committee
chaired by the Minister of Scientific Research and Technology (MRST); progress reports
will be sent to World Bank project team monthly;
(b) selection of priorities and validation of actions to be launched by beneficiaries in
accordance with the project's four phases;
(c) supervision of budget, procurement and disbursements; in order to accelerate the start of
the project, related operational work will be subcontracted to a separate organization, the
Private Sector Foundation (PSF), which is already in charge of the same tasks for other
Bank projects;
(d) supervision and follow-up of remediation actions carried out in public sector areas;
(e) supervision and follow-up of contingency action plans' development and implementation;
(f) definition and implementation of a Communication Plan dedicated to Y2K readiness
infornation dissemination; and
(g) training for increasing awareness of stakeholders and the public on Y2K risks and
Senegal's strategic areas' readiness.
Total Budget for this component is estimated at US$750,000, of which US$250,000 is financed under
the PPF.
Component 2: Public Sector Remediation
The remediation and upgrading of public sector systems is split into four main subcomponents:
*   Main Administrations' Information Centers (DTAI, DAF, CID)
*   Other Public Ministries and Administrations
*   State-owned Enterprises
*   Health
Subcomponent 1: Main Administrations' Information Centers
(a) Direction du TraitementAutomatique de l'Information (DTAI-Ministry of Finance) is in
charge of critical operations such as civil servants' payroll, treasury, tax recovery, debt
management, etc.
(b) Direction de l'Automatisation des Fichers (DAF-Comnputer Automation Department -
Ministry of Interior) is in charge of the election system, identity cards, visas and passports,
etc. The election system correction is almost complete (own human resources); however,
critical applications (identity cards, visas and passports, human resources management)
remain to be addressed.



Page 7
(c) Centre d'lnformatique des Douanes (CID-Customs Deparunent of Informatics). The
GAINDE 3 system is vital for Senegal and represents a major share of government
financial resources.
A Y2K remediation contract with ACFO (a French software company) of more than
US$1 million is at high risk according to information provided to the Bank's mission, and
the following urgent actions have bee agreed: audit of ACFO's planning and delivery by
an independent consultant; upgrading of CID's technical platform; and training and
assistance to the 200 clients connected to CID's system (these three actions are financed
under PPF funds).
A specific Contingency Plan is necessary due to the very high impact of a failure in
customs' operations. This plan and related budget will be put under direct control of CID
in close coordination with general Contingency Plan development.

Subcomponent 2: OtherPublicMinistries and Administrations
Requests have been colected by DelUgation  1 'Informatique4 through a comprehensive inventory of
all equipment installed in aministrations and public services. It is proposed that the project cover
remediation actions representing about 50% of the needs identified for 14 main Ministries and Services5
*   Due to time constraints, it is assumed that only 50% to 60% of this program can be achieved
before the end of CY99 and that further actions wiUl be taken according to real dysfunctions
observed in early CY2000.
* As most computer applications correspond to office automation (word processing and
spreadsheets), some light dysfunctions may not be critical for a short period. Prioritization based
on risk analysis according to the importanc of each sevice and application concerned will have
to be managed by the Y2K Public Sector and Administrations' Comnission in close connection
with the PMU.
* Preparation of implementation and some urgent remediation actions were started in March 1999
and wiU be covered retroactively.
A budget of US$1.5 million has been allocated for this subcomponent, including a provision of US$0.4
million with regard to remediation needs for administrations where the inventory has not yet been
completed.

Subcomponent 3: State-owned Enterpnses (Poste, SNCS, PETROSEN, SODAGRI, S£4ED)6
The Y2K Coordination Conumittee has collected needs assessments from staw-owned enterprises
impacted by the Y2K problem. Each company has produced a detailed inventory and a renwdiation
plan that supports its request. Detailed Terms of reference (TOR) are being prepared for immediate
and urgent actions.
A budget of USS1.6 million has been allocated for this area, including US$450,000 financed under the
PPF.
Subcomponent 4: Health
The surveys of this area have not yet been completed, but first results show that the Y2K bug impacts
office automation and medical instrments.
A preliminary estimate of US$0.85 million for remediation actions is envisaged at this stage.
ComDonent 3: Contingency Plans
It is obvious that due to time constrants all systems will not be fully ready by Decenber 31, 1999, and
that preventive means and organizations have to be put in place to solve any critical situation that can
provoke domino and systemic impact on the whole Senegalese economy and social life. Contingency
Plans have to address this issue with two different targets:
*   A global target to ensure that the population and the economy will not be severely impacted by a
disaster due to Y2K major failures in strategic infrastructures (such as water, electricity,
telecommunications, finance); this will be addressed by a National Contingency Plan.
*   A sector-specific target to ensure that functioning of admnions and large
institutions/enterprises wil not be adversely affected by Y2K failures and that critical activities
wil continue even with a decrease of qualty of service; this will be addressed by Sector-specific
Contingency Plans.
Since much work has yet to be undertalen in this area, a team of international consultants will be hired,
financed by PPF funds under Component 1, and supervised by the PMU to:
*   assess the overall readiness in critical areas;
* evaluate risks and strategic activities to be guaranteed at national and sector levels; and
*   assist Senegalese contngency plan teams in the conception and implemtation of adequate
contingency plans (studies, training, seminars) at national and sector-specific levels.
AU contingency action plans (national and sector specific), with the exception of the one for customs,
wil be put under the direct responsibility of the PMU, and a team leader appointed by the Senegalese
Government will be included in the PMU team full time.
Budget estimate covering logistics, training, tests and specific investments is US$1.7 million (25% for
the national plan and 75% for sector-specific plans); this amount includes financing of some urgent
remediation actions to correct systems' failures observed in the beginimng of CY2000.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project does not attempt to address any long-term policy or institutional reforms. It wil not have
any conditionality linked to any sector policy, nor will it have any macroeconomic or public policy
reform objective or conditionality. Although the project does not support any key policy and
institutional reforms, it attempts to prevent failures due to the new milennium bug that could lead to
weakened key economic institutions. Through this project, there will be a positive impact in improving
some institutional functions, such as crisis and emergency project management.
3. Benefits and target population:
The direct beneficiaries of the project wil be the public sector administrations and agencies. The
Senegalese population will benefit through better services provided by public institutions and strategic
enterprises, e.g., utilities, finance, transport, health, etc.
Private institutions that depend upon key governmental operations, such as public payroll,
infrastructure services, customs, etc., will benefit indirectly from the project.
Upgrading of information systems (hardware, software, networks) in large areas of public
administaton will allow further modernization processes and plans. All information collected by
DJlegation a l Informafique will help this department to assess the existing situation and define more
adequate information systems' plans for public ministries and administrations.
As for the public institutions, they will improve their project management expertise as well as the way
they handle crisis situations. Another lasting and transferable skill from this project is the contingency
planning expertise that could be applied in all vital sectors of the economy as a way to ensure business
continuity in case of catastrophe.
4. Institutional and implementation amngements:
In order to achieve the main purpose of this project, it is necessary to have efficient tools and
institutions that can handle the project's overall complexity, or at least address some of the critical
issues discussed above. Project management expertise and procurement expertise are surely needed.
ProjectManagement Unit
The PMU's coordination and mmagement of all the project components is a critical prerequisite to
ensure the success of the project. One of the main recomnmedations is to set up a PMU that is
empowered by the highest authorities in the country. It will report to the Y2K Steering Committee

chaired by the Minister of Scientific Research and Technology (MSRI), and will be in charge of
project implention consisting of the project's three conponts.

Procurement under thius project will follow the World Bank "Y2K Procurement Guidelines" tha were
issued on November 4, 1998 by the Procurement Policy and Services Group of the Operational Core
Services Network (OCSPR) and the, Procurment Group of the Legal Operattons Front Office
(LEGOP); see Annex 5. Tbe, prjojets Procedures Manual will be defined with the assistance of the
Private Sector Foundation's (PSF) procurement adviser, who will work closely with the Y2K Tender
Comnuttee. Bank procurement specialists will clear the manual. It will define procureanet rules and
processes as well as authorization and no-objection procedures to be used to ensure timely processing
by all actors involved.



Pape 11
Monthly reports on the Y2K project procurement and disbursement activities in the concerned
institutions will be prepared by the PMU and reported to the World Bank.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements
Separate project accounts will be established and maintained in accordance with principles and
practices satisfactory to IDA. The PMU will maintain a financial mnagement system - including
accounting, internal controls, finacial reporting and auditing elements - adequate to ensure that it can
provide accurate and timely information regarding project resources and expenditures. Due to time
constaints which do not allow installation of a proper new financial management system, the Private
Sector Foundation (PSF)-established as a private agency under the Private Sector Capacity Building
Project (Cr. 2759-SE) and has now gained significant experience in financial management,
disbursement and procurement-would be entrusted with processing all the project's financial services
as defined in the project's Procedures Manual including the accounting systm, financial management,
disbursement and procurement. PSF's financial management capacities were assessed and found
satisfactory.
The annual financial statements of the project will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accountig principles in Senegal. They will include a statement of sources and uses of funds, a
statement of reconciliation of the special account, a balance sheet and required notes to the financial
statements. The financial statements will be submitted to IDA no later than six months after the end of
the fiscal year. The project will prepare annual financial statments including a statement of sources
and uses of funds and a balance sheet. The financial statements of the project will be audited for each
year by an idependent auditor acceptable to IDA in accordance with standards on auditing also
acceptable to IDA. Audit reports of reasonable scope and detail would be submitted to IDA within six
months of the end of the audited period. The auditor will provide an opinion on the project financial
statements, statements of expenditure (SOE) and special account (SA). The audit will include: (a) an
assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems to monitor expenditures and
other financial transactions and ensure safe custody of project-financed assets; (b) a determination as to
whether the borrower and project implementing entities have maintained adequate documentation on all
relevant transactions; and (c) verification that expenditures submitted to the Bank are eligible for
financing, and identification of any ineligible expenditures. The appointment of auditors satisfactory to
IDA will be a condition of Credit effectiveness.
According to the arrangements indicated above, minimum financial management requirements will be
met prior to Credit effectiveness. However, all capacities necessary for full Loan Administration
Change Initiative (LACI) implementation, in particular PMR-based disbursement, are unlikely to be in
place prior to Credit effectiveness. Due to the nature of the project which should be disbursed over a
period of 18 months, an action plan for the application of the PMR-based disbursement method will not
be developed for this project.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Alternatives considered include:
(a) Reallocation of funds under existing Bank-financed projects: There are various projects in
public sector development and infrastructure in Senegal which could conceivably be
restructured to include Y2K remediation components in the corresponding government
agencies. However, this option was found to be impractical and ineffective because of the
very short window of opportunity for addressing urgent Y2K issues, and the complexity of
re-negotiating current allocations with a multitude of counterpart agencies.



Pag 12
(b) Using infoDev Tecbnical Assistance Grants for contingency planning: This option proved
inadequate as an altemative, considering the scope of work needed to ensure a reasonable
level of business continuity assurance, and the need for procuremnt of goods and services
that far exceed the US$500,000 cap for infoDev grants. To initiate remediation programs
and heighten the country's awareness of Y2K issues, however, Senegal received two World
Bank Y2K infoDev grants (US$100,000 for planning and US$500,000 for
implementation).
(c) Use of existing public sector procurement  chanisms in Senegal versus establishment of
new procurement procedures for Y2K-related goods and services: The existing public
sector procurement procedures are too complicated and time-cn ing. As such, they
would create unacceptable delays in acquisition of goods and services required for
remediation of systems at risk. A stemlined emergency procurement process is therefore
proposed to ensure timely acquisition of required goods and services for remediation of
critical systems.
(d) More comprehensive planning before undertaking the project: The remaining time for
effective business continuity and coningency plaming is so short that any further delays
for additional planning could produce grave consequences. To address certain unassessed
and hence unidentified risk exposures, the proposed design calls for provision of a certain
level of flexibility in reviewing and redirecting the focus of activities under the project on
an as-needed basis, and allowing for reallocation of funds to address such needs.
2. Projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed,
ongoing, planned):
The Y2K problem is an issue that affects operations and systems in diverse sectors. In the context of
World Bank operations, however, very few countries have requested financing by the Bank to deal with
these issues. Existing cases are very recent, and include Y2K projects in Argentina (October 1998,
US$72 million), Sri Lanka (December 1998, US$29.0 million), and Malaysia (March 1999, US$100
million).
3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Design of this project incorporates lessons learned in design of emergency activities and the existing
Bank-financed Y2K projects. These lessons include:
(a) streamlining of public sector Y2K procurement procedures;
(b) replacing ICB requirements with LIB, and international shopping for Y2K procurement,
(c) flexibility in reacting to unforeseen risk exposures and circumstances;
(d) highly centralized decision-naking authority and project implementation; and
(e) strengthening and streamlining of project management teams.
In addibon, technical assistance will be provided to the PMU to improve their project management
capability and ensure a more effective outcome for the project.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The GoS has developed a National Y2K Strategy Plan, a National Y2K Steering Committee, headed by
the Minister of Scientific Research and Technology, and a National Y2K Coordination Committee (see



Page 13
Section B, 2.2). The Government has already allocated significant resources to identify and address
potential problems in critical public administration systems, and to monitor the situation in critical
infrastructure operations.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank's involvement would provide additional financing for contingency and business continuity
planning and remediation. It would also bring higher visibility to these efforts. In addition, sharing of
best practices from similar efforts in other countnes (streamlined adminiative practices for
emergency mnagement, procurement, process management) would have a very positive inpact on
better implementation of the Government's Y2K Action Plan.
The strengthening of the Project Management will be a direct consequence of the Bank's involvement.
It is one key condition to ensure that actions will be implemented according to national priorities and
that a global view of all potential risks will be addressed at the national level.
E: Summary Project Analysis:
1. Economic:
The Y2K problem appears as a simple technical issue to be addressed by 1T professionals. However,
its potential impact may put at risk a number of critical public services (payroll, customs, health).
Besides, the actual impact of these problems cannot be calculated in advance, as a global and general
disaster for few days or weeks is not an hypothesis to be envisaged. Furthermore, the entire economy
could suffer if major disruptions occur in public utilities (electicity, energy, telecommunications). IfC
for instance, State employees are not paid, or goods are not processed through customs in a timely
manner, or SMEs are not able to continue their commercial and manufacturing activties, such
problems may lead to social and economic instability.
Economic benefits of strengteing the efforts to solve the Y2K problem include mitaion of nsks in
the functioning of critical services in the country.
According to information available, it was not possible to provide reliable figures for the whole country
about the potential impact of major disruption of public services and inastructures.
2. Financial: (see Annex 4)
It is difficult to accurately predict the cost of potential disruptions caused by Y2K failures. This is
mainly due to the high level of interdependencies among various sectors. The Y2K problem could
potentially affect computer-based operations and date-dependent digital systems. The domino effect of
partial failures in one or more critical sectors could lead to a situation that may affect the entire
economy. This in turn could lead to  mendous losses for the Government and private businesses.
The financial impact of disruption could be compared to the cost of several days/weeks of general
slowdown in major activities or sectors.
3. Technical:
Sitngthening of Y2K's institutional framework and creation of a Project Management Unit attached to
the Y2K Steering Committee and reporting weekly to governmnt's meetings will ensure that individual
projects will be evaluated rigorously and according to national priorities. Regular progress reporting
and monitoring will take place to guaranty fte transparency of the process.



Pag 14
4. ]Institutional:
Project organization: The project was designed to take advantage of the already existng Y2K
framework. The PMUT created under the project will take the responsibilty for monitoring project
activities (remediation, contingency planning, SME awareness and risk evaluation, traimng, etc.) to be
implemented by various agencies, especially large information and computer centers [Finace (DTAI),
customs (CI)), Ministry of Interior (DAF)]. The Public Sector and Administrations Commission will
have a specific role in ensuring that all key services in ministries and public administrations will not
suffer major disruptions.
The PMU will be responsible for monitoring the program in its various components, while PSF,
through a subcontact agreement, will be in charge of accounting. financi  mnagement and
procurement aspects. A Tender Commatee will be in charge of executing procurement review and
clearance in an independent and speedy manner.
5. Social:
The Y2K problem can have a considerable social impact, in part due to potential disruptions in public
systens, and in part due to adverse reactions of the public to sensationalist stories in the media on Y2K
issues as the Year 2000 approaches. A strong and reliable communication campaign is essential to
inform the public realistically and transparently about the real scope of Y2K risks, and the status of
efforts to mitigate them. A national contingency plan and sector-specific contingency plans must be
developed, tested, and communicated to the public at large to ensure that public perception is consistent
with reality. A Communication Plan, part of Component 1, will address this issue.
6. Environmental assessment:         Environmental Category   [I  A    t] B  [XI   C
7. Participatory approach:
The following activities are proposed to increase the direct participation of beneficiaries:
3   Sftegteing the National Y2K Coordination Unit;
*   Strengthning the National Y2K Resource Center,
* Building a National Contingency Plan involving all key players;
*   Creation of a Project Management Unit;
*   Weekly communication to Govemrnent;
*   Conununication Plan for the public; and
* Direct involvement of technical commissions' members including representatives from
beneficiaries (administratons, state-owned enterpnses, strategic-sector enterprises, SMEs'
organizations, rescue team organizations).
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
This project will enhance the capacity of the Government to manage its modernization process using
advanced technology and to inplement procedures and methods for monitoring large and complex
projects. In particular, Delegation d 1 'Informallque will be in a better position to prepare and
coordinate further computerization of most administrations through information collected dunng the
Y2K inventory and assessment.

ANNEx 2: DETALED PROJECT DEscRETON
Senegal: Year 2000 National Action Plan Support Project
The GoS has requested assistance from the World Bank to support the Senegalese Y2K
National Action Plan in mitigating Y2K related risks in its critical financial and public service
operations. Efforts are focused on those areas and priorities that are vital to the economy and
are still non-Y2K compliant.
These include:
(a) Public sector's large computer systems centers. They are in charge of vital
infonnation systems dealing with government financial revenue and expenditure,
population official registration and documents, and customs. In particular, customs'
operations are critical for the economy, and adequate resources must be allocated
to assess their Y2K compliance and to meet any remediation and contingency plan
needs.
(b) Senegalese ministries and public administrations that may face disruptions in their
daily functioning due to failure in office automation tools and database servers.
According to a review carried out by the Public Sector and Administrations
Commission for 14 institutions, around 75% of their total computer inventory of
2,500 pieces is non-compliant, and 15% will have to be replaced.
(c) State-owned enterprises, including railways and postal services, that have started
their Y2K remediation process but require more funds to cover their needs.
(d) Health is a specific and sensitive area where needs in electronic and computer-based
equipment cover administrative work as well as medical equipment. The synthesis
of recent surveys to make an inventory of Y2K bug problems is under review and
validation; and, at this stage; only a preliminary budget estimate has been provided.
(e) Privatized basic infrastructure service providers (water, electricity and
telecommunications companies) have been very active in fixing their Y2K problems.
This is mainly because these operations are managed by international partner
companies. Although there is a high degree of Y2K readiness in these operations,
the Government nevertheless needs to ensure and verify that all such systems are
fully compliant. This work will be carried out in the first assessment phase of
national and sector-specific contingency plans (Component 3).
(f) The scope of potential Y2K risks in private sector operations, especially in small
and medium enterprises (SMEs), is not covered well at this point. Building
awareness and disseminating information is a continuous process. The project will
include actions and means for strengthening the capacity of Y2K coordination to
adequately monitor the readiness status and to assess the potential Y2K risks for
SMEs and industries.
The project will cover the most urgent priorities (identified as priority number one) that
represent around 50% of the total needs identified. It is assumed that this approach will allow



Pop 19
Senegalese administrations and public services to provide daily services offered to the
population, and to carry out their own management under satisfactory conditions.
Plroject Componeats DescniptioB
This project will reinforce and accelerate ongoing work carried out by the GoS since the
beginning of 1999. It will take into account the existing framework and ongoing actions.
Due to the specific deadline of December 31, 1999 and the Y2K bug context, the project's time
frame will be split into four phases, linked to priorities:
Phase 1 will cover urgent actions already started or to be started before the end of
October 1999. A Project Preparation Facility advance (PPF) of US$750,000 and
retroactive financing up to US$2 million (200%o of the total amount of the project) were
approved in order to cover urgent actions already identified.
Phase 2 will cover actions to be implemented prior to December 31, 1999. As all
identified actions cannot be implemented by this date, activities identified as highly
critical by inventory and contingency plan studies have been selected, and
corresponding actions will be implemented by end-1999.
Phase 3 will cover actions to be implemented before March 31, 2000. This will
correspond to the continuation of already identified needs in less critical activities and
to remediate actual dysfunctions due to the Y2K bug. During that period, contingency
plans will have to be targeted to mitigate these eventual dysfunctions in critical areas at
national or sector-specific levels.
Phase 4 (April to December 2000) will cover actions dealing with consolidation and
modernization of computer systems and infrastructures already upgraded for Y2K.
Several needs have already been identified in enlarging network and open systems
infrastructures and allowing more decentralization of administration operations. The
Project Management Unit (PMtJ) will select actions according to government priorities
and available financing. However, all actions will have to be implemented before end-
December 2000 so that the last disbursements can be completed in June 2001.
Some actions have yet to be identified, so flexibility is provided to the project to permit the
PMU to adapt schedule and budget to real priorities, in line with the project's four phases as
described above.
A detailed Implementation Plan is described in Annex 8 and will be adjusted regularly
according to the progress of the project with regard to actual needs.
The project will be composed of three components: Project Management Strengthening,
Public Sector Remediation, National and Sector-specific Contingency Plans.
Component 1: Prolect Mananement Strenathenins
A Project Management Unit will be implemented and in charge of the following main tasks:
(a) overall supervision of the project, reporting weekly to the Y2K Project Steering
Committee chaired by the Minister of Scientific Research and Technology (MRST);
progress reports will be sent to World Bank project team monthly;



Pap 20
(b) selection of priorities and validation of actions to be launched during each phase by
beneficiaries in accordance with the project's four phases;
(c) supervision of budget, procurement and disbursements; in order to accelerate the
start of the project, related operational work will be subcontracted to a separate
organization, the Private Sector Foundation (FSP), which is already in charge of the
same tasks for other Bank projects;
(d) supervision and follow-up of remediation actions carried out in public sector areas;
(e) supervision and follow-up of contingency action plans' development and
implementation;
(f) definition and implementation of a Communication Plan dedicated to Y2K readiness
information dissemination; and
(g) training for increasing awareness of stakeholders and the public in Y2K risks and
Senegal's strategic areas' readiness.
The main identified actions are described in the following table:
Action Description                        Estimated cost

Communication, training, consultants' services                         220,000
Total Budget for this component is estimated to US$750,000, of which US$250,000 through
PPF.
ComDonent 2: Public Sector Remedlatlon
The remediation and upgrading of public sector systems is split into four main subcomponents:
* Main Administrations' Information Centers (DTAI, DAF, CID)
*   Other Public Ministries and Administrations
*   State-owned Enterprises
*   Health
Subcomponent 1: Main Adinistrations'Information Centers
(a) Direction du TraitementAutomatique de l'Information (DTAI--Ministry of
Finance) is in charge of critical operations such as civil servants' payroll, treasury,
tax recovery, debt management, etc.



Page 21
Y2K remediation plan is on track and most of the urgent work to be done will be
achieved on time; modernization projects are actively being prepared (networking,
decentralization, etc.)
Total Budget: US$3.1 million: Y2K remediation actions US$2.4 million; further
modernization US$0.7 million.
Financing: GoS has financed US$1.2 million, infoDev Grant US$0.5 million.
Remaining US$1.4 million (US$0.8 for tax recovery system) that DTAI requested for
project support retroactively and network modernization (US$0.6 million).
(b) Direction de l'Automatisation des Fichers (DAF--Computer Automation
Department - Ministry of Interior) is in charge of the election system, identity cards,
visas and passports, etc. The election system correction is almost complete (own
human resources); however, critical applications (identity cards, visas and
passports, human resources management) remain to be addressed.
Total Budget: US$2.1 million: hardware purchase US$0.6 million (Canadian funds);
remediation actions US$1.5 million.
Financing: Government US$0.9 million; hardware financed by Canada US$0.6; IDA
funds US$0.6 million.
(c) Centre Informalique des Douanes (CID--Customs Department of Informatics).
The GAINDE1 system is vital for Senegal and represents a major share of
government financial resources.
A Y2K remediation contract with ACFO (a French software company) of more than
US$1 million (financed by France) is at high risk, and the following urgent actions have
been agreed: audit of ACFO's planning and delivery by an independent consultant;
upgrading of CID's technical platform; and training and assistance to the 200 clients
connected to CID's system (these three actions are financed under PPF funds).
A specific Contingency Plan is necessary due to the very high impact of a failure in
customs' operations. TOR for suppliers' bids are under design by CID experts. A first
approach indicates that the solution proposed would cost around US$0.6.million.
Total Budget: US$1.7 million: technical platform upgrade and client installation and
test US$60,000; system remediation US$1 million; contingency plan US$600,000;
miscellaneous US$20,000.
Financing: France has agreed to support the remediation program (US$1 million).
Depending on findings and recommnendations of the consultant's audit, to be hired for
assessment of the situation under Component 1, US$ 0.7 million of IDA funds may be
required.

 Requests have been collected by Dekgation a I 'Informafique 2 through a comprehensive
inventory of all equipment installed in administrations and public services. It is proposed
that the project cover remediation actions representing about 50% of the needs identified
for 14 main Ministries and Services 3 .
*   It is assumed that due to time constraints only 50°/O to 60/o of this program can be
achieved before the end of CY99 and that further actions will be taken according to real
dysfunctions observed in early CY2000.
*   As most computer applications correspond to office automation (word processing and
spreadsheets), some light dysfunctions may not be critical for a short period.
Prioritization based on risk analysis according to the importance of each service and
application concerned will have to be managed by the Y2K Public Sector and
Administrations Commission in close connection with the PMU.
*   Preparation of implementation and some urgent remediation actions were started in
March 1999 and will be covered retroactively.

*   A budget of US$1.5 million has been allocated for this area, including a provision of
US$0.4 million with regard to remediation needs for administrations where the inventory
is not yet completed.
Subcomponent 3: State-owned Enterprises: (Poste, SNCS, PETROSEN, SODAGRI, SAED)4
The Y2K Coordination Committee has collected needs from state-owned enterprises impacted
by the Y2K problem. Each company has produced a detailed inventory and a remediation plan
that supports its request. Detailed Terms of references (TOR) are being prepared for
immediate and urgent actions.
A preliminary budget of US$1.6 million has been allocated for this area, including US$450,000
financed under the PPF.
Subcomponent 4: Health
The surveys of this area have not yet been completed, but first results show that the Y2K bug
impacts office automation and medical instruments.
A preliminary estimate of US$0.85 million for remediation actions is envisaged at this stage.
Component 3: Continuency Plan
It is obvious that due to time constraints all systems will not be fuMly ready by December 31,
1999, and that preventive means and organizations have to be put in place to solve critical
situations that can provoke domino and systemic impact on the whole Senegalese economy and
social life. Contingency Plans have to address this issue with two different targets:
*   A global target to ensure that the population and the economy will not be impacted by a
disaster due to Y2K major failures in strategic infrastructures (such as water, electricity,
telecommunications, finance); this will be addressed by a National Contingency Plan.
*   A sector-specific target to ensure that fimctinog of adminisaions and large
institutions/enterpnses will not be adversely afibeted by Y2K failures and that cnrical activities
will continue even with a decrease of quality of service; this will be addressed by Sector-specific
Contingency Plains.
Since work has yet to be undertaken in this area yet, a team of international consultants will be
hired, financed by PPF funds under Component 1, and supervised by the PMU to:
*   assess the overall readiness in critical areas;
*   evaluate risks and strategic activities to be guaranteed at national and sector levels; and
*   assist Senegalese contingency plan teams in the conception and implementation of
adequate contingency plans (studies, training, seminars) at national and sector-specific
levels.
All contingency action plans (national and sector-specific), with the exception of the one for
customs, will be put under the direct responsibility of the PMU, and a team leader appointed by
the Senegalese Government will be included in the PMU team filll time.

Budget estimate covering logistics, training, tests and specific investments is US$1.7 million
(25% for national plans and 75% for sector-specific plans); this amount includes financing of
some urgent remediation actions to correct systems' failures observed in the beginning of Year
CY2000.

ANNEX 5: PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS
Senegal: Year 2000 National Action Plan Support Project
General
1.   A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) for Senegal was carried out in July 1994
showing that procurement procedures in Senegal do not conflict with Bank Guidelines. No special
exceptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Credit documents for International
Competitive Bidding (ICB), since Senegal's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take
precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations.
2.   Goods financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with Bank's "Guidelines under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995, revised in January and August 1996, September 1997, and
January 1999), and Bank Standard Bidding Documents and Standard Evaluation Report will be used
for LIB. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally would be carried out in accordance
with Senegal's procurement laws and regulations, acceptable to IDA, provided that they assure
economy, efficiency, transparency, and broad consistency with key objectives of Bank Guidelines.
Under NCB, the procedures should ensure that: (i) methods used in evaluation of bids and the award of
contracts are made known to all bidders and not be applied arbitrarily; (ii) any bidder is given adequate
response time (four weeks) for preparation and submission of bids; (iii) bid evaluation and bidder
qualification are clearly specified in bidding documents; (iv) no preference margin is granted to
domestic manufactrers; (v) eligible firms are not precluded from participation; (vi) award wil be made
to the lowest evaluated bidder in accordance with pre-determned and transparent methods; (vii) bid
evaluation reports will clearly state the reasons to reject any non-responsive bid; and (viii) prior to
issuing the first call for bids, draft standard bidding documents prepared as annexes to the Procedures
Manual are submitted to IDA and found acceptable.
3.   Consultant services' and Employment financed by IDA wil be procured in accordance with the
Bank's "Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, revised
in September 1997 and January 1999). The standard Request for Proposal, as developed by the Bank,
wil be used for appointment of consultants.  Simplified contracts wiU be used for short-term
assignments, i.e., those not exceeding six months, carried out by firTns or individual consultants. The
Government was briefed during appraisal and received clarification during negotiations about the
features of the new Consultans Guidelines, in particular with regard to adverisement and bid opening.
4. The program elements by disbursement category, their estimated costs, and procurement methods
are sumunaized in Table A to this annex. Thresholds for procurement methods and prior review are
sunmmarized in Table B.
Goods
5.   A large volume of activities financed under the credit (US$3 million) will be used to procure
goods under LIB and NCB procedures.
6. The project is not expected to have any contract under ICB procedures. Contracts for goods
exceeding US$200,000 would be procured through LIB. The remaining contacts for goods, costing
less than US$200,000 per contract would be procured through NCB. Goods or spare parts which are
propritary and obtaiable from only one source would be contruaed through direct contracing m
accordance with para 3.7 of the Directives up to an aggregate of US$2 million. Small items which
cannot be grouped into contracts of US$20,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate of



Page 28
US$1 million, might be procured through prudent local shopping, on the basis of quotations obtained
from at least three reputable suppliers.
Consultnt Services
7.   Consulting services financed by IDA would be for: (i) studies, preparation of bidding documents,
accounting systems, financial management support, and financial audits; and (ii) technical assistance
and consultancies on technical matters and trauning - sklls gap analysis and skills development.
Consultants financed by IDA, totaling US$5 million, would be hired in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants" (January 1997, revised in September
1997 and January 1999). Selection would be based on competition among qualified shortlisted firms
through Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) by evaluating the qualiy of the proposals before
combining quality and cost evaluation by weighting and adding the quality and cost scores. The Project
Management Unit (PMU) would ensure a widely publicized procurement notice to obtain candidacy
from consultants. Based on agreed upon criteria, the PMU will maintain and update a list of
consultants which will be used to establish shortlists.
8.   Other methods would also apply. For audits and other services of a standard nature, up to an
aggregate amount of US$0.5 million, the Least-Cost Selection (LCS) would be the most appropriate
method - the firm with the lowest price being selected provided its technical proposal received the
minimum qualifying mark.
9.   Consultants' services for small and simple services, for small studies and technical assistance (for
contracts not exceeding US$100,000 and up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000) would be based
on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ), based on the consultants' experience and competence relevant to
the assignment.
10. Services for small studies and technical assistance which can be delivered by individuals would
be selected through comparison of qualifications among Individual Consultants (IC) expressing interest
in the assignment or approached direcdy.
11. Single-Source Selection (SSS) will be exceptionaly used provided the aggregate amount of such
contracts does not exceed the equivalent of US$200,000 over the project life.
12.  Shorlists of consultants for contacts estimated under US$50,000 may be comprised entirely of
national consultants, if a sufficient number of qualified finns (at least three) are locally available at
competitive costs. This would particularly apply to contracts for architectural and enginering services.
However, if foreign firms have expressed interest for those contracts, they will not be excluded from
consideration.
IDA Reviews
13.  Contracts fnanced by IDA above the threshold value of US$100,000 equivalent for goods wil be
subject to IDA's prior review procedures. The review process would cover about 60% of the contract
amounts for goods and consultants - see Table B of this annex. Selective post-review of contracts
awarded below the threshold level will apply to about one in three contracts and wiUl be carried out by
Bank staff - using audits, and other consultants, as necessary.
14. Bank staff will also review the selection process for the hiring of consultants proposed by the
Borrower. Prior IDA review for the selection of cmsulants wil include the review of budgets, short-
lists, selection procedures, requests for proposals, evaluation reports, contract awards, and negotiated
contracts. Prior IDA review will not apply to contracts for the recruitment of consulting finns and



Pop 29
individuals estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent, respectively. However,
the exception to prior IDA review will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless
of their value, to single-source hiring, to assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA, or to
amendments of contracts raising the contract value above the above-mentioned prior review thresholds.
For all consultant contracts subject to prior review (estimated above US$100,000), opening the
financial envelopes will not take place prior to receiving the Bank's no-objection to the technical
evaluation.
15. Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be maintained by the
Borrower for ex-post review by auditors and by IDA supervision missions.
16. For training abroad and in-country, the program - containing names of candidates, costs
estimates, content of courses, periods of training and selection of traimng institutions - will be reviewed
by IDA annually.
17. Frequency of procurement supervision missions proposed: one supervision mission every three
months will include special procurement supervision for post-review/audits.
18. Modification or waiver of the scope and conditions of contracts. Before agreeing to any material
extension, or any modification or waiver of the conditions of contracts that would increase aggregate
cost by more than 15% of the original price, the Borrower should specify the reasons thereof and seek
IDA's prior no-objection for the proposed modification.
Procurement Status of Oneoing Proiects and Proposed Arraneements
19. The Private Sector Foundation (PSF) established under the Private Sector Capacity Building
Project (Cr. 2759-SE) as a private agency, which has now gained significant experience in
procurement, would be entrusted with processing all procurement services as will be defined in the
project's Procedure Manual.
20. As condition of credit effectiveness, the Government of Senegal will establish effective and
efficient fast-track Y2K procurement guidelines, and a Y2K Tender Committee with a clear mandate
and special derogation for review and approval of Y2K procurement documents in a defined time frame.
Procedures Manual
21. The project's Procedures Manual and internal organization would include: (i) procedures for
caling for bids, consultants, and vendors, and awarding contracts; and (ii) disbursement procedures.
The Procedures Manual will be submitted to IDA for approval prior to credit effectiveness. In any
case, a version acceptable to IDA will be a condition of effectiveness.
22. Payment to Contractors. The Govermment had agreed with IDA during appraisal on the principle
of opening a special account in a commercial bank.
23.  Prior to credit effectiveness, the Govermment wil submit and agree with IDA on: (a) a version of
the Procedures Manual; and (b) a contract with the Private Sector Foundation. The Govermnent will
also give assurance that it will: (i) use the Procedures Manual; (ii) use the Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents for ICB, the Standard Request for Proposals for the selection of consultants, and the
Standard Bid Evaluation reports; (iii) apply the procurement procedures and arrangements outlined



Pae 30
above; (iv) update the Procurement Plan' on a regular basis to compare target times and actual
completion, and transmit it to IDA, during implementation, with all procurement-related documents;
and (v) carry out, during quarterly reviews, an assessment of the effectiveness of bidding procedures
and performance, as they relate to the program's procurement experience, and propose for IDA and
other donors' consideration any modification to the current procedures to the extent that would
accelerate procurement, while sti1l maintaining compliance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines and
adequate control over contract awards and payments.
24. The Government gave assurance at negotiations that it will take the necessary measures to ensure
that procurement phases do not exceed the following target time periods:

Disbursements
Allocation of loan proceeds
25.  The credit will be disbursed over a period of eighteen months. Disbursements will be made
against eligible project expenditures for goods and services as shown in Table C above. Goods will be
financed at 100% for imported items and 90% for locally purchased items, while consulfing services
will be financed at 100% (excluding taxes). All disbursements will be made in confonnity with the
procedures outlined in the disbursement handbook and a disbursenmnt letter that will be sent to the
Borrower upon project effectiveness.
Use of Statements of Expenditure (SQE)
26. All disbursements against contracts below the following ceilings will be made against
Statements of Expendite:
- US$100,000 equivalent for goods,
- US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firms, and
- US$50,000 equivalent for individual consulting contracts.
27. For all expenditures eligible under SOE, detailed supporting documents showing evidence of
payments to contactors and suppliers will be kept at the PSF. These documents will be made
available to Bank supervision missions and the annual audits.
Special Account
28. To facilitate disbursement of IDA funds, the Government will open a Special Account (SA) at a
commercial bank acceptable to IDA to be managed by the PMU. The authorized allocation will be
CFAF 800,000,000 and will cover four months of eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness and
subnmission of a witidrawal request by the Borrower, an amount representing 50 percent of the
authorized allocation wiUl be deposited in the SA. Once payments through the SA wiU have totaled
SDR 1.6 milion, the full amount of the SA can be claimed.
29. Special Account replenishment applications must be prepared on a monthly basis, regardless of
the level of activity during the month. All replenishment applications will be supported by the
necessary supportng documentation, the SA bank statement and a reconciliaton of this bank statement.
Direct payment requests and applications for issuance of special commitents should be valued at
about 20% of the special account advance outstanding at the time of submission. The SA will be
audited annually by iependent auditors acceptable to the Bank.

ANNEx 6: FINANcLAL MANAGEMENT
Senegal: Year 2000 National Action Plan Support Project
1. Financial management of the project will be carried out, under the superision of the PMU, by
the Private Sector Foundation (PSF) which is the executing agency of the ongoing IDA-financed
Private Sector Development Project. This arrangement will ensure that the financial management
system will provide the project and IDA with accurate and tmely information regarding resources and
expenditures. The financial management system will include accounting, financial reporting and
auditing elements.
Financial Mananement Assessment
2.     An assessment of the financial management capacities of the PSF was done to verify if its
financial management system can handle all accounting aspects for the Year 2000 Support Project. As
mentioned above, the PSF, established under the Private Sector Capacity Building Project (Cr. 2759-
SE) as a private agency, which has now gained significant experience in financial management,
disbursement and procurement, would be entrusted with processing all financial services as defined in
the project's Procedures Manual. PSF's accounting system was assessed and found satisfactory. It
can be used for many project and can be custmized to reflect the expenditures of each project by
components, subcomponents and expenditure categories. PSF has adequate accounting capacities as it
is staffed with three former big auditing firms' employees who have gained significant experience with
World Bank financed projects. And since PSF is already in charge of the accounting of the
Agricultural Export Promotion Project (Cr. 3017-SE) in addition to the accounting of the Private
Sector Capacity Building Project, it is envisaged that PSF would hire one additional accountant who
will be specifically in charge of keeping the accounts of the Year 2000 Support Project.
Accountinf
3.     The project financial management system will ensure adherence to accounting and auditing
standards acceptable to the Bank in order to (a) reliably record and report all financial transactions of
the project including those transactions involving the use of Bank finds; and (b) provide sufficient
financial information for managing and monitoring project activities. The PSF's accounting software
will be used and customized to meet these requirements.
4. A consultant will be appointed to develop detailed procedures for project accounting for each
compoent, including accounting and internal control systems, that accord with such accounting
standards or agreed format that (a) reliably record and report all financial transactions of the project,
and (b) provide sufficient financal information for managing and monitoring project activities. The
objective of these procedures is to ensure consistent financial reporting and to provide reasonable
assurance that accounts are properly recorded and resources safeguarded. The underlying systems take
into account the specific needs and circumstances for each component including accountng procedures
to be followed by each one of the entities involved in the implementation of the project including the
Project Management Unit and PSF. Terms of reference, which are under preparation, have to be
approved by IDA.
Financial Revortinf
5.     The annual financial statements of the project will be prepared in accordance with generally



Pop 34
accepted accounfing principles in Senegal. They will include a statement of sources and uses of funds,
a statement of reconciliation of the special accounts, a balaince sheet and required notes to the financial
statements. The financial statements will be submitted to IDA no later than six months after the end of
the fiscal year.
Auditing
6.     The financial statements of the project will be audited for each year by an independent auditor
acceptable to IDA in accordance with standards on auditing also acceptable to IDA. Audit reports of
reasonable scope and detail would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the audited
period. The selection of the auditor is a condition of effectiveness.
7.     The auditor will provide an opinion on the project's financial statements, statements of
expenditure (SOE) and special account (SA). The audit will include: (a) an assessment of the
adequacy of accounting and intemal control systems to monitor expnditur  and other financial
transactions and ensure safe custody of project-financed assets; (b) a determination as to whether the
borrower and project implementing entities have maintained adequate documentation on all relevant
transactions; and (c) verification that expenditures submitted to the Bank are eligible for financing, and
identification of any ineligible expenditures
Staffing
8.     PSF's accounting staffing has been assessed and found satisfictory. Adequate accounting
stffing will be maintained throughout the life of the project in PSF, which is in charge of keeping the
project's accounts.
Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI)
9.    According to the arrangements planned, minimum financial management requirements will be
met prior to Credit effectiveness. However, all capacities necessary for full LACI implementation, in
particular PMR-based disbursement, are unlikely to be in place prior to Credit effectiveness. Due to
the nature of the project, which should be disbursed over a period of 18 months, an action plan for the
application of the PMR-based disbursement method will not be developed for this project.
