MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECTs Project Completion Report on India
,Guarat water Suinlv and Sewerage Prgject (Credit 1280-IN)
Attached is the report antitled "Project Completion Report on India -
Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 1280-IN)" prepared by the South
Asia Regional Office. No Part II was provided by the borrower.
This, overly complex, project closed after a three year extension of the
credit's closing date and a major restructuring with some of the major components
still incomplete and SDR 15.6 million out of the original credit of SDR 63.8
million canceled. The large number of different components clearly overburdened
both the newly created implementing agency and the Bank (over 300 contracts
required Bank rwview).   The projected institutional improvements did not
materialixe and none of the financial covenants were complied with. The low cost
sanitation component was, reportedly, successful, after a NGO took over
anagement but no details are provided. Overall the performance of the project
is rated as unsatisfactory, institutional development as negligible and the
sustainability of its limited benefits as unlikely.
The generally informative and well written PCR has some shortcomings in
the provision of cost and financial data. The project may be audited.

PROJECT COMPLEllON REPORT
INDIA
OUJARAT WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PJROJECT
(CEMDIT 1280-IN)
P,reface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage
Project for which an IDA Credit in the amount of SDR 63.8 million was approved on July 6, 1982 and
which became effective on February 8, 1983. An amount of SDR 11.0 million was cancelled on
December 5, 1991. The project was officially restructured in March 1, 1989. The Credit was closed
on December 31, 1991 and an undisbursed amount of SDR 4,610,215.56 was cancelled on May 13,
1992.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the South Asia
Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).
Preparation of the PCR commenced during the February 1992 supervision mission and
is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, Credit and Project Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda. PCR preparation was
delayed because the Governent needed time to prepare the financial and cost tables following the last
disbursement in May 1992.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
GUJARAT WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1280M1
ESvaluation Summar
1.          bei,e
1.1        The project included both urban and rural areas in the state of Gujarat. The objectives of
the project were to: (i) bring water to rural communities where water is scarce or unsafe for human con-
sumption; (i) improve or extend water supply and sewerage services in selected urban centers; (iii)
extend and upgrade sewage collection and disposal systems in densely populated areas in major municipa-
lities, including the capital city of Ahemedabad; (iv) provide low-cost sanitation in medium-size towns
which are unable to afford water-borne sewerage; and (v) strengthen the institutional framework of the
sector through Improved financil nanagement, accounting, billing and collection practices, the intro-
duction of cost recovery and the establishment of training facilities for water supply and sewerage
personnel at all levels within the sector.
2.         ImDlementation Exgerience
2.1        Both the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB) and the Ahemedabad
Municipal Corporation (AMC) were expected to implement the project in a four- to five-year period com-
mencing with detailed design in July 1981 and the first disbursement in December 1982. Physical
constuction was expected to have been completed by December 1986, at which time all schemes should
have been operational. It was also anticipated that the rural schemes would be completed one year ahead
of the urban schemes. However, land acquisition and preparation of tender documents did not proceed
as smoothly as expected to permit the timely bidding and awarding of major contracts. Ibis resulted in
long implementation delays. In December 1986, the initially planned physical completion date, less than
one-quarter of the Credit had been disbursed and none of the major components were completed. The
original closing date was September 30, 1987.
2.2        On March 1, 1989, the project was officially restructured to include additional water supply
components to help the hardest hit of the drought-stricken rural areas of Gujarat. The closing date was
extended to September 30, 1990 and then to September 30, 1991. The overall disbursement rate was
increased from approximately 50% to approximately 80%1 and covenants dealing with cost recovery and
billings and collections modified so that compliance with revised target dates could be reasonably
expected. The closing date was extended once again to December 31, 1991 in order to produce an
acceptable action plan for cost recovery in rural water schemes. However, The Government did not
produce an acceptable plan and the Credit was closed on December 31, 1991. An undisbursed balance
of SDR 4.6 million was cancelled on May 13, 1992.
t       The inreaset disbursemt rate was to assist the Government of India in dealing with the oil crisis at ht time.



- iii -
S \ t. ~Resu;
3.1        Project results are mixed. The GWSSB, created during project preparation as the successor
to an erstwhile government department, hc Po experience with the Bank and did not at the beginning
believe in appointing enginiering and financial management consultants to assist with project imple-
mentation. There were considerable procurement delays and physical implementation was behind
schedule. In the end, most of the project components were *'wmpleted except for some minor works and
the major AMC sewage treatment plants, which experienced lengthy land acquisition delays, were s:ill
under construction on the closing date. The low-st sanitation progran in the and rural urban areas,
implemented by a Non-Governmenta Organization (NGO), was successful.
3.2        RCatively little progress was made on sector policy and institutional issues.  The
Government of Gujarat (GOG) did not comply with the financial covenJ. which required a modest tariff
to meet operation and maintenance costs for rural water supply. Also, AMC was not in compliance with
the cost recovery covenants for water supply and sewerage services. GWSSB's own institutional develop-
ment was long delayed because of the reluctance to obtain assistance from consultants and consequent
delays in the timely submission of financial statements and audit reports. Nevertheless, as project imple-
mentation advanced, there was improvement in most of these aspects including the concept of cost
recovery, on which there is a greater awareness of the need given GOG's shrinking resources.
4.         Sustainabilky
4.1        The prospects for achieving project sustainability are not good unless GO0  takes the
necessary actions to increase tariffs/collections and improve efficiency. As projected in the SAR, ihe
necessary resources for Ahemedabad car. be achieved through the delinking of water and sewerage bills
from property tax. GOG has initiated actions designed to implement delinking and tariff increases in
1993 under the Gujarat Urban Development Project. Annual twriff increases are also needed in the other
municipalities during the project phase-in period. For rural areas, again some actions have been taken
to increase tariffs and improve recovery levels to 50% in 1993 and 100% by 199S, but the effects in
increased resources have yet to be confirmed.
5.         L-essons LW_en
5.1        rojecPreparation. While project preparation did address most of the main sector issues,
implementation delays might have been avoided if the design engineering and procurement arrangements
for major contracts had been further advanced before project approval.
5.2        Water Tariffs. One of the key policy elements of the project was the increase and mainten-
ance of tariffs at an adequate level to allow sustainable operations. This objective was never achieved.
In hindsight, more prompt and forceful actions were needed: (i) during preparation, some 'up-front"
action should have been taken towards meeting this objective; and (ii) during implementation, suspension
of the Credit when covenants were not being met. In addition, less complex tariff covenants might have
obtained better results.
5.3        NGO Involvement. Progress was minimal in the low-cost sanitation program in the rural
areas until the appointment of a reputable NGO. The importance of NGO involvement and community
participation is apparent.



- iv -
5.4        Instittional A  gemMents. In effect, GWSSB's main function has been to arrange the
design and constmction of water schemes. Operations and maintenance of the schemes was left with the
municipalities and local bodies. This separation of major functions has not provided the proper incentives
needed to operate in an efficient manner. An institutional arrangement which embraces both the
construction and the operations and maintenance functions and also Includes resource mobilization and
financial management is needed.

2.         Bakeround
2.1        As in much of India, water supply and sewerage systems in the urban centers of Gujarat
state are owned, operated and maintained by local bodies such as municipal corporations, municipalities
and towns. In the rural areas, Regional Water Supply Schemes (RWSS), serving several communities,
are owned by the Government of Gujarat (OG), and Individual Rural Water Supply Schemes (IRWSS),
each serving a single village, are built by GO and handed over to the Village Panchayats for operation
and maintenance (O&M). The Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB), under the Water
Supply, Health and Family Welfare Department, GO, builds, operates and maintains the stateowned
RWSS and builds and hands over, for O&M, the IRWSS to the Village Panchayats. Created by 000
in 1979, GWSSB became fully effective in April 19Q1. In addition to building the RWSS and IRWSS,
its mandate was to also finance, build and commission water and sewer projects in the urban areas and
hand over the facilities to the respective local bodies for operation and maintenance. However, local
bodies have the option to finance and execute such projects by themselves.
2.2        The amount of financial assistance provided by GOG varies depending on the size of the
local entity. Municipal Corporations do not normally have access to GOG funds for capital works while
the smaller municipalities and town Panchayats are supported by GOG at varying levels based on size and
importance. The Ahiemedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), which should finance its own services,
is the largest of the municipalities in the state and was the executing agency for a large sewerage
component under a separate Project Agreement of this Credit.
3.         Sector. Status. Objectives and Policy
3.1        Gujarat state covers an area of 187,091 sq kIn, is situated in the northwest of India and has
a total population of about 40 million distributed among some 216 urban areas and 18,275 villages where-
in 70% of the Gujaratis live. The area has an uneven distribution of water resources which causes nearly
half of the village population to suffer from lack of safe drinking water. There are three perennial rivers
- Narmada, Tapi and Mahi - all of which are located to the south. The semi-arid area of Kutch, to the
northwest, has no reliable source of water supply. More, with few exceptions, ground water is the main
source of water supply. However, it is greatly limited because of rocky stratum, or increasing salinity



-2 -
and contamination by fluorides, as in the Mehsana District, due to overpumping for irrigation and lack
of GOG regulation. In recent years, the seasonally low ground water supply levels have become even
lower, due to frequent and long droughts, the severest occurring in 1986/87 when most wells failed
completely. A water resource sector development plan and the political will for its implementation are
urgently needed to prioritize actions which would encourage water conservation and control pumping for
irrigation, the main cause f3r the irreversible degradation of aquifers and increasing shortages of potable
water supplies in the rural areas.
3.2        Resources devoted to the sector have not been sufficient or well focused. GOI, in the sixth
Five Year Plan (1980-85) provided 2.2% of the Plan for rural water ($505 million) and 1.8% for urban
water ($411 million), an increase of three to four times over the previous plan. At the GOG level, how-
ever, because of competing demands for resources within the state by other sectors, cyclical droughts,
lack of planning, variable technical and management skills, shortages of key materials and equipment,
as well as foreign exchange constraints, only 1%-2% of public expenditure were being invested in the
sector. in general, COG's Dolicy has been to extend distribution systems, with limited emphasis on
source development and little or no attempt to Improve safety of the drinking water quality through
improved operation and maintenance and the reduction of unaccounted. for water. This policy has resulted
in even greater water shortages. A comprehensive sector planning study Is therefore needed.
3.3        The GOI sector development objective for sewerage coverage was 80%. In Gujarat, 19
urban areas have water-borne se werage facilities with partial service coverage and only primary sewage
treatment. However, the major cities of Ahemedabad, Baroda, Bhavnagar and Surat operate systems with
secondary sewage treatment facilities. GOI's target of 80% urban sewerage coverage became unachiev-
able in the near term, and the sector development objective has shifted to greater use of low-cost sanita-
tion technology, wherever feasible. The project's low-cost sanitation program, developed with this
objective in view, has surpassed expectations but much remains to be done.
4.         Proect Objietiv
4.1        The objectives of the project were to: (i) bring water to rural commrunities where water is
scarce or unsafe for human consumption; (ii) improve or extend water supply and sewerage services in
selected urban centers; (Iii) extend and upgrade sewage collection and disposal systems in densely popu-
lated areas In major municipalities, including the capital city of Ahemedabad; (iv) provide low-ost sanita-
tion in medium-size towns which are unable to afford water-borne sewerage; and (v) strengthen the
institutional framework of the sector through improved financial management, accounting, billing and
collection practices, the introduction of cost recovery and the establishment of training facilities for water
supply and sewerage personnel at all levels within the sector.
5.         Project Description
5. 1       The project had six components:
(1)   Urban Water Supplies - Source Development, Transmission. Treatment and Distribution
Systems
(a) Blhavnagar - 60 mld from Shetrunji irrigation reservoir;
(b)  lamnagar - 25 mid from Und-l irrigation reservoir;
(c)   Godhra - 10.65 mld from the Pan-AM irrigation canal;



-3-
(d)  NMiad - 9 tube-wells yielding 16.8 mid; and
(e)   And - 3 tube-wells yielding 5.28 mid.
(2)   UJrbn Sewerage
(f) Ahemedabad - peripheral trunk sewers, one on either side of the Sabarmati River,
terminating at two pumping stations of 621 ndd and 795 mld peak capacity and two
aerated lagoons 227 mld and 155 mld average flow capacity.
(g)  £gkot - a sewerage system for the congested city center, with eight zonal lift
stations, and one terminal punmping station and aerated lagoons.
(h)  Nadiad. Anand and Savarkundla - extensions to the existing sewerage systems in the
case of Nadiad and Anand, and a complete new system for Savarkundla. All three
projects involve zonal lift stations, terminal pumping and aerated lagoons.
(3)   RuralW atr uppiy
(a) Regional Village Water Supplies - provision of water supplies to 255 villages,
divided into 7 regional groups, each being supplied from multiple tube-well
instllations.
(j)   ndividual Village Water Supolies - water supply for 111 'no source (problem)
villages, each supplied from its own Individual source: 53 from tube-wells, and the
remainder from dug (open) wells.
(4)   Low_-ost Sanitation
(k)  Low-cost sanitation for 15 middle-size towns: 26,800 pour-flush and communal
facilities with 440 seats.
(S)   Common Serices
O)   Worishops, stores, vehicles, equipment for sewer cleaning, leak detection and
laboratories.
(6)   Insutional Development
(m) Constructing and equipping a training institute.
(n)  Technical assistance for designing and implementing training programs.
6.         Project Design and Organization
6.1        The project was ffrst mentioned in an IBRDIWHO Cooperative Program in 1979 and
presented to IDA in August 1980. Preparation began under difficult circumstances because the Public
Health Engineering Department was in the process of becoming GWSSB. A new chairman was appointed
who had to deal with Bank project preparation missions. The project preparation period of only one year



-4-
was short. The time between appraisal and Board
presentation was long and somewhat compensated
for the short preparation period.
Prjeot ldentli.eation            August 1980

issues:                                     B Pordesentation                    July 1982
(a)   Cost Recov=: During negodtations, a schedule was agreed to achieve recovery of O&M
by all project towns by 1988. For the rural villages, a Rs 6.00 per capita tariff for O&M
was also agreed. Furthermore, it was agreed that the short-fall between revenues and O&M
was to be covered by GOG out of the current 10% surcharge on the sales tax.
(b)  Household Conneti o Sewag Systems: A loan fiund at the interest rate of 6% with
repayment in 60 equal monthly installments, was included as a separate item in the project
for the purpose of making soft loans available to property owners of the lower income
group to ensure that they could meet the expense of improving existing sanitary facilities
within the household and making connections to the sewerage system.
(c)   Mering: There was virtually no metering of domestic consumption in the project towns.
Industrial and comwnercial connections are metered without exception throughout the project
aea, and on this limited scale, the meters have been kept in reasonable working order.
GWSSB and AMC agreed to study the possibility of introducing domestic metering.
(d)  Leak Detectio: It was agreed during negotiations that GWSSB would establish a leak-
detection unit, equipped and trained to detect and reduce unaccounted for water and would
continue leakage surveys of distribution systems after transfer of the systems to local
authority ownership, as well as providing this service at a later date to the whole sector as
required.
(e) Low Cost Sanitation Program: At project appraisal, about two-thirds of the population in
the 15 participating towns had no in-house latrine facilities. The objective of the first stage
of the program (1982-86) was to reduce this sanitation deficiency by half, at which stage
overall coverage would be 61%, of which 95% would have individual ho-usehold latrines.
The majority of latrines to be provided under the project were to be of the pour-flush type
with leach pits, except in areas where soil conditions were unsuitable or where there was
a danger of contamination of drinking water sources. It was planned that the very poor
would receive a 100% grant of the estimated cost of conversion or construction. GOG
would provide 75% and the remainder would be provided by the local authority. A
minimum of 30% of the total program cost was mandated to the poor section of the
community. The less poor and low and middle income groups had lower subsidy levels of
80% and soft loans.
(tD Operations and Maintenance: While GWSSB did the construction, it was agreed that the
municipalities would be responsible for O&M. This was also the case for the IRWSS.
However, in the case of RWSS, GWSSB was to be responsible for both construction and
O&M.

6.3        Proj CkgSiSQ. AMC took responsibility for implementation of its sewerage project
and entered into a project agreement with IDA. GWSSB, under another project agreement, was respon-
sible for implementation of all other project components. The sewerage component of the Rajkot
Municipal Corporation (RMC) was Initially implemented by GWSSB, but RMC was unhappy with the
slow progress and decided to take up the completion of the work itself.
6.4        The project design and organization appeared reasonable and addressed most of the
important Issues. However, the overall need for a water resource sector development plan for the state
was not considered. Also, preparation of the "engineering aspects" (final designs, bidding documents,
procure¢mt packaging and consultant services) and land acquisition were not completed to a sufficient
level. Also, litte "up-front" actions on the policy issues (tariffs, metering, and leak detection) were
initiated during preparation. Later, project implementation presented many difficulties; these are
discussed in the next sections.
7.         Poect lnp     n
7.1          gjnLect Sar--. Following Board apuroval in July 1992, the main delay in design and start
of physical Implemetaton was the appointnent of consultants for both GWSSB and AMC components.
Retroactive financing for consultant services was provided but not used because of the time taken by GOG
to reach an understanding of the need for consultant assistance.
7.2        I ementation Eeie. Both GWSSB and AMC expected to implement the project in
a four- to five-year period commencing with detailed design in July 1981. Physical constr "on was
expected to be completed by end 1986, at which time all schemes should have been operational. It was
also anticipated that the rural schemes would be completed one year ahead of the urban schemes.
Preparation of tender documents was expected to proceed smoothly to permit bidding and award of major
materials and equipment contracts in the thi-d quarter of 1982 and most of the major civil works contracts
by end 1982. It was, however, recognized that this optimistic scheduling depended on careful planning
and good management, neither of which were forthcoming and long delays resulted. Ten years later, at
the close of the loan, the large AMC sewage treatment plant and the Rajkot sewerage scheme were still
incomplete. The appointment of consultants and preparation of the final designs and engineering, together
with an excessively large number of small contracts and slow contract award procedures, seriously
delayed project implementation. The inherent risks in procurement delays by a new borrower should
have been more carefully evaluated in scheduling the four and one-half year completion period. Better
up-front procurement planning, related to the number and size of contracts would have aided more timely
implementation. Also, there were problems in land acquisition, poor contractor perfbrmance and
implementation was often delayed due to lack of counterpart funds. Finally, the large number of
contracts, subject to the Bank's prior review, also contributed to implementation delays.
7.3        Proiect Restructuring. In September 1987, GOI made an urgent request to the Bank, on
behalf of Gujarat, for drought-related assistance due to the failure of the monsoon for three successive
years (1985-87). The Bank responded with three missions - October 1987, February 1988 and July 1988
- and the Board approved the resaructuring of Credit 1280 and Credit 1643 (Gujarat Urban Development
Project) to include additional water supply components to help the hardest hit of the drought-stricken rural
areas of Gujarat. Since Credit 1643 had a later closing date, a larger share of the drought-related works
were included in that project.

7.4        In addition to including two new RWSS and an expanded sanitation component, the principal
changes to Credit 1280 were: (a) extension of the Credit closing date of December 31, 1988 to
September 30, 1990 (original closing date was September 30, 1987); and (b) increasing the average rate
of disbursements from April 1, 1988 through September 30, 1989 (for withdrawal applications received
on or prior to that date) from 50% net of taxes and duties to approximately 80%.
7.5        Project restructuring also modified various financial covenants. Basic cost recovery goals
were not changed, but target dates for reaching those goals were extended so that compliance with revised
covenants could be reasonably expected. Further discussion of financial covenants is provided in Section
8 and Part IM (Status of Covenants).
7.6        Poect Cos. A summary of project costs is provided in Table I; further details are shown
in Part m.
7.7        Overall costs, expressed in Rupees, were
nearly 50% greater than estimated at the time of appraisal.      Table I

GWSSB was a new borrower and reluctant to use consulting services there were considerable delays.
The remaining contracts were subject to random post review after contract award. The low review thres-
hold also caused communication delays between GWSSB and the Bank since almost 300 contracts were
sent to Washington for review, slowing physical implementation. The threshold for equipment and
materials was increased to US$150,000 at the time of restructuring.

be disbursed over a five-year period,   W
but in fact, extended to ten years      WS -O --            A:t s ll Zl:
because of restructuring and imple-       z
mentation delays (see Part IL). Only                                         NA_ 
in 1987 were targets exceeded (Fig.     20
1).
8.    Pr       o Results               12-
8.1        After much delay, most                  _
of the project components were com-
pleted except for the major Ahemeda-    4m
bad Municipal Corporation sewage
aerated lagoon with a total capacity of    PM  F1M"  FM   FMW   F7 Fa
380 mld.  Since restructuring, the
program  for low-cost sanitation  Figure 1
actually exceeded all targets and has
been successful.
8.2        However, except for the low-cost sanitation program, little progress has been made in
addressing five of the six sector issues oudined in the original design as described in para 6.2.
(a)    Cost Reor. Cost recovery for urban and rural water supply and sewerage services has
been and continues to be a recurring and unresolved issue which has existed from project
appraisal in 1980181 throughout the supervision period. Despite repeated assurances by
GOG and AMC over the past decade that tariffs would be increased to cover, at a
minimum, operation and maintenance costs and some part of debt service costs, there has
been no significant progress in any project towns except one, and none at all in the rural
schemes. GOG sometimes indicated that the drought situation should ease before tariffs
could be changed. Overall, there was a lack of political will to implement the tariff
increases. Failure to comply with the cost recovery covenant for rural water supply was
the major reason for not extending the Credit closing date in December 1991.
(b)   Housebold Connections to Sewerage Systems. The arrangements for loans to the lower
income groups proved to be too difficult to administer. As a result, none of the project
towns have had success with this arrangement as the householders did not apply for sewer
connections.
(c)    Metering. GWSSB and AMC engaged consultants who studied the possibility of intro-
ducing domestic metering and concluded that because of the low pressures and intermittent
service, domestic metering would not be feasible. Even though water resources are scarce,
no attempt was undertaken to start a phased program of installing meters.
(d)    Leak Detection. GWSSB, likewise, claimed that because of the low system pressures, they
were unable to form a leak detection unit. Again, little was done to conserve basic water
resources and improve system efficiency.



-8 -
(e)   QOeratinon  nd Maintenance. O&M performance in GWSSB, RWSS and the municipal
towns suffers from lack of funding and trained staff; this results in the distribution of unsafe
drinking water. According to a consultant's report, about one in three IRWSS are non-
operational at any point in time. AMC is satisfactorily maintaining the intceptor sewers
and pumping stations it bas built In the project. A permanent training unit in the training
school (established to train staff in O&M) does not have adequate GOG budgetary support.
Also, municipal councils and local bodies are reluctant to release staff for training. The
training done up to now is yet to result in noticeable O&M improvements. 1he entire
training program therefore requires review and change to achieve even some modest gains
in sustainability.
8.3        Economic EvuaIation. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) includes estimates of Internal
Rates of Return (IRR) and approximate Average Incremental Cost (AIC) calculations for the urban water
supply schemes. The IRR analysis showed an aggregate return of 2.5% for all projects, based on a series
of assumptions which included several real increases in tariff levels over the discounting period. This
was considered acceptable since the stream of benefits included revenues only and could be considered
to be significantly higher In economic terms due to the acknowledged, but difficult to quantify, health and
other associated benefits.
8.4        The Economic Analysis in Part I
shows the expected economic results of imple-                Table n
menting the Jamnagar water project and the   IRR Analyses for Jamnaar Water and Nadiad Seweoma
Nadiad sewerage project.  IRR analyses were                    Iteral Rate of RetuM

rates (5% per year). Per capita consumption rates   revue iner. in 1994
were taken from the SAR and used to convert
available data on average annual tariffs per household into equivalent per cubic meter tariffs. The higher
return shown for the Jamnagar water supply project is expected since Jamnagar is one of the better
performing municipalities and water projects typically will yield higher economic returns than wastewater
projects. The Nadiad sewerage project, however, is significantly less sensitive to variations in assumed
conditions. It should be noted that the two analyses are based only on cash revenues and do not include
health and other tertiary benefits, which are difficult to measure.
8.6        AIC calculations have also been prepared which show a cost of about Rs 3.0 per cubic meter
for the Jamnagar water project and Rs 3.6 per cubic meter for the Nadiad sewerage project. These
compare to the AIC calculations in the SAR of Rs 0.79 for Jamnagar and Rs 1.93 for Nadiad.
9.         Financial Covena
9.1        Proect Towns. Detailed financial projections for each town, prepared in a form designed
specifically to facilitate assessments of comp:iance with financial covenants, are presented in Annex 2.
In summary:



-9-
*    Towns were in compliance with the "letter" of the cost recovery covenant because of the
delay in implementation of the physical works. However, with the commissioning of the
works, annual increases will be required for most towns in the future. Large annual
increases will be needed In Rajkot and Savarkundla.
*    Except for Godhra, towns were in compliance with the collection performance covenant.
Savarkundla and Rajkot will need to focus on this matter as they begin operations of the
new systems.
*    The towns were generally unable to comply with the debt service coverage covenant; strict
interpretation of this covenant would have curtailed further borrowing.
9.2        Ahemedabad. AMC has not complied with the requirement to employ user charges and,
due to widespread legal appeals of property taxes in the city, has collected only about 50% of the water
and sewerage taxes levied. Even if it had collected 100% of the taxes, it would not have been in compli-
ance with the cost recovery covenant.
9.3        The need to delink water and sewerage revenues from the property tax was included In the
operational action plan in the SAR for the Gujarat Urban Development Project in 1985. The issue was
raised during supervision missions on numerous occasions without result. While evaluating its options
relative to delinking, AMC undertook a series of actions to improve its collection performance, such as
pursuing out-of-court setflements and establishing a special tax court, but little if any, increase in
collections was realized. Recently, in connection with the extension of the Gujarat Urban Development
Project, progress has been made to improve cost recovery.
9.4        Rural Schem. By the time the regional schemes began to be completed (1990), it was
clear that no steps had been taken to implement collection of the required Rs 6.0 per capita and for
transmitting the proceeds to GWSSB. At the insistence of the 1990 supervision mission, the Water
Supply Department and Panchayat Department issued instructions to district development officers aimed
at implementng the required collections. The processes were initiated and GWSSB also began issuing
invoices to the panchayats within the regional schemes. These actions, however, were not sufficiendy
timely or effective to achieve any significant collections by December 1991. This fact had a bearing on
the decision to close the project as of December 31, 1991.
9.5        Audit. By covenant, participating agencies were required to have an annual audit
performed by an external auditor and the report submitted to the Bank no later than nine months after the
close of each fiscal year. Problems in achieving compliance with the covenant were persistent. At
project closing, only two municipalities had submitted the reports, and three others had made firm
commitments to submit overdue reports by June 1992 (6 months late). GWSSB itself was more than one
year late in submission of its 1989/90 report.
9.6        Commercial Accounting Systems. From a review of the SAR (paras 4.11 and 5.21), it is
apparent that the Bank's appraisal team was lead to believe that consultants had already been employed
by GWSSB and AMC (without Bank financing) during project preparation to design and implement, by
April 1, 1982, commercial accounting and financial management systems. However, at project closing,
GWSSB and all municipalities still lacked fully functioning commercial accounting systems. Financial
management consultants have been employed recently under Credit 1643 to assist the corporations with
fte improvement of their accounting systems.



- 10-
10.       Impact of the Project
10.1      Although there are questions about its sustainability, the project had a beneficial impact -
both urban and rural populations in water-short areas of Gujarat now have piped water supply. Also,
four municipalities and several villages and small towns have benefitted from improved sanitation.
GWSSB has also benefitted from the institutional development and training components of the project,
though there is much room for improvement.
11.       hank Performance
11.1      From the beginning, appraisal and supervision teams had difficulty in persuading 000 to
appoint consultants for improving managerial, accounting and engineering performance, thereby greatly
affecting timely project implementation. Supervision missions were, for the most part, adequately spaced
and quite effective, considering the long distances over which project sites were located. The principal
lessons for other Bank financed projects are more "up-front" activities during project preparation and
prompt enforcement of project conditionalities.
12.       Borrower Performance
12.1      Borrower performance varied according to the quality of GWSSB's management team which
changed several times over the ten-year implementation period. The first two years during appraisal,
under the leadership of the first Member Secretary, showed some progress. In the following 2-3 years,
procurement issues slowed implementation. When a new financial controller was appointed, Institutional
development improved. Performance after that was mediocre until the restructuring when performance
improved somewhat. The entire sector institutional framework which separates the design/construction
function from the operations/maintenance function needs to be thoroughly reviewed.
13.        Prolect Relationships
13.1      The Bank's relationship with GOG and GWSSE; has been good.
14.       Consulting Services
14.1      GWSSB's reluctance to appoint consultants for major engineering design and financial
management services was a cause for implementation delays. Under the circumstances, most consultants
performed adequately.
15.       Project Documentation and Data
15.1      The Project and Credit Agreements were adequate and appropriate for achieving project
objectives. The appraisal report of the project documentation was comprehensive and useful for both
GWSSB and Bank supervision missions.
16.       Studies
16.1      The metering and leak detection studies were completed, but not implemented.

OVRVIEW OF FEIANCIAL CQVENANTS
Financial covenants for this project were designed to assure the long term sustainability of investments.
Three principal areas were addressed including cost recovery, collections and debt service coverage. The
terms of these covenants were modified at the time of restrcturing to reflect the changes in circumstances
associated with the major delays In project implementation. A brief summary is provided below.
Pdo tQ o-ecr Completio
Achieve 100% coverage of O&M costs and depreciation from direct user charges, and 8S%
collection performance, with FY 1990/91 being the nominal target year.
Subsequent to Project Competion
Achieve increasing levels of coverage of O&M costs and depreciation with revenues derived from
user charges to reach a minimum of 60% coverage at the end of the first three years (e.g. FY
1993/94). During the subsequent three years, costs recovery was to be measured in terms of
O&M costs plus debt service; service charges revenues were stipulated to reach a minimum of
70% by the end of the third year and 100% for all years thereafter (e.g. FY 1997/98 onward).
Collection performance was targeted at 90% for all years after project comp'etion (e.g. FY
1991192).
Prior to Future Borrowing
Achieve net revenues (internal cash generation) sufficient to cover maximum future debt service
including the debt service of the loan under consideration, by a factor of 1.3.
Ahmedabacd      a M;rtig
Without specific reference to project completion, cover O&M costs plus depreciation with
revenues derived from user charges by March 31, 1988 and O&M costs plus debt service by
March 31, 1993. Collection performance and debt service coverage requirements are the same
as described above for project towns.
Rural Water Supply Schemes
"Problem villages" are required to make available to GWSSB annually an amount equivalent to
Rs 6.0 per capita. Any shortfall in funding for O&M is to be covered by these villages from
their revenues from the 10% surcharge on the sales tax. GWSSB is required to maintain all Baknk
funded regional schemes and Bank funded individual village schemes.
