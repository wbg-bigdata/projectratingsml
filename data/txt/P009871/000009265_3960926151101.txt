MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO INDIA
FOR THE THIRD RAILWAY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.        The following  _meorandum and reco mendation on a proposed Loan
to India for US$ 390 mill.on is submitted for approval. The proposed toaa
would have a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the
standard vAriable interest rate and would help finance track
modernization.
2.        Background:  The Bank Group has a long history of involvement
with Indian Railways (IR), with 16 operations since 1949, totalling almost
$1.8 billion. Much has been accomplished in that period, and IR's fiaan-
cial and technical performance compares favorably in many respects with
other railway networks throughout the world. Despite this progress, IR is
entering an important phase of its institutional growth with demand for
rail transport expected to almost double by the year 2000. This will in
turn place a premium on IR's capacity to absorb effectively modern tech-
nology and to mairtain the progress made in improving operating
efficiency. Internal resource generation will need to be further enhanced
to help finance the substantial investment required to cope efficiently
with ttis demand.
3.      IR has recently completed a 15-year Corpor&te Plan which, together
with an agLnda of key reforms recommended by the Railway Reforms Comittee
(1985), provides a sound framework for continued assistance from the Bank
Group.  The Corporate Plan defines IR's economic role, identifies the
investment and other measures necessary to fulfill that role, and contains
a financing plan complete with cost reduction and revenue measures neces-
sary to mobilize the funds required for the investment plan. IR proposes
to accommodate traffic growth to year 2000 while maintaining the labor
force at about its present size (implying productivity growth of 4.5Z
p.a.) and reducing cost per unit of output by 151 in real terms.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement:  The principal rationale for
continued Bank involvement is to support implementation nf IR's Corporate
Plan. This would further the objectives of improving the quality of
transport planning and investment, and promoting operational efficiency
and increased cost recovery. Throughout the project, the Bank will
monitor IR's progress in implementing the Plan in general, but will par-
ticularly focus on operational and financial performance. In assisting IR
to upgrade the quality of its track, the project will complement recent
projects which have supported electrification and the modernization of
motive power, rolling stock, and maintenance facilities.
5.        Project Objectives:  The project would seek to (i) improve the
planning and execution of IR's track renewal, upgrading and maintenance
program; (ii) enhance the quality and capacity of track by assisting IR
overcome its substantial arrears in this area (thereby promoting more
efficient train operations); and (iii) support IR's efforts to mobilize
more resources internally.



-2-
6.        Project Description: The proposed project would comprise:
(a) renewal and upgrading of about 4,000 track kme on heavy density
freight routes, using high tensile, long-welded rail, generally laid on
concrete sleepers in improved ballast; (b) provision of modern track
renewal and fiaintenance equipment, to improve the quality of this work and
reduce track occupancy time in heavily trafficked corridors; and
(c) training and technical assistance related to the above, as well as in
general manpower planning. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$ 1,206 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$ 390
million (32X). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A; retroactive financing up to US$ 10 million is contemplated.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively.  A map is attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 7047-IN, dated April 15, 1988 is being distributed separately.
7.        Actions/Conditions:  During loan negotiations, agreement was
obtained on the following: (a) annual review of IR's progress in
implementing its Corporate Plan, within the framework of targets related
to output, equipment availability and utilization, and labor productivity;
and (b) that IR will maintain tariffs and take all other action necessary
or appropriate to meet annually out of internally generated resources all
operating expenses (including adequate provisions for depreciation) and
dividend payment on capital-at-charge.
8.        Benefits:  By improving track quality in IR's major traffic
corridors, the project will produce: (a) operational benefits resulting
in fuel savings and improved utilization of locomotives and rolling stock;
(b) savings in the costs of maintsanirAg track and rolling stock; and
(c) capacity benefits from reduceri line occupancy required for track
renewal and maintenance. Not all of these benefits can be readily
quantified, but the internal economic rate of return from those that can
be quantified reasonably is 20X.
9.        Risks:  From the experience with recent projects, the major risk
is implementation delays. This risk,~ is being minimized by (a) confining
Bank financing to a relatively small number of con'.racts;(b) reaching
detailed agreement on all procurement arrangements during negotiations;
(c) making extensive use of standardized procurement documents and
(d) allowing advance procurement of equipment required to implement the
renewal work.
10.       Recoe_ndation:  I as satisfied that the proposed loan would
camply vith the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recomend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
