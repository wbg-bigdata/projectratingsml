INDIA
RAILWAY MODERNIZATION III PROJECT
Loan and Project Su mmary
Borrower:          India, acting by its President (GOI)
Beneficiary:       Indian Railways (IR)
Amount!            Bank Loan:  US$ 390 million
Terms:             Repayment over 20 years, including five years' grace
at the standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:  GOI will on-lend the proceeds of the loan as GOI's
capital-at-charge to IR in accordance with its standard
arrangements for financing IR's capital expenditure
program. IR pays a dividend on the total capital-at-
charge at a rate determined by GOI, currently 6.5Z per
annum. GOI will carry the interest and exchange risks.
Purpose:          The purpose of the proposed project is to assist IR in
modernizing and improving the utilization of its assets
within the framework of a recently formulated 15-Year
Corporate Plan. This project, focussing on track,
complements recent projects which have focussed on
workshops, rolling stock, and electrification.
Project           The project consists of: (a) renewal and upgrading of
Description:       some 4000 track kilometers of IR's heavy density routes,
especially the major trunk roe-es connecting India's
four major cities: New Delhi, Bombay, Madras, and
Calcutta; (b) provision of track equipment and rolling
stock for transporting track material; and (c) provision
of advisory services and training in manpower planning
and in track-related areas.
Benefits          The project will substantially reduce track maintenance
at Risks:          costs and, by reducing speed restrictions and the track
occupancy time required for renewal and maintenance
work, increase track capacity in critical corridors as
well as improve the utilization of rolling stock. The
principal risk is implementation delays. This risk is
being minimized by (a) allowing advance procurement of
equipment needed to implement renewal work and (b)
selecting as the major project component an item which
is free of the complex design and procurement issues
which have characterized recent projects with IR.

RAILWAY NODDRIIZATIOS III PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Overview
1.01      For a country with the population, geographic size and diversified
economic structure of India, transport plays a vital role. The transport
system, and the output therefrom, has recorded substantial growth over the
past 25 years (Annex 1.1). Rail and road transport are the dominant modes,
and will remain so.  However, there has been a marked shift in their shares
of total traffic with road's share of land freight, for example, increasing
from 13X in 1951 to around 40X in recent vears (Annex 1.2). 1/ This shift
reflects road transport's inherent advantage in handling non-bulk traffic.
While this process may well continue to a degree, especially with the recent
liberalization of road transport regulations and with progressive improvement
of the road system, there are limits to this process, especially now that
over 802 of rail freight is bulk (Annex 2.5) with most of that carried in
high density corridors where road capacity will continue to be over-taxed.
Thus, some stability in modal shares seems to be emerging with no significant
trend over the past decade. This suggests that these two modes are now
largely performing their appropriate respective roles (rail for medium and
long hauls of train- and wagon-load traffic particularly of bulk commodities,
with road for smaller loads and shorter hauls.)
1.02      Compared with railways and roads, the other modes of transport are
at present of minor importance as general goods and passenger carriers:
coastal shipping and pipelines each carry about 3X of the total freight
traffic in terms of ton-ki; air transport carries about 12 of total pass-km.
These modes are, however, important within their specialized areas, and there
is scope for considerable expansion within each mode because of the size of
the country and its geographical features. Consequently, GOI is undertaking
projects for the expansion of coastal shipping of coal and for pipeline
transportation of crude oil, gas and petroleum products.
1/ There are no comprehensive data on road transport operations in India.
The volume of road freight has to be estimated from data on the vehicle
fleet, complemented with assumptions on vehicle utilization (guided by
data on gasoline and diesel consumption). Accordingly, the estimates are
approximate, but nevertheless convey an order of magnitude.



-2-
1.03      Despite the progress depicted in Annex 1.1, because of past under-
investment (par& 1.14), the tranuport system is ill-equipped to satisfy
existing demand efficiently, let alone cope with a prospective doubling of
demand by the end of the century. Host transport modes need to modernize.
In railways, some 201 of the track, much of it in major corridors, is overdue
for renewai and needs to be upgraded. Motive power is obsolete and
underpowered; many of the rolling stock designs in use restrict speeds and
are inefficient carriers of bulks, which is especially disadvantageous as
the railways approach capacity limits in several major corridors. Obsolete
terminals and yards cause significant delays, adversely affecting utilization
of locomotives and rolling stock.
1.04      In main roads, India has one of the lowest densities (per head of
population) in the world and consequently some of the highest road traffic
densities in the developing world. Moreover, the existing road network
leaves much to be desired. For example, one-third of the limited national
highways system (the trunk system accounting for 21 of the total road
network, but perhaps one-third of road vehicle-kms) is still one lane. A
recent study estimated that Rs 45 billion (WS$ 3.5 billion) in 1984 prices
would be required to rectify this and other deficiencies in national highways
alone.  A,art from deficiencies in road infrastructure, most of the existing
vehicle fleet is of outmoded and inefficient design. The principal truck
used is the large two-axle type which is inefficient as a load carrier and in
fuel consumption, and also causes considerable road damage through
overloading. These issues are being addressed by a Vehicle Fleet and Road
User Charges Study being carried out under the Bank-assisted National Highway
Project (Annex 1.3, para 8).
1.05      Ports are not adequately equipped to handle the envisaged quan-
tities of bulks (both dry and liquid) and containers, and deeper drafts will
be required at selected ports. Capacity constraints place a premium on
improving the efficiency of port operations, which has been low in India due
to labor relation problems, poor labor productivity, stuffing/destuffing
containers inside the port area, obsolete equipment, vehicular congestion and
poor intermodal facilities and practices. Progress has been made on some of
these issues in recent years, especially with the belated introduction of a
combined transport document, establishment of some inland container depots,
and the decongestion and modernization of the country's largest port, Bombay.
However, much more needs to be done. The Seventh Plan (1986-90)
appropriately provides for modernization of facilities and equipment, and the
recent Port Reforms Committee Report has identified desirable institutional
improvements, including some degree of privatization. The Bank intends to
use this Report as a basis for future dialogue with GOI on a possible future
port project.
1.06      Thus, a substantial task lies ahead, in terms of both investment
and institutional/operational improvements, if the transport sector is to
efficiently cope with the demands that will be placed upon it in the coming



-3-
years. These demands will take the form not only of increased level of
transport activity, but a substantial change in the composition of that
activity, reflecting technological developments such as containerization and
bulk handling.
B. Transport Planning and Coordination
1.07      India has a federal structure, and responsibility for transport
matters is distributed between the Central and State Covernmentm. While
railways, shipping, and major ports are exclusively under the Central
Government's (GOI's) authority, the Central and State Governments share
jurisdiction over highways and road transport, minor ports, and inland water
transport, though their respective roles are clearly delineated.
Central/State activities are coordinated by a Transport Development Council,
an Inland Water Transport Board, and an Interstate Transport Committee (for
road transport).
1.08      At the Central level, ports, shipping, and roads are under the
Ministry of Surface Transport; there are separate Ministries of Railways and
Civil Aviation; and pipelines come under the Ministry of Petroleum. In
September 1985, all transport modes except pipelines were consolidated under
one Ministry of Transport, but this was found unwieldy and the arrangement
was abandoned in October 1986. Coordination is adequately effected by: (a) a
Cabinet Committee chomprising the Ministers of Railways, Surface Transport,
and Civil Aviation; (b) a Committee of Secretaries from the transport
Ministries and the Planning Commission, serviced by a secretariat in the
Ministry of Railways; and (c) the work of the Planning Commission itself.
1.09      All major proposed investments are assessed by the Planning
Commission for inclusion in the five-year Development Plan, from which are
derived annual plans linked to budgetary allocations. No major project can
receive funding unless it is included in the Plan. The Commission's
activities extend beyond investment review per se to assessments of opera-
tional performance, maintenance, and resource mobilization in the sector.
The Commission has recently embarked on long-term perspective planning in the
transport sector, designed to identify more accurately the linkages with
other sectors and the respective roles of the various transport modes in the
major corridors.
C. Transport Policy and Investment
1.10      A major review of transport policy was completed in 1980 by the
National Transport Policy Committee. Its many recommendations, almost all of
which were accepted by the Government, centered around:



-4-
(a) the need to improve transport planning by developing a systematic
methodology for projecting transport demand and its allocation on
the basis of resource costs of the different modes of transport and
by developing long-term perspective master plans for major are*s of
investment;
(b) promoting the appropriate inter-modal allocation through the market
mechanism (e.g., improved pricing) rather than through regulation
and physical control; and
(c) improving cost recovery and relatedly, project execution and
productivity.
1.11      In response to (a), the Planning Commission has established a high
level Steering Committee to systematize is work on long-term perspective
planning in transport. The Committee has commissioned several major studies,
including origin-destination surveys of present traffic flows, transport
demand forecasts for major commodities and major corridors, development of a
national transport planning model, and a long-term technological perspective
study. Reports on these studies are expected towards the end of 1988.
Master Plans have been developed in some areas (e.g., national highways and,
as part of preparation of the proposed project, rail track renewal).
However, much more remains to be done in this respect.
1.12      In response to (b) and (c), the structure of rail tariffs has been
improved and road transport regulations liberalized; road user taxation is
being reviewed by a Bank-fit:anced study (para 1.04), and cost recovery has
improved in railways (para 4.10) and ports. The ten major ports as a group
now internally finance about 40 percent of their investment expenditures,
whereas they incurred a net operating deficit in the early 1970's. To
improve project execution and the productivity of operations, modern work
methods and equipment need to be introduced where appropriate.
1.13      The major policy challenges at this point are thus to sustain the
momentum of the above-mentioned initiatives and extend their application.
The Bank's sector strategy (para 1.17) has been designed accordingly.
1.14      As indicated in the following table, transport's share of total
Development Plan expenditure has declined from around 23% in the 1950's and
early 1960's to 12X in the 1980's. In real terms, transport investment grew
rapidly during the first three plans, but this was followed by a long period
(1966-78) of contraction for railways, during which annual investment expen-
diture was little more than half the level prevailing 1957-66. Investment in
the other modes continued to grow but generally more slowly than previously,
and more slowly than the aggregate demand for transport services by each
mode. Moreover, the changing structure of transport demand (an increasing
proportion of bulk and container traffic) required new specialized
facilities. Under the Sixth Plan (1981-85), public investment in transport -
especially road and rail - increased significantly. But a substantial back-



-5-
log of rehabilitation and modernization remains, especially if the transport
system is to cope efficiently with an expected doubling of demand by year
2000. The Seventh Plan (1986-90) makes a major effort to address this need,
providing for a S0 increase in transport investment (though whether this
actually occurs will depend on how well the Plan allocations, which are
expressed in 1985 priies, are protected by subsequent increases to match
inflation). The fucus of the transport investment plan is on modernizing
rail track, motive power and rolling stock, augmenting road capacity, and
increasing the capacity of ports to handle bulks and containers.

D. Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.15      The Bank's past involvement in the sector has been predominantly in
railways, due to the Indian authorities' preference until recently to rely
almost exclusively on local competitive bidding in road and port projects.
However, following GOI's recent decision to entertain international competi-
tive bidding in roads and ports, the Bank after a long hiatus has recommenced
lending operations in these two subsectors, with the Nhava Sheva Port Project
(Loan 2387-IN, 1984, US$ 250 million), the National Highways Project (Loan
2534-IN, 1985, US$ 200 million), and the Cujarat Rural Roads Project (Credit
1757-IN, 1987, SDR 101 million).



-6-
1.16      Experience with recent Bank-assisted projects in the sector is
described in Annex 1.3. The principal lessons from railway experience may
be summarized as (a) until recently, only limited progress in ensuring that
IR made adequate provisions for asset renewal and replacement;
(b) disappointing impact of "program-type" components which were not
specified in advance and did not form part of a well-articulated master plan
which, inter alia, anticipates and addresses labor redundancy implications;
and (c) implementation delays because important design and procurement issues
were not finalized prior to loan/credit approval. The proposed project has
been shaped with these lessons in mind.
1.17      Regarding future involvement in the sector, while the Bank will be
seeking to follow up its recent re-entry into the roads and ports subsectors,
a continued lending relationship with IR is envisaged, within an agreed
framework for adapting IR to its future role. This framework is described in
some detail in para 3.02 and Annex 3.1; the central thrust is to improve
efficiency and the degree of self-financing by modernizing infrastructure and
operations, rationalizing redundant facilities, and improving labor
productivity. The proposed project supports implementation of this strategy.
II.  INDIAN RAILWAYS
A. Organization and Management
2.01      IR is fully owned by GOI, and is the nation's largest single
undertaking, with a capital investment (in current cost terms) of some Rs 660
billion (over US$ 50 billion), and a total staff strength of about 1.6
million. Responsibility for the management of IR rests with the Railway
Board under the overall supervision of the Minister of State for Railways.
The Railway Board exercises all the powers of GOI in respect of regulation,
construction, maintenance and operation of the railways, and advises the
Minister on policy matters.  The Board therefore performs the dual functions
of Secretariat to the Ministry of Railways and of an executive body respon-
sible for railway operations.  In financial matters Parliament oversees
implementation of recommendations made by the Railway Convention Committee
and other parliamentary committees.
2.02      The Railway Board comprises the Chairman, the Financial
Commissioner (who is vested with full powers of GOI to sanction IR
expenditure) and five other functional members (Chart). The Board is sup-
ported by Advisors, Executive Directors, and subordinate staff.
2.03      IR consists of nine Zonal Railways, each under the control of a
General Manager, and each zone is a large system on its own account. IR also
has four factories engaged in the manufacture of locomotives, rolling stock



-7-
and wheels and axles; a new factory is under construction with Bank assis-
tance for remanufacture of critical diesel locomotive components. Further
details on these production units and on wrkshops are available in Staff
Appraisal Report No. 4940 of April 26, 1984, and earlier Appraisal Reports.
B. Infrastructure
2.04      IR operates over some 62,000 route kilometers (77,000 track
kilometers), and almost 30,000 km of sidings and yards. Some 7,400 route
kilometers ate electrified and electrification of another 3000 km is under
way, with Bank assistance. Some 55Z of the network is broad gauge (BG,
1676 mm), 40% meter gauge (MG) and the balance narrow gauge (NG).
2.05      Due to constraints on total rail investment (para 1.14), and the
need to focus available funds on the critical problem of providing adequate
carrying capacity, real track expenditures from the mid sixties to the late
1970's were only a third of their prior level (Annex 2.7). As a consequence,
the track structure has deteriorated considerably, requiring an increasing
number of speed restrictions due to worn-out rail, rail fractures, and
unstable track. The speed restrictions have considerably reduced line
capacity. While some progress was made as a result of increased allocations
under The Sixth Plan (1981-1985) (para 2.21), about 17,500 kms are now due
for renewal, and each year another 2,300 kms become due ("new arisings").
To liquidate the arrears and deal with "new arisings," IR has prepared a
ten-year program providing for renewals of about 4,000 track kms per year.
Although more than one-third of arrears are on the meter gauge system, 85% of
track renewal expenditure over the next three years will be on the BG system,
which is in proportion to that system's contribution to IR's traffic. Within
the BC system, renewal efforts will be focussed to the maximum practicable
extent 1/ on the A routes (Delhi-Calcutta, Delhi-Bombay, Delhi-Madras, and
Bombay-Nagpur-Calcutta) and other heavy density routes generally carrying
more than 15 million gross tonnes (MGT) per year. Together these routes
account for about 20% of IR's track but about 75% of total traffic. IR has
requested Bank assistance for this element of its FY89-91 renewal program.
2.06      During renewal, the opportunity will be taken to improve track
standards, which is necessitated by IR's plans (already under implementation)
to introduce heavier and longer trains operating at increased speed, in order
to cope with increased traffic. Furthermore, the increased traffic allows
less time for track maintepance, which reinforces the need for higher track
standards and the use of modern track maintenance methods. IR has studied
various international track standards and selected for the broad gauge net-
1/ Traffic densities on these routes limit the time available to carry out
renewal work.



-8-
work a range of future standards (according to traffic levels and *azimuin
speeds) consistent with those used by comparable railway. (Ann*x 2.2).
Economic analysis confirms that the standards are appropriate (Annex 3.9).
For heavy density routes the new standard is for long-welded 60 kg/r rail
sections, made of high tensile (90 UTS) steel and laid on pre-stressed con-
crete sleepers with elastic fastenings. Very little of the existing track
conforms to these standards:

13,630           2,940
2.07      To minimize interference to traffic, IR needs to increase the speed
with which track renewal and maintenance is carried out on its major routes.
Thus, modern track machines (e.g., relaying trains, continuous track tamping
machines, ballast cleaners, and dynamic track stabilizers) are being
introduced. Such machines not only increase the speed of relaying, but also
the quality of work.
2.08      Because of unsatisfactory experience with IR's treatment of the
labor implications of workshop modernization (para 1.16 and Annex 1.3,
para 3), the Bank asked IR to specifically address, during project
preparation, the labor implications of mechanizing track renewal and main-
tenance work. In response, IR pointed out that most track renewal work to
date has been performed by casual labor, so adjusting the size of this force
will not be as difficult as for permanent labor such as that used in
workshops. In fact, in many areas IR experiences difficulty recruiting labor
for track renewal, due to the arduous nature of the work. Routine track
maintenance is carried out using permanent labor, but labor displaced by
machines will be moved to other work previously performed by casual labor
(periodic maintenance, special repairs and renewal). As part of the annual
budgetary approval process, zonal General Managers are required to specify
how they will redeploy staff displaced by mechanization. Finally, the



-9-
increasing volume of renewal work will offset to some degree the manpower
reductions from mechanization. The Bank considers these arrangements
satisfactory, and during negotiations agreement was reached on arrangemnts
to monitor adjustments in gang strengths following mechanization under the
project.
C. Motive Power
2.09      The motive power fleet consists of 5,570 steam, 3,050 diesel and
1,300 electric locomotives (Annex 2.1). The steam locomotives are gradually
being phased out and replaced by more efficient and powerful diesel and
electric locomotives. However, existing diesel and electric locomotives are
of obsolete design and do not meet current requirements for fuel efficiency,
availability and reliability. The Bank group is therefore financing
(Credit 1299-IN/Loan 2210-IN) IR's procurement of 18 prototype electric
locomotives of three alternative, modern designs used elsewhere in the world.
These locomotives will be delivered and tested during calendar 1988, follow-
ing which local manufacture of the present IR design (about 100 units per
year) will be phased out and replaced by manufacture of the selected new
design. Technology transfer for such manufacture is included in the contract
for the prototype locomotives. In the meantime, to help fill an emerging gap
in motive power until locomotives of the new design come into production, ADB
is financing the procurement of 40 additional electric locomotives of modern
design. Because many of the existing locomotives will continue in service
for some time, design modifications are under way which will improve the
present fleet until a sufficient number of the new design locomotives has
come into operation.
2.10      IR also plans to replace its current generation of under-powered
diesel locomotives, also manufactured in India, with more powerful locomo-
tives of more recent design. IR is negotiating contracts for such
locomotives, which would include provision of technology for domestic
manufacture.
D. Rolling Stock
2.11      IR has some 360,000 wagons (in terms of equivalent 4-wheeler units)
of which 285,000 are BC, 71,000 MG and the balance NG. Some 50X of the
wagons are of covered type, 30Z special, and the remainder departmental.
Most of the wagons are 4-wheelers, which are being gradually replaced by more
efficient and reliable bogie wagons. The change in traffic pattern from
general purpose goods traffic to bulk traffic in unit block trains requires
wagons of specialized type with high payload, and IR has developed such
wagons which are manufactured in India. During the Seventh Plan (1986-90) IR
plans to replace some 80,000 BG and 15,000 MC 4-wheeler units with bogie



-10-
wagons. Because of the higher productivity of the new units (higher payload
and longer average haul), IR expects to produce 30z more net ton kms by 1990,
with no net increase in wagon units.
2.12      While the IR-designed high capacity bogie wagons are a vast
improvement on the 4-wheeler units they are replacing, they suffer from some
design deficiencies, particularly in the bogie itself, which causes unneces-
sarily high wheel and track wear. Test bogies of superior design have been
procured under Bank Group financing (Credit 1299-IN/Loan 2210-IN) and IR's
future type will be selected after tests are completed in 1989.
E. Operating Performance
2.13      IR's overall operating performance continues to improve (Annex 2.3)
and is amongst the best in developing countries when measured against
yardsticks such as track utilization, output/employee, and equipment
availability and utilization (except for electric locomotives - para 2.14).
In several areas it is comparable with railways in developed countries. This
is especially true for wagon utilization (defined in terms of tons carried
per ton of capacity) which has increased 30% since the early 1980's and now,
as the recent audit of Credit 844-IN notes, is "well above European and
average US levels - in a class with the world's top performers." This
improvement is largely due to the increased operation of unit trains, which
has also contributed to a 20% increase in traffic units per employee since
1980.
2.14      While the ava.lability of diesel and steam locomotives is
satisfactory, the availaoility of electric locomotives is low, reflecting
design deficiencies. As toted in para 2.09, design modifications are being
made to existing locomotives, and new design electric locomotives are being
introduced. Utilization of these locomotives is also low, again partly due
to design deficiencies. Another factor contributing to low utilization has
been the discontinuities in electrification, which limit the opportunity for
through running. The Bank-assisted electrification project (Loan 2417-IN) is
filling the major gaps in route electrification and therefore should promote
improved utilization of electric locomotives.
2.15      In an effort to further improve operating performance, IR is plan-
ning a computer-based, real-time Operating Information System (OIS). This
will require substantial investment in telecommunications, which in turn
raises major design and technology issues, chief among which is the potential
benefits from several major users sharing with IR a joint facility in order
to exploit the economies of high capacity fibre optic links on the main
communication routes. GOI/IR has requested Bank assistance for IR
telecommunications/OIS, and the Bank is therefore pursuing these issues with
IR and other GOI agencies.



-11-
F. Traffic
2.16      IR's freight and passenger traffic statistics since 1951 are shown
in Annex 2.4. The annual average rate of growth in freight NTKMs over this
period has been about 52, though this has fluctuated considerably between
almost 7Z in the 50's and 32 in the 70's. Over the past decade the growth in
NTKMs has averaged 42 p.a., with particularly strong growth in 1986 and 1987.
IR's Corporate Plan 1985-2000 (paras 3.01-3.03) projects IR's freight traffic
to reach 400-430 billion NTKMs by 2000, implying an average annual growth
rate of 5.0-5.5Z between 1987 and 2000. This is predicated on GDP growing
at 4.5-5.02 p.a., and on rail's modal share increasing from its present level
of less than 602 (Annex 1.2) to 65-75%. The Bank's projections (Annex 2.6)
imply a growth rate of about 42 p.a., reflecting an assumption that rail's
modal share will remain at its recent level (para 1.01).
2.17      The composition of freight traffic has changed considerably, with
seven major bulk commodities accounting for 83% of total NTKMs in 1987,
compared with 662 in 1971 (Annex 2.5). Most of this increase is attributable
to coal, foodgrains and fertilizers. IR expects most of its future traffic
growth to occur in coal, cement, foodgrains, and "other goods" (reflecting
containerization). This assessment seems reasonable, and the Bank's projec-
tions by commodity (Annex 2.6) reflect the commodity composition projected in
IR's Corporate Plan.
2.18      Non-suburban passenger-kas have grown at 3.5Z p.a. since 1951, and
at 52 p.a. over the past decade. Virtually all of the growth in passenger-
kus over the past decade has occurred through increased journey lengths,
reflecting market trends (reinforced by IR's pricing strategy) for road to
capture the shorter-haul non-suburban trips, for which it is better suited.
IR's Corporate Plan assessed the market prospects of the separate non-
suburban services (first class, second class, air-conditioned sleeper and
chair services, second class express and second class ordinary) and the
separate projections imply an overall average growth rate of 42 p.a. The
analysis is sound and the Bank has adopted these projections for the finan-
cial assessment in Chapter IV.
2.19      Suburban passenger-kms have grown at just under 62 p.a. since 1951,
but only at 2.42 p.a. over the past decade, largely influenced by a downturn
following a major fare increase in April 1983. IR's Corporate Plan expects
suburban traffic to grow at 62 p.a., but this appears optimistic, and a 42
growth rate has been adopted for the Bank's financial projections.



-12-
G. Investment
2.20      Annex 2.7 presents IR's investment from 1962 to date, and as
projected in the Seventh Plan (1986-90) and Corporate Plan (1985-2000). As
already noted, the annual level of investment approximately halved after 1966
and did not re-attain its pre-1966 level until the 1980's. Between 1966 and
1980, investment focussed on motive power and rolling stock, which accounted
for almost half of IR's annual investment expenditure by the late 1970's. To
accommodate this, new line construction was radically curtailed, but so too
was track renewal, on which annual expenditures from 1967-80 averaged little
more than a third of the level attained in the early 1960s.
2.21      In response to increasing arrears of track renewal, and the need
to upgrade track for modern operations, track renewals were substantially
increased in the Sixth Plan (1981-85)4 This effort is projected to continue,
with track expenditures accounting for 20% of IR's investment to year 2000,
compered with about 10% in the 15 years to 1980. IR is now also sig-
nificantly increasing its expenditures on workshops, plant and machinery (8Z
of planned investment to 2000, compared with 3% until the late 1970.) to
provide efficient maintenance capacity for the motive power and rolling stock
fleet which has grown in size and sophistication over the years (Annex 2.1).
Future investment plans provide for a substantial increase in signalling,
telecommunications and computerization (7% of planned investment to 2000,
compared with 2-4% in the past), which have been relatively neglected in the
past but are essential to improving the utilization of IR's motive power and
rolling stock, and thereby substantially reducing the need for future invest-
ment in these areas.
2.22    Overall, the thrust of IR's investment plans is sound, focussing on
renewal and modernization, with relatively little being devoted to new lines,
track doubling, and gauge conversion.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Context: IR's Corporate Plan 1985-2000
3.01      Early in the formulation of the proposed project, it was decided
that the justification for further Bank assistance to IR would need to be
assessed within the framework of the broad institutional changes necessary
for IR to efficiently perform its future role. At the time, IR was in the
midst of preparing a Corporate Plan for the period 1985-2000, taking into
account, inter alia, the recommendations of several recent committees,
including the National Transport Policy Committee (1980), the Rail Tariff
Enquiry Committee (1980), and the Railway Reforms Committee (1982-85).



-13-
During project preparation, the Bank reviewed the Corporate Plan to assess
whether it constituted a satisfactory long-term framework for future
assistance.
3.02      The Plan, which has just recently been endorsed by GOI, defines
IR's economic role, identifies the investment and other measures necessary to
fulfill that role, and contains a financing plan complete with cost reduction
and revenue measures necessary to mobilize the funds required for the invest-
ment plan. The Plan is summarized in Annex 3.1; its key features are:
(a)  a projected doubling of traffic between 1985 and 2003;
(b)  an objective of accommodating this traffic while maintaining the
labor force at about its present size 1/ and reducing cost per unit
of output by 15Z in real terms;
(c)  pursuing this objective by:
(i) focussing investment expenditures on modernization and improv-
ing productivity, rather than capacity expansion per se;
(ii) focussing investment on BC heavy density routes, which
account for most of IR's traffic;
(iii)  running heavier and longer trains, using larger wagons;
(iv) in freight operations concentrating on point-to-point bulk
movement with unit trains;
Cv) modernizing and rationalizing workshops, yards and terminals,
closing down redundant facilities and uneconomic branch lines;
and
(vi) improving manpower planning, job design, promotion policies
and training.
(d)  planned investment (expressed in 1985 prices) over the 15-year
period of Rs 462 billion (US$ 36 billion), approximately half of
which would be for replacement; this implies average annual invest-
ment of about Rs 30 billion (about US$ 2.3 billion), about double
the level achieved during the Sixth Plan (1981-85), but of a
similar order to that provided for (and being achieved) in the
ongoing Seventh Plan (1986-90); and
I/ This implies that output per employee will grow at about 4.5Z p.a.,
compared with 3X p.a. 1961-85).



-14-
(e) financing all replacement expenditure from depreciation provisions,
plus in effect increasing internal financing of new investment by
improving the operating ratio from 961 in 1985 to 831 by 2000.
3.03      The Plan has been reviewed by the Bank.  While its goals are
ambitious, the underlying strategies are sound, and the Corporate Plan
provides a very useful framework within which to design future Bank
assistance. During implementation of the proposed project, it is intended to
monitor progress towards the Plan's main goals. Accordingly, at
negotiations, GOl/I agreed to review annually progress in implementing the
Plan, against various intermediate indicators related to output, equipment
availability and utilization, and labor productivity (Annex 3.2), and to
inform the Bank of the results of this review.
B. Rationale and Objectives
3.04      The rationale for continued Bank assistance to IR is to support
implementation of key elements of IR's Corporate Plan, especially:
(a) improved utilization of assets;
(b) improved planning and investment in key areas; and
(c) increased internal generation of funds for asset renewal and new
investment.
Specifically, this project would seek to improve the planning and execution
of IR's track renewal/upgrading and maintenance program, enhance the quality
and capacity of track by assisting IR overcome its substantial arrears in
this area (thereby promoting more efficient train operations), and improve
IR's financial performance. The proposed project would complement recent
projects, which have supported modernization in other areas (design and
maintenance of motive power and rolling stock, and electrification). Other
priority areas, which could be the subject of future Bank assistance, are
modernization/rationalization of terminals and yards, improvements to sig-
nalling and telecommunications, and introduction of computer-based operations
information systems.
C. Project Description
3.05      The proposed project would comprise the following main components:
(a)  renewal/upgrading of track on arterial (A routes) and other heavy
density routes;



-15-
(b) equipment for track relaying and maintenance;
(c) locomotives and wagons for transport of track material; and
(d) technical assistance and training.
Track Renewal/Upgrading
3.06      As part of project preparation, IR have produced a track master
plan, satisfactory to the Bank, which inter alia provides an economic jus-
tification for proposed track standards, a medium-term plan for overcoming
arrears of economically warranted renewal, and an appropriately dimensioned
and distributed program, having regard to likely funding. IR's total track
renewal/upgrading program for FY90-92 is summarized in Annex 3.3. IR has
requested Bank assistance for that part of the program relating to arterial A
routes (para 2.05) and other heavy density routes, generally carrying more
than 15 million gross tonnes per year. The project will support 4,000 track
kms of renewal, which will cover most of IR's FY90-92 program for these
routes. Annex 3.4 gives details of the project routes, which are shown on
Map 19974.
3.07      The project will replace low tensile (72 UTS) jointed 45 or 52 kg/m
rail on wooden or cast steel sleepers with high-tensile (90 UTS) long-welded
60 kg/m rail, generally laid on pre-stressed concrete sleepers. The new
standard, comparable to that used by other railways with similar traffic
(Annex 2.2), will substantially reduce track maintenance requirements since
the new rail will have double the life, the heavy concrete sleepers with
increased ballasting will stabilize the track, and the welding of joints will
eliminate joint repairs and reduce rolling stock maintenance. By eliminating
speed restrictions, the new track will also improve utilization of motive
power and rolling stock, and increase line capacity.
Track Equipment
3.08      Traditionally, track renewal and maintenance has been done manually
although IR has already begun introducing mechanized methods on some of its
most heavily-trafficked sections. Manual methods are too slow, and the
quality of work deficient, for IR's high density routes. The project there-
fore provides for modern track laying and maintenance equipment such as
relaying trains, continuous tamping machines, dynamic track stabilizers,
ballast cleaning machines, welding plants, grinding machines, and ancillary
equipment (Annex 3.5). The new machines will substantially increase IR's
renewal capacity, reduce the track occupancy required for renewal and main-
tenance work, and improve track quality.



-16-
Locomotives and Rolling Stock
3.09      The huge track renewal program will require considerable transport
of material, in some cases over long distances. The project therefore
provides locomotives and specialized wagons for this purpose.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.10      Technical assistance and training will be provided in three areas:
(a) manpower planning;
(b) planning of track renewal and maintenance programs; and
(c) technical training in the operation and maintenance of the track
equipment to be procured under the project.
3.11      As indicated in para 3.02, IR plans to accommodate an expected
doubling of traffic between 1985 and 2000 with virtually no increase in
staff. This will require a considerable transformation in its labor force,
to cope with mechanization of track work, new maintenance regimes (e.g.,
making more use of unit exchange systems), more sophisticated motive power
and rolling stock designs, yard and terminal modernization/rationalization,
and computer-based operations information and reservation systems.  IR's
Corporate Plan recognizes that providing for this transformation is an
immense task, requiring improvements in IR's manpower planning, and a sub-
stantial re-orientation of IR's training effort. Whilst IR can itself imple-
ment many of the required improvements, it will still require assistance in
specialized areas of manpower planning and training. The project provides
for 180 staff-months of such technical assistance.
3.12      While the quality of IR's track planning compares favorably with
that of many railways in developed countries, in view of the magnitude of
its track expenditures, IR should analyze more systematically the economic
implications of alternative renewal/maintenance strategies, and the conse-
quences of alternative levels of track expenditure. The project provides 180
man-months of technical assistance to promote this work.
3.13      Approximately 90X of the technical assistance man-months for man-
power and track planning is expected to be provided from domestic sources.
3.14      Most of the training required in operating and maintaining modern
track equipment will have to be provided overseas at equipment manufacturers
and at railways using similar equipment. The cost of such training is
provided for in the project.



-17-
D. Project Cost and Financing
3.15      The total cost of the project is estimated at Rs 16,875 million
(Uvf 1,206 million), with a foreign exchange component of US$ 390 million, or
3rA.  The cost estimate, sumarized below and detailed in Annex 3.6,includes
identifiable taxes and duties of Rs 4,744 million (US$ 323 million). Total
project cost, net of taxes, is Rs 12,131 million (US$ 883 million). Base
costs are expressed in March 1988 prices. The costs of goods are based upon
ex-factory prices for similar items manufactured in India and recent prices
of imported material and equipment. Cost estimates for consultant services
are based on Rs 20,000 per staff month for local and US$ 15,000 per staff-
month for foreign. The local rate is consistent with prevailing rates; the
foreign rate is at the upper end of the spectrum, recognizing the highly
specialized and short-term nature of the services. Provision is made for
international travel and per diem where appropriate. There is no provision
for physical contingencies due to the program nature of the project. Price
contingencies are estimated on the basis of the implementation schedule and
the following forecast of price escalation: for local cost, 8Z in 1988-89, 7X
in 1990, and 6% p.a. thereafter; for foreign cost 42 p.a..

3.16        The proposed Bank loan of US$ 390 million would finance 1002 of
foreign costs and 44Z of total costs excluding taxes and duties. GOI would
finance the balance of US$ 493 million equivalent, excluding taxes and
duties. Retroactive financing up to US$ 10 million is proposed for expendi-
tures incurred on track equipment and consultant services between April 1,
1988 and the date of the Loan Agreement.

e. Implementation, Disbursements, and Auditu
3.17      IR will implement the project and is well organized to do so.  All
preparation work is complete. The track sections to be renewed have been
identified; however this will be reviewed annaally in the light of traffic
and operational developments, and relative rates of deterioration of the
various sections. The Implementation Schedule (Annex 3.7) was agreed at
negotiations, as were progress reporting requirements. The loan is expected
to be fully disbursed over a five-year period ending December 31, 1993
(Annex 3.8). This is considerably sooner than the June 30, 1997 date implied
by the standard disbursement profile, because of the progress already made in
procurement, and because the project is much simpler in its procurement
features than standard railway projects (i.e., a relatively small number of
contracts, generally with simple specifications).
3.18      The proposed loan would be disbursed as follows:
(a)  100% of the foreign cost of imported items;
(b) 100l of the ex-factory cost of items from domestic suppliers
procured under ICB;
(c) 100% of the cost of technical assistance and training.
To facilitate disbursements, a specia- account will be established with an
authorized allocation of US$ 30 million.
3.19      Auditing arrangements are discussed iu para 4.02.
F. Procurement
3.20      All material (all rails and about one third of the steel sleepers)
and equipment financed under the loan (Annex 3.5 provides details) will be
subject to international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
Group Guidelines. All Bank financed contracts in excess of US$ 1 million
equivalent will be subject to prior Bank review, but the extent of review
work will be minimized by IR's agreement (obtained at negotiations) to use
standardized documents acceptable to the Bank. Local manufacturers are
expected to bid for certain ICB contracts and domestic preference of 15Z or
the applicable rate of customs duty, whichever is less, would be applied for
the purpose of bid evaluation. Procurement of government financed items will
be according to satisfactory local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures or by
other methods (direct purchase from IR sources, or from sole source domestic
suppliers) which are satisfactory. Ballast and almost 90% of the concrete
sleepers will be procured under LCB. Track items not subject to ICB or LCB
(the remaining concrete and steel aleepers, welding supplies, labor for
handling materials) will be supplied directly by IR or directly purchased
from single domestic sources. Technical assistance will be provided by



-19-
specialist consultant firms who will be appointed in accordance with the Bank
Cuidelines. To expedite project implementation, there has been advance
contracting of some track equipment to an estimated value of US$ 35 million,
in respect of which retroactive financing up to US$ 10 million is proposed.

C. Economic Evaluation
Introduction
3.22      The economic evaluation is conducted in three stages.  First,
alternative rail weights are compared in the abstract (though using assump-
tions representative for India) to ascertain whether the rail standard
proposed by IA for the project routes is appropriate, if one were starting de



-20-
novo. Secondly, the econoaic merits of renewing and upgrading existing
"over-age" sections are determined for the range of traffic levels found on
the project routes (viz., by 1989, the initial year of project
implementation, 13-35 MGT p.a.). Finally, sensitivity tests are conducted
for lower traffic growth assumptions, and for reduced maintenance and operat-
ing savings.
3.23      Throughout, costs and benefits have been converted to economic
prices by: (a) expressing the imported content rt cif prices; and
(b) applying the estimated standard conversion factor of 0.8 to local costs.
Because costs and benefits of each alternative are assumed to be uniform for
any km of the project routes, except to the extent they are influenced by
traffic levels, the analysis is conducted throughout for one km of track.
Analysis of Proposed Rail Standard
3.24      The assumptions and results of this analysis, for varying traffic
levels, are presented in Annex 3.9 Tables 1-6.  The results indicate that
60 kg/90 UTS rail is the appropriate choice for IR sections with initial
traffic between 10 and 35 MGT p.a., and that these are approximately the
limits for this rail weight.  At 10  MGT (Table 1) 60 kg rail has a lower net
present value (NPV) cost than 52 kg rail at discount rates up to 10%, but
52 kg rail is marginally cheaper at 12% discount rate. The opportunity cost
of capital for renewal work (i.e., the return on the next best alternative
projects foregone by IR) is judged to be in the range of 10-12%. At 15 MCT
p.a. (Table 2) 60 kg is cheaper, even for discount rates as high as 15Z, and
this remains broadly true up to 30 MGT p.a. (Tables 3-5). At initial traffic
of 35 MGT (Table 6) 65 kg rail becomes attractive at 10% discount rate, but
60 kg and 65 kg are approximately equivalent at 12% and 60 kg is preferable
at 15% discount rate.
Rate of Return on Proposed Renewal/Upgrading Work
3.25      This analysis requires comparison between a "project" case and a
"without project" case. As indicated in Annex 3.4, there are almost
5,000 kms of track overdue for renewal on the project routes. The project
will renew and upgrade the worst 4,000 kms and, as can be inferred from
para 2.06, this generally consists of jointed 45 kg/72 UTS rail on either
wooden or cast steel sleepers, on a deficient ballast cushion.
3.26      It is assumed that, without the project, track maintenance costs
would increase for 5 v,ars,i at which time further intensification of main-
tenance would be infeasible and the track would be replaced by 52 kg/72 UTS
(the rail generally manufactured in India). Detailed assumptions are listed
in Annex 3.9. Operating costs on the new 60 kg track are assumed to be 5%
lower than on the existing track. This reflects such factors as fuel
savings, reduced detentions and diversions of trains due to reduced track
occupancy for maintenance work and longer renewal intervals, better utiliza-
tion of locos and rolling stock due to diminished speed restrictions, and



-21-
reduced maintenance of rolling stock attributable to elimination of rail
joints.
3.27      The results of this analysis (Annex 3.9, Table 7) indicate that
the average rate of return for the track renewal work as a whole would be
20. The return on the individual subprojects would range from 16Z (Table 8)
for the sections wich lowest traffic (13 MGT p.a.) to 29X (Table 9) for
sections with the highest traffic (35 MGT p.a.).
Sensitivity Tests
3.28      The economic benefits of the project are not very sensitive to
future traffic growth. If future traffic growth is only 2.5Z instead of 52
p.a., the rate of retur-r WO;J'I drop from ZO% to 192 (Table M0). If main-
tenance and operating stvirg'. prove to be only half of those assumed in the
central case, the rate of -e2tarn would drop from 202 to 15% (Table 11).
H. Environmental Impact
3.29      The project involves no land acquisition or resettlement.  The
project will reduce the demand for timber sleepers, and to that degree will
have a favorable environmental impact.
I. Project Risks
3.30      From the experience with recent projects, the major risk is
implementation delays. This risk is being minimized by (a) allowing advance
procurement of equipment to implement the renewal work; and (b) selecting as
the major project component an item which is straightforward and free of the
complex design and procurement issues which have been a feature of recent
projects.
IV. FINANCE
A. Introduction
4.01      GOI's financial policy towards IR has been designed over the years
to allow it to earn net revenues sufficient to cover all expenses including
depreciation and a dividend to COI. Funds for capital expenditure other than
replacement of assets are provided by GOI and are added to a capital-at-
charge account, which is a liability of IR in perpetuity and on which IR is



-22-
expected to pay a dividend at a rate recommended by a Parliamentary Committee
from time to time. The present rate of dividend on current investments is
about 6.5Z per annum. In years in which IR does not generate a net surplus
sufficient to pay the dividend in full, the unpaid amount is carried forward
as a contingent liability, without interest. IR finances capital expenditure
for asset replacements by a charge against revenues through the Depreciation
Reserve Fund (DRF). IR proposes tariff increases at the beginning of a
fiscal year based on its expected resources and traffic in the ensuing year.
The assumption is that the tariffs set at the forecasted traffic level would
result in revenues sufficient to meet the financial poLicy objectives. As IR
is a departmental undertaking of COI, the commercial freedom allowed IR is
constrained by Governmental policy.
4.02      Financial arrangements with the Government and audit procedures
are, with some improvements noted in paras 4.03-4.04, the same as when the
first Modernization Project (Credit 844-IN) was appraised in 1978. The
accounting function is efficient, well-organized, and well-staffed with
satisfactory budget control and operating systems. In addition to a large
and efficient internal audit, an exhaustive statutory audit is conducted
under the direction of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG),
who reports to the Parliament through the Public Accounts Committee. Audited
financial statements are finalized within eleven months of year end and
presented to the Parliament for approval. IR has under previous projects
consistently provided the Bank Group with audited accounts. IR also provides
reports of project expenditure in a timely manner and to the satisfaction of
the Bank Group. GOI has agreed that IR will, in accordance with sound
accounting and auditing principles and procedures approved by C & AG, main-
tain records and accounts to reflect its resources, expenditures, and opera-
tions related to the project and have IR's accounts for each fiscal year
audited by C & AG. IR will furnish to the Bank such accounts not later than
eleven months after the end of each such year together with a report of the
auditors.
B. Recent Changes in Financial Policies
4.03      Two developments are worthy of note, one concerning the allocation
to DRF for renewals and replacements of aging assets, and the other a new
policy for IR to borrow in the market to supplement 'capital' drawings from
the Government, which hitherto had been the sole source of funds for new
assets.
4.04      In regard to the first development, DRF in effect has always been a
renewal and replacement fund and not a depreciation provision in the normal
accounting sense. This is not an uncommon practice in railways around the
world. The drawback in IR in the past has been that the allocations to DRF
had proved insufficient to take care of need-based replacements because these
allocations have been determined on an annual basis, influenced by
availability of financial resources, physical constraints (e.g., how many



-23-
wagons can be manufactured) as well as the complexities of ascertaining the
optimum timing of replacement. A Railway Reforms Committee (RRC) appointed
by the Government in May 1981 cautioned against scaling down the contribution
to DRF in order to meet IR's full dividend liability to the General Exchequer
and indeed proposed that the Government should waive dividends as nece  ary
in order to make up the arrears.  The RRC further recommended that IR   nduct
a detailed review of the precise effects of the past policies, identify the
policy changes and specific measures required, and seek the approval of the
Railway Convention Committee (a Parliamentary Committee concerned with
Railway finances) for such changes and measures.
4.05      In response to the RRC recommendations and to Bank concerns on the
subject (para 1.16), IR has quadrupled its allocations to the DRF in the last
five years (para 4.10), and appointed RITES, a subsidiary of IR, to carry out
the recommended detailed review of the DRF. This review has just been
completed. The salient recommendations are:
(a) Instead of the present method of ad hoc annual appropriations to
DRF to meet replacements as considered necessary, the DRF provi-
sions should be made with reference to current cost of assets,
updated each year, and the prescribed lives of the assets.
(b) Annual withdrawals from DRF should be related solely to the present
day cost of assets due to be replaced in a given year though it
might lead to greater demands on DRF in certain years and might
leave some unspent balance in other years.
(c) Asset registers should be introduced with the help of computers.
Until this is done, IR should use the the current replacement costs
of all assets as worked out in the report (with reference to the
physical quantum and unit prices as of March 31, 1986) in order to
arrive at the depreciation contribution for each subsequent year.
(d) Arrears in replacements of overaged assets estimated at Rs 62,000
million (9X of IR's total asset value in current costs) as of
March 31, 1986 should be eliminated over a ten-year period, under
special financing arrangements to be agreed to by GOI, without
there being a charge to the revenues of IR.
4.06      These recommendations are sound and far-reaching, requiring deci-
sions by IR, the Ministry of Finance, and Parliament. During negotiations,
GOI/IR stated that the recommendations are under examination by IR.
Thereafter the considered views of GOI/IR would be placed before the
Parliament's Railway Convention Committee. IR will keep the Bank informed of
the conclusions reached/decisions taken. Meanwhile IR has agreed to maintain
the provision for depreciations in the period 1990-1994 at not less than the
budgetary provisions made in respect of 1989, namely Rs. 15,000 million.



-24-
4.07     The second development mentioned in paragraph 4.03 is in accordance
with the recent policy of the government that the public sector shoultd
approach the market for part of the financial resources needed for
investment. Initially, IR's investment allocation under the Seventh Plan
(FYs6-90) was Ra 1234340 million (FY8S prices), and the intention was to
finance the outlay exclusively from internal resources and capital drawn from
the Government, in accordance with past practice. In the first two years of
the plan, IR incurred 34% of the plan expenditure and financed 542 of it from
internally generated funds; the balance was provided by the Government. In
view of higher traffic growth than foreseen when the Plan was formulated,
the Planning Commission, during its recent mid-term review of the Plan,
approved a 101 increase in IR's investment program.  This higher level of
investment during the remaining years of the Seventh Plan is expected to
continue during the Eighth Plan period (FY91-95).
4.08     IR is resorting to bond issues to finance the additional
investment. The first offering of this kind was in FY88 and was successful.
IR formed a wholly owned subsidiary, the Indian Railway Finance Corporation
(IRFC), which raised Rs 2,500 million, at an interest rate of 101 and
maturity of ten years. Offerings will be repeated annually. IRFC will buy
assets such as rolling stock and lease these back to IR in exchange for lease
payments. These arrangements would not only facilitate IR having a larger
investment (through IRFC), but also in the long run tend to be more advan-
tageous compared to obtaining the additional capital from the Government and
paying a dividend thereon in perpetuity. (That is, the cost to IR in net
present value terms of paying lease charges for ten years, then acquiring the
asset free of charge, is less than paying a dividend at the current rate of 6
1/2Z p.a., in perpetuity).
C. Past Performance
4.09     IR's actual revenue and expenditure accounts for the period FY82 to
FY87 are summarised below and detailed in Annex 4.1. The balance sheet as of

4.10      IR consistently has earned revenues in excess of its total operat-
ing expenses, which include depreciation. However, IR has not always been
able to meet its full dividend liability. Its best results were in FY86,
when a large surplus was generated enabling discharge of a part of accrued
dividend liability from the past. During the period FY82 to FY87, revenues
grew faster than working expenses. Growth in the volume of traffic, at
almost 5.5X per annum during this period (with large increases in FY86 and
FY87 when net ton kilometers increased by 142 and 10 respectively), combined
with rate revisions enabled IR to substantially increase allocations to DRF,
from Rs 3,500 million in FY82 to Rs 12,500 million in FY87, while still
meting dividend liability in recent years.
4.11      A financial covenant under Loan 2210-IN/Credit 1299-IN (1962),
repeated under Loan 2417-IN (1984), required IR to maintain tariffs and take
all other action necessary or appropriate, so as to meet annually out of
internally generated resources, all operating expenses and dividend payment
on capital-at-charge. IR has generally complied with this financial
covenant. However, in FY84 and FY85, IR did not have sufficient net revenues
and had to limit dividend payments to 89X and 582 respectively, of the
dividend liability. (It may be noted, however, that dividend liability is
relatively small in relation to total revenues, so that the 422 shortfall in
dividend payment in FY85 represents a revenue deficiency of less than 42.)
Subsequent tariff increases have enabled IR to meet its full dividend
liability in FY86-87, and to pay off some of the accrued dividend liability,
but there will be a need in the future to continuously monitor this issue.
Thus, this covenant is repeated under the proposed loan.
D. Future Finances
4.12      Revenue and expenditure accounts have been projected to FY95 using
inter alia the traffic projections explained in para 2.16-19. The accounts
are summarized below and detailed in Annex 4.3. Projected Source and
Application of Funds, and Balance Sheets are shown in Annexes 4.4 and 4.5
respectively.

4.13       Revenues and expenditures have been projected in 1988 prices.
Traffic vrojections and objectives in regard to cost reductions, operating
ratios and ratios of net revenues to capital-at-charge are broadly consistent
with IR's Corporate Plan (1985-2000) parameters.
4.14       These financial projections imply that provided tariffs are main-
tained at FY88 levels in real terms, IR would be able to make DRF allocations
on an annual basis to cover adequately the current needs for renewals and
replacements. From FY90 onwards, however, IR would need to raise tariffs by
2Z annually, in real terms, in order to meet the dividend liability in full.
IR's attention was drawn to these financial projections and their
implications. IR stated phat the assumptions underlying the projections
would be reviewed as evunts unfolded in the future, and appropriate action
would be taken, if required, to meet the covenant referred to in par& 4.11.

V.  AGREEMENTS AND RECOKOENDATION
5.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached with GOI on the fol-
lowing principal matters:
(a)  annual review of IR's progress in implementing its Corporate Plan,
within the framework of targets related to output, equipment
availability and utilization, and labor productivity (para 3.03);
and
(b)  IR will maintain tariffs and take all other action necessary or
appropriate to meet annually out of internally generated resources
all operating expenses (including adequate DRF allocations) and
dividend payment on capital-at-charge (paras 4.06 and 4.11).
5.03      During negotiations, agreement was also reached on the following:
(a)  the project financing plan, and retroactive financing
(para 3.16);
(b)  the implementation schedule, project reporting requirements and
annual reviews of IR's progress in implementing its track renewal
program (paras 2.08 and 3.17);
(c)  procurement arrangements (para 3.20); and
(d)  audit requirements (para 4.02).
5.04      Subject to the above, the project provides a suitable basis for a
Bank loan to GOI of US$ 390 million at the standard variable interest rate,
for a term of 20 years including 5 years of grace.

INDIA
RAILWAY MODERNIZATION III PROJECT
Experience with Recent Bank-Assisted Transport Projects
1.        The Bank's past involvement in the sector (Table 1) has been
predominantly in railways, due to the Indian authorities' preference for
local competitive bidding in ro'd and port projects. However, following
OOI's recent decision to entertain international competitive bidding in
roads and ports, the Bank has, after a long hiatus, recommnced lending
operations in these two subsectors, with the Nhava shev- Port Prz,-.t
(Loan 2387-IN, 1984, US$ 250 million), the National Highways Project (Loan
2534-IN, 1985, US$ 200 million), and the Gujarat Rural Roads Project
(Credit 1757-IN, 1987, SDR 101 million).
Railways
2.        Through sixteen operations approved between 1949 and 1984, Bank
Group assistance to Indian Railways (IR) has totalled US$ 1.8 billion
equivalent. The first thirteen operations were based on one- to three-
year slices of IR's investment programs and covered foreign exchange for
acquisition of: (a) materials, parts and components for manufacture of
motive power and rolling stock; (b) machinery and plant for IR manufactur-
ing units; and (c) materials and equipment for line improvement works and
telecommunications. Since 1978, there have been three specific investment
projects focussing on particular components in respect of motive power,
rolling stock, workshop and track electrification. The audit (Report
No. 6055-IN, January 10, 1986) on the Thirteenth Railway Project, the last
of the program loans, concluded that the projact "came close to achieving
its principal objective to provide capacity for the forecast increase in
traffic during the Project period.., and IR's operational and financial
performance improved... However, the Project included some investments of
low economic priority while inadequate resources were devoted to higher
priority investments in replacements and renewals... and resources allo-
cated to the Depreciation Reserve Fund were inadequate."
3.        The first of the specific projects, the Railway Modernization
and Maintenance Project (Credit 844-IN, 1978, US$ 190 million) was satis-
factorily completed in late 1985, about 18 months behind schedule. The
project had two major components: (a) support for the first phase of IR's
workshop modernization and rationalization program; and (b) the estab-
lishment of a wheel and axle plant. The audit found that the element of
workshop modernization devoted to five major pre-specified workshops was
"successful and probably justified", but that the program element of
workshops modernization, "in which machine tools were placed in numerous
shops around the country that may or may not be viable elements of the
maintenance system, probably had a much lower return." Moreover little
rationalization has occurred and few of the potential labor savings have
been realized. Regarding the wheel and axle plant, the audit noted that



-32-                          Annex 1.3
Page 2 of 3
while this is a "model industrial operation," its economic impact has been
disappointing, because of cost overruns and the decline in the world
market for rail equipment. Overall, the audit concluded that any com-
ponent having a major impact on the labor force needs careful design, but
that this project and its successors (paras 4-5) have "sharply outlined
the real long-term problems facing IR and the constraints the Bank must
consider when structuring a lending operation. This was not the case with
the earlier lending format and is the useful result of a serious attempt
to effect specific changes."
4.        The Railway Modernization and Maintenance Project II (Credit
1299-IN/Loan 2210-IN, 1982, SDR 184.7 million and US$ 200 million) is
directed at (a) further improvements in the maintenance system through
establishment of a facility for reclamation of diesel electric locomotive
components and assemblies, and the provision of unit exchange spares; (b)
introduction of new electric locomotive technology; and (c) components and
materials for new design high-capacity wagons. This project is behind
schedule due to disturbances in the Punjab (the site of the Diesel
Component Works), and delays in initiating procurement of electric
locomotives/components and bogies for wagons. However, 80Z of the
Credit/Loan is now committed.
5.        The [ailway Electrification and Workshop Modernization Project
(Loan  2417-IN, 1984, US$ 280.7 million) supports electrification of about
3000 route-kms, and Phase II of the workshop modernization program. After
a slow start, physical implementation is now progressing well and the
project is expected to be completed on time. About 60X of the loan has
been committed.
Ports
6.        The Nhava Sheva Port Project (Loan 2387-IN, 1984, US$ 250
million) supports the establishment of a new bulk and container port in
the Bombay area. This project also started slowly, but physical implemen-
tation is now proceeding well and is expected to be completed by June
1989, about a year behind schedule. However, institutional development is
behind schedule, which may require that initial operations are contracted
out to a port management company.
Roads
7.        The Bihar Rural Roads Project (Credit 1072-IN, 1980, US$ 35
million) comprises the construction/improvement of about 700 kms of rural
roads, and improvements to the maintenance organization (including provi-
sion of equipment). This project has been implemented satisfactorily,
though with some delays, and is nearing completion.



-33-
Annex 1.3
Page 3 of 3
S.        The National Highway Project (Loan 2534-IN, 1985, US$ 200
million) aims to (a) foster institutional development by, amongst other
thing., introducing modern aspects of highway, planning, design, construc-
tion and financing; (b) evaluate the extent to which modern, more fuel-
efficient vehicles should be encouraged to ply Indian roads, rnd if so how
to promote the appropriate vehicle fleet; (c) develop the capabilities of
local contractors by exposing them to foreign competition and
collaboration; and (d) alleviate congestion on some key sections of the
national highway system, by the construction/ rehabilitation of some
500 kas of road in six States. The civil works component is well behind
schedule, due to delays in finalizing tender documents, evaluating tenders
and awarding contracts. In part, these delays are attributable to the
need to familiarize the state agencies responsible for executing this
component with Bank procedures. However, most of the contracts have now
been awarded. The institutional components are progressing well, although
the Vehicle Fleet Modernization and Road User Charges Study was initiated
behind schedule.
9.        As the Gujarat Rural Roads Project (Credit 1757-IN, 1987,
SDR 101 million) became effective only in August 1987, there has not yet
been sufficient implementation experience to draw any conclusions.

NOTE:    Ranges reflect varying standard in relation to traffic levels or
maximum speeds. Thus, in India for a line with over 20 million
gross tonnes per annum with speeds up to 160 kmph, the standard is
60 kg rail, 1660 sleepers/ku and 30 cm of ballast, whereas for a
branch line with less than 5 million gross tonnes per annum and a
maximum speed below 100 kmph, released rails of 45 kg/m may be
used with 1310 sleepers/km, and 15 cm of ballast.

Details of Economic Evaluation
1.      Paras 3.21-28 of the main report describe the general methodology
and assumptions used in the economic evaluation. The assumptions are
documented in more detail in the attached Tables 1-11. Some of the
assumptions warrant amplification. As this analysis relates to IR's heavy
density corridors, which have in the past exhibited faster traffic growth
than the system-wide average, the analysis assumes future traffic growth
of 5% p.a., compared with the system-wide average of 4% p.a. assumed in
the financial analysis of IR as a whole (Chapter IV). For similar
reasons, the ratio of net to gross traffic is taken as 60%, higher than
the system-wide average of 50%.  A traffic ceiling of 60 MCT p.a. is
imposed, as this is the capacity limit for track sections under foresee-
able operating conditions on IR.
2.        Costs in the analysis of rail standard (Tables 1-6) relate to
rail only, as all other track costs are assumed constant between the
alternatives being compared. This analysis compares the net present value
(NPV) cost of alternative rail weights and UTS. Subsequent rail renewals
are lower than the initial rail renewal because the value of released
material (which varies from case to case) is netted out. This is not done
for the initial renewal, because at that point the value of material
released from existing track would be constant for all alternatives.
Assumptions regarding fuel and maintenance savings are based on RDSO,
Comparative Tractive Resistance and Fuel Consumption on 52 kg and 90 r
Track (Mechanical Engineering Report No. M 357, January 1978) and
International Union of Railways (UIC), Factors Affecting the Cost of Track
Maintenance: Their Relative Importance (Report No. 715-1).
3.        Having determined that 60 kg/90 UTS rail has the minimum NPV
cost for the traffic ranges experienced on the project routes, the next
analysis (Tables 7-11) explores whether complete renewal, comprising
re-ballasting, new sleepers/fasteners and new 60 kg/90 UTS rail, is
economically warranted on the project routes. Costs in this model are
therefore higher than in the preceding analysis, but the same broad prin-
ciples apply, such as netting out the value of released material in sub-
sequent renewal cycles in the "without project" case. (The analysis
period is taken as that required to exhaust the service life of
60 kg/90 UTS rail. Thus, there is no second cycle of renewal in the "with
project" case, and the period of analysis varies according to the annual
traffic level.) Further details of the assumptions used in this analysis
are given in Table 7.

Annex 4.2
Page 2 of 2
Fixed Assets
1.      The value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet is based on
their original costs. Additional cost of like-for-like replacements over
their cost (the inflationary element) is charged against DRF, and has not
been included in the figures in the balance sheet.  Improvement element at
the time of replacement has been included in the fixed asset account in
the balance sheet.
Depreciation Reserve Fund
2.      This balance in the fund represents cumulative contribution
including interest earned to date less:
(a) value of assets withdrawn from services; and
(b) full cost of replacement.
Inventories
3.      These are financed from capital-at-charge.
Development Fund
4.      Development Fund is created out of IR's net revenue surpluses
after meeting dividend liability to COI. In certain years, temporary
loans were drawn from the General Exchequer to meet the expenditure char-
geable to Development Fund. As of March 31, 1986 IR has an outstanding
loan of Rs 3,364 million under the Development Fund.
5.      Development Fund:  Finances expenditure of a capital nature for:
(a) operating improvements costing over Rs 300,000 each;
(b) users amenities irrespective of their cost; and
(c) staff amenities costing more than Rs 25,000 each.
6.      Items financed from revenue are:
(a) operating improvements costing upto Rs 300,000 each; and
(b) staff amenities costing upto Rs 25,000 each.
