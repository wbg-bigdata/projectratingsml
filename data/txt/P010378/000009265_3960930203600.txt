MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A NATIONAL IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka for SDR 21.9 million (US$29.6 million equivalent). The
credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. It would
help finance the National Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. The European
Economic Community (EEC) would provide parallel grant financing for tecbnical
assistance, training, and institutional support components of the project
(US$4.0 million equivalent).
2.        Background.  Rice is the principal food crop in Sri Lanka, occupying
nearly 402 of all cultivated land and 802 of the area under irrigation. Over
the last 20 years the area under irrigation increased by about 200,000 ha to
about 550,000 ha (25% of cultivated land), most of it through river diversions
and implementation of settlement schemes in the northern and eastern dry
zones. While generally successful, the high cost of the schemes has reduced
the funds available for investments in other sectors and for maintenance of
existing irrigation infrastructure. In addition, economic rates of return of
the new schemes have been low in recent years, largely due to the depressed
world market for rice. In 1988 IDA recommended that the Government of Sri
Lanka (GOSL) (a) reduce the share of expenditures for irrigation and
resettlement in the Public Investment Program, (b) give priority to
rehabilitati;. and upgrading of existing schemes, and (c) postpone the start-
up of construction of proposed major new schemes. Continued armed conflict
and political uncertainties in the Northeast are added reasons for emphasising
the preservation and improvement of existing infrastructure, much of which was
constructed long ago. GOSL has agreed with this assessment and with the help
of major donors has begun to correct the balance between construction of new
projects and rehabilitation and improvement of existing schemes. IDA, ADD,
OECF and USAID are currently financing rehabilitation of major schemes (those
exceeding 600 ha), including the Major Irrigation Rehabilitation Project
(MIRP, Cr. 1537-CE). T.DA, IFAD and several bilateral donors have financed
rehabilitation of min, schemes (under 80 ha) and medium schemes (80 - 600 ha)
under a series of Integrated Rural Development Projects and the Village
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (VIRP, Cr. 1160-CE). Progress under these
projects has generally been satisfactory. However, implementation in seven
northeastern districts was suspended in 1986 due to civil strife. Recent
estimates indicate that some 10,000 minor schemes covering about 110,000 ha,
and 190 medium and major schemes covering about 50,000 ha, still require
rehabilitatior works.
3.        All minor and most medium schemes have traditionally been managed
and maintained by the farmers themselves, except for major repairs to
headworks which are undertaken by GOSL. Most major schemes were built over
the last 40 years and until recently all were managed and maintained by GOSL.
In 1988 GOSL took a policy decision to reduce the role of the public sector in



- 2 -
irrigation and to increase the involvement and responsibilities of the farmers
for operation and maintenance (O&M) of their schemes. The new policy was
prompted by (a) positive results of several experimental programs to establish
farmer organizations for O&M, and (b) failure of GOSL's efforts to recover O&M
costs from the beneficiaries. The ongoing USAID-supported Irrigation
Management Policy Support Activity project is expected to result in a detailed
policy statement and draft legislation for implementing GOSL's new irrigation
policy by the end of 1991. Meanwhile, the Agrarian Services Act already has
been amended in February 1991 to provide for the establishment of farmer
organizations and their registration as legal entities. The Irrigation
Ordinance also is being amended to (a) empower the farmer organizations to
collect irrigation charges after they have taken over O&M responsibilities for
distributory and field channels, and (b) specify the legal powers of
management committees for major irrigation projects.
4.        In the framework of the decentralization process, the provincial
councils have recently assumed the responsibility for providing services to
about 60Z of the area under irrigation, while the balance 402 remains under
the control of central government agencies. All provincial councils, except
the Northern and Eastern Provinces, have already established irrigation units.
These units are now responsible for planning and implementation of
construction and rehabilitation works and for providing technical advice on
O&M, while staff of the central Department of Agrarian Services remain
responsible for advising the farmers on the establishment of farmer
organizations and scheme management. While workable, the decentralized
irrigation units should be kept under close review by GOSL and, where
necessary, the central Irrigation Department should provide support to the
provincial administrations.
5.        Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operations.  The main lesson
learned from the implementation of recent irrigation projects is that farmers
should be closely involved in all stages of construction or rehabilitation in
order to ensure the success of the operation. Farmer organizations should be
established before works begin, their views should be reflected in the plans,
they should participate in the construction, and they should assume full
responsibility for O&M of the schemes.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  GOSL's current strategy for the
irrigation subsector emphasizes completing projects under construction, and
preserving and improving performance of existing schemes in order to stabilize
and increase agricultural production. IDA supports this strategy and already
has financed rehabilitation and improvement of minor schemes under VIRP (Cr.
1160-CE), which closed in December 1990, and that of major schemes under the
ongoing MIRP (Cr. 1537-CE). Although several other donors also have financed
such works, minor schemes covering at least 452 of the command area under such
schemes and mediumlmajor schemes for about 152 of their command area still
require rehabilitation. The proposed project is a national program which
would support GOSL's strategy, build on experience gained under VIRP and
similar recent projects, and assist provincial councils in executing their new
responsibilities. IDA support is justified as it would (a) improve the
capacity and efficiency of public irrigation services at the center and in the



- 3 -
provinces, and (b) promote increased participation In system management by
farmer organizations.
7.        Project Obiectives.  The project's main objectives are to stabilize
and increase agricultural production and incomes and to raise the standards of
living through rehabilitation and improved 0&M of existing irrigation schemes.
Subsidiary objectives include (a) upgrading the skills of farmers and staff of
the implementing agencies, and (b) creating viable farmer organizations for
managing the rehabilitation schemes.
8.        Prolect Description.  The proposed seven-year project (1991-97),
would support a series of interrelated actions designed to upgrade the level
of services provided by existing irrigation schemes. Specifically, the
project would finance (a) rehabilitation and improvement of about 1,000 minor
and 60 medium/major irrigation schemes covering about 37,500 ha,
(b) establishment of farmer organizations and introduction of improved O&M
practices in all rehabilitation schemes, (c) training of farmers and staff of
the implementing agencies, (d) execution of environmental protection studies
and works, (e) establishment of three new support units in the Irrigation
Department and execution of socio-economic and hydrological studies, and
(f) technical assistance for project planning, implementation, and impact
assessment. The Department of Irrigation would have overall responsibility
for project implementation and monitoring. The total cost is estimated at
US$49.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$8.6
million (17Z). In order to facilitate the early start-up of the project and
to complete VIRP carry-over works and studies, expenditures of up to US$1.2
million equivalent incurred after December 31, 1990, would be considered for
retroactive financing. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Sri Lanka are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No.9425-CE, dated May 9, 1991 is being distributed separately.
9.        ARreed Actions.  Agreements reached at negotiations include
(a) selection of schemes in accordance with agreed criteria, (b) appointment
of consultants for planning and implementation by December 31, 1991,
(c) submission of (i) a proposal for future organizational arrangements of
public services for the irrigation sector by June 30, 1992, and (ii) a
timetable for implementation of agreed recommendations by December 31, 1992,
and (d) submission of draft annual work programs, budgets, and staff
requirements by June 30 of each project year. Conditions of effectiveness for
the IDA credit would be (a) signing the cofinancing agreement between GOSL and
EEC, and (b) submission of a draft work program, budget, and staff
requirements for 1992. A condition of disbursement against expenditures for
works in the Northern and Eastern Provinces would be the completion of on-site
appraisal of selected schemes and a review of implementation arrangements to
the satisfaction of IDA.
10.       Environmental Aspects.  Potential harmful effects of the
rehabilitation works to the environment would be assessed during the
feasibility studies to be conducted for all schemes. Where necessary,



- 4 -
provisions would be made to remedy these effects. Seepage of water from
reservoirs causing drainage congestion would be reduced or eliminated. In
addition, the project would provide for planting of trees in the borrow areas
and canal reservations. The project's training programs for farmers and staff
of the implementing agencies would emphasize environmental awareness.
11.       Special Operational Emphasis.  Rehabilitation and improvement of
existing irrigation schemes, of which many were constructed centuries ago,
would benefit entir%s local communities in Sri Lanka. Additional employment
opportunities would be created, especially for the landless, both off-farm
during construction and on-farm during planting and harvesting seasons. Sri
Lankan men and women have equal access to economic opportunities and social
facilities. Many of the farmers are women, and women are active participants
in community activities, including the farmer organizations now being
established in the irrigation schemes. Therefore, women and men are expected
to benefit equally from the project.
12.       Proiect Benefits.  The project would stabilize the production of up
to 100,000 mt of paddy per year which would otherwise be lost through further
deterioration of the schemes, and also increase annual production by about
20,000 mt of paddy and about 5,700 mt of other field crops due to improvement
works and better water management practices. Average incomes of about 100,000
farm families would increase by 152 to 55? over present levels. Employment
for on-farm activities would increase by about 2,000 person-years annually,
largely hired labor. Temporary off-farm employment generated during project
implementation is estimated at about 7,000 person-yearst this employment would
primarily benefit the landless. The economic rate of return of the project is
estimated at 312.
13.       Risks.  The project faces two main risks.  First, inadequate
staffing of the new provincial administrations could cause implementation
delays or sub-standard quality of works. To minimize this risk, a central
project management cell would be established in the Irrigation Department and
consultants would be employed to assist the provincial administrations with
project planning and implementation and to monitor the quality of the -orks.
The capacity of the provincial administrations would be reviewed each year
and, if necessary, tasks beyond theix capacity would be assigned to the
Irrigation Department. Second, the establishment of farmer organizations
could proceed at a slower pace than expected, causing delays in project
implementation. Institutional organizers would be employed in all schemes to
assist with the formation of farmer organizations.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
