APPRAISAL OF THE S3COND TELECaOIVMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project which forms about
83% of the 1971-1974 Telecommunications Expansion Program of Empresa
Nacional de Telecomunicaciones Colombia (TELECOM). A Bank loan of US$15
million is proposed.
ii.       The project costing US$32 million equivalent will provide for
an additional 42,000 local service lines in areas of Colombia where little
or no local service exists and for the expansion of the long distance net-
work to alleviate present congestion and cover estimated demand until 1975.
The estimated Intenaal Financial Return on the project would be about 29%.
iii.      All items in the project to be financed by the Bank would be
imported and procured through international competitive bidding. A small
amount of long distance equipment and some telex equipment would be prooured
from existing suppliers for reasons of standardization, and cable and local
network materials would be from domestic manufacturers; these items are
outside Bank financing.
iv.       The proposed loan is the second lending operation in the
Colombian telecommunications sector.  The first, Loan 499-CO, was made in
1967 to provide the basic long distance network, some local service, and
to improve international service. Owing to delays in building construction
and late deliveries of equipment, the closing date of the loan has been
postponed one year to December 31, 1971. The full amount of the loan which
was for US$16 million has now been committed. The project is expected to
be satisfactorily ccmpleted and the loan fully disbursed by the new closing
date.
V.        After initial weaknesses TELECOM's organization is showing rapid
improvement and the entity is capable of carrying out the proposed program.
vi.       TELECOM's financial position is satisfactory.  TELECOM will provide
from its internal cash generation about 36% of its approved investment re-
quirements during the period 1971 through 1974. The annual rate of return
on net fixed assets in operation during that period would be satisfactory.
vii.      The proposed project is a suitable basis for a loan of US$15
million, for a term of 20 years including a grace period of four years.

APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia has requested Bank assistance in
financing the 1971-1974 program of expansion to be carried out by Empresa
Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM). The main object of the program
is to provide local telephone service in some areas of Colombia where
service is limited or non-existent, and to expand long distance communica-
tion facilities. The cost of the program is estimated at about US$39.5
million equivalent.
1.02      The proposed project, which foims about 83% of the program, pro-
vides for new local networks and the extension of long distance facilities,
additional telex and miscellaneous equipment. The cost of the project is
estimated at US$32.4 million equivalent, the foreign exchange content would
be US$18.2 million of which the proposed Bank loan would be US$15.0 million.
1.03      An application for the loan together with TELECOM's expansion
plan was received in April 1970. During June 1970 an appraisal mission
comprising Messrs. A. M. Minton, J. G. Davis, J. Balkind visited Colombia
to evaluate the Project. The mission together with Mr. P. Bassole sub-
sequently visited Colombia again in July-August 1970 to complete the
appraisal.
1.04      The telecommunication project would be the second in Colombia.
The first one, financed by Loan 499-CO (US$16 million) and signed in June
1967, provided for the establishment oL a modern long distance network
and for the expansion and improvement of local and international tele-
phone, telegraph, and telex services. Owing to delays in building
construction and late equipment deliveries there has been some delay in
the original construction timetable and in the disbursement of the loan.
The closing date of the loan has been postponed from December 31, 1970
to December 31, 1971. The full amount of the loan has been committed
and both disbursement and construction are expected to be completed by
the new closing date. The loan now proposed will enable TELECOM, to
maintain continuity of development for which procurement action has to
be initiated in early 1971.
1.05      TELECO1g's management showed considerable weakness in the early
stages of the project under Loan 499-CO but in the past year with the
experience gained and with the aid of local and foreign consultants it
has shown rapid progress.



2. THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
The Economic Background
2.01      Colombia is a country of about 22 million people distributed in
a number of distinct regions defined principally by mountain ranges. In
the north and west, high mountain chains, in some places reaching heights
of 5,000 meters, isolate the densely populated districts of the central
region from the coast; the south eastern portion of the country is sparse:ly
populated and extends into the Amazon jungle area. Half the population is
urban, living in the centers of more than 10,000 people. Nearly a quarter
live in the four leading cities of Bogota (2.1 million), Medellin (1 million),
Cali (1 million), and Barranquilla (0.7 million), all of which are importarnt
manufacturing centers. Population is growing very rapidly (3.3%) and urban
population is growing 60-70% faster than the national average. Per capita
income, at US$300, is still relatively low but in recent years has shown
accelerating growth in the face of a national economic performance over
the past decade which has been somewhat better than expected. The growth
of GNP ifhich rose from around 5% in the early 1960's to over 7% by the end
of the decade has been broadly based. Non-traditional exports (i.e. agri-
cultural products other than coffee, plus manufacturing) have shown growth
rates roughly three times that of the GNP. The encouraging growth of
commodity production, internal trade, and non-traditional exports has been
heavily dependent on the government's large and effective program of infra-
structure investment, much of which has been directed towards tying together
economic activities carried on in relatively self-contained regions. National
integration, for example, has been a major objective in the Bank's own sup-
port for the road transport, electricity, and telecommunications sectors in
recent years.
2.02      The provision of adequate telecommunication services is an obvious
requirement for an expanding economy, which requires a large volume of rapid,
reliable communications to operate effectively. In comparison with trans-
port and power, the telecommunication sector is relatively undeveloped, in
the sense that it will require a period of relatively heavy "catching-up"
investment, and of institution-building, over the next few years.
The Telecommunication Sector
2.03      The telecommunication sector is under the control of the Ministry
of Communications. Investment in the sector is coordinatsd within the
national economic development plan by the National Planning Department
(PLANiEACION). The responsibility for providing telecommunication services
in Colombia is divided among many entities. Although the Government-owned
TELECO[ exclusively provides domestic telegraphy, telex and long distance
telephone services together with international services, no less than 60
entities, including TELECOM, are providing local telephone service.  At
the end of 1969, TELECOM had 21,000 local telephones in operation; this
represented about 3% of the total for the country. Under the terms of its
license TELECOM is allowed to operate local services and does so, with the
approval of the Ministry of Communications, in areas where the municipality
is unable to give service and requests TELECOM to provide the facilities.



2.04      At the present time Colombia has about 600,000 local telephone
lines. Over 90% are automatic and one-third are located in Bogota. National
long distance connections are provided over about 3,900 circuits of which
one-half are operated automatically. International services are conducted
over direct links by satellite, HF and VHF radio. A countrywide telegraph
service is provided through 1,424 public offices, and a modern telex net-
work provides service for about 2,500 subscribers. Details of existing
facilities together with planned expansion targets to 1975 are given in
Annexes 2 and 3.
2.05      The major problem of the telecommunication sector in Colombia is
the fragmentation of the local telephone service. While a few large munici-
palities, which have created separate telephone entities, operate efficiently
and give good service there are many others which oring to the small scale
of operations cannot operate their services efficiently, let alone develop
them. The proliferation of small entities results in the duplication of
planning and in the complication of the technical integration and inter-
connection of the sector. Without adequate technical and financial backing
operations are not effective. Furthenmore, the purchase of costly imported
plant and equipment in small quantities results in higher prices and con-
sequently, greater demand on the country's foreign exchange resources. If
progress is therefore to be made in the sector further fragmentation must
be prevented and action should be directed to achieving a reasonable degree
of consolidation.
2.06      The ideal solution for the problems of the sector, which must be
a long term objective, would be the consolidation of the many local operating
entities into a single national telecommunication body. Present indications
are that over the short period any sectoral rationalization will mainly be
brought about by TELECOM since the large financially viable local operating
entities are reluctant to merge with the smaller entities; furthermore with
local and regional political influences still very strong any form of merger
through legislation would in all probability be resisted.
2.07      On the assumption that sectoral integration will only be achieved
through the purchase of the smaller local operating entities, it is es-
timated that between US$30 and 35 million would be required as compensation.
TELECOM has included US$2.2 million in the 1971-74 program for such ac-
quisitions. More recently, however, the Government, in approving increases
in TELECOM's long distance telephone tariffs, specified that a part of the
expected additional revenue (estimated at about US$3 million for the four
years 1971 through 1974) should be set aside and used exclusively for local
expansion including the purchase of local entities. TELECOM will also
probably use a part of the remaining additional funds arising out of the
tariff increase, estimated at about US$10 million, to acquire local entities.
It would therefore appear that a significant start in sectoral reorganization
will be seen during the next few years.

3. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
3.01      TELECOM is an autonomous entity which was established in 1947.
It is governed by a Board of Directors comprising four members and four
alternates.  The Minister of Comnunications is ex-oficio Chadrman of the
Board. The President of the Republic appoints all members of the Board
and also the president of TELECOM, who is the entity's chief executive
officer responsible for day-to-day operations. TELECOM's organization
is divided into four divisions: Engineering, Operations, Financial, and
Industrial Relations, each of which is headed by a vice-president who
reports directly to the president. An organization chart is given in
Annex 1.
3.02      Until recently TELECOM's organization and administration was
weak in both technical and financial services but it is now showing rapid
improvement. In 1968, TELECOM engaged financial consultants to improve
general accounting, financial control, inventories, purchasing, credit
collection and data processing. The first phase, partly financed by
Loan 499-CO, is progressing satisfactorily and will be completed at the
end of 1971.  TELECOM proposes to continue with a second phase and the
proposed loan provides for the financing of the necessary consulting
services (see para. 4.02, ii). In 1970 TELECOM engaged technical consultants
to improve the organization of its oporations division. This work, which
is being financed by TELECOM, is still in its early stages.
Recruitment and Training
3.03      TELECOMI has no difficulty in recruiting professional staff who
come mainly from the universities. Technical and administrative staff
are obtained chiefly from the Technical Institute of Electronics and
Communications (ITEC) in Bogota. ITEC is a UNDP assisted vocational
training institute for electronics and communications. Its courses on
telecommunications, given by an international team of instructors, are
made available to all entities dealing with telecommunications, including
railways and meteorological services.
3.04      TELECOM's technical and operational staff are sent to ITEC for
basic and refresher courses. The facilities are adequate to meet TELECOM's
needs for the forthcoming expansion program. In addition, supervisory
staff are sent abroad for training under arrangements made with suppliers
and under bilateral assistance.
Accounting and Audit
3.05      A number of serious accounting deficiencies were brought out in
the audit of the 1967 accounts, the first to be submitted to independent
audit.  A subsequent in-depth investigation was carried out at the Bank's
request under the direction of the auditors and was satisfactorily completed
in May 1970.  The 1968 and 1969 accounts have been audited and found correct.



- 5 -
3.06      The existing auditing arrangements which are satisfactory conform
with the undertaking in loan 499-CO. Assurances have been obtained that
the accounts lill continue to be audited by an independent auditor accept-
able to the Bank.
Existing Telecmmunication Facilities
3.07      A brief description of TELECOM's facilities at the end of 1969
is given below. Additional information is provided in Annex 2 and Maps 1
and 2.
(a) Local Service
As of December 31, 1969 TELECOM provided local exchange
facilities in 373 tor-ans and smaller localities utilizing 13
automatic and 360 manual telephone exchanges with total
capacities of 15,825 and 6,000 lines respectively.
(b)  Long Distance Service
The domestic long distance service comprised of:-
(i) Modern microwave systems (1,200 channel capacity) between
the principal regional centers of Bogota, Cali, Medellin,
Pereira and Bucaramanga (see Map 1). The number of cur-
rently installed channels on each of these routes is
sufficient to meet traffic until early 1973.
(ii)  VHF routes linking other important centers.  Many of
these routes are congested, in particular the Medellin/
Barranquilla, Barranquilla/Cartagena, Bucaramanga/Cucuta
links urgently require additional capacity.
(iii) Open wire lines and HF connections operating between
small localities. The service is poor and requires
upgrading with modern systems.
(c)  Long Distance Switching
At the end of 1969 TELECOM had 35 automatic long distance
switching exchanges in operation. Orders have been placed under
Loan 499-CO for a further 10 automatic and 80 manual exchanges,
which will be installed by the end of 1971.
(d) Telex and Telegraph Service
TELECOM's fairly well developed domestic telex network,
which was established in 1954, is of modern design, with
dialling for both local and long distance calls. At the end
of 1969 the 2,310 telex subscribers had access to 650 national
and 45 international circuits through 39 automatic exchanges.



- 6 -
The present total telex exchange capacity is 2,550 lines.
TELECOM also operates an extensive domestic telegraph service
through 1,424 public offices, many of which are located in
small villages. 40% of the service is operated with tele-
printers, the remainder by hand key.
(e) International Service
International telephone, telegraph and telex services
are provided through an earth satellite station inaugurated in
I'arch 1970 or by means of HF radio.  The satellite system pro-
vides high quality service through direct links k27 circuits
in all) to Argentine, Brazil, Chile, Panama, Mexico, USA,
West Germany and Spain. The HF radio stations which are
located near Bogota have direct circuits to various cities
in Europe, North and South America.  The service via HF
facilities has recently been improved by additional technical
equipment.
Tariffs
3.08      Details of TELECOM's principal tariffs are given in Annex 5.
Telephone installation fees, monthly rentals, and call charges are reason-
able. In addition to a guarantee deposit of US$42 equivalent, new local
subscribers are required to pay an investment deposit which varies between
US$27 and US$64 equivalent per line. Investment deposits were introduced
in 1969 to help finance the urgently needed local development. Both
deposits are refundable when service is terminated. TELECOM's telex
charges are reasonable.
3.09      Domestic tariffs are set by the Board of TELECOM subject to
the approval of the Minister of Communications. Tariffs for international
telephone, telex, and telegraph traffic and the related participations
are established in agreements between TELECOM and foreign entities. The
equivalent Colombian peso charges for international traffic, which are
settled in dollars or gold francs are at present being reviewed bi-monthly
and revised to take into account currency changes. This arrangement is
satisfactory.
Past Financial Performance
3.10      Statements of sources and application of funds for the period
1967-1970 are given in Annex 8. During that period it is estimated that
TELECOM will have increased its gross plant in operation from about Col$366
million to Col$911 million.  35% of newly constructed works will have
been financed from internal sources, 39% from suppliers' credits, and 26%
from IBRD Loan 499-CO.
3.11      TELECOM's audited income statements for the years 1967 through
1969 with estimated figures for 1970 and relative notes are given in
Annex 6. Between 1967 and 1969 TELECOM's overall revenues increased by



- 7 -
76% to Co1$497 (US$26.9) million; part of the additional revenue arising
from a 13% telephone tariff increase in August 1968. During the same
period, mainly due to successive wage awards and higher social charges,
operating expenses increased by 61% to Col$426 (US$23.0) million.  Despite
a slight improvement, the operating ratio was still poor, at 86, in 1969,
reflecting in part the operation of the heavily staffed telegraph service
taken over in 1965 at Government request.
3.12      Loan 499-C0 requires TELECOM to limit the net annual increases
in staff during the present program to a maximum of 5% of the number of
employees at the beginning of each year. This provision, which was
satisfactorily complied with, will, with the agreement of TELECOM, be
continued for the construction period of the new program.
3.13      Loan 499-CO requires TELECOM to achieve an annual rate of return
of at least 9% on the net value of fixed assets in operation calculated on
the current peso equivalent of the dollar value of the assets with a 10.
rate of depreciation (see Annex 10). During the period 1967 through 1969
the annual average value of the Colombian peso to the dollar declined from
14.5 in 1967 to 17.3 in 1969. The tariff increase of August 1968 was im-
plemented too late to prevent the annual rate of return falling slightly
below 9% in 1968. The rates of return for 1967 and 1969 slightly exceeded
13% and 10% respectively.
3.14      TELECOM's debt service coverage by internal cash generation has
ranged between 1.9 times and 1.5 times during the past four years.
Present Financial Position
3.15      TELECOM's audited balance sheets for the years 1967 through
1969 with estimated figures for 1970 and relative notes are given in
Annex 7. TELECOM's financial position as of December 31, 1969, was
generally satisfactory. Current ratio was 1.1:1, cash position was
adequate. Net assets, valued at historical cost, totalled Col$838
(US$45) million and consisted of net fixed assets in service Col$499
million, other fixed assets (mainly work in progress) Col$259 million
non-current assets and investments Col$61 million and net current
assets of Col$19 million. For rate making purposes TELECOM is required
to value its net assets in service at their dollar value (see Annex 10).
On this basis net fixed assets in service as of December 31, 1969, would
have been Col$718 million, with a corresponding increase in the total
equity figure.



3.16      TELECOM's capitalization as of December 31, 1969, was as follows:
Col$         Col$

837.9
Debt/equity ratio was 52/48. Salient features of the capitalization are
given below.
3.17      Under a 1968 law dealing with severance pay, public entities
such as TELECOM were required to pay to the Fondo Nacional de Ahorro (FNA),
the new acdministering authority for severance pay, an assessed liability
for the past service of their employees.  As of December 31, 1969 TELECOM
had a liability to FNA for employees severance pay totalling Col$123.7
million. TELECOM has been allowed by ministerial arrangement to retain
the funds together with the contributions for 1969, 1970, and 1971 and
an interest charge of 9% per annum until December 31, 1971 after which
it must repay tne sum then due (estimated at Col$194 million) by seven
equal annual instalments.
3.18      TELECOM has a non-contributory pension scheme for its employees.
In the past TELECOM has adopted the practice of charging to operational
expenses only the actual payments for pension allowances rather than an
annual charge related to the salaries of the employees, covering a pro-
vision for their future retirement allowances.  It has now been agreed
that TELECOM will have an actuarialvaluation made of its pension liabili-
ties by June 30, 1972 following which satisfactory arrangements will be
made to provide for the ascertained liability. In the meantime a sum of
Col$36.9 million has been provisionally set aside to meet the liability
as at December 31, 1969. Provisions for future pensions will be retained
within TELECOM and used for internal investment until such time as they
are required.



- 9 -
3.19      At the end of 1969 TELECCM's current receivables totalled
Col$127.0 million, equivalent to about four months revenue. In an
effort to improve this position, TELECCM is following the consultants'
recommendations and is accelerating billing; where there are direct
contacts with the subscribers, collection procedures are being improved.
However, the bulk of unpaid accounts relates to the Government, official
bodies and local connecting entities, and Government action is required.
3.20      In 1969, the Government, with the concurrence of the Bank,
agreed to settle its old arrears with TELECCM in four instalments
terminating in January 1972.  This arrangement is being carried out,
however, there has been delay in the settlement of current accounts by
a few Government departments. As of December 31, 1970 the National Post
Office owed TELECOM an estimated Col$31 (US$1.7) million for services
rendered in district offices operated jointly by the two entities during
the three-year period 1968 through 1970. The Government agreed during
negotiations that the arrears of the Post Office would be settled in
accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Bank and that future
bills of the Post Office and other Government agencies would be maintained
on a current basis.
3.21      A number of national connecting entities have not been promptly
transferring to TELECOM the sums collected on the latter's behalf and in
two extreme cases TELECOM had to set up its own collection organization
in the areas concerned. During negotiations the Government agreed to use
its best efforts to ensure that telephone operating entities make punctual
payment of their debts to TELECOM.

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
4.01      In addition to the completion of the remaining works of the 1967-
1970 program, which includes construction financed by Loan 499-Co and some
complementary items (see Annex 14), TELECCK has drawn up a further program
of expansion for execution during the four-year period 1971 through 1974.
1971-1974 Program
4.02      The new program, the total estimated cost of which is Col$731.6
(US$39.5) million, provides for:-
(i)  the expansion of the local telephone service, the provision
of additional long distance facilities, and the extension of
the telex network (see para. 4.04 for details);
(ii)  the Improvement to budgeting, costing and plant accounting
through the employment of accounting consultants;
(i;i) the acquisition in 1974 of about 8,000 lines being provided
in various localities on the plain, north of Bogota. The
regional development authority for the area, Corporacion
Autonoma de la Sabana de Bogota (CAR), in accordance with its
statutes, will carry out the construction works and then
transfer the plant, at cost, to TELECUM for operation;
(iv)  the commencement of construction in 1974 of a microwave
link between Colombia and Ecuador, and a national data
transmission network.
Other Investhment
4.03      During the period 1971 through 1974 TELECOM also expects:-
(i) to purchase some small local systems from operating entities,
which, because of financial difficulties, wish to sell their
undertakings;
(ii)  to increase investment in INTELSAT as required for continuing
participation; and
(iii) to further develop its staff housing scheme under which loans
for housing are made available to the staff at low rates of
interest.
The Project
4.04      The project for Bank financing comprises items 4.02 (i) and (ii)
in TEIECOM's 1971-1974 program of expansion. The full details of the
project and the annual expenditure are given in Annex 11. A brief outline
of the project is set out below.
*Includes Co147.9 (us$0.4) million incurred in 1970.

4.o6      The cost estimates are reasonable and adequate and are based on
recent experience in Colombia. The costs of local and long distance switch-
ing plant, microwave and other radio links, and toll ticketing equipment
have been estimated having regard to the prices included in recent contracts
signed by the larger local operating entities and TELECCK with suppliers.
4.07      As telecormunication equipment costs are showing a downward trend,
the contingency provision on foreign supplied equipment has been restricted
to 3% to cover unforeseen design and engineering modifications. The local
costs of the project have been based on current prices with a 3% contingency
for design and engineering modifications and an annual 10% contingency for
wage and price escalation; the latter is in line with the 1966-69 average
price increases for labor and materials of the type to be used in the project.
Amount of proposed Bazk loan
4.08      A loan of US$15 million is proposed for the financing of the
items, all to be procured through international competitive bidding, listed
below:
US$ million
Local systems
exchange equipment                 5.30

Total                     15.00
Procurement
4.09      Items financed by the Bank loan will be procured by international
competitive bidding. The additional radio channel on the existing Bogota/
La Cruz microwave route and the additional Lincompex and telex equipment
are being procured from existing suppliers for standardization reasons; the
cost of these items which is in line with interrational prices will be
financed through suppliers' credit.



- 13 -
4.10      Certain goods such as cable ducts, poles, fittings which are
manufactured locally will be procured by local bidding. Cables will be
procured from the domestic manufacturers. These items are included in
local currency costs and are outside Bank financing.
Disbursement
4.11      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against CIF costs of
imported equipment and the foreign costs of the consultants. Estimates
of disbursements have been made according to the construction schedule
and are shown in Annex 12.
4.12      Any unused balance of the loan should, after consultation with
the Bank, be made available for the purchase of additional goods similar
to those already procured under the loan.
Project Execution
4.13      The construction schedule  for the main items of the project
are shown in Annex 15.  No assistance from technical consultants will be
required. Construction of the project will be carried out as follows:-
(i)  New microwave links, trunk switching plant, toll ticketing
equipment, the large and meditum sized local exchanges,
telex exchange extensions and the maritime radio plant
will be installed by the suppliers with the help of
TELECCI's staff.
(ii) Additional microwave channel, multiplex equipment, HF
equipment, construction of new VHF routes and redeployment
of VHF radio equipment, carrier equipment on overhead lines,
installation of small local exchanges, local cable works,
subscribers telephone and telex plant will be installed by
TELECCM since it already has experience in this work.
(iii) Buildings, routes and ductwork will be constructed by local
contractors under TELECOMts supervision.

5. JUSTIFICATIONi
5.01     The project aims at meeting the demand for local exchange and
long distance facilities in TELECOM's area of operations. It provides for
the development of local services by expanding present exchanges and ex-
tending service to new areas, and the expansion of long distance and telex
facilities. The components of the project are balanced and accord with
correct development priorities in the sector. The project would make an
important contribution to the economic development of Colombia by increas-
ing the efficiency of operations in administrative, industrial and commer-
cial activities.
Demand
(i) Local Telephone Service
5.o2     Of the 42,000 lines to be installed under the project about
24,000 lines have been allocated to some of the areas where TELECCI4 is
already providing local service. The remaining 18,000 lines are to be
installed in towns where there is no local service.
5.03     TELECCH had about 21,000 connected lines at the end of 1969.
Since then it has carried out further local expansion and has also purchased
t-he local networks of the North Santander Telephone Company, bringing the
total number of connected lines to about 31,400. Unsatisfied waiting
applications are about 3,500. In planning an increase of 24,000 lines
up to the end of 1974, TELECCEI is providing for an annual growth rate of
12.3%; this is in line with the average growth rate of the automatic
connected lines for the whole country (13%).
5.04     TELECOIIs plans for the extension of its local systems to new
areas of service have been guided by the population and economic importance
of the areas concerned. NJew; telephone exchanges are being provided in
about 200 localities having populations of between 5,000 and 30,000 with
a total population of over two million. The capacities of exchanges for
the new localities have been based on TELECQCIEs experience in towns of
similar population and economic background in the country.  Out of the
109 centers listed in Annex 3 the present density is, with the exceptions
of 12 localities, higher than one telephone line per hundred of the
population, without taking into account the planned expansion. The
capacity planned by TELECQI for the new exchanges totals 18,000 lines,
which will provide a density of less than one per hundred of population.
Planned expansion is therefore conservative.
(ii) Long Distance Service
5.05     Long distance traffic has been increasing at the rate of 25%
per annum. This high rate of growth is expected to continue during the
period of the program in part due to the high growth of local telephone



- 15 -
installations throughout the country and to the expected increase in
subscriber dialling of long distance calls following the introduction
of toll ticketing. The number of circuits has been worked out on a
route-by-route examination of traffic trends.
(iii) Telex
5.o6      The telex service is used mainly by large coamercial and
industrial firms. The number of telex subscribers has been increasing at
the rate of 8-9% per annum. International telex service has recently
Improved with the additional facilities offered by the earth satellite
station and this would stimulate the demand for telex facilities. In
providing an additional 1,000 lines the project allows for an annual
growrth of 10% in subscribers over the period 1971-1974.
Least-Cost Solution
5.07      TELECCMVs local exchange program consists of a large number of
separate small works covering the conversion to automatic working of
existing manual exchanges, the expansion of capacity in a large number of
existing exchanges and the provision of automatic exchanges in new local-
ities. The choice of automatic working for providing local service and
for handling long distance telephone traffic provides a better service
and represents the least-cost solution. For the expansion and extension
of local exchanges, the least-cost solution depends entirely on correct
ergineering design of the exchange systems.  TELECcM is handling these
satisfactorily.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
5.o8      The internal financial rate of return on the project is estimated
to be 29% (see Annex 13) at current tariffs. This gives a minimum measure
of the project's substantial benefits to transportation and industry by
way of increased efficiency. The rate of return was determined by equal-
izing the present values of expenditures and the incremental operating
cash flows attributable to the project.

6.02      In estimating the requirements for the construction works,
provision has been made for price escalation in the local costs of the
program (para. 4.07); escalation of operating costs during the period of
the program has also been covered (para. 6.12). The foreign costs of the
program and of debt service have been based on the rate of exchange as at



- 17 -
the time of appraisal (Col$18.5=U3$l), and no account has been taken in
those figures of exchange depreciation, which since 1968, has been about
5-6% per annum. However, the financing plan includes a reasonable provision
of Col$67 million as cover for any additional payments of debt service
and foreign equipment should exchange depreciation continue at the present
annual rate of 5-6/o A brief analysis of the sensitivity of TRIECCH's
cash flcw to currency variation is given in Annex 9.
6.03      The recent tariff increases are expected to provide TELECOM with
not less than Col$245 (US$13) million over and above that required from
internal cash generation for the approved requirements of the four-year
period 1971 through 1974.  Since the decision to increase tariffs was only
taken in December 1970 plans for the utilization of the new funds have not
been finalized, nevertheless it is known that TELECC4 will now be able to
acquire sooner than expected several of the larger local operating entities
at present in financial difficulties and requesting take-over. To ensure
that no interference is suffered by the Bank-financed project, detailed
procedural arrangements for the take-over of local entities, including
adequate consultation with the Bank, were agreed during negotiations.
It was furthermore agreed that TELECOM would obtain the approval of the
Bank before undertaking any capital expenditure additional to that included
in the 1971-1974 program if such additional capital expenditure during
any one year would exceed Us$50O,0OO0 or 5  of the previous year's capital
expenditure, whichever is the greater.
6.04      In November 1970, after consulting with the Bank, TELECOI agreed
to purchase, at a cost of US$1.2 million the local networks of the
Departmental entity of Norte Santander. Under the agreement TELECCM will
repay the amount due to the entity and to suppliers (US$0.9 million) over
the five-year period 1971-1975.
6.05      TELECOIM has agreed to take over the CAR network in 1974 at cost
(see para. 4.02, iii). The terms of the purchase provide for TELECOM to
take up from CAR a five-year 12% local currency loan of US$3.2 million
equivalent for the cost of outside network and to assume the liability
for the suppliers' credits on the exchange equipment estimated at US$1.5
million equivalent.
6.o6      TELECOM is arranging US$2.9 million by way of suppliers' credits
towards the cost of the supplementary Bogota/La Cruz microwave channel,
Lincompex HF equiprment and telex plant included in the 1971-1974 program
(see para. 4.04, (ii a & b and (iii)). A further US$ 3.2 million of
suppliers' credit, most of which has already been contracted, will be usedi
to finance the remaining works of the 1967-1970 program (see para. 4.01
and Annex 14).
6.07      Execution of a microwave link between Colombia and Ecuador and
the national data transmission network (see para. 4.02, iv) is expected to



- 18 -
cormmence in 1974. As no detailed studies are yet available for these items
they have not been considered at this time for Bank financing; however it
has been assumed that TELECCI will arrange financing for US$1.8 million of
the cost. Delay in the execution of this work would not interfere with
the Bank-financed project.
6.08      The financing plan takes into account an estimated US$3.5
million equivalent from subscribers' deposits and an estimated US$4.6
million equivalent which would become available for internal investment
from severance pay and pension funds (see paras. 3.17 and 3.18) and from
the settlement of past due receivables.
6.09      Suppliers' credits have been included in the forecast at 8% per
annum repayable over five years, these being the current terms obtainable

Future Operating Results
6.10      Forecast income statements to 1975 are given in Annex 6.  Fore-
cast operating results for the period of the program 1971-19774 are summarized
as follows:-
1971    1972     I972      1974
-(in millions of Col$)----
Total Operating Revenues        781.2   921.5  1,112.5  11352-5
Total Operating Ecpenses        589.1   712.8    863.8  1,058.3
Net Income       192.1   208.7    248.7    294.2
Operating Ratio                  75       77       78       78
Rate of Return                   18.8%   17.6%    18.8%o   19.9%
6.11      It is estimated that with the new tariffs and the introduction of
the additional facilities which TELE'CQH is at present installing and those
which will come into operation before the end of the program the overall
revenue should more than double between 1970 and 1974.  Telephone revenues
which should increase by about 37% in 1971 are expected to show an average
annual increase of 20-25% over the three remaining years of the program.
With the increase in telephone facilities domestic telegraph revenue is
expected to remain relatively static or even decline; provision has however
been made for an annual 8% increase in international telegraph revenue.
Telex revenue, which has been growing annually at between 20% and 24% durirg
the past three years is forecast to show a 17% average annual increase.
6.12      It is envisaged that operating expenses (excluding depreciation)
will show an overall annuial increase of about 20e. This would cover the
cost of the annual wiage awards, (an increase of about 16% per annum during
the last three years), higher social charges, additional staff requirements
and other operating expenses arising out of expanded operations.



- 19 -
6.13      With a much higher total revenue TELECOM's operating ratio is
expected to improve to about 75 in 1971. After 1971 a slight annual
deterioration of the ratio to 78 in 1974 is anticipated, this being mainly
due to the costs of additional operational staff required for the expansion
of the networks.
6.14      The forecast of TELECCli s future performance as given in para.
6.10 has been drawn up using the rate of exchange as of August 1970
(Col$18.5=US$l).  On this basis TELECCM is expected to have an average
annual rate of return of about 18.8% during the period of the program.
This would be highly satisfactory. However, a more realistic evaluation
of TELECOM's performance for the period of the program should take into
account possible currency depreciation (see para. 6.02); and a further
calculation has therefore been made by following the rate of return formula,
based on the dollar value of the assets, prescribed for Loan 499-co (see
Annex 10), and, as agreed during negotiations, to be continued for the
proposed loan.  On this basis, assuming a 5.3% exchange depreciation, the
rate of return would average about 15.1% per annum. A sensitivity analysis
of TELECOMI s rate of return to currency variations using the covenant
formula is given in Annex 9. Under Loan 499-Co TELECOM is required to
have a rate of return of 9% per annum. However, this rate would be in-
sufficient to generate the funds necessary for the new program and it was
agreed during negotiations that a rate covenant of 11% per annum from 1971
would be required.
Forecast Financial Position
6.15      Forecast balance sheets as of December 31, 1970 through 1975 and
related notes are given in Annex 7. TELECCM's financial position is
expected to remain satisfactory during the period of the program. Net
plant in service should increase from Col$667 million in 1970 to Col$1,352
million in 197k. At the end of the program, debt/equity ratio would be
37/63. Cash position should be very satisfactory.
6.16      Under Loan 499-co TELECOM is required to obtain the approval of
the Bank before undertaking any long-term debt unless its debt service
in any future year is covered 1.7 times by the net revenues of the pre-
ceding fiscal year or a later 12-month period prior to the incurrence of
the debt.  TELECCVils debt service has been considerably increased by
recent local and long distance expansion, the earth satellite station and
the new severance pay requirements (para. 3.18) and the entity has repeatedly
had to consult with the Bank under the covenant. A reduction of the debt
service covenant requirement to 1.5 times, which would provide adequate
safeguard, would reduce frequent requests for Bank approval for the
incurrence of new debt. This change was agreed during negotiations.

7. RECGIMETDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:-
a) annual increases in personnel will continue to be
restricted (para. 3.12);
b) an actuarial valuation of TELECOMts liability for
employees' pensions will be carried out and satis-
factory arrangements made to meet the ascertained
liability (para. 3.18);
c) the rate of return will continue to be computed on
the average value of net fixed assets in operation
calculated on the current Colombian peso equivalent
of the dollar value of the assets with a 4W  rate
of depreciation (para. 6.14);
d) tariffs wiU be maintained at such a level which
will provide an annual rate of return of at least
eleven percent (11%) on the average net value of
fixed assets in operation (para. 6.14);
e) approval of the Bank will be sought before undertaking
new debt if the maximum annual future debt service is
not covered 1.5 times by net revenues of a 12-month
period prior to the incurrence of new debt (para. 6.16);
f) the approval of the Bank will be obtained during the
execution of the program before any additional major
capital expenditure or investment is incurred (para.
6.03);
g) satisfactory arrangements will be made for the
settlement of receivables due fram the Government
and its agencies (para. 3.20);
h)  the Government will use its best efforts to insure
that telephone operating entities shall make due
and punctual payment of their debts to TELECOM
(para. 3.21).
7.02      The proposed project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$15 million for the term of 20 years including a four-year grace
period.

1969         548,250                 3.0                 2.75
Although in the past two years the growth of connected lines has been
hampered by the lack of new facilities, statistics provided by local
operating entities to PIANEACION show that demand is still growing.
Local operating entities expect to have one million automatic lines
connected by the end of 1975. This signifies a growth rate of about
13% per annum.

EMPRESA NACIOINAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES (TELECOM)
Notes on the Income Statements
1.   Operating Revenue
(i) Telephone revenue
(a) Installation fees have been forecast on the basis of
the estimated number of telephones to be installed
by TELECOM during each year.
(b) Rental and Urban calls have been forecast on the basis
of the estimated average number of telephones in oper-
ation during each year.
(c) National and international call revenue estimates
allow for the following annual increases:
1970   1971  1972  1973  1974  1975
National          21%   37%   20%   25%   25%   20%
International   100%   35%   30%   28%   30%   30%
National long distance call charges were increased
between 15.7% and 19.7% as from January 1, 1971. The
additional revenue arising out of these changes is
reflected in the projections of national call reve.nue.
The high increase in 1970 international call revenue
reflects the introduction of the earth satellite station.
(d) Lease of earth satellite channels relates to the contract
signed between TELECOM and ENTEL of Ecuador.
(ii) Telegraph revenue
(a) Since national telegraph traffic decreased in 1967
and 1968 and only showed an increased of 0.9% in
1969 (see Annex 3), no provision has been made in
the projections for any increase in national
telegraph revenues.
(b) International telegraph revenues have been assumed
to increase at an average annual rate of 8% after
1970.



ANNEX 6
Page 4 f 4 pages
(iii)   Telex revenue
National and international telex revenue estimates
allow for the following annual increases:
1970  1971  1972  1973  197h  1975
National          10%   15%   10%   10%   10%   10%
International    36%  36%   20%   22%   20%   20%
(iv) Other Revenue
This item includes income from services to the National
Post Office, rents, directory income, sales, etc.
2.   Operating Expenses
(i)  Wages, social benefits, etc.
The forecasts provide for an annual 16% increase in
wages with related increased social charges, the cost of
additional staff for TELECOM's expanded operations and
higher provisions for pension liabilities.
(ii) Other operating expenses have been reviewed on an individual
basis.
(iii)  Depreciation has been calculated at an average rate of about
5$ on annual gross fixed assets in operation. This is in
line with TELECOM's present depreciation rates as charged in
its accounts.
For the purpose of calculating the Financial Rate of Return
under the Loan Agreement, a rate of 47% is used (see Annex 10).
3.   Interest
In 1971 the interest charged to construction relates to
loan 499-CO. After 1971 all interest will be charged against
income.

Notes on the Balance Sheets
1. Fixed Assets
ti)  Depreciation reserve in 1968 was adjusted by TELECOM to correct
for previous over-depreciation-
(ii) lWork-in-progress as of December 31, 1970 through 1975 has been
assumed to be equal to 50% of the sum total of the work in
progress brought forward plus the gross capital construction
for the year.
(iii)  Provision for increased construction materials in store and in
transit has been made in 1971 and 1973.
2.  Other Assets
The analysis of this item for the period 1969 through 1975 is
given below:-
1969  1970  1971  1972  1973  1974  1975
------  =   (Col$ =illioi7T -----

(iv)  Employees' housing
loans                     21.1  30.8  39.5  45.2  49.9  54.6  59.6

Total        61.5  59.0  79.7  85.4  90.1 109.5  80.5
(i)  No change has been forecast for investments.
(ii)  TELECOM is required to set aside for the purpose of developing
local networks, a part (equivalent to the net revenues
arising from a 6% increase in the charges for manual and
semi-automatic calls) of the additional revenues arising
from the January 1, 1971 tariff increase. Given the time
required to value, take over, and absorb local networks,
and having regard to TELECOM' s current plans for the
development of local networks which will be financed from
its other resources, it has been assumed in the projections
that until 1974 the fund will be allowed to accumulate.
* After deduction of Bad Debts reserve Col$5.0 million.

(iii) Accounts receivables, which are non-current, are owed by the
Government and National Post Office; settlement of these debts
will be made by instalments in accordance with an agreed time-
table terminating in December 31, 1974.
(iv) Employees housing loans are expected to increase as follows:
1970   1971   1972   1973   1974  1975
---------(Coolillion) -------------
9.7    8.7    5.7    4.7    4.7   5.0
(v) Deferred charges are to be written off by 1974.
3.   Current Assets
(i)  Accounts receivable projections assume that TELECOM will show a
reasonable improvement in its outstanding receivables taking in-
to account increased revenue.
(ii) Other current assets consist of inventories, advances and prepaid
charges.
(a) Only a small increase in operating inventories has been
forecast during the period of the program. TELECOM is at
present reviewing its stores operations and following the
implementation of the consultants' recoimmendations econo-
mies in stock levels are to be expected.
(b) Advances and prepaid charges have been increased to cover
downpayments for equipment which will occur during the
construction program.
(iii) Current liabilities have been increased to take into account
TELECOM's additional activities.
4.   Equity
Equity figures were adjusted in the 1968 and 1969 accounts for
reclassifications and corrections, which mainly arose out of the audit
of the 1967 accounts (see para. 3.05).
5.   Provisions
The 1967 provisions of Col$65.3 million consisted of Col$25.9
million for self-insurance and Col$39.4 for severance pay. The self-
insurance provision was closed in 1968 following rearrangement of
insurance cover to meet the requirements of the Loan 499-CO. Severance
pay provision was transferred to long-term debt in 1968 when TELECOM's
liability for severance pay was assessed. Other provisions in 1968,
1969 and 1970 relate to loss of e;change.
6.   Subscribers' deposits
The estimates take into account the income from guarantee and
investment deposits (see Tariffs in Annex 5) received from new local
subscribers.

Sensitivity of Cash Flow and Financial Rate of Return
To Currency Variations
1.        Over the past three years the average annual rate of exchange of
the Co'ombian peso to the dollar has declined from Col$14.5 in 1967 to
Col$17.3 in 1969. Exchange depreciation in 1969 was about 5.3%. In August
1970, the rate of exchange was Col$18.5. The following analysis shows the
sensitivity of TELECGI's 1971-1974 cash flow and financial rate of return
to variations in exchange rates, on the basis of the Loan 499-CO rate of
return formula (see Annex 10).
2. Cash Flow
TEIECaL's cash flow for the 1971-1974 program will be mainly
sensitive to currency variations through the amounts required for foreign
debt service, and to a lesser degree through down payments to suppliers.
The table below shows TELECOI's foreign debt service for the period 1971
through 1974, as included in the forecasts i.e. using a rate of exchange,
Col$18.5=US$1, and on the basis of rates of exchange which allow for an
exchange depreciation of 5.3% per annum.

19.38      Total         358.4          Total          412.2
The figures show that should the rate of exchange of the peso
to the dollar continue to depreciate over the period of the program at
the same rate as in 1969, additional requirements for debt service would
amount to about Col$54 million.  Down payments to suppliers would require
a further Col$3 million. The additional Col$67 million provision in the
financial plan would be sufficient to cover up to about a 6% annual
exchange depreciation.

3.  Rate of Return
TELEC4 's financial performance is measured by the ratio of net
income, before interest, to average net assets in service, the value of
fixed assets and depreciation being calculated on a dollar basis and con-
verted at the current peso equivalent (see Annex 10). The tables below
show TELEC0IUs estinated depreciation, net asset values and rates of return
for the period 1971 through 1974 on the basis of a rate of exchange, Col$18.5
=US$1, and on the basis of rates of exchange which allmw for an exchange
depreciation of 5.3%, per annumn.

The figures shao  that shlould exchange depreciation continue
at the same rate as in 1969, TEICOM's rate of return would average about
15.1% per annum for the period of the program as compared with the average
of 18.8%O calculated in the forecasts.

Formula for Cbmputation of Financial Rate of Return
1.        The rate of return will be computed annually by relating the
Empresa's net operating income for the year in question to the average
value of the net fixed assets in operation.
2.        For the purpose of this computation:
(a) The valuation of gross fixed assets in operation and of
accumulated depreciation will be determined as explained
in paragraph 3 below.
(b) The "net fixed assets in operation" means the gross value of the
fixed assets in operation less the accumulated depreciation thereon.
The "average value" of the net fixed assets in operation will be
determined by adding the value of the net fixed assets in opera-
tion at the beginning of the year to the value of the net fixed
assets in operation at the end of the year and dividing the total
by two.
(c) The "net operating income" shall be determined by subtracting
from total operating revenues all operating and administrative
expenses, including taxes (if any) and adequate provisions for
maintenance; provision for depreciation should be included at
a notional hOg rate on the dollar value of fixed assets in
operation, converted into pesos at the average exchange rate
during the year.
3.        For purposes of computing future values of net fixed assets in
operation as basis for our rate commitments, the dollar value of gross
fixed assets in operation and the depreciation reserve will be recorded
in memorandum accounts which will be made up as follows:
(a) to the agreed value of gross fixed assets as at December 31, 1969
will be added each year a sum representing the annual amount of
new plant commissioned translated into dollars at the average
exchange rate during the year, subject to a deduction of an amount
for retirement of assets during the year;
(b) to the agreed dollar value of depreciation reserve will be added
each year a sum representing the annual provision for depreciation
calculated at 41a of the dollar value of the average gross fixed
assets in operation; appropriate adjustment will be made to reflect
retirement of assets during the year.
4.        For purposes of the rate covenant the dollar value of the net
fixed assets in operation will be averaged and converted to pesos at the
average exchange rate during the year.

2.    32 automatic exchanges, each having capacities of more than
200 lines, and totalling 22,750 lines, are to be installed in the
following localities according to the timetable mentioned:
(a)  1972
Malaga               Cerete           San Martin
Velez                Planetarica      Tocaima
Sahagun             Villeta           El Guamo
Lorica              Neira             Chaparral
Sabanalarga
(b)  1973
Cunday              Purificacion      Ataco
Ortega              Cienaga de Oro   Fresno
Natagaima           Venadillo         Ayapel
Cajamarca        Cucuta
(c)  1974
San Antero           Tierralta        Ocana
Iliomil              Pueblo NTuevo    Pamplona
Chinu               N-ionte Libano
3.    In addition, between 1972 and 1974,  ELCQI proposes to install
54 automatic exchanges of capacities up to 200 lines, and 186 automatic
exchanges of capacities up to 50 lines, in 240 small localities where
the population ranges from 5,000 to 30,000 inhabitants. The total
number of lines covering these areas would be 19,250.
4.    The project includes the purchase of 43,000 telephone sets and
PBX equipment.                                   -
B.  Long Distance Service
1.    The long distance routes which are included in the project are
shown in the maps 1 and 2. At present Barranquilla is the only regional
center not linked to the capital, Bogota, by a microwave route. The



AmNES 11
Page 2 of 4 pages
project fills this gap by extending the present microwave system from
Iviedellin to Barranquilla.  Other new microwave links are Medellin/Cartagena
and Bucaramanga/Cucuta/San Cristobal. The latter will provide additional
facilitiGs for connecting the national networks of Colombia and Venezuela.
The others will also provide for television transmission between Barranquilla/
Cartagena and iiedellin/Bogota.
2.   The project provides for the installation of a supplementary
microwave radio frequency channel on the present Bogata-La Cruz route
which is congested.
3.    The number of voice frequency circuits to be provided by the
installation of additional multiplex equipment on the main routes is
shown below:
No. of Circuits
Route                  1970       1974      Additional
Bogata-Barranquilla                 96        220          124
Bogota-Cali                        216        336          120
Bogota-Bucaramanga                  84        168           81
Bogota-Pereira                      60        108           48

Bucaramanga-Cucuta                  48         60           12
Total              876       l,500         624
These circuits represent only the extensions on the microwave routes.
The additional number of circuits required up to 1974 shows an annual
increase of 20% per year. This takes into account higher efficiency of
utilization through larger blocks of circuits.
4.   A number of HF routes will be equipped with technical equipment
(LIl\ICOMPEX) to improve transmission quality.  This equipment will be
purchased from the supplier of the original equipment and will be financed
by suppliers' credit.
5.   Extensions to the V-F network have been planned in the under-
mentioned routes.
Santa Marta-Maicao              Bucaramanga-Velez
Santa Marta-Cienaga             1Iariouita-Armero
Valledupar-Codazzi              lariquita-Dorada

The equipment will be provided by new purchases and plant withdrawn from
present VHF routes which are to be equipped with microwave system.
6.    Some minor routes having open wire lines will be equipped with
an additional 1,068 channels of carrier equipment. This will replace
obsolete plant and generally improve service in the small localities
concerned.
7.    To provide for the large increase in automatie traffic three
new automatic trunk exchanges will be constructed in Bogota, Medellin and
Cali for handling outgoing traffic. The existing exchanges will deal with
all manual and automatic incoming traffic.
8.    Under agreement with the local operating entities TELECOM will
introduce toll ticketing equipment for about 450,000 subscribers in the
cities of Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Pereira, Bucaramanga, Buenaventura,
Cucuta, Manizales, Ibague and Barrncabermeja. At present subscribers
dialled trunk calls are registered on the same meter together with the
local calls; this arrangement is not widely accepted by Colombian subscribers
and has held back the use of the Subscribers Trunk Dialling (STD) service.
Toll ticketing will automatically provide a print of the long distance
calls made by a subscriber and will remedy present difficulties. TELECCM
already has one such installation on order for Barranquilla under Loan
4;99-co.
C. Telex Service
TELECCM will increase its telex facilities throughout the country
by 1,000 lines and purchase an additional 1,000 new teleprinters.
D. Maritime Radio
The present equipment in the two maritime radio stations of
Buenaventura and Barranquilla is obsolete and does not comply with the
international agreements. T3LECOM proposes to purchase modern equipment
comprising six transmitters and six receivers for single side band operation
together with the related aerials, switchboard, accessories and power
supply equipment.
E. Consultants
TELECOM intends to seek the aid of consultants to recommend
and assist in the implementing improvements of its budgeting, costing and
plant accounting. A sum of US$300,000 has been included in the project
for this purpose.

2.        The calculation shows that the increased revenue from the new
investment would yield a rate of return of about 29% using 1970 prices.
3.        A sensitivity analysis of the internal financial rate of return
to four different assumptions is given below:-
Test 1:  The construction period is extended 251 (five years
instead of four), the construction cost is increased
15l%, the increased cost being allocated over the
construction period.  Benefits are also delayed by
the same duration as the construction.  The rate of
return falls to about 26%.
Test 2:  A 5% decrease in benefits is assumed.  The rate of
return falls to 23%.
Test 3: A 5,O increase in benefits would raise the rate of
return to 34%. The rate of return is increased to
34%.
Test 4: Exchange rate is assumed to fall by 5.3% per annum
(the rate of 1969) for the construction period. The
rate of return falls to 27%.
