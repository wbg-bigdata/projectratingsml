REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A FEEDER ROADS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$6.6 million to help finance
a Feeder Roads Project. The loan would be made on standard Third Window terms
of 25 years, including seven years of grace, with interest at 4-1/2 percent per
annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of Senegal" (212-SE) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on September 10, 1973. A special mission on public
finance visited Senegal in October 1974; its findings are included in this
report. Country data appear in Annex I.
Past Development
3.        During the 1960's, the Senegalese economy experienced virtual stag-
nation, as real output increased less rapidly than population, and per capita
GNP declined. Two factors were responsible for this situation. First, with
independence, Senegal lost its privileged position as the center of French
West Africa and therefore had to adjust to reduced economic, administrative,
and political dimensions. Secondly, the difficulties of adaptation to the
new situation were compounded in the latter part of the decade when ground-
nut production fell by 50 percent due to unfavorable weather and falling
export prices. In 1971, weather conditions improved temporarily, but 1972
and 1973 brought the Sahel's most severe drought in this century. Food
emergency operations avoided widespread starvation, but both the fiscal and
balance of payments situations sharply deteriorated.
4.        Public savings net of amortization, which had substantially improved
during the preceding years, were all but wiped out in. 1972/73 and 1973/74.
Revenues were affected by the decline in economic activity; and recurrent
expenditures were further increased by a rise in salaries to compensate for
the rapidly increasing cost of living, substantially higher debt service pay-
ments, and perhaps most importantly, heavy consumer subsidies which resulted
from maintaining low domestic prices in the face of skyrocketing food import
prices. Thus, at mid-1974, in spite of a US$46 million higher transfer to
the Stabilization Fund from groundnut sales than in the previous year, the
public finance situation was more serious than it had been since 1960.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



- 2 -
5.         Faced with a difficult situation in public finance, the Government
took a number of steps in November 1974 which were expected to put public
finances on a sounder footing. Consumer prices for rice, sugar, and ground-
nut oil were raised to bring them more closely in line with world market
prices. Thus, the consumer price of rice was increased by 70 percent (com-
plete elimination of the subsidy), the price of sugar was increased by 90
percent (leaving a subsidy of about 20 percent) and that of groundnut oil
was raised by 43 percent (leaving a subsidy of about 20 percent). However,
high world market prices for wheat required an increase in domestic flour
prices which the Government was reluctant to pass on to the consumer and
which led to a subsidy on flour. At the same time, when subsidies were
reduced, Government salaries were raised by 16 percent on the average, but
with actual increases ranging from 60 percent for the lower salaries to 3
percent for the higher salaries, to compensate for the rapid increase in basic
food prices. Farmer prices for groundnuts were brought closer to world prices
which were particularly high at that moment. The Government thought it could
safely reduce its take from the groundnut crop since world phosphate prices
had increased five-fold and compensating revenues from this source were
assured through expanded government participation in the phosphate mining
company and a 100 percent tax levy on excess profits accruing from the price
rise. However, during FY75 a good part of the additional public savings was
absorbed by payments for the increased participation in the phosphate mine and
the servicing of debt incurred to finance new investments and state acquisi-
tions of two foreign-owned public utility companies.
6.        Through FY75 the current budget of the central Government showed
record surpluses but deficits started to build up again in the Stabilization
Fund due to the consumer subsidy on flour and sagging world market prices
for groundnuts. The falling trend in wheat prices may enable Government
to phase out the flour subsidy in the course of FY76, but the financial
situation of the public sector will nevertheless become difficult again;
groundnut prices are continuing to fall and the world fertilizer market
has been unable to support the earlier five-fold price hike.
7.        The balance of payments also came under pressure in 1973 and 1974,
in the former year because of a w:idening of the trade gap and in the latter
year because capital outflows from the private sector partly offset a sub-
stantial improvement in the current account. Net foreign reserves at the
end of 1974 stood at minus US$44 million. In January 1975 Senegal drew its
full US$19.2 million allocation under the IMF oil facility.
8.         Balance of payments problems persisted through 1975 largely because
of cyclical factors. The good 1974 crop was harvested at a time when world
groundnut prices were still high; this created an atmosphere of optimism both
in the private and public sector. At the end of 1974, the state marketing
organization purchased the crop from the farmers at generous prices thereby
injecting massive purchasing power into the economy. In summer 1975 private
and public expenditures were booming, but the bulk of the groundnut crop
remained unsold, world market prices were 30 percent lower than a few months



- 3 -
earlier, and foreign exchange reserves fell rapidly under the pressure of
excess demand. The Government responded by introducing selective credit
restrictions which so far have been effective in reducing total credit out-
standing and stabilizing domestic inflation. Foreign exchange reserves
stood at minus US$66 million by the end of November 1975; this was financed
by a drawing in September of US$11.7 million under the second IMF oil
facility, by the monetary union to which Senegal belongs, and by the mostly
foreign-owned commercial banks.
9.        The first half of 1976 will see a continuation of the problems
experienced in 1975; the Government's reluctance to cut incomes of groundnut
farmers has encouraged it to maintain producer prices in the face of slack-
ening world demand for groundnut products. Unfortunately, phosphate rock
prices are weakening as well; this will effectively eliminate the cushion
which has enabled Senegal to absorb the recent rises in oil and other import
costs while implementing a policy of income distribution in favor of the
rural areas. Hopefully, this income redistribution policy will not fall
victim to the current difficulties Senegal is experiencing. There are strong
indications that several OPEC countries are willing to provide increased
capital aid; moreover, there remain substantial sources of additional balance
of payments assistance the Government can tap such as the IMF, Stabex and the
monetary union to which Senegal belongs. Finally, the Government has already
demonstrated its willingness to use credit restrictions and to eliminate
costly consumer subsidies to maintain control over the short-term situation.
Prospects
10.       As demonstrated during the last five years, weather conditions and
groundnut world market prices remain critical for Senegal's growth prospects.
The Government is striving, with our support, to reduce its vulnerability to
variances in these factors. Its long range program calls for development of
areas less affected by rainfall fluctuations (Casamance and Eastern Senegal)
where cash crops other than groundnuts can be grown. Irrigation is being
developed in the arid northern part of the country; this will reduce depen-
dence on cereal imports. With substantial gains also in industry, tourism
and fisheries, weather conditions and groundnuts by 1980 will be far less
decisive factors than today. However, groundnut cultivation is the mainstay
of the economy and provides the livelihood for the majority of the rural poor.
The Government is, therefore, introducing animal traction, fertilizers and
crop rotation techniques to raise the productivity of the groundnut farmer.
11.       The Fourth Development Plan (1973/74 - 1976/77) continues to give
highest priority to rural development (36 percent of the total), housing/
public utilities (18 percent) and transport infrastructure (16 percent).
Industry and tourism, quite justifiably, see their share increase from 5
to 10 percent of the total. Assuming average rainfall conditions, Senegal's
growth in real terms in the remainder of the 1970s will be of the order of
4.5 percent or about 2 percent per capita, which is still a considerable



-4-
improvement over the past decade. A new plan is under preparation and will
be reviewed in the course of a basic economic mission scheduled for the
Fall of 1976.
12.       The structure of Senegal's balance of payments will gradually im-
prove, but in the next few years the benefits of these favorable trends will
be reduced by falling terms of trade. Tourism, some new export industries and
an important expansion of phosphate rock mining will provide additional foreign
resources, and the implementation of existing irrigation plans will progres-
sively diminish the large food imports for urban centers. These prospects
combined with a favorable long-term outlook for groundnut production should
result in a healthier trade balance in the early eighties. The favorable
long-term prospects remain contingent on the execution of the investment
program which will have to be largely financed from abroad at a rate of about
US$125 million annually on concessionary terms. Traditional sources of aid
will probably not suffice, and it will take time before new aid flows from
Middle East OPEC countries are developed. Therefore, for the coming two or
three years supplemental foreign funds, over and above foreseeable project
aid, will be needed.
13.       The financial pressures of the past three years have already led
the Government to borrow on the Eurodollar market for a total amount of US$85
million, partly to roll over previous debts. Part of the expected balance of
payments deficits over the next two or three years could be financed through
access to the expanded IMF facilities or the Stabex fund; but additional
foreign exchange resources at a rate of about $25 million a year will pro-
bably be needed. Assuming additional borrowing to cover the gap is done on
Eurodollar terms, debt service would increase from six percent of exports of
goods and non-factor services in 1975 to roughly ten percent by the end of
the 1970s.
14.       In view of Senegal's performance in economic development and the
expected shortfall in the amount of concessionary aid needed to implement the
Government's development program and to raise the incomes of the rural poor
Senegal is considered eligible for Third Window loans from the Bank. The
country is creditworthy although foreign reserves are at the moment low and
will stay so for the rest of the decade because of the recent reverses in
the terms of trade. By extending the grace period on their loans foreign
donors can help to alleviate the balance of payments situation during this
period of financial stringency.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SENEGAL
15.       The Bank Group has had 23 operations in Senegal to date.     Total
lending amounts to US$116 million (net of cancellations), including fourteen
IDA credits, four Bank loans, two blends of Bank and IDA funds, two IFC opera-
tions, and one blend of Bank and IFC funds. Annex II contains a summary



- 5 -
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of January 31,
1976 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       Execution of these projects, apart from the Railway Project and
the Site and Services Project, is moving forward witlhout exceptional delays.
The procurement for the railway has been slow due to time consuming contract
approval procedures, but most project components have now been received or
ordered. The Site and Services Project is about one year behind schedule,
although physical execution is now progressing satisfactorily. The Bank
Group and Senegal held discussions recently on delays in reorganizing the
executing agency, Office des Habitations a Loyer Mod,re (OHLM), and in
implementing Government's commitment to reorient its housing policy in favor
of lower income groups. Two agricultural credits (140-SE and 404-SE) pro-
vided for technical assistance designed to facilitate the reorganization
of the Office National de Cooperation et d'Assistanc2 au Developpement (ONCAD);
while this program failed to achieve meaningful results for some time, the
Government recently took a number a steps to strengthen ONCAD's management and
financial operations. Some improvement, especially in accounting, resulted
from these efforts. But ONCAD's overall performance has not improved and the
organization remains overstaffed, which is costly in times of high wage
inflation (see Annex II).
17.       In view of Senegal's need for substantially higher capital inflows,
the scale of Bank Group lending is expected to increase significantly in the
future. The Bank Group share of foreign aid disbursements (including grants)
is expected to increase from about 6 percent in 1970/71 to 24 percent over the
1974-80 period. By then the Bank Group is likely to be the largest aid donor.
This will increase the Bank Group's share of the outstanding and disbursed
debt from 12 percent at the end of 1973 to about 25 percent by 1980. IBRD/
IDA share in public debt service will probably go up from 2.2 percent in 1973
to about 13 percent by 1980.
18.       The objectives of Bank Group project lending in Senegal fall under
four main headings. Priority will continue to be rural development, including
development of irrigation in the Senegal River Valley Region (e.g., the Debi-
Lampsar Engineering Credit), intensification of groundnut production and
diversification into new crops and new regions (e.g., the Sine Saloum and
Terres Neuves projects and the proposed Eastern Senegal Livestock Project).
As in the past, our agricultural lending is expected to exceed one-third of the
total. Secondly, we shall assist diversification of the economy by lending for
the growing sectors of tourism and industry (e.g., the proposed tourism infra-
structure project on the Petite Cote and a proposed second loan to SOFISEDIT,
a development finance company established with assistance from the Bank Group
in 1974). Thirdly, we shall continue investment for modernizing and expanding
the country's infrastructure (e.g., the project described in this report and
a Third Highway Project, and a proposed fishing wharf at Dakar Port). Finally
we shall continue lending to reorient and expand the country's education
system, as in the Second Education Project.

PART III: THE RURAL ROAD SECTOR
Roads and Agricultural Development
19.       Agriculture plays a central role in Senegal's economy, employing
over 70 percent of the total labor force. Although it contributed only 38
percent of GDP in 1974, the sector's leverage on the economy is and will
remain considerable through its impact on exports (over the past decade, agri-
cultural products have accounted for about 60 percent of total exports) and
rural demand for locally produced goods and services. Groundnuts and millet
are the country's main agricultural products, and groundnuts are the country's
principal export. During the last four years, groundnuts have comprised
between 35 and 55 percent of total exports and generated about 60 percent
of value-added in the agricultural sector. While agricultural development
potentials differ between regions, in general Senegal suffers from inade-
quate or irregular rainfall and poor soils, particularly in the Groundnut
Basin where the majority of the rural population is concentrated. In addi-
tion to the constraints imposed by nature, an important factor limiting
increases in agricultural production is the poor condition (due primarily
to inadequate maintenance) or total absence of rural roads. Government is
aware of the critical relationship between feeder roads and agricultural
development and has asked the Bank to assist in establishing a systematic
means of evaluating and meeting feeder road requirements.
The Marketing System
20.       Agricultural production falls into two main categories, crops
grown for export, mainly groundnuts, and those grown for domestic consump-
tion, primarily cereals; the mec.hanism for marketing varies according to
these categories. Office National de Cooperation et d'Assistance au Devel-
oppement (ONCAD) has the monopoly for the marketing of groundnuts which
it buys at a uniform producer price from about 1,700 cooperatives throughout
the country. Transport rates are fixed in five categories by ONCAD according
to road conditions. Benefits resulting from the project will accrue to ONCAD
where road improvements result in a road being shifted from a lower to a
higher category or to transporters if they result in improvements of a road
through better maintenance within a given category. These transport cost
savings should allow ONCAD to improve and extend its services to farmers.
Competition among the private groundnut transporters is strong enough to
ensure that transport savings would be passed on to the farmers in the form
of lower rates on the transport of consumer goods, agricultural inputs and
commodities other than groundnuts. Specifically with respect to cereals,
marketing is less well organized than with groundnuts and road improvement
would have a more direct impact. While Government has decided to expand
ONCAD's role in cereal marketing, cereals are presently bought both by ONCAD
(20-30,000 tons annually) and by private traders (about 50,000 tons). Pro-
ducer prices for cereals are set by Government, but except for ONCAD pur-
chases, products are sold freely, often below Government prices. Cereal



-7-
marketing suffers particularly from a lack of storage capacity 1/ and trans-
port. In regions where poor road conditions allow limited access, the
unreliability and high costs of transport and the lack of competition among
those traders willing to collect produce result in lower producer prices.
Farmers are therefore less inclined to generate marketable surpluses. In
these circumstances, access to feeder roads and the resulting reduction of
transport costs, and the increased competition this would permit, should help
stabilize producer prices at levels attractive to farmers and consequently
stimulate production increases.
Highway Network and Traffic
21.        Senegal's highway network is one of the most extensive in West
Africa, comprising about 13,300 km of which 9,100 km are classified, meaning
that their maintenance and improvement are in principal financed by the
national budget. However, only 5,840 km are presently being maintained and
of the remaining 7,460 km of roads, about 4,200 km are not classified as they
are under the authority of local officials whose limited financial means do
not permit them to do any significant improvement or maintenance work. Less
than half of the existing 7,460 km of feeder roads have been partly improved,
the remainder being rather ill-defined tracks without adequate foundations.
The proposed project addresses itself to the economically most important of
these partly improved or unimproved tracks. Traffic on rural roads is highly
seasonal and consists mainly of groundnuts and other agricultural products
and agricultural inputs. Traffic growth in the rural sector is projected to
be 4 percent annually on average, higher in areas in which there are specific
agricultural development projects.
Road Transport Industry
22.       The road transport industry specializing in rural transportation,
including agricultural commodities and inputs, is composed of about 250 firms
with some 1,500 trucks. There are 19 large firms (of which two are coopera-
tives of small owners) owning between 16 and 60 vehicles each while about half
of the rest of the industry is composed of smaller firms owning one or two
trucks, mostly of lighter build. Some trading companies and government agen-
cies have also established their own trucking fleets. Much of the freight
generated by commerce and industry is transported by the large modern firms
while the small ones rely on the groundnut campaign aad general cargo and
suffer from sharp seasonal traffic variations. Among smaller firms, competi-
tion is fierce and the rates are often barely sufficient to cover direct
operating costs.
1/   A study of cereals production, marketing and storage has recently begun,
financed under the Sine Saloum Agricultural DeveLopment Project (Credit
549-SE/Loan 1113-SE).



-8-
Highway Administration
23.       Highway administration is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Public Works, Urban Development ad Transport (MPWUT). Within MPWUT the
Directorate of Public Works (DPW) is responsible for construction and mainte-
nance of the classified highway system. As a result of a recent reorganiza-
tion of MPWUT, DPW has five divisions in Dakar (central, buildings, new works,
equipment and road maintenance) and seven regional divisions. Maintenance
works are carried out by the regional divisions under the overall direction
of the Road Maintenance Division (DER) with equipment managed and repaired by
the Central Equipment Division (PCM). A Subdivision for Feeder Roads, Bureau
des Pistes de Production (BPP), has been created within DER to coordinate
betterment and subsequent maintenance of the feeder road network. BPP will
receive assistance from a Directorate of Studies and Programming (DSP) in
MPWUT established to coordinate and execute planning for the entire ministry.
Staff for DPW come from existing Government personnel, training programs,
two technical colleges and several technical universities. These facilities
should produce sufficient Senegalese personnel to fill progressively positions
in DPW now held by foreign staff. At present, French aid (FAC) provides 14
engineers to MPWUT.
Development and Financing of Feeder Roads
24.       Development of the feeder roads system has been an important element
in many IDA financed transport and agricultural projects. A total of 494 km
of feeder roads and secondary roads related to agricultural projects were
financed by the First Highway Project (Credit 198-SE in 1970), the Casamance
Rice Project (252-SE in 1971) and the First and Second Terres Neuves Settle-
ment Projects (Credits 254-SE in 1971 and 578-SE in 1976). The Second High-
way Project (Credit 366-SE in 1975) contained the comprehensive survey of
feeder road requirements on which the proposed project is based.
25.       Until FY74, no funds were allocated for feeder roads, except those
included in Bank/IDA financed projects. Since then about US$178,000 have
been budgeted annually for these roads. These funds represent only a small
portion of Government's total expenditures for roads and its revenues from
road-user charges; less than 1 and 0.5 percent respectively. However, with
the proposed project alone, additional average annual expenditures of about
US$756,000 will be made on feeder roads over the next three years. If Govern-
ment continues the program at its present rate and extends it to the next
level of agricultural roads - the extensive farm-to-market network - which
is highly likely in view of Government's growing emphasis on rural develop-
ment, the financial requirements for these roads will grow very rapidly.
In fact, present estimates are that US$3 million annually would be required
for feeder road construction, improvement and maintenance by 1985. Given
Government's other commitments in the highway sector, it is unlikely that
sufficient funds would be allocated to the DPW budget for feeder roads. A
two-pronged strategy to stem this short:age of funds consists of: (i) re-
ducing the costs of feeder road works; and (ii) finding extra-budgetary
funds to supplement DPW's resources.



-9-
26.        Consultants BCEOM, as part of their feeder road study in Senegal
financed under the Second Highway Project examined various ways of reducing
feeder road costs and concluded that excavation and truck loading of laterite
for regravelling and routine maintenance operations could be performed with
considerable cost savings by labor-intensive methods. The proposed project
would use these methods. In addition, Government will look into other alter-
natives during project execution with the help of the technical assistance
experts included under the project. Government has agreed to discuss its
findings with the Bank and establish a program for i-ollow-up action at the
same time as the program for the second year of the project is submitted to
the Bank for approval. (Section 3.05 of the Loan Ag:reement.)
27.        Regarding alternative sources of funds, consideration has been
given to the possibility of increasing participation from the ultimate
beneficiaries of feeder road improvements, the ruraL people they serve.
This participation could be in the form of cash contribution, self-help
labor, or a mixture of both. As a result of Government's policy of admin-
istrative decentralization, Rural Communities, groups of villages with
about 10,000 inhabitants and with autonomous budgets, are becoming the basic
administrative centers in rural areas. Experience with the more established
Rural Communities, particularly in the Thies region, has shown that roads
are second only to wells on their list of priority investments. The Rural
Communities can therefore be expected to contribute financially and with
self-help labor for roads in their areas. particularly in periods of the year
when farmers are underemployed. Government will ex-lore the possibilities
of obtaining voluntary contributions in cash or labor from Rural Communities
for maintenance of feeder roads. As an incentive to these communities,
Government will examine with the Bank a formula to give priority to pledges
of voluntary contributions from Rural Communities wrnen selecting roads to
be included in the second and future year programs for feeder roads. Before
the above-mentioned contributions become available, DPW will have to spend
about US$556,000 annually for maintenance of the feeder roads to be improved
under the project. Government agreed that it will allocate not less than
US$556,000 for maintenance of the project roads and that these annual alloca-
tions will be increased in line with cost increases and maintenance require-
ments of the feeder road network. (Section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement.)
PART IV: THE PROJECT
28.       The Government of Senegal has requested that the Bank finance a
comprehensive program of feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance based
on a study of feeder road requirements under the Second Highway Project
(Credit 366-SE) carried out by consultants BCEOM. The project was appraised
in May 1975 and negotiations were held February 9-11, 1976 in Dakar, Senegal
with a Senegalese delegation led by Mr. Tidiane Ndiaye, Director of Finance
in the Ministry of Plan and Cooperation. The appraisal report (No. 941a-SE)



- 10 -
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides
a loan and project summary and the attached map (IBRD 11868R) shows the project
area.
The Project Area
29.       The project will cover the Groundnut Basin which comprises the
administrative regions of Thies, Diourbel and Sine Saloum, the Casamance
region, and the west part of Eastern Senegal. The project will not cover
the Cap Vert peninsula and the Senegal River region: the former already
has a fairly well developed secondary road network which is mostly paved,
while the feeder road requirements of the latter will be determined within
the framework of plans to develop the Senegal River Basin through major
dam and irrigation works.
Project Description
30.        The proposed project consists of a three-year program for the
improvement and subsequent maintenance of about 1,000 km of feeder roads
and maintenance of about 250 km of existing feeder roads, including the
following:
(a) purchase of highway equipment and spare parts:
(b) purchase of materials and supplies for the opera-
tions included under the project;
(c) technical assistance to (i) the Subdivision for Feeder
Roads (BPP) for implementation of the proposed road
improvement and maintenance program and (ii) monitoring
of the project; and
(d) construction of BPP's headquarters.
Project Execution
31.        Physical execution of the project is scheduled to begin in mid-
1976 and to take three years to complete. UIPWUT will be responsible for
execution of the project through BPP. To implement the feeder road program
BPP will need two engineers and two administrative assistants at headquarters
in Dakar. The latter can be recruited in the country. The two engineers
will be recruited from abroad for a period of two years until Senegalese
engineers have been trained. Road rehabilitation and maintenance will be
carried out by three BPP brigades, with some support provided by contractors
and possibly by community self-help programs. BPP's brigades will initially
be located in the regions of Thies/Diourbel, Sine Saloum and Casamance with
the Thies/Diourbel brigade transferred to Eastern Senegal in the third year
of the project. The Government has given assurances that, within the frame-
work of the project's objectives, feeder road brigades can be transferred
from one region to another according to the changing priorities of agricul-
tural development. (Section 4.03 of the Loan Agreement.)

32.       The feeder roads to be included in -the first year's rehabilita-
tion and maintenance program have been selected by Government with assist-
ance of consultants and with the approval of the Bank in areas where ongoing
or planned development projects would increase agricultural traffic. In
order to maintain a desirable degree of flexibility for iuture years, an
Interministerial Consultative Committee (ICC) will be created before
June 30, 1976 (Section 3.04a of the Loan Agreement) to review annually and,
if necessary, revise the provisional programs prepared for the second and
third years. ICC will be chaired by the Minister of Public Works and
will consist of representatives of the Ministries of Rural Development,
Plan and Cooperation, Finance-and the Interior (representing the Rural
Communities) as well as of ONCAD. These agencies will review and submit
annually their particular feeder road requirements. The proposal will be
coordinated and screened from technical and economic viewpoints by the
Directorate of Studies and Programming (DSP) of MPWUT. (DSP has been
established by Decree but not yet staffed; the proposed Third Highway
Project includes the services of four technical assistance experts for
three years to fill key positions and to train local counterpart staff
in their duties). The criteria 1/ for analyzing feeder roads have been
established with assistance of the Bank and the annual programs for the
second and third years of the project will be submitted to the Bank for
approval four months before the beginning of each working year. (Section
3.04b of the Loan Agreement.)
33.        Some civil works, particularly drainage structures and excava-
tion and hauling of laterite and construction of the BPP offices, will be
carried out by domestic contractors. Present administrative procedures for
contract approval and payment of invoices are slow for contracts of more
than minimal size and this tends to discourage small enterprises from bid-
ding because delays in payment cause serious liquidity problems for these
firms. Government has recently taken a number of actions to accelerate small
payments and is presently exploring other possibilities for simplifying and
expediting procedures. In addition, the proposed Third Highway Project
provides technical assistance to DPW to determine the action required to
promote the domestic construction industry. Labor-intensive methods for
routine maintenance and excavation and loading of laterite may be carried
out by self-help brigades of Rural Communities.
34.        Several concepts and assumptions included in the design and justi-
fication of the project require careful monitoring and regular evaluation
to determine the extent to which they can be replicated or should be modified
in subsequent projects. The project provides for monitoring by the technical
assistance consultants in BPP and by other experts of such items as the costs,
1/   These criteria include both a first-year benefit and an economic rate of
return of at least 10%, that a road section be in an area where there is
at present or will be in the future substantial agricultural activity and
that a road section fit geographically into the work-program of one of
the feeder road brigades.

productivity and quality of various methods of work construction and mainte-
nance, and the impact of feeder roads on, inter alia, per capita income,
traffic growth and transport charges. The project will include US$440,000
for 55 man/months of technical assistance.
Project Cost and Financing
35.       The total cost of the project net of taxes but including contin-
gencies is US$8.5 million. The proposed Third Window Loan of US$6.6 million
will finance the estimated foreign exchange component or 77 percent of
total project costs net of taxes.    The local costs (US$1.9 million equivalent)
will be provided by Government.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.        Equipment, materials and supplies amounting to about US$5.0 million
will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with Bank Group guidelines. Contracts for equipment, materials and sup-
plies costing under US$20,000, and for spare parts, can be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding in accordance with local procedures acceptable to
the Bank; the total amount of such purchases would not exceed US$400,000.
Civil works may be carried out by contract or by force account. Contracts for
the construction of selected civil works (drainage and crossing structures,
excavation/haulage of materials for base courses, and BPP office building)
amounting to about US$0.5 million, will be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally following procedures acceptable to the Bank. Con-
struction supervision will be carried out by BPP with the assistance of the
Regional District Engineers.
37.        loan funds will be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100 percent of c.i.f. costs of equipment, spare parts, and
other imported supplies and materials, and 91 percent of the
cost of these items if purchased locally;
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for technical assistance
services; and
(c) 64 percent of total costs (with taxes) of works by contractors.
Benefits and Justification
38.        The economic justification of the project rests on two types of
benefits from road improvement and subsequent maintenance: (i) savings in
total transport costs; and (ii) increased transport reliability and, in some
cases, provision of access to possible markets. Because of the prevailing
marketing system (para. 20), transport savings would have only a limited
direct impact for the farmer on the main agricultural product, groundnuts.
The per kilo savings in transportation costs due to the project (about 0.30
CFAF) would be insufficient: to warrant an increase in the national price



- 13 -
ONCAD pays farmers for groundnuts (41.5 CFAF). However, the total savings
for ONCAD in transportation costs as a result of the project would be sub-
stantial - about US$900,000 annually by year four, representing about 17
percent of ONCAD's present transportation costs. These savings will either
be used by ONCAD to expand and improve its services to farmers, or will
be passed on to Government's Price Stabilization Fund. In addition, road
improvement will increase ONCAD's ability to provide essential agricultural
inputs, particularly improved seed varieties, fertilizer, pesticide and
equipment, in sufficient quantity and on a timely basLs to assist farmers
in increasing their output. Transport savings will have a more direct im-
pact on cereal production. With easier and more regular access of trucks
to farming areas reducing the risk that surpluses wilL not find a buyer,
farmers can take advantage of modern agricultural methods to increase their
cereal production.
39.        Institution-building is of primary importanze, and the project
provides major benefits in this area which cannot be quantified. These consist
of: (i) establishing within DPW a Subdivision for Feeder Roads with separate
budgetary appropriations and its own equipment financed under the project;
(ii) setting up an Interministerial Consultative Committee with MPWUT's new
Directorate of Studies and Programming acting as its secretariat; and (iii)
trying to develop a system of partly financing feeder road maintenance on a
self-supporting basis through the involvement of Rural Communities. These
institutions will ensure that development of agriculture and of feeder roads
is effectively coordinated so that requests for feeder road improvement from
different regions of the country will be assessed according to uniform and
objective criteria. In addition, the possible participation of Rural Commu-
nities in maintaining feeder roads may help reduce the burden of these recur-
rent costs on the national budget.
40.        Economic justification for the road improvement component of the
project has been based on vehicle operating cost savings in areas where
agricultural activity is already substantial and on incremental value-added
on roads with little or no existing traffic which form part of an agricul-
tural development project. For the estimates of benefits from the mainte-
nance of previously improved feeder roads, only savings in vehicle operating
costs have been taken into account. The economic rate of return of the whole
project would be about 14 percent. The rate of return is considered conser-
vative as benefits from other than the main agricultural crops are not taken
into consideration, and the assumption of 4 percent traffic growth may be low
since most feeder roads to be improved are located in areas with ongoing or
future agricultural development programs aiming at a much higher rate of
production increases.

Credit of February 10, 1969 and Loan of same date (cancelled);
Effective June 25, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The credit is almost fully disbursed and a completion report is
being prepared.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. 252         Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Effective January 6, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Project progress is satisfactory although the number of farms super-
vised has not increased as much as anticipated. On the other hand, production
targets established at appraisal will be reached. Adequate rainfall will
ensure a satisfactory 1975/76 campaign, although maize production suffered
from heavy rains in August. Because of cost overruns, mainly due to the
increased number of extension staff, salary increases and changes in the US
dollar exchange rate, the project was running out of funds. However, Govern-
ment has made available US$960,000 to finance project implementation between
July 1975 and June 1976. Together with undisbursed IDA funds (US$900,000)
this would ensure enough money to maintain project activities until a second
project is submitted to the Board for consideration.
Cr. 253         Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Effective November 30, 1971;
Closing Date: October 1, 1976
All components except the Universit:y Institute of Technology (IUT)
have been implemented. This item is 2.5 months overdue and is now expected
to be completed in March 1976. Delay has been due largely to technical
problems. A cost overrun of about US$500,000 on the project as a whole
is anticipated; the Government will finance it.
Cr. 254         Terres Neuves Settlement Project; US$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Effective January 31, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project's settlement program was completed in 1974 as antici-
pated at appraisal. Adequate and evenly distributed rainfall ensured good
crops during the last two seasons. The project has been successful in pro-
viding higher incomes than expected for settlers and has attracted families
with more adult workers than anticipated. STN (the state corporation in
charge of the project) has taken over project management from the management
agency agreed upon at appraisal. During negotiations of the second project,
satisfactory arrangements were worked out to ensure adequate project manage-
ment and coordination with other regional agencies involved in the area.
The credit will be fully disbursed in the near future.

Cr. 314/Ln. 835      Second Railway Project:   US$3.2 Million and
US$6.4 Million Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972;
Effective December 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1976
The original project was substantially modified to reduce
track renewal works in favor of funds for spare parts for track laying and
maintenance equipment and for locomotives. By the end of 1975, US$6.0 million
had been disbursed out of the total Loan/Credit of US'j9.6 million; track re-
newal had been completed, as well as procurement for workshop rehabilitation
and orders had been placed for all track equipment and spare parts for loco-
motives under the project; bids for the civil works to rehabilitate the work-
shops had been submitted and were being analyzed. In recent months, as a
result of sustained efforts by supervision missions, :he railway has been
granted financial autonomy, locomotive availability has been increased result-
ing in a higher carrying capacity, and steps have been taken to strengthen
technical assistance. Much improvement is still needed, however, in manage-
ment efficiency, and a proposed Third Railway Project, scheduled for FY 1977,
will focus on this. A drop in international traffic (end of the Mali drought
relief program) and in phosphate traffic (slump in world phosphate market) has
weakened railway finances.
Cr. 336              Site and Services Project; US$8.0 Million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Effective August 31, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Progress has been made in removing the major bottlenecks
to project execution. To accelerate physical execution the Government has:
(a) created a separate Site and Services Project Capital Account authorizing
OHLM's Director General to make direct withdrawals under a post hoc audit
control and permitting accelerated payments to contractors; and (b) permitted
the continued use of a "procedure d'urgence" to accelerate tender award proce-
dures. As these measures have only recently been implemented, physical pro-
gress remains slow, although construction activity has visibly quickened.
These and other agreed upon measures should contribute to recouping some of
the delays now amounting to about one year. Some 1,100 plots have now been
allocated by public lottery. Plot occupation is expected to begin in early
1976. Rather than reduce the size of the project, the Government and IDA have
agreed to reduce the disbursement percentage on civil works from 67% to 45% to
ensure the availability of IDA funds for all project components. Although
improved working performance has been achieved at the executing agency level
and some counterpart personnel have been elevated to project responsibility,
adequate counterpart staffing continues to pose difficulties and will warrant
close attention.

Ln. 866              Telecommunications Project; US$6.25 Million Loan of
December 19, 1972; Effective June 5, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
Large cost overruns have raised the cost of this project
from US$8.9 million at appraisal to US$19.9 million according to recent esti-
mates. A co-financing formula was successfully worked out which included a
loan from the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of US$4
million, new French suppliers' credits of US$4 million, and an increased
contribution from our borrower, Office des Postes et Telecommunications du
Senegal (OPTS). The new financial package and conditions of the CCCE loan
were accepted by the Senegalese Government and the agreement would enable the
project to be completed as originally appraised. However, recently OPTS has
been informed that the Government intends to levy an income tax on OPTS's
profits from operations in FY 1975 and also for previous years. OPTS has
never before been subject to tax. This change of policy towards the OPTS
is causing doubts about the financing plan drawn up at the time the CCCE loan
was negotiated. These matters are being discussed with the CCCE and the
Government.
Ln. 867              Airport: Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of December 9, 1972;
Effective May 22, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
All project work was completed, the runway in full opera-
tional service and the loan fully disbursed by the end of January 1976. The
total cost of the project did not exceed the CFA franc costs made at appraisal
although the devaluation of the US dollar resulted in the proceeds of the Bank
loan financing a smaller percentage of the works than originally contemplated.
Cr. 350              River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million Credit of January 9,
1973; Effective June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1977
Procurement has been completed for the main components of
the project and contracts have been awarded. Construction of works is progres-
sing satisfactorily. The Senegalese authorities requested that the Debi/
Lampsar components of the project be deleted from Credit 350-SE and be reform-
ulated within the broader framework of integrated development of the Senegal
River Basin. The proposed reformulation was agreed upon by IDA and an en-
gineering project for Debi/Lampsar was appraised in December 1974 and approved
by the Board in April 1975. Because of price increases, US dollar devaluation
and additional works, the proceeds of Credit 350-SE will not be sufficient to
complete the project, despite the deletion of the Debi/Lampsar component.
The project authority SAED (Societe d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des Terres
du Delta), is presently seeking supplementary financing from Government of
about US$3.6 million to complete the project.

Cr. 366              Second Highway Project; US$8.0 M.illion Credit of April 9,
1973; Effective November 28, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
Implementation of the maintenance program and engineering
studies started about six months behind schedule and execution at the begin-
ning was slow but has improved since 1975. Engineering studies for the next
phase of pavement strengthening were completed during the first half of 1975.
Work on pavement strengthening began in February 1975, about 18 months later
than appraisal estimates. The pavement strengthenirg component originally
comprising 109 km of road rehabilitation had to be reduced to 35 km due to
higher construction costs than expected at appraisal., changes in the exchange
rate of the US dollar and the shifting of funds from pavement strengthening to
higher priority road maintenance.
Cr. 404              Second Agriculture Credit Project; US$8.2 Million Credit
of June 25, 1973; Effective November 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The 1974/75 campaign was good: groundnut and cereal
production (1.0 million and 0.7 million tons, respectively) reached their
highest levels since 1969. Demand for short and meclium-term credit under
the 1975/76 campaign remained stronger than anticipated, but available credit
funds were sufficient to cover requirements for this campaign, the output of
which is expected to be even higher than that of 1974/75.     Government intends
to cancel the subsidy on equipment but the subsidy on fertilizers will not
be reduced significantly, as required. However, the on-going study on fer-
tilizer applications financed under the Credit should provide a basis for
policy review. Major organizational and financial problems still exist at
ONCAD despite technical assistance provided since 1969. Steps taken by
Government in early 1975 to remedy this serious situation--maintaining staff
level, giving ONCAD management more financial autonomy and strengthening it
with qualified accountants--resulted in some improvement, especially in
accounting. However, ONCAD's overall performance has not improved and the
organization remains overstaffed. High wage inflation increased operating
costs without compensation through higher tariffs for its interventions.
ONCAD credit requirements attained record levels, partly because of accumu-
lating operating losses but mainly because of the large groundnut and millet
stocks and prolonged prefinancing for Government's account.
Ln. S-3              Ship Repair Engineering Loan:   IJS$0.6 Million Loan of
September 20, 1973; Effective February 5, 1974;
Closing Date: March 6, 1976
The project consists of carrying out the following studies
to determine the feasibility of a dry dock project:



ANNEX II
Page 7
(a) Technical studies including those of physical and
geophysical factors affecting site selection.
(b) Economic studies including a market survey, a
revision of the dry dock project feasibility study
and a survey formulating a training program.
The studies have now been completed; they indicate low economic and financial
returns, and a relatively high market risk. The Government is exploring
possible financing and ways of reducing the market risk.
Cr. 446              Drought Relief Project; US$3.0 Million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Effective February 5, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the Senegalese plan to rehabilitate
people in drought affected areas by assisting them to redevelop and improve
their farms and lands. Operations, including strengthening of health and
water supply services, have been proceeding satisfactorily and the project is
expected to be completed on schedule.
Ln. 987              SOFISEI)IT Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of May 24, 1974;
Effective November 22, 1974; Closing Date:    December 31,
1978
SOFISEDIT was created by the Government in March 1974 for
the purpose of providing long-term financing for industry and tourism develop-
ment. To recruit the initial staff and to find office space took several
months and the company did not start operations until November 1974. During
its first fiscal year of operations which ended September 30, 1975, SOFISEDIT
approved nine loans totaling US$2.4 million and three equity investments for a
total of US$320,000. The loan to SOFISEDIT is expected to be fully committed
by the end of 1976 and a second project was appraised in December 1975.
Cr. 530              Second Education Project:   US$15.0 Million Credit of
February 19, 1975; Effective April 22, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project management unit has been strengthened and is
functioning well. Design work on the four lower secondary schools is well
advanced and is proceeding satisfactorily in the case of the lower secondary
science/technology centers.   Construction at the Dakar Industrial Worker
Upgrading Center has begun and a tender has been issued for the National
Marine Training School. Equipment lists and bills of quantities of construc-
tion materials for the nonformal rural youth training program have been
approved by IDA. The Hotel/Tourism Training Center is delayed due to pro-
longed contract negotiations between the Government and the selected archi-
tectural consulting firm. Also the Government has yet to complete the terms
of reference for a preinvestment study of primary education.

Credit and Loan of May 22, 1975; Effective October 31,
1975; Closing Date: June 10, 1981
This project, which started in late 1975, aims at increas-
ing and diversifying agricultural production in the Sine Saloum region through
the reinforcement of SODEVA'S activities. Activities under the project, includ-
ing the setting up of extension services, are underway as planned.
Cr. S-18             Debi-Lampsar Irrigation Engineering Credit, US$1.0 million
Credit of May 22, 1975; Effective February 13, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The credit finances the execution of the engineering
studies needed for the implementation of the Debi-Lampsar irrigation scheme.
Despite delays in effectiveness, the studies are well advanced and the original
schedule for project implementation will not be substantially delayed.
Cr. 578              Terres Neuves II Resettlement and Eastern Senegal Technical

Effective November 14, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project, due to start in 1975, consists of the resettle-
ment of 600 families, and studies and surveys for a master plan for the Eastern
Senegal region.
