                          xiv
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1   Context at Appraisal

1.      Despite Argentina's recovery after the deep economic crisis of 1999-2002, many
problems persisted at the time of appraisal, including low access to and quality of health
services for the poor. This was the case despite sweeping health reforms, and despite the fact that
in the early 2000s, Argentina was among the top 20 countries globally in per capita health spending.

2.      Immediately after the crisis, the percentage of the population not covered by formal
health insurance had risen to 44% in 2002 (from 38% in 1997). The rest of the population had
formal health insurance coverage – either by the Obras Sociales (national social health insurance
programs) or by private health insurance policies. But those without formal health insurance had to
use the public healthcare system, where there were significant shortfalls in quality and sometimes in
service availability. This system was financed fully from public funds – since health care must be
provided for free at public health facilities – in a traditional manner based on financing of inputs,
without any link between health facility revenues and the quality of care provided.

3.      In response to the crisis, the Government of Argentina developed the Health Sector
Reform Program in 2003, with two main pillars – the first one providing financing for
essential public health actions. An innovative modality was used to provide provinces with
financial incentives to produce these actions. This pillar was financed by the World Bank under the
Essential Public Health Functions Project Phases 1 and 2 (P090993 and P110599), starting in 2006.

4.     The other major pillar centered around the Maternal and Child Health Insurance
Program (Plan Nacer), complemented by structural changes in the provincial health systems to
improve the efficiency of public financing and the delivery of health services. The latter was
supported by the World Bank Provincial Maternal-Child Health Sector Adjustment Loan (P072637).

5.      Plan Nacer started in 2004 as a provincial public insurance program providing a free
basic package of pre-defined cost-effective services, through participating healthcare
providers, to women and children without formal health insurance in the country’s nine
poorest provinces – those in the Northeast and Northwest. All uninsured pregnant and lactating
women (up to 45 days after birth), as well as uninsured children aged under six, were eligible. No
copayments or prepayments were (or are) required, in line with the principle of mandatory free
health care in the public system in Argentina.

6.      Plan Nacer is a pioneering Results-Based Financing (RBF) program in health. It is one
of the first large-scale programs worldwide to use an RBF approach in the health sector, and various
other RBF programs in health around the world have been modeled on it.

7.     Participating health care providers under Plan Nacer – all public providers in the
provinces covered – receive payments on a fee-for-service basis (conditional on quality) for the
services covered, on top of the financing they receive from the public system on a traditional
basis. These payments are only made for services provided to eligible (uninsured) women and



                                                 1
children enrolled in the program, and are conditional on pre-defined protocols being followed (to
assure quality). Annex 10 lists the services covered – all maternal and child health services.

8.      At the same time, there is a second level of Results-Based Financing (RBF), whereby
payments are provided to provinces on an RBF basis, as part of a two-stage incentive
mechanism. The National Ministry of Health (NMH) makes performance payments to provinces
called capitation payments – based on the number of eligible persons that have been enrolled in the
program, and on provincial achievement regarding a list of ten “tracer? indicators (e.g. prenatal care
coverage in eligible women, following pre-determined quality protocols – see Table 2 of Annex
10). 1 The financing received by the provinces via this mechanism is used to make the payments to
the health facilities on a fee-for-service basis. Thus there are two stages of RBF payments: one from
NMH to the provinces, and the other from the provinces to the health facilities. The achievement of
performance indicators by both provinces and health facilities (including adherence to quality
protocols) is verified by an external audit firm (see Annex 10). The goal is to move from a
traditional health system based on inputs and fixed budgets to one geared toward outputs and results.

9.     The initial phase of Plan Nacer, covering the nine poorer northern provinces of the
country, was financed by the first loan of the Provincial Maternal-Child Health Adaptable
Lending Program (PMCH-APL, P071025). This APL was approved by the Board for an amount
of US$435 million in April 2004. The Project Appraisal Document for the first phase APL (APL-1)
had anticipated that the program would be rolled out nationwide over three phases, and the first
phase would consist of APL-1 (for US$135.8 million) covering the nine northern provinces.

10.     However, it was decided to merge the planned second and third phases of this APL
series into one single loan, APL-2 (P095515), financing a rollout of Plan Nacer across all 24
provinces of the country. This decision was taken due to the strong demand from the provinces
that were not included in APL-1, as well as the positive assessment on the part of the Government
and the Bank of APL-1 implementation in the nine northern provinces. APL-2 was approved by the
Board (for US$300 million) in November 2006. Its anticipated closing date was December 2011.

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

11.     The Project’s PDOs were: (a) to increase access by eligible uninsured mothers and children
to basic health services; (b) to strengthen the incentive framework for efficiency and focus on
results between the national level and the eligible provinces and among eligible provinces and
service providers by linking financing to both services actually rendered to the target population and
to the achievement of the Maternal and Child Health Insurance Program (MCHIP) results as reflected
by the selected ten tracers of the Trazadoras (Tracers) Matrix. The “eligible provinces? were
defined in the original Loan Agreement as the 15 provinces not covered by APL-1, but this
definition was later amended in April 2010 to also include the nine poorer provinces covered by
APL-1, given that APL-1 was about to end in July 2010.

  A fixed maximum capitation amount is given to each province per eligible person enrolled in the program. Forty
percent of this maximum amount is based on provincial performance regarding the ten tracer indicators – 4% for each
tracer indicator – while the remaining 60% of this maximum amount is given regardless of tracer indicator performance.
Thus, in effect the province receives somewhere between 60% and 100% of the maximum capitation amount –
depending on tracer performance – per eligible beneficiary that is enrolled.

                                                          2
12.     The Project had eleven PDO indicators (given in Table 3), of which eight were closely
linked with the enrolment or “tracer? indicators used to determine provincial performance.
These eight PDO indicators were measured at the national level, while the corresponding enrolment
or “tracer? indicators were measured at the provincial level, for each province.

1.3   Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

13.      The PDO remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project.

1.4   Main Beneficiaries:

14.    The main beneficiaries were pregnant and lactating women (up to 45 days after birth) and
children aged under six years, without formal health insurance, in all provinces. The indigenous
population as a whole also benefited from the Indigenous Peoples’ Plans (IPPs). Others in the
population also benefitted indirectly from improved health services.

   2      US$10.2 million (US$16.0 million): Reorganizing provincial Ministries of Health; improving epidemiological
          information, financial, and human resource management systems; studies for policy formulation.
   3      US$17 million (US$667,000): Dissemination of detailed information about the program among major
          stakeholder groups; community outreach to increase participation of the eligible population.
   4      US$14.6 million (16.8 million): Information technology design services, software and equipment, and related
          training; external concurrent audits; in-depth evaluations (including surveys and Impact Evaluation).
   5      US$1.6 million (2.6 million): Operational expenses (e.g. travel, per diems).
Note. Component 1 was co-financed by the Government in two ways. First, the Government financed salaries,
infrastructure, etc. at the health facilities. Second, from January 2011 onwards for the Phase 2 provinces (and from
August 2010 onwards for the Phase 1 provinces), 30% of each capitation payment (i.e. the monthly payment for each
person covered) was paid by the province. The rest (70%) was covered by the Bank loan.

1.6   Revised Components

16.      The Project’s components were not revised during implementation.

1.7   Other significant changes

17.    Two restructurings took place during implementation, in April 2010 and in June 2012.
In both cases, there were changes in the allocation amounts for the different loan categories of
disbursement (consultant services, goods, training, operating costs and capitation payments, which
consisted of a separate category). The changes were not large, and the allocation for capitation

payments – the heart of the Project – ended up increasing from US$208.5 million to US$212.1
million. No other changes took place in the second restructuring.

18.    In the first restructuring, further changes took place: (i) the closing date was extended to
December 2012; (ii) the Bank co-financing percentage for the capitation payments category was
changed; 2 (iii) coverage was expanded from just 15 provinces to all provinces; and (iv) the basic
package of services covered by the program was expanded to also include congenital heart disease
(CHD) treatment for children and additional complex maternal health services. The latter was due to
analysis showing: (a) CHD was a major factor underlying child mortality in the country; and (b) the
package needed additional services to better address higher-risk births.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

19.    This ICR’s findings for the Project (APL-2) preparation and implementation phase,
until June 2010, are based on the findings of a Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio
(QALP-2) report, done in June 2010 by the World Bank Quality Assurance Group (QAG). Annex
11 provides details of this report, including ratings for different aspects of Project and Bank
performance, and a comparison of these ratings with ISR ratings. QAG assessments are considered
to be independent and often critical, and this ICR considers QALP-2 to be a largely accurate
assessment of the Project at the time. See also Annex 12 for more information.

2.1   Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.    The ICR for APL-1 noted “a deep understanding of Argentina‘s complex health sector,
the lessons learned from the Bank‘s rich health sector portfolio, and the difficult
circumstances the country was going through?. This finding remains relevant for APL-2.

21.     The lessons drawn upon at the preparation stage were appropriate, and were
incorporated appropriately into the Project design. APL-2 took into account not just the lessons
from the preparation of APL-1, but also those from implementation of APL-1, featuring in
particular: (i) an additional element in the independent concurrent audit to verify the compliance of
the provinces with key elements of Plan Nacer; and (ii) expanded technical assistance.

22.     The rationale for Bank intervention for APL-2, as for APL-1, was solid. A major
rationale was the Bank’s long experience with Argentina’s health sector (more than ten years),
resulting in significant comparative advantages in supporting Government efforts that combine
policy reform with investments to contribute to longer-term institutional improvements.

23.    The QALP-2 report gave an overall rating of Satisfactory for the Quality of Design,
highlighting some of the following as key strengths, which this ICR agrees with:



2
  Instead of falling over time from 100% to 70%, and then to 40%, it would fall to just 70%. The portion of the
capitation payments not financed by the Bank was supposed to be financed by the provinces. The original loan
agreement was found to be abrupt and unrealistic in expecting the Bank co-financing percentage to fall to 40%
(implying that the provincial contribution would rise to 60%) so rapidly.



                                                      4
•   Strategic relevance and appropriateness of Development Objectives: The Project designed
    a public insurance system that increased access to health care services for an underserved low
    income and vulnerable population group.

•   Adequate attention to technical aspects and financial sustainability: The Project has a solid
    and internally consistent framework for technical aspects. There should be no undue risk to
    financial sustainability given the relatively small size of this operation (about 1% on average of
    total provincial public health expenditures). (See also Section 4 on sustainability.)

•   Quality of institutional framework for the Project: The Project was framed to work within
    the institutional structure in existence at the time of appraisal.

•   Extent of integration and quality of financial management and procurement aspects in
    project design: Adequate measures were in place to support early start-up of procurement
    activities, and team’s procurement specialists were fully integrated with other Project activities
    during the design phase. The Project Financial Management (FM) risk assessment was thorough,
    and took into account the Bank's Country Financial Accountability Assessment of 2002.

•   Quality of arrangements for governance and anti-corruption in Project design: The Project
    avoided altering the political economy ramifications while introducing an empirically driven
    performance system for allocating resources. The introduction of an external auditing system
    provided a measure of verification and third party monitoring.

•   Extent of integration and quality of environmental aspects in Project design: This was rated
    as Highly Satisfactory by QALP-2. APL-1 financed a high-quality Strategic Environmental
    Assessment with detailed analysis of the environmental risks affecting maternal and child health.

•   Government ownership of the design process: The QALP-2 report gives a Highly
    Satisfactory rating for this, saying: “There has been clear political will on the part of the central
    and provincial authorities. The decision to widen the scope of the Project to cover a wider set of
    provinces was in response to demand from the provinces to be included….?

24.      Other strengths noted in the ICR for APL-1 regarding the quality of design are also
relevant in this ICR for APL-2. These include (see Annex 12) high relevance; a pro-poor focus;
innovative results-orientated systems of incentives; strong collaboration with various actors; and
appropriate choice of lending instrument since the use of an APL allowed the approach to be tried
out first in the northern provinces under APL-1 before including the other provinces under APL-2.

25.    Some weaknesses in design were also identified by QALP-2, which ultimately did not
turn out to be significant shortcomings given the information available after the Project close:

2.1(a) Factors seen by QALP-2 as the Main Reasons for Lagging Achievement in the PDO
Indicators:

26.     The evolution of several PDO indicators was lagging at the time of the QALP-2 report
– which rated achievement of these indicators at Project close as “Moderately Likely? – and
the following are the main reasons identified for this (see Annex 12 for full details):


                                                   5
 i. Readiness for Implementation: QALP-2 stated: “APL-2 was judged to be ready for
    implementation based on the successful implementation of the first two years of APL-1 in nine
    provinces….the addition of 15 provinces and thereby covering the whole country was ambitious
    and resulted in a slow start up.? At the time of the QALP-2 in June 2010, many of the provinces
    that had been newly included under APL-2 (the “Phase 2? provinces) still had low rates of
    coverage by the program, even though these were relatively richer than the “Phase 1? provinces.

ii. Realism of Project Design, and Varying Provincial Capacities: QALP-2 found that “the
    overall Project design is realistic? but “could have taken into consideration? varying provincial
    capacities – referring particularly to the Phase 2 provinces where performance was lagging.

iii. The role of municipalities in the larger Central Region provinces (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe
     and Cordoba): QALP-2 noted the “institutional complexities? here because in these provinces,
     oversight over the provision of health care services was handled not by the provinces but by the
     municipalities, which represented an additional layer of management in between the provinces
     and the providers. But the municipalities did not receive performance payments (nor any other
     payments) under the program. Providing them with such performance payments would have
     enhanced their incentive to facilitate good performance by providers.

iv. Measuring and auditing performance requires a strong information system that was
    initially not present in some provinces. The depth of existing information systems in various
    provinces was initially insufficient in order to follow the fast pace of required reporting to
    obtain financial incentives. However, this improved over time, during implementation, as
    improvements were made to the existing information systems.

2.1(b) Other factors:

v. Procurement aspects in Project design: QALP-2 rated this as Moderately Satisfactory (MS),
   explaining that this rating (rather than Satisfactory) was because of an INT investigation that
   had just been launched (see below), indicating that the initial procurement risk assessment now
   appeared “naïve?. The Bank Team explained that the Minister herself initiated the investigation,
   indicating Government pro-activeness to resolve any potential corruption issues.

vi. Social aspects in Project design: The QALP-2 report gave an MS rating for integration of
    social issues in Project design, citing “a sound basic orientation on essential concepts and
    approaches, coupled with an insufficient attention to the mechanisms of implementation?.

27.    Despite the weaknesses in design mentioned in QALP-2 (listed above), QALP-2 still
rated the Project design as Satisfactory, and anyway these weaknesses were later addressed
successfully and turned out to be at most minor shortcomings when assessed at Project close:

   • The first four of the six weaknesses listed above were seen by QALP-2 as the main reasons
     for the then-lagging PDO indicators. These would have been significant shortcomings if the
     PDO indicators had continued to progress at a slow rate. However, as described below, an
     Action Plan implemented in the last year of the Project led to substantially improved
     performance (even in the large Central Region provinces). Hence, these four weaknesses
     ultimately did not significantly hamper performance when assessed at Project close.


                                                 6
      • The weakness noted by QALP-2 on procurement (fifth in the above list) was due to the
        ongoing INT investigation. But ultimately the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.
      • Regarding the last (sixth) identified weakness in the above list, performance in social aspects
        and social safeguards improved substantially later during implementation (see Section 2.4).

2.2    Implementation

28.    QALP-2 found implementation progress overall to be Moderately Satisfactory (MS) in
June 2010 (see Annex 11). High ratings were given for several aspects of implementation (notably
Government ownership and commitment), while some weaknesses were identified (see Table 2).

29.    During the subsequent Midterm Review (MTR) of November 2011, the PDO rating
was downgraded from MS to MU since at that time only three of the eleven PDO outcome
indicators were on track to be fully achieved (based on end targets) – but performance was
good overall in the poorer “Phase 1? provinces (i.e. the provinces that had entered earlier in the
program under APL-1.) The lagging indicators were mostly those related to the tracers in the 15
“Phase 2? provinces that had been included later in the program – under APL-2 – and was
especially low in the provinces of the Central Region (see Table 1 of Annex 2).

30.     The relatively good performance of the tracer indicators in the Phase 1 provinces was
matched by good performance regarding various indicators of implementation, in particular
the provincial “resource transfer rate? to the health service providers. The “resource transfer
rate? in a province is the percentage of the total performance payments transferred under Plan
Nacer to the province that has, in turn, been transferred onwards (on a fee-for-service basis) to
providers. If the system is working well in a province, this percentage should be more than 80%. A
low “resource transfer rate? implies a large unutilized balance in a provincial Bank account. At the
time of the MTR, the “resource transfer rate? exceeded 80% in all Phase 1 provinces. Conversely,
the poor overall performance of the tracer indicators in the Phase 2 provinces was matched by low
provincial “resource transfer rates?. Of the 15 Phase 2 provinces, only four had a “resource transfer
rate? exceeding 80%. In three provinces, the “resource transfer rate? was less than 40%.

31.    The reasons for the poor tracer performance and poor implementation in many Phase
2 provinces were attributed mainly to a few major factors (which were later addressed),
including weaknesses in information systems, overestimation of the capacity of the provinces to
engage in a new results-oriented approach and issues with Component 3 (see Table 2).

32.     After the MTR the Government conducted an in-depth analysis of the factors that
hindered the performance and based on the results, initiated an Action Plan to address them
(see also Annex 7). A special focus was given to the lagging Phase 2 provinces. A major focus of
the Action Plan was on addressing the reporting, billing and information capture issues, including
substantial improvements in existing information systems. The national Project team substantially
increased the frequency of supervision visits to the provinces, and regional meetings were held
regularly. Different selected individuals in the national team were each “assigned? to one province.
As part of the Annual Performance Agreements signed between the national team and the provincial
teams, a list of the larger health providers was identified in each province. The provincial teams
committed to closely following these providers, and health coverage targets were included in the
Annual Performance Agreements signed between the provincial teams and the providers.

Delays in Impact Evaluation (IE) activities and in the MTR (QALP-2).                      Although IE activities were delayed, the Bank and Government teams showed a great
                                                                                          degree of adaptability, and solid results have now been obtained despite the challenges
                                                                                          (see Annex 13). The MTR took place later than expected, but as part of the MTR an in-
                                                                                          depth diagnosis was undertaken of the causes of the lagging tracer (and PDO) indicators,
                                                                                          and this was instrumental for the development after that of a successful Action Plan.
The MTR found that the PDO indicator targets were too ambitious, given the timeline       The high degree of achievement of the PDO indicators (see Section 3) suggests that most

but by the municipalities (see Section 2.1 for more details) (QALP-2, MTR).
There was room for some potential efficiency gains from pricing of services (MTR).        This was addressed as part of the close engagement with the provincial level under the
                                                                                          post-MTR Action Plan.
Towards the end of the Project, some provinces had problems in making their               The national Government required that under the new follow-on Plan Sumar program,

                                                                                            8
33.     The Action Plan addressed the major weaknesses identified (see Table 2) and had a
positive impact on the performance of the tracers, especially for the Phase 2 provinces – and
hence also on the PDO indicators. Between the January to April 2011 “cuatrimestre? (latest data
at the time of the MTR) and the May-August 2012 “cuatrimestre?, the improvement in tracer-
related indicators for the Phase 2 provinces ranged from 22% to 43% of the target population within
a period of 16 months (see Table 1 of Annex 2). Improvements were also made in several indicators
for Phase 1 provinces, but less so since they had started at higher levels to begin with. Overall
performance for the PDO indicators improved significantly, since seven of the 11 PDO outcome
indicators were linked closely with provincial tracer indicators.

34.     The disbursement rate and the provincial “resource transfer rates? also improved
substantially. The disbursement rate rose sharply, from 59% at the time of the MTR to 100% just
after Project close (see Annex 1). And by the Project close, the average “resource transfer rate? of
the 15 lagging “Phase 1? provinces was 83.4%, as compared to 62.5% at the time of the MTR.

35.     A key feature of implementation was the constant interaction between the Bank and
Government teams on the ground. Most of the Bank team consisted of country-based staff with
strong skills who engaged constantly with the Government team. This close engagement, as well as
the Government team’s pro-active efforts, was key in addressing the many emerging challenges.

36.    The following are some ratings changes that occurred towards the end of the Project:
(a) The Project Management rating was raised from MS to S in the last two ISRs, given the steps
taken by the Government to develop and implement an Action Plan successfully, after the MTR;
and (b) in the last ISR, the social safeguards rating was raised from MS to S, and the PDO rating
was raised from MU to MS (see Sections 2.4 and 3.2 for respective explanations).

2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

37.    Design of M&E: This included: i) internal oversight; ii) external concurrent audits; and iii)
Impact Evaluations. The Project tracked results indicators for level of coverage and achievement of
outcomes included in the tracer indicators, and monitored the quantity of services delivered.

38.     Project Results Framework and Linkages at Different Levels: Eight of the Project’s 11
PDO outcome indicators were closely linked to provincial enrolment or tracer indicators (which
were used to determine the level of the performance payments to the provinces). Furthermore, the
enrolment and tracer indicators in each province were closely linked to the services in the
Nomenclador (the package of services whereby health service providers received a fixed fee per
unit of service provided). 3 Thus, provincial performance – which was linked to the PDO outcome
indicators – was in turn closely linked to the performance of service providers. This alignment of
performance indicators at different levels represents good design, except for the larger Central
Region provinces where municipalities were key but received no performance payments.


3
  For example, one of the provincial tracer indicators was the proportion of eligible pregnant women with the first
antenatal care visit before 20th week of pregnancy. At the same time, antenatal care visits are services for which health
facilities receive fee-for-service payments (subject to the required protocol being followed). So, stimulating production
of these services at the health facility level in turn stimulates overall achievement of this particular tracer indicator.


                                                            9
39.     Implementation and Utilization of M&E: The Project’s outcomes and outputs were
adequately monitored throughout implementation. The provincial tracer targets were not always
closely linked to the PDO indicator targets, but this linkage was emphasized towards the end of the
Project under the Action Plan developed after the MTR. The External Concurrent Audits (ECAs)
generally worked well, despite procurement-related delays occurring twice (see Annex 12).

40.     Evaluation Agenda Including Impact Evaluation (IE): The Project had a broad
evaluation agenda, including in-depth IE, but this in turn led to initial challenges and delays.
For example, the baseline IE survey for the Phase 2 provinces was conducted in 2008/09 instead of
in 2007 as originally planned. There were other challenges with the surveys and survey data. But
the Government and Bank teams have been innovative and adaptable in responding to unanticipated
changes on the ground, and were ultimately able to use sources of information other than those
originally anticipated, to adapt the evaluation strategy and generate solid results (see Annex 13).

41.     Importantly, the Government shifted towards a more comprehensive evaluation
agenda, going beyond IE. Quantitative and qualitative studies outside of the IE exercise were
implemented to assess critical aspects of the program that could not be covered under the IE sub-
program, including, among others: (i) a study examining how health workers’ motivation is affected
by an RBF program; (ii) an assessment of users' satisfaction; (iii) an analysis of the synergy
between the Universal Child Allowance program and Plan Nacer; and (iv) a review of the results
linked to the implementation of a CHD Surgery Network. This evaluation agenda was financed
mostly from the Government’s own funds – a sign of direct involvement and leadership on the part
of the Government in institutionalizing a broad evaluation agenda for the program.

2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.     Environmental and Social Safeguards: APL-1 financed a high-quality Strategic
Environmental Assessment on environmental risks affecting maternal and child health. QALP-2
provided an MS rating for social safeguards in the quality of design, mentioning insufficient
attention to the mechanisms of implementation (see Annex 11). It also accordingly provided an MU
rating for implementation and Bank supervision on social aspects, based on information available as
of March 2009. The rating for compliance with the Indigenous Peoples policy (OP 4.10) had been
downgraded to MS in June 2009, not long before QALP-2. In November 2012, it was upgraded to
Satisfactory again (in the last ISR), based on much-improved implementation at the later stages,
including: (a) good overall progress on implementation of the Indigenous Peoples Plans (IPPs) of
2010/2011; (b) the activities in the 2010/2011 IPPs that were not completed were discussed in detail
as part of consultations for a new round of IPPs, provided to the Bank for 10 provinces in October
2012; (c) for the 5 new provinces that triggered OP 4.10, 4 social assessments had been undertaken.

43.    Financial Management (FM): The rating for FM was Satisfactory until December 2009
and was then downgraded to MS (due to moderate shortcomings at the provincial level identified by
the concurrent Auditor). It remained that way until the Project closed. QALP-2 also noted delays in
some of the audit reports and unaudited IFRs, but these delays were rapidly addressed by the client.

44.    Procurement: (see also Annex 12): QALP-2 provided a rating of MU for implementation
by the Government on procurement issues, due mainly to an INT investigation that ultimately did
not result in any proven corruption (see Table 2). A Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) Plan


                                                10
was developed in early 2011, and progress on this has been good (also in Table 2). The MTR of
November 2011 found that overall performance for procurement implementation had improved.
Just before the MTR, the procurement rating in the ISRs was upgraded from MU to MS. An action
plan was anyway developed at the time of the MTR based on a recent review of procurement in the
health sector program. Performance regarding this plan has been satisfactory. In May 2012, an
external consultant conducted an Independent Procurement Review (IPR), and the Government then
produced an Action Plan in late 2012 to address its findings (agreed to by the Bank).

2.5   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.    A new project, the Provincial Public Health Insurance Development Project, PHIP,
Sumar (for US$400 million, P106735), was approved on April 28, 2011 to support similar goals
as APL-2. But aside from uninsured under-six children and pregnant women, it also includes
additional population groups: children and youth up to the age of 19, and women between the age
of 20 and 64, that are uninsured (9.4 million instead of 2 million people covered).

3.    Assessment of Outcomes

3.1   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.    The objectives, design and implementation of this flagship RBF Project were – and still
remain – highly relevant for the Argentine health sector, for the country as a whole and for
the many RBF initiatives in other countries. The national government and the provinces have
demonstrated continuous support and strong interest throughout APL-1 and APL-2. The design of
the operation included a highly innovative finance mechanism and linked the national level with the
provincial and provider level.

47.     This Project is considered one of the most important Projects in Argentina’s portfolio
in the Human Development sector in the past decade, and is mentioned as a key Project in the
2010-2012 Country Partnership Strategy. It started an RBF approach in the health sector that has
been followed now in many other countries, in Latin America and elsewhere. Design and
implementation aspects are highly relevant for other countries with RBF initiatives, which look to
the Argentina Plan Nacer experience to draw lessons. International RBF seminars often invariably
feature the experience of Plan Nacer, discussing design as well as implementation aspects.

48.   The Project is thus rated by this ICR as having High relevance of objectives, design and
implementation.

3.2   Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49.     After the implementation of the Action Plan formulated after the MTR (see above), the
program’s performance improved substantially, and ten of the eleven Project outcome
indicators were found to be achieved or almost achieved – with five targets being surpassed by
a large margin – at the Project close. This can be seen from Table 3. (See Annex 2 for details of
data sources and related calculations.) Note that “surpassed by large margin? indicates a final value
that exceeds the end target by more than 20%, while “almost achieved? indicates a final value that
is within 90% of the end target.

50.     An Index of Achievement – a simple measure of the extent to which final values exceed
or fall short of end targets, on average, for different groups of PDO Indicators – shows that
there was over-achievement for both PDO sub-objectives, but especially for Sub-Objective (b)
where the final values far exceeded the end targets for all indicators. 4 An Achievement Index
value more than 100 indicates that the extent to which final values have surpassed the end targets is
larger than the extent to which final values have fallen short of the end targets. Table 3 shows that
the Achievement Index of PDO Sub-Objective (a) slightly exceeded 100, while the Achievement
Index of PDO Sub-Objective (b) exceeded 100 by a very large margin.


4
  This Index is calculated by taking the simple average of the ratio of the achievement levels (final value divided by end
target) of each Indicator included in the calculation (and scaling to 100). For example, the Index value for Sub-
Objective (b) is the result of the following calculation: [(79/60) + (95/50) + (94/70)]/3 x 100.



                                                           12
51.    The final values far exceed the baseline values for all Project indicators – in most cases
there has been at least a doubling in indicator values – indicating substantial progress during
the Project period. For PDO Indicators 2 to 8 which are the most closely linked to final health
outcomes, the ratio of the final value to the baseline value ranges between 1.7 and 3.5 (see Table 3).

52.     Performance has also been good for the intermediate indicators. Out of ten intermediate
outcome indicators, nine have been fully achieved, and the targets have been surpassed for seven of
these (see Table 2 of Annex 2). The remaining indicator has been partially achieved.

53.     An indication of the substantial impact of the program on targeted health outcomes
can be seen from results of a recent rigorous Impact Evaluation (IE) of Plan Nacer. While this
evaluation is still continuing, preliminary results indicate, for example, that – controlling for other
factors and for selection bias – the number of infants with low birth weight (out of every 1,000 live
births) are reduced by 28% for beneficiaries of Plan Nacer, as compared with non-beneficiaries
who are eligible but not enrolled in the program. (See Annex 3 for more).

54.    A further indication of the program’s impact is the strong downward trends in child
and neonatal mortality in “Phase 1? and “Phase 2? provinces, and also in maternal mortality
(MM) in the areas where it was highest (“Phase 1? provinces). This can be seen from graphs in
Annex 3. MM has not shown a clear rising or falling trend in the “Phase 2? provinces. But it was
much lower to begin with in these provinces, which also had a lower percentage of all pregnant
women that were uninsured (30%) as compared to the “Phase 1? provinces (41%). So the program
lowered MM in the areas where the need was greatest.

55.      According to survey data, beneficiaries and health workers are highly satisfied with the
program. A survey of beneficiaries (see Annex 5) found their satisfaction level (based on an Index)
to be almost 7 on a scale of 10, with higher satisfaction levels among beneficiaries with higher
utilization levels under the program. Satisfaction was especially high (9.1) among mothers of
children benefitting from CHD treatment paid for by the program. A separate health facilities
survey found health workers to have a satisfaction level of 7 (on a scale of 10), when asked about
the program’s design regarding the use of funds at the facility level.

56.     Taken together, the above information indicates that the Project rating for efficacy
(achievement of objectives) should be Substantial. Although the final value was less than the end
target in some cases, the shortfall was small for all but one PDO Indicator, and the final values far
exceeded the baseline values for all PDO indicators. Even in the one indicator where the final value
was substantially less than the end target, the final value was 1.7 times the baseline value. The
extent to which the final values exceeded the end targets is larger than the extent to which the final
values fell short of the end targets, for both PDO Sub-Objectives – especially (b). Additional
justification for the Substantial rating comes from the information available on the Intermediate
Indicators, the IE results, and recent trends in child mortality, neonatal mortality and MM.

3.3   Efficiency

57.   Economic Efficiency: The Project’s internal (financial) rate of return was estimated at
between 8.2% and 8.5% if one takes into account only the benefits from averted neonatal deaths


                                                  13
(see Annex 3 for details). The other benefits not factored into the calculations include benefits from
averted deaths of older infants (after the neonatal period); higher productivity due to reduced
incidence of low birth weight; reduced maternal mortality (at least in the areas with higher maternal
mortality to begin with); and reduced morbidity among infants and mothers. If these additional
benefits had been included in the calculations, the internal rate of return would have been far higher.

58.     Institutional Efficiency: This ICR agrees with the following statement from QALP-2,
which indicates a high degree of institutional efficiency: “Within the general framework of a public
sector with considerable discretionary power, and associated vested interests, the Project constitutes
a serious attempt at introducing a system of performance indicators and associated resource
allocation mechanisms, while leaving intact the institutional structure, thereby introducing an
element of incentives for improved performance, which hitherto has been absent?.

59.     Minor shortcomings in design and implementation: As discussed in Section 2.1, QALP-2
rated the quality of the Project design as Satisfactory, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses
but the weaknesses turned out to be only minor shortcomings when assessed at Project close (see
explanations above). QALP-2 rated implementation in June 2010 as MS, and both QALP-2 as well
as the subsequent MTR in November 2011 found a range of implementation weaknesses (see Table
2). But as Table 2 shows, the Action Plan developed just after the MTR addressed these weaknesses
successfully, resulting in accelerated progress of the Project indicators. The result was an excellent
level of achievement of the PDO indicators at Project close (see Table 3). Hence, the
implementation weaknesses identified turned out to be only minor shortcomings.

60.     The Project is thus rated by this ICR as having Substantial efficiency, since: (i) the
internal rate of return is high even when taking into account just one category of benefits (those
from averted neonatal deaths); (ii) institutional efficiency was high; and (iii) shortcomings in design
and implementation were minor.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

61.    This ICR assigns a Satisfactory rating for the Overall Outcome for the Project, based
on relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency. The ratings given by this ICR for relevance,
achievement of PDOs (efficacy) and efficiency are High, Substantial and Substantial respectively
(as explained in the previous three sub-sections). Hence, the Overall Outcome rating is Satisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62.    Poverty Impacts: Those covered by Plan Nacer were from the uninsured population, and
consisted of vulnerable population subgroups, which – if not enrolled in the program – did not have
access to adequate basic health care. The strategy of starting with the poorest part of the country
under APL-1 – the poorer northern provinces – was appropriate.

63.     Gender Aspects and Social Development: The Project had a strong gender emphasis,
given its special focus on pregnant women, women post-partum (up to 45 days after birth or
miscarriage) and their young children. The last ISR refers to good implementation on IPPs (see
section 2.4 above), which is an important contributing factor to social development.

                                                  14
      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64.     It is clear that the reforms and changes brought about by the program are having a
lasting impact. It is hard to see how they can be easily reversed.

      (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative): None

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

65.     The risk to the Development Outcome is rated as Moderate, more due to challenges in
institutional sustainability than in financial sustainability. As mentioned in section 3.5 (b), the
program has led to institutional changes and reforms that cannot be easily reversed. Furthermore,
the program costs only about 1% of total provincial public health spending on average, and thus
financial sustainability does not appear to be an issue, even at the provincial level.

66.    The program (Plan Nacer and its successor Plan Sumar) is on its way to being fully
mainstreamed at the provincial level, and provincial ownership is growing but will take time
to be fully entrenched. There are clear indications of growing provincial ownership, such as a
reduction over time in the scope of the problem (noted in Table 2) of delayed provincial
Counterpart Funding contributions. At this time, all the provincial debt accumulated under Plan
Nacer has been paid – a big achievement in Argentina’s Federal system. Under Plan Sumar,
provinces have also begun to finance the salaries of some members of the provincial Project teams.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

67.     This ICR rates Bank performance on Quality at Entry as Satisfactory, in line with the
Satisfactory rating on this issue in the QALP-2. As QALP-2 noted, the Project designed a social
insurance system that increased access to health care services for an underserved low income and
vulnerable population group of uninsured children and pregnant women. The Project introduced a
system of incentives for improved performance in a difficult political context, with vested interests.
It was based on an innovative APL approach, which showed to be a well-functioning model for the
nine Phase 1 provinces. The Bank’s preparation team consisted of experts with long experience in
the field of health, and the Bank team worked in close collaboration with the Government in the
preparation process. QALP-2 gave a Satisfactory rating for the following, among others: relevance
and quality of the Project indicators; attention given to technical, financial and economic aspects;
quality of institutional framework; effectiveness of the Bank’s management of the preparation
process; and overall quality of design (see Annex 11). The shortcomings in design noted by the
QALP-2 turned out to be minor shortcomings when assessed at Project close (see Section 2.1).

68.    This ICR rates Bank performance on Quality of Supervision as Satisfactory (S), for
reasons which are now explained. The QALP-2 report of June 2010 rated overall Bank
supervision as MU. This rating was based on the following sub-ratings (see Annex 11): (a) S for
Focus on Development Effectiveness; (b) MU for Fiduciary, Safeguards and GAC aspects; (c) S for
Supervision Inputs and Processes; (d) MS for Candor and Realism of ISRs.


                                                 15
69.     Thus, the main problems identified by QALP-2 were with the sub-category of
Fiduciary, Safeguards and GAC aspects, but the Bank team addressed these aspects well.
Within this sub-category, Satisfactory ratings were given by QALP-2 for FM and procurement. But
performance was found to be MS for GAC aspects and MU for social aspects. On social aspects,
which relate in particular to poor implementation at the time of QALP-2 on issues relate to the IPPs,
implementation improved markedly towards the latter phase of the Project (see section 2.4). This
was facilitated by much closer supervision on the part of the Bank on social aspects, including on
the part of a Bank social safeguards expert. On GAC aspects, the Bank supported the Government
in the development in early 2011 of a solid GAC plan to address governance and corruption issues
in the health sector, and implementation of the plan has been good (see section 2.4).

70.    The candor of ISR ratings – which had been rated as MS in the QALP-2 – improved
substantially after QALP-2, and indeed some of the subsequent ratings were lower than those
in the QALP-2 (see Table 2 of Annex 11). In particular, at the time of the MTR of November 2011,
the PDO rating was downgraded to MU as compared to the MS rating given by QALP-2. (The ISR
PDO rating previously has been S). The end-of-Project rating in the ISRs for the PDO was MS.

71.     A competent task team is in place in the country and at headquarters with all relevant
skills, as noted in the QALP-2, and this helped the Bank to provide technical assistance
towards the production of an effective Action Plan to substantially improve Project
performance after the MTR. The TTL in place at the time of the QALP-2 (June 2010) had been in
place for two years, and remained until just before the Project close, indicating good continuity.

72.     The successful interactions on the Action Plan were made possible by the constant and
close engagement by the Bank team on the ground. Aside from the TTL, the core Bank team
consisted of committed and capable county-based staff. Discussions focused on key implementation
issues, and adaptations had to be made in response to often-changing circumstances on the ground.

73.    The extension of the Project closing date by one year (to December 2012) was a sound
move, allowing additional time to take the actions needed to improve the performance of the
Phase 2 provinces. This was agreed to by the Bank and Government teams.

74.    Since the ratings for Quality at Entry and Supervision are both Satisfactory, the overall
rating for Bank performance is Satisfactory.

5.2   Borrower Performance

75.     This ICR rates the performance of the Implementing Agencies (the National and
Provincial Ministries of Health) as Satisfactory for the following reasons: The overall quality
of the design process was rated as Satisfactory by QALP-2, and in this ICR. The reasons for this are
explained in detail in Section 2. Furthermore, this is certainly attributable in very large part to the
Government, since as mentioned in QALP-2: “There has been clear political will on the part of the
central and provincial authorities. The decision to widen the scope of the Project to cover a wider
set of provinces was in response to demand from the provinces to be included in the program.? In
fact, Government ownership of the design process was rated as Highly Satisfactory by QALP-2.




                                                  16
76.     Implementation progress was rated as MS by the QALP-2 report for the reasons
mentioned above in Section 2.2. Implementation problems led to poor progress in many of the
tracer indicators and the related PDO indicators, in particular in the “Phase 2? provinces, and this
led to a downgrading of the PDO rating to MU at the MTR of November 2011.

77.     However, during the MTR an in-depth diagnosis was undertaken of the reasons for the
poor implementation and indicator performance, and the Government subsequently
developed an in-depth Action Plan to address the issues raised. The Action Plan was
implemented intensively, and the Government was pro-active in expanding the size of the
provincial Project teams in several “Phase 2? provinces, to help address local complexities that had
not been anticipated in the design phase. Performance improved substantially since then, especially
in the lagging “Phase 2? provinces. As a result, tracer indicator performance improved substantially,
and so did the performance of the seven PDO indicators linked to the provincial tracer indicators.

78.     The Government team had strong skills and showed flexibility in making adaptations a
number of times as needed, responding to new information or circumstances. For example, in
2010 the package of services covered was expanded to also include CHD treatment and additional
complex maternal health services, due to an analysis showing the importance of these additional
services. In November 2009 and May 2011, cash transfer programs were started first for
disadvantaged children and then for disadvantaged mothers. In both cases, the transfers were made
conditional on the child/mother being enrolled in Plan Nacer, as well as fulfillment of certain
requirements regarding health checkups and immunizations. The Government team also adopted
diverse strategies to deal with the delays in enrolment in the larger Central Region provinces, such
as a contingency plan to improve performance in Buenos Aires province within 100 days.

79.     There were sometimes delays in provincial counterpart funding contributions (due to issues
such as inflexible provincial administrative procedures, cash flow constraints and financial planning
difficulties), leading to several provinces owing debt under Plan Nacer at the time of Project
closing. The national Government responded by making capitation payments under the follow-on
Plan Sumar program (in 2013) conditional on full repayment of Plan Nacer debt on the part of each
province. At this time, as a result, provincial debt under Plan Nacer has been paid in full, for all
provinces. Despite the challenges with IE, the Government and Bank teams showed a great degree
of adaptability, and solid results have now been obtained (see Annex 13). Finally, the agreement to
extend the Project closing date was key, allowing additional time needed for the Phase 2 provinces.

80.    All of this justifies an overall Satisfactory (S) rating for the Implementing Agencies for
implementation. The overall rating for the Implementing Agencies’ performance is thus S, in line
with an S rating for both the quality at entry (preparation) and implementation phases.

81.     Performance of the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance (MEPF), with which the
Loan Agreement was signed, is also rated as Satisfactory (S), and thus overall Borrower
performance is also rated S. The Project was implemented by the Ministries of Health, who
played the major role in its implementation. But MPEF played a suitable support role, allowing the
NMH to take the lead in putting in place an innovative, transformative and effective program that
was important for the country. MEPF’s strong support for Bank-financed health projects is in line
with its recognition of the health sector as key to the Bank’s portfolio in Argentina. Since the
performance by both the Government and Implementing Agencies is S, overall Borrower
performance should also be rated S.

6. Lessons Learned

82.     Differences in local institutional capabilities need to be analyzed and taken into
account: For Argentina, and other countries with a federal institutional framework, it is critical to
take diversity in terms of local institutional capacity into account and adjust the Project accordingly.
An in-depth analysis is required to identify differences in local capabilities and develop a strategy
on how to address the specific circumstances of different provinces or localities.

83.      RBF can work well even in a Federal system, but all major actors at different levels
need to receive performance payments, and the different sets of performance indicators at
different levels need to be aligned. Alignment of province-level performance indicators and health
facility-level performance indicators was key to overall performance of the program, and worked
well in most cases. The exception is with the larger Central region provinces where the
municipalities had direct oversight over the health facilities but did not receive performance
payments. This clearly slowed down progress in these provinces.

84.    Close engagement with actors at lower levels – including health providers – can make a
large difference to overall performance of an RBF program. This type of close engagement was
a key component of the successful Action Plan developed after the MTR. This Plan involved
frequent supervision visits by national Project team members to the provinces, regular regional
meetings and a commitment by provinces to work closely with larger health providers.

85.     A strong focus on information systems (including for reporting and billing) is key for
the success of a larger-scale RBF program. A major reason for the substantial improvement in
performance resulting from the Action Plan after the MTR was the Plan’s emphasis on
strengthening information systems.

86.      Institutional changes/strengthening takes time: Another reason for the better performance
of Phase 1 provinces could have been that they had more time to implement the Project. The time
frame for Phase 2 provinces was likely too short and better results could have been achieved if the
Project period was longer. If the Project time frame could not be changed, then it would have been
better to be less ambitious with the indicator targets. More broadly, provincial ownership and
institutional sustainability have been growing but will take time to be fully entrenched.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

87.     Through Plan Nacer, the Nation and the Provinces began to implement a policy of
prioritization, public insurance and explicit health coverage for the most vulnerable members of the
population. The program has achieved results along several different dimensions, many of which
are not reflected in the PDO or Intermediate Indicators. See a summary of the Government’s
contribution to this ICR, in Annex 7, for more details.

(b) Cofinanciers: Not Applicable.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders: Not Applicable.

                               Annex 2. Outputs by Component


   A. Evolution of Project PDO and Intermediate Outcome Indicators

1.      Table 1 shows the values of the PDO Indicators of the Project, over time. The table
reports the baseline values (column A), values at the time of the Midterm Review (column E), and
latest known values/estimates (columns F, G and H).

2.      For PDO Indicators 2 to 8 – which are linked to the provincial tracer indicators – two
sets of “final? values are reported, since the results from the final external concurrent audit
are not yet available for all provinces. For the tracer indicators, the procedure is that: (a) data are
first obtained, and values calculated, providing “pre-audit? values; and then (b) the external
concurrent audit is carried out, producing “post-audit? values for the tracer indicators. The audit
always leads to a “downward adjustment? of the results, since some observations are rejected (i.e.
the post-audit levels of achievement are lower than the pre-audit levels of achievement). The data
are considered finalized for the tracer indicators only after the post-audit values are obtained.

3.     At this time, the external concurrent audit for the Phase 2 provinces for the last
“cuatrimestre? (September-December 2012) is still ongoing, and its results will not be known
in time to be used for this ICR. The results from the external concurrent audit for the Phase 1
provinces for the same “cuatrimestre? are also not yet known, at present. The only period for which
post-audit values are available for all provinces at this time is the second “cuatrimestre? of 2012
(May-August 2012).

4.     Columns F and G report values for PDO Indicators 2 to 8 for the second “cuatrimestre?
of 2012 (May-August 2012) – the last “cuatrimestre? for which post-audit values for the tracer
indicators are available for all provinces. Column F reports these values for the Phase 1 and
Phase 2 provinces separately, while column G reports these values for all provinces as a whole.

5.      Column H reports estimates for PDO Indicators 2 to 8 for the last “cuatrimestre?
covered by the Project (September-December 2012), based on estimates of post-audit tracer
values (calculated using known pre-audit values). Before the results of the external concurrent
audit are known, post-audit values will not be available. But the pre-audit results are available for
all provinces. Estimates of the post-audit results were calculated for all provinces, using the
following procedure: (i) For each province, data on pre-audit and post-audit levels of achievement
in the first and second “cuatrimestre? of 2012 (January-April 2012 and May-August 2012) were
used, to obtain an estimate of the typical percentage “downward adjustment? applied as a result of
the audits (for each tracer indicator); and then: (ii) this estimated percentage “downward adjustment?
was applied to the known pre-audit levels of achievement for each tracer indicator for the last
“cuatrimestre? (for each province), to obtain estimates for the post-audit levels of achievement.
Finally: (iii) the estimated post-audit achievement levels for each tracer indicator for the last
“cuatrimestre? were used to compute estimates for the final values of PDO Indicators, as of
December 31, 2012. These are the values reported in column H.

6.   The values reported in the Datasheet in front of the ICR are from column (H).
However, the final values in column (H) are actually not so different from those of Column (G). It


                                                  21
was decided to use the values of column (H) because for PDO Indicators 2 to 8, these provide data
for the last “cuatrimestre? of the Project (even though they are based on estimates of post-audit data,
rather than actual post-audit data).

7.      Key findings from the results shown in Table 1 are:

•    Based on the latest known data (see columns F, G and H), seven out of eleven PDO indicators
     have been fully achieved or surpassed, while three more have been almost achieved (the latter is
     based on column H).
•    Out of the seven indicators that were fully achieved or surpassed, the targets have been
     surpassed by large margins for all except two indicators.
•    The Achievement Index for PDO Sub-Objectives (a) and (b) – see Note 4 below the Table for
     an explanation on this – shows that the extent to which the final values exceeded the end targets
     more than compensated for the extent to which final values fell short of the end targets. This
     was true for both PDO Sub-Objectives, but was especially true for Sub-Objective (b).
•    Towards the end of the Project (after the Midterm Review), performance increased substantially
     for the Phase 2 provinces in particular, that had been lagging.


8.      Note that the values reported in columns (E), (F), (G) and (H) are based on data coming in
from the program, i.e. based on services invoiced and paid for as part of the program. Services
rendered to the eligible populations that were not paid for under Plan Nacer are not included in the
figures. So, the figures under-report the reality, e.g. the percentage of eligible pregnant women that
had the first antenatal care visit before the 20th week of pregnancy (Indicator 2) is more than what is
reported in columns F, G and H since many eligible pregnant women did indeed have a first
antenatal care visit before the 20th week of pregnancy, but without this visit being recorded under
Plan Nacer records at the time.

9.      Thus, a large part of the improvements seen between the Column E values and the Column F
(or G or H) values come from a large increase in the number of women and children registered in
the program, and an increase in the number of services paid for and recorded under the program.
They do not all reflect an increase in the number of services rendered to the eligible population per
se (if one also counts the services that were not paid for and recorded under the program).

10.     However, the baseline values (column B) – taken from the Project Appraisal Document –
reflect all services given to the eligible population, not just services that were invoiced, paid for and
recorded under the program. (The program was not even operational at the time of appraisal in the
Phase 2 provinces).

Notes:
1. The baseline values are all national values, based on national data (except for Indicators 1, 9, 10 and 11 where the baseline values are only for the Phase 2
   provinces since the Phase 1 provinces were not included at the beginning). Since APL-2 was originally meant just for the 15 new Phase 2 provinces, it was
   planned that the baseline IE study would be used to obtain baseline values for the Phase 2 provinces only (as a group), and these would be used to replace the
   national baseline values reported in the PAD. But the baseline IE study was delayed substantially, and was ultimately conducted in 2008/09, well after the project
   started in late 2006. In addition, in mid-2010 the Phase 1 provinces were included in APL-2, in addition to the Phase 2 provinces. At that point, APL-2 became
   essentially a Project with national coverage. So, there was no longer a need for baseline values for the Phase 2 provinces only, and it is appropriate to use the
   original national-level baseline values as reported in the PAD.
2. See main text above for explanations regarding pre-audit values, post-audit values and estimations of post-audit values.
3. “Not Achieved? = final value lower than 90% of end target (e.g. lower than 45% if target is 50%). “Almost Achieved? = final value between 90% and 99% of
   end target (rounded to nearest % point). “Achieved? = final value between 100% and 104% of end target. “Surpassed? = final value between 105% and 119% of
   end target. “Surpassed by Large Margin? = final value 120% or more of end target.
4. The Overall Achievement Indices were calculated for PDO Sub-Objectives (a) and (b) by taking the simple average of the ratio of the achievement levels (final
   value / end target) for each PDO Indicator (and scaling to 100). For example, the Index value for Sub-Objective (b) is the result of the following calculation:
   [(100/60) + (95/50) + (94/70)]/3 x 100. The Overall Achievement Index would have a value of exactly 100 if the final values were exactly equal to the end targets
   for all indicators. A high Overall Achievement Index indicates that the extent to which final values have surpassed the end targets is larger than the extent to
   which final values have fallen short of the end targets.
5. The definition of PDO Indicator 9 (percentage of NMH-PHM annual performance agreements successfully implemented) was changed (made more stringent)
   towards the end of the Project. According to the previous definition, all annual performance agreements that had been signed and were being implemented were
   counted, regardless of the quality of the implementation (i.e. the word “successfully? had not been given sufficient weight). The level of achievement at the time
   of the Midterm Review was 100%, based on this previous definition. The final values reported for this indicator in the above table are based on the latest
   definition agreed to with the Bank which is more stringent. The latest definition is that one should only count performance agreements where: (i) the rate of
   enrolment of the eligible population is higher than the minimum target agreed to, and also: (ii) at least 70% of all projects in the Strategic Plan of Technical
   Assistance and Capacity Building (which is a part of the performance agreement) have been executed.

Indicators. Out of ten intermediate outcome indicators, nine have been fully achieved, and the
targets have been substantially surpassed in seven out of these nine indicators. In the next section,
achievement of individual indicators linked to each component of the Project is discussed.

      B. Discussion of Individual Components, Outputs and Achievements

12.    Component 1: Implementation of the Maternal-Child Health Insurance Program
(MCHIP)
(Original Bank allocation of US$242.7 million; final expenditure of US$249.7 million from
IBRD)

13.     Description: This component aimed to ensure the sustainable implementation and
functioning of the MCHIP. It provided support for: i) capitation payments for MCHIP services
by the National Ministry of Health (NMH) to participating provinces covering a share of the
costs of the basic service package, calculated on a per capita basis; ii) Equipment (medical,
transportation and communications) for basic health care facilities that supply the MCHIP
package; iii) Technical assistance and training programs for the provincial Ministries of Health
to develop systems, instruments, and skills necessary to implement and run the MCHIP; iv)
Health service delivery training for providers delivering basic services under the MCHIP; v)
Information technology equipment and consultant services to upgrade and expand information
systems for monitoring the implementation of the MCHIP; vi) Technical assistance and training
for the management of participating health service providers to strengthen areas including their
billing capacity, development and implementation of provider data systems.

14.      Achievement of Intermediate Results for this Component (see also Table 2):


                                                     27
      •   Capitation payment occurring according to approved enrollment lists and trazadora
          systems (Fully Achieved and Surpassed).
      •   PHSPT and NHSPT function effectively according to concurrent and financial audits
          (Fully Achieved and Surpassed).
      •   Number      of     authorized   providers   receiving    the     basic    medical
          equipment/vehicles/communications equipment according to the annual performance
          agreement (Fully Achieved and Surpassed).

15.    Component 2: Strengthening the National and Provincial Ministries of Health
Stewardship Capacity
(Original Bank allocation of US$10.2 million; final expenditure of US$16 million)

16.     Description: The aim of this component was to adapt the provincial Ministries of Health
to meet the implementation requirements (information, managerial) of the MCHIP. It includes
the essential and major structural change of separating the purchasing and provision of services
and setting up and training national and provincial health service “purchasing? team. This
component provided financial support for: i) reorganizing participating Provincial Ministries of
Health (PMHs) in both staffing and interrelationships, as necessary; ii) improving
epidemiological information, financial, and human resource management systems; iii)
completing studies essential for NMH policy formulation.

17.       Achievement of Intermediate Results for this Component (see also Table 2):
      •   Number of PHSPTs established and functioning, capable of preparing and negotiating
          NMH-PMH and PMH-authorized providers’ annual performance agreements (Fully
          Achieved and Surpassed).
      •   NHSPT is established and functioning, capable of preparing and negotiating PMH-NMH
          annual performance agreements (Fully Achieved).

18.    Component 3: Communications and Community Outreach
(Original Bank allocation of US$17 million; final expenditure of US$667,000)

19.    Description: The aim of this component was to ensure the effectiveness of the MCHIP
through providing the eligible population, particularly those who have historically been
marginalized, with enough knowledge about, and motivation to use, the services being offered.
The component was supposed to provide financial support for: Consultant services, incremental
ministry operating costs, event organization, and media communication services to support two
main lines of communication: i) Dissemination of detailed information about the program among
major stakeholder groups (provincial governments and their populations, the Federal Health
Council (COFESA), the medical profession and insurance agency managers and staff). ii)
Community outreach to increase participation of the eligible population.

20.       Achievement of Intermediate Results for this Component (see also Table 2):
      •   Regular information process among stakeholders on maternal-child health care issues in
          general and entitlements in the Plan Nacer in particular (Fully Achieved and Surpassed).




                                                 28
      •   Targeted groups increase, knowledge of their entitlements under the program and
          participation in Plan Nacer, and report satisfaction with process and results (Fully
          Achieved and Surpassed).


21.    Component 4: Program Monitoring, Evaluation and Concurrent Auditing Systems
(Original Bank allocation of US$14.6 million; final expenditure of US$16.8 million)

22.    Description: This component provided financial support for: i) Information technology
design services, software and equipment, and training for NMH and PHMs staff to upgrade the
monitoring of health provider performance in collecting and reporting information; ii) External
concurrent auditing of key elements underlying transfers of capitation payments; iii) In-depth
Project evaluation, including the completion of the baseline for impact indicators and Project
impact evaluations at mid-term and closing.

23.       Achievement of Intermediate Results for this Component (see also Table 2):
      •   Project implementation reports available as agreed, including financial reports supporting
          the capitation payments. Satisfactory reports from concurrent and annual financial auditor.
          (Fully Achieved and Surpassed).
      •   Project evaluation implemented: baseline at the end of PY2; mid-term impact evaluation
          at the end of PY3; and final impact evaluation at the end of last year of APL-1. (Partially
          Achieved – see Table 2 for more details).

24.    Component 5: Project Management and Administration
(Original Bank allocation of US$1.6 million; final expenditure of US$2.6 million)

25.     Description: This component provided financial support for operational expenses such as
travel costs for the provinces travel and per diem costs for coordination meetings, mainly for the
National Health Services Purchasing Team (NHSPT) activities.

Discussion of Achievement of Individual Components

26.     All intermediate outcome indicators were achieved, for all Components, except for two
indicators, for which achievement was partial. One of these indicators with only partial
achievement was for Component 3 (Communications and Community Outreach), which also had
a very low level of expenditure of just US$667,000 out of a total allocation of US$17 million.

27.     This component had some difficulties, as raised in the ISRs. The Communication
Strategy was ultimately only partially implemented, and disbursement of the component was just
4% at Project close. This component had a rating of MU at Project close. However, the
government stated that first, communication campaigns were absorbed by the Government
Communication Unit without the direct participation of the National Ministry of Health, and
second, the government wanted to avoid an increase in the demand for health services in urban
areas to an extend more than the health system could deliver. On the other hand, there was a
lack of demand side interventions to bring people to health facilities particularly in rural areas
were access was low.


                                                  29
28.     However, the goals of the component were still partially achieved, as shown by the
achievement levels of the two Intermediate Outcome Indicators for this component (one was
fully achieved and the other partially achieved). This was because many of the activities were
still carried out, financed from Government own sources. The Government also noted that
communication campaigns were absorbed by the Government Communication Unit, outside of
the National Ministry of Health.

29.    The partial achievement of one of the indicators for Component 4 (Program Monitoring,
Evaluation and Concurrent Auditing Systems) was due to challenges with the planned Impact
Evaluation for the program. See Annex 13 for a full discussion of this.

   A. Trends in Enrolment
1.     Enrolment in Plan Nacer has tended to rise rapidly from the time a province is
newly enrolled, and at this time close to 100% of eligible children are enrolled. But the
enrolment rate among women has been lagging to some extent (although it is still high).
Figures 1 through 4 show basic trends in enrolment of eligible women and children in Plan
Nacer, over time, separately for the Phase 1 and the Phase 2 provinces.

2.     These figures show that enrolment has initially moved sharply upwards for both Phase 1
and Phase 2 provinces, but has then plateaued or even fallen to some extent once it has hit the
60% to 70% range for women. However, for children enrolment rates have continued to move up
to 100% for both Phases 1 and Phase 2 provinces.

3.      The reason for the lower enrolment rates for women is that it has proved challenging, at
times, to attract early registration (enrolment) on the part of women. This would need to occur
via health centers, and yet it has proved harder to get health centers to participate actively in the
program, than hospitals. The reasons for this include higher capacity on the part of hospitals, as
well as better record-keeping and registration systems, and better ability to invoice properly.


                                                                                        32
Thus, often, a woman is registered in Plan Nacer only when she goes to a hospital for her birth.
Registration rates for children are high, on the other hand, because children get enrolled from the
time the mother goes to the hospital to give birth, and they generally remain enrolled afterwards
until they reach age six.

     B. Trends in Infant Mortality, Neonatal Mortality and Maternal Mortality

4.      Plan Nacer aimed to address basic health care needs of uninsured pregnant/lactating
women and young children. Thus it is illustrative to look at trends in infant, neonatal and
maternal mortality, with the important caveat that there are many factors that affect these
indicators aside from Plan Nacer and the characteristics of this program. Economic
circumstances (at the national and local level) affect these indicators, for example, and so
movements (or lack of movement) in these indicators cannot always be attributed to Plan Nacer.

5.      With that caveat, the trends in infant, neonatal and maternal mortality are now analyzed.

6.       The Figures (5 to 9) indicate the following:

7.      The infant mortality rate (IMR) and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) have been
falling in both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 provinces, but the fall has been faster in provinces
included in Plan Nacer. Figure 5 (for the IMR) and Figure 7 (for NMR) show the falling trends
in both groups of provinces. Figure 6 shows that the ratio of the IMR in the Phase 1 Provinces to
the IMR in the Phase 2 Provinces fell substantially between 2004 and 2007 – years in which the
Phase 1 provinces were in Plan Nacer (but not the Phase 2 provinces). The Phase 2 provinces
entered the program in 2007, and from then on the ratio of the two IMRs remained roughly
constant. In short:

     •   The IMRs of the Phase 1 Provinces and Phase 2 Provinces converged to each other when
         Plan Nacer was operational in Phase 1 provinces (from 2004 to 2007).
     •   Once the Phase 2 provinces were also included (from 2007 onwards), the ratio of the two
         IMRs remained roughly constant.

8.      Similar observations can be made for the NMR. As Figure 8 shows, the NMRs of the
two provinces converged from 2004 to 2007, when only Phase 1 provinces were included in the
program. Once the Phase 2 provinces were included from 2007 onwards, the divergence in the
two NMRs ceased. In fact, the NMR of the Phase 2 provinces actually fell faster than the NMR
of the Phase 1 provinces between 2009 and 2011. (This can be seen from the slight rise after
2009 in the line tracking the ratio of the two NMRs in Figure 8, after falling quite sharply for
several years.) The improved relative performance in the Phase 2 provinces regarding the NMR
may be due, in turn, to the faltering in the previously rising trend in the enrolment rate of eligible
women from 2009 onwards in the Phase 1 provinces (see Figure 3).

9.      Maternal mortality (MM) has shown a falling trend in the Phase 1 provinces, where
it is highest to begin with. However, there is no obvious trend – rising or falling – in the
Phase 2 provinces since they joined the program. This can be seen from Figure 9. While the
lack of a falling trend in the Phase 2 provinces is not ideal, these provinces do start out with a
relatively low maternal mortality rate already.

10.     A recent analysis of MM in Argentina shows that there are many factors affecting it
that need to be modified outside of a program like Plan Nacer, and by itself such a program
cannot lower MM rates below a certain point. This was one of the findings underlying the
recent Operational Plan for Reducing Maternal Mortality in Argentina, developed by the
National Ministry of Health in Argentina. To reduce MM below levels already seen in the Phase
2 provinces, additional steps are needed, including, among others: (a) redefining the roles of
hospitals, especially the ones that currently do not comply with all of the conditions for
providing adequate maternal care; (b) strengthening the referral network, and assigning
appropriate roles to health facilities in the network; and (c) providing additional technical
assistance to hospitals and provinces to that they can maximize use of (and invoicing of) the new
sub-package of additional complex maternal health services that were included in 2010 into the
“Nomenclador? of Plan Nacer (see main text of this document). Utilization of and invoicing for
these additional complex services, designed to address high-risk births, was not high in 2011 and
much of 2012, but is now picking up.


                                                 36
11.     The maternal mortality rate of the Phase 2 provinces should fall under the follow-on
program Plan Sumar, as the new sub-package of additional complex maternal health
services becomes entrenched, and as other steps are taken outside of Plan Sumar. Plan
Sumar is the follow-on program, of Plan Nacer. It will support similar services as Plan Nacer,
and will add additional population subgroups in addition to pregnant/lactating women and under-
six children. As the steps mentioned in the previous paragraph and others are undertaken, in line
with the Operational Plan for Reducing Maternal Mortality in Argentina, the chances of falls in
MM even below the levels seen in the Phase 2 provinces are good.

12.     Further analysis shows that there is a particularly close relationship between health
care coverage rates of pregnant women – either by formal health insurance or by Plan
Nacer – and the neonatal mortality rate (NMR). For this analysis, an indicator was created
called “Health Coverage Gap (HCG) Among Pregnant Women?. Values of this indicator were
calculated separately over time for the Phase 1 Provinces and for the Phase 2 Provinces. This
indicator is defined as the percentage of all pregnant women in the entire population (either
within the Phase 1 or the Phase 2 provinces) that are not covered by either formal health
insurance or by Plan Nacer (which is conceptualized as a public health insurance program).

                                                            Neonatal Mortality Rate




13.      The “HCG Among Pregnant Women? was lagged by one year and then plotted on the
same graph as the NMR, for the Phase 1 Provinces (see Figure 10). The same was done for the
Phase 2 Provinces (see Figure 11). The figures show that the neonatal mortality rate (NMR)
closely tracks the value of the HCG Among Pregnant Women in the preceding year. It makes
sense that a fall (or rise) in health care coverage among pregnant women would lead to a rise (or
fall) in the NMR in the following year, because: (i) in the case of Plan Nacer, as discussed above,
a low enrolment rate among pregnant women is usually due to low registration of newly pregnant
women during the earlier trimesters, rather than low registration of women at birth (when they
are easily registered); and: (ii) low registration during the earlier trimesters may have an impact
on NMR, but that would occur at the time of birth (or immediately afterwards), which would
often.

14.     Remarkably, the relationship between the two variables (HCG Among Pregnant Women
in the previous year and the NMR) remains close even when the HCG Among Pregnant Women
rose in 2010, for Phase 1 provinces. Furthermore, the “proportionality? of the relationship
between the two variables – i.e. the ratio of the change in one to the change in the other – is
roughly similar for the Phase 1 provinces as in the Phase 2 provinces.

15.    The spike upwards in the HCG Among Pregnant Women in the Phase 1 provinces in
2009 (the year preceding 2010) is attributable to the fall in the enrolment rate of women in Plan
Nacer in 2009 – see Figure 3. The HCG Among Pregnant Women rose by 8.4% – that is, by 84
for every 1,000 pregnant women – in 2009 (the year before 2010), and the NMR rose by 0.32


                                                                                        38
(per 1,000 live births) in 2010. This implies that for every X additional women enrolled in Plan
Nacer, the number of neonatal deaths saved will be X multiplied by the factor [0.23 / 84] = 0.27.
This value is used in the Benefit-Cost Analysis conducted below.

16.     This analysis is not as rigorous as one that controls statistically for other “confounding
factors? – exogenous factors that lead to changes in the Plan Nacer enrolment rate and at the
same time to changes in the NMR, resulting in spurious correlation between these two variables.
It is hard to see what these exogenous “confounding factors? could be, in this case. The
exogenous “confounding factors? would need to explain the fall in the Plan Nacer enrolment rate
in 2009, and at the same time the rise in the NMR in 2010.

17.      Nevertheless, the magnitude of the impact on neonatal deaths, of being enrolled in Plan
Nacer, as estimated using the above exercise, is remarkably similar to that found from the results
of Impact Evaluation (IE) activities under Plan Nacer. Great care was taken to correct
statistically for confounding factors in the IE analysis, which is discussed in the next section. The
similarity of the findings from the two different sets of analyses can be seen from the similar
estimates of the number of neonatal deaths averted, the Benefit-to-Cost ratio and the internal rate
of return from the two different exercises in Section D.

   C. Results of Impact Evaluation for Plan Nacer

18.    As detailed in Annex 13, while the Impact Evaluation (IE) activities under Plan Nacer
had their challenges, reliable results have so far been obtained from two IE exercises involving
analysis of administrative data: (A) an analysis of data from medical records at health centers
and hospitals (as well as from Plan Nacer records) at Tucuman and Misiones provinces covering
the years 2006 to 2009; and (B) an analysis of data from medical records at public maternity
wards (as well as from Plan Nacer records) at 13 provinces – the nine northern Phase 1
provinces as well as Cordoba, Entre Rios, La Rioja and Santa Fe.

19.    The data and results from (A) have been finalized and are fully available, while only
preliminary results are available at this time from (B). As discussed in Annex 13, results from
survey data are not yet available, although data from the follow-up IE survey of the Phase 2
provinces are now being cleaned and analyzed and also be available in the next few months.

20.     A summary of key results from (A) and some preliminary results from (B) are given
below. The analyses only looked at the eligible population, i.e. only pregnant/lactating women
and under-six children without formal health insurance. Among the eligible population, both
Plan Nacer beneficiaries as well as those that chose not to be enrolled in the program were
included in the analyses. In all cases, statistical techniques have been used to correct for possible
bias, such as selection bias.

21.      Table 1 presents the key results from these two IE exercises. All of the results shown are
statistically significant, and in most cases highly statistically significant (significant at the 1%
level). These results are very strong, and much stronger than what has been found in most
other similar IE exercises.

  Number of Babies Born with Low Birth Weight1 (per                Fall of 27.9%
  1,000 live births among eligible population)
      Notes:
   1. Very low birth weight means less than 1500 grams, while low birth weight means less than 2500 grams.
   2. The implied change due to Plan Nacer is the change that is estimated conditional on enrolment, e.g. the
      first row indicates that out of every 1000 live births, the number of babies born with low birth weight
      would be reduced by 26% if all of these mothers were enrolled in Plan Nacer (as compared to the number
      of babies born with low birth weight if none of the mothers were enrolled in Plan Nacer).



   D. Benefit Cost Analysis and Calculation of Internal Rate of Return

22.   As part of a Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA), the benefits from reduced neonatal
mortality as a result of Plan Nacer were estimated using two different methodologies:

   •    Methodology 1: Using the finding emerging from the graphical analysis of Section B
        above, that for every X additional women enrolled in Plan Nacer, the number of neonatal
        deaths saved was X multiplied by the factor [0.23 / 84].
   •    Methodology 2: Using the finding of the first IE exercise described in Section C above,
        that the number of neonatal deaths was reduced by 25% (in the eligible population) as a
        result of being a beneficiary of Plan Nacer.




                                                     40
23.     In the case of Methodology 2, it was necessary to estimate the number of neonatal deaths
occurring in the eligible population in the first place, since the available data do not give this
figure directly. This estimation was made by: (i) taking the number of neonatal deaths as a whole
in each province (per year) which is a known figure from administrative data records; and (ii)
multiplying this by the assumed ratio of the NMR of the eligible population to the NMR of the
population as a whole. The latter ratio was assumed to be the same in all provinces (in all years)
as the ratio found in the IE sample dataset drawn from Tucuman and Misiones provinces that
was used for the first IE exercise mentioned in Section C.

24.     The value of each neonatal life saved was estimated using the Human Capital Approach,
i.e. by calculating the discounted stream of estimated lifetime earnings. The latter was estimated
using the following assumptions and parameters: (a) per-capita GDP growth rate of 2% (which is
conservative compared to recent trends); (b) discount rate of 3%; (c) income will be earned every
year from age 18 to 62, at a level of 70% of the per-capita GDP level (given that these are
disadvantaged members of the population). With these assumptions, the value of each life saved
was calculated as US$246,964.

25.     This value was applied to the stream of benefits as calculated using each of the two
methodologies. Benefit-to-cost ratios (BCRs) and internal rates of return were computed
under the assumption that all benefits other than those from averted neonatal deaths are
zero. This assumption is clearly not correct, but was nevertheless made for the purposes of
obtaining a lower bound for the BCR and the internal rate of return. The cost figure used in the
calculations was the cost of the IBRD contribution of US$300 million, together with the cost of
the Provincial contributions to the capitation payments (US$39 million).

26.     The results are given in Table 3 below. Both methods show similar results, that the
Internal Rate of Return from the Project was either 8.2% or 8.5%. The BCR was calculated as
around 1.4 in both cases.

Methodology 1                  1.43                            8.5%
Methodology 2                  1.40                            8.2%


27.      In summary, the internal rate of return from the Project was calculated as either
8.2% or 8.5%, from considering the benefits from averted neonatal deaths alone, without
taking into account other benefits. The other benefits not factored into the calculations include
the benefits from averted deaths of infants (after the neonatal period); higher productivity due to
reduced incidence of low birth weight; reduced maternal mortality (at least in the areas with
higher maternal mortality to begin with); and reduced morbidity among infants and mothers,
among others. If these additional benefits had been included into the calculations, the internal
rate of return would have been much higher.

services as part of a household survey called the “Estudio de Monitoreo de la Satisfacción del
Usuario y de la Calidad de Atención del Plan Nacer? (Study of Monitoring of Satisfaction of
Users and of the Quality of Care Given Under Plan Nacer). The data were collected at the
household level, from households in all 24 provinces, in 3 phases, as follows:

2.     Data were collected from households with children aged between 1 and 2 years, since
these were considered to have the greatest potential in terms of using health services under Plan
Nacer. A strategy of stratification was applied, with 3 different strata as follows:




                                               45
   •   Stratum 1: Children with high utilization of services (children aged between 1 and 2 years, with
       more than 3 consultations invoiced and paid for in the previous year).
   •   Stratum 2: Children with low utilization of services (children aged between 1 and 2 years, with
       between 1 and 3 consultations invoiced and paid for in the previous year).
   •   Stratum 3: Children with no utilization of services (children aged between 1 and 2 years, with no
       consultations invoiced and paid for in the previous year).

3.      Interviews were conducted in users’ homes because, unlike in the case of exit surveys at
health facilities, one would not have contamination due to possible temporary effects produced
by an immediate feeling (positive or negative) generated by contact with the health system just
before the interview.

4.     At this time, results from the first and second phases are available. These are from both
Phase 1 and Phase 2 provinces, as can be seen from Table 1.

5.      A number of questions were asked at each interview – some focusing on services
received by mothers during the periods of pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum, and some
focusing on services received by children up to two years of age. The answers allowed the
formulation of an overall User Satisfaction Index, which is a conceptual and statistically
consistent measure that accounts for the various factors that affect the satisfaction of
beneficiaries with respect to public services provided under Plan Nacer. The methodology used
for the construction of this Index is based on statistical tools such as factor analysis and binary
logistic regression.

6.      As is expressed in the Table 2, the User Satisfaction Index level on the whole, regarding
use of Plan Nacer services, is 66 points (out of a possible 100) on average, reflecting a very high
level of satisfaction.

 Table 2. Index of User Satisfaction Regarding Plan Nacer Services, Average Global Value
                                                     Average Value – on Scale of 0 to 100
Index of User Satisfaction – Global Value (for all                   66.0
users)


7.      When the average value of the User Satisfaction Index is calculated separately for those
in large urban centers, versus those in smaller urban centers, the value of this Index is found to
be higher in larger urban areas (see Table 3).


                 Table 3. Index of User Satisfaction, by Size of Urban Area
                                                       Average Value – on Scale of 0 to 100
Index of User Satisfaction – Large Urban Centers                       67.8
Index of User Satisfaction – Smaller Urban Centers                     65.4




                                                  46
8.      The “degree of entrenchment? of Plan Nacer, for a particular health facility, can be
measured in different ways. One simple way is to look at the proportion of services that are
eligible under Plan Nacer, that are in fact invoiced and paid for by the program. If Plan Nacer is
working as intended, then a higher “degree of entrenchment? implies more financing under the
program, better motivated health workers, better provision of services, and so on.

9.      Table 4 presents the values of the User Satisfaction Index for different groups of users,
according to whether they use predominantly health facilities with a high, medium or low
“degree of entrenchment? of Plan Nacer. Clearly, there is a positive relationship between the
“degree of entrenchment? of Plan Nacer at a health facility and the degree of satisfaction of the
users of health services at that facility.


       Table 4. Index of User Satisfaction, by “Degree of Entrenchment? of Plan Nacer
                                                            Average Value – on Scale of 0 to
                                                                         100

10.     Table 5 presents the values of the User Satisfaction Index for different groups of users,
according to level of utilization. Clearly, there is a positive relationship between the User
Satisfaction Index and the level of utilization of Plan Nacer services, which is a sign of the
positive impact of Plan Nacer in terms of the satisfaction of users, particularly those that are
very familiar with the program (i.e. among those with a high degree of utilization of the services
under the program).

B.   Survey of Satisfaction Regarding Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) Treatment

11.     CHD treatment services were included in the benefits package during the period of
implementation of Plan Nacer. Over the period February to April 2013, a telephone survey was
conducted of households with beneficiaries of CHD treatment under Plan Nacer. Out of 1698
such households, it was ultimately possible to include 723 (with adequate information gathered)
in the survey.

12.     Similar to the case of the broader household survey mentioned above, in this case a
Satisfaction Index was constructed using a statistical model. The average value of this Index
among all households interviewed was 91.3 out of a scale of 10, which is an extremely high
value for such studies (see Table below).

Evaluation and Dissemination of Experiences in Implementing Public Health Policies to
Support Sustained Progress in Achieving Social Goals: the Final Evaluation of Plan Nacer

1.      Plan Nacer is the Federal program of the National Ministry of Health through which,
since late 2004, the Nation and the Provinces began to implement a policy of prioritization,
public insurance and explicit health coverage for the most vulnerable members of the population.
The program’s immediate objective was to contribute to the reduction of maternal and child
morbidity and mortality, in line with the Millennium Development Goals. In addition, the
program aimed to strengthen the public health sector in terms of implementing Provincial
Maternal-Child Health Insurance programs intended to provide health coverage to pregnant
women, lactating women and children under 6 years without explicit (formal) health coverage as
a mechanism to ensure, from an equity perspective, more and better access to health services of
adequate quality.

2.     Throughout its implementation, the strategy of generating Provincial Health Insurance
schemes, initiated by Plan Nacer, was characterized by a continuous process of evaluation and
dissemination of lessons learned. This enabled a critical analysis of the decisions implemented
and the establishment of a strong foundation to face the challenges ahead.

3.      This document is a part of the Final Evaluation of the implementation of Plan Nacer in
the provinces of Argentina. This year marks the completion of the second phase of Plan Nacer
(Phase 2). Phase 2 incorporated the provinces of the Cuyo, Centro and Patagonia regions,
starting in mid-2007. The provinces of Northeast and Northwest Argentina were a part of Phase
1 starting in 2004. Phase 2 of Plan Nacer consists of a geographical expansion of a public health
insurance program. This program aims to ensure a common set of prioritized health services,
intended initially for mothers and children. Consequently, it will be evaluated as part of a process
that seeks to promote universal coverage which is a key principle mentioned in the Constitution,
through Provincial Health Insurance schemes.

4.      This evaluation is intended to determine the degree of compliance with the objectives and
targets in the program’s original design and to identify key lessons facilitating the continuation
and expansion of the strategy of public health insurance, featuring a set of prioritized services, to
a broader population group and addressing more complex lines of care. In order to enable a
comprehensive assessment of the implementation of Plan Nacer, in terms of both intended and
unintended results at the time of the of design IBRD loan 7409-AR APL II, we propose the
following principles that will enable good use of this document in the pursuit of learning,
addressing gaps and building a strategic vision of the policy initiated through the program.

A. Proposed Principles for the Final Evaluation of Plan Nacer

5.      Prior to the Final Evaluation of Plan Nacer, it is necessary to establish a set of principles
that will be useful for this final evaluation – in particular, for better interpretation of the results
and conclusions of this exercise.




                                                  50
    •    Originally, Plan Nacer was expected to be rolled out in three phases, but then a decision
         was made to include in the program in 2007 all provinces that were not already included.
         This implied significant challenges on the part of the Nation (central government) in
         providing support to complex and diverse processes throughout the country.
    •    Phase 2 of Plan Nacer should not be evaluated only as a financing mechanism in
         isolation, but rather as a step in the process of rolling out the strategy of Provincial Health
         Insurance (SPS) schemes, in order to provide to the population full access to health care,
         in line with their rights as enshrined in the Constitution.

“It must be said that this is a priority today for the National Government. I am not referring here only to Plan Nacer
– which will continue with its original conception as planned, and which has proved to have very positive results –
but rather, I am talking about going beyond the original Plan Nacer and expanding its coverage.

                                                                                                  Dr. Juan Manzur
                                                                                            National Minister Health

    •    Phase 2 of Plan Nacer was designed and began, in terms of objectives and
         implementation mechanisms, at a time when Phase 1 had not completed implementation
         of all mechanisms that were important for the generation of health results. (In June 2007,
         for example, health providers under Phase 1 were able to use only 54% of the resources
         received).
    •    Phase 1 was implemented in provinces with high rates of maternal and child morbidity
         and mortality, with few differences between provinces in institutional complexity. By
         contrast, the provinces of Phase 2 have a wide range of diversity in key aspects such as
         the size of the eligible population, the number of health facilities, health indicators
         (before implementation), and the size of the additional resources (from Plan Nacer)
         relative to the local budget, among others.
    •    The more advanced level of institutional development of the provinces of Phase 2 and
         better health outcomes at the outset led to the formulation of Project indicators with
         ambitious goals given the time period of implementation, without fully taking into
         account possible significant barriers to effective implementation. (But, most of the
         challenging targets were achieved or were close to being achieved at the Project close.
         This reflects the strong commitment to fulfill the Development Objectives on the part of
         the Government team and the provinces.)
    •    The implementation strategy of the Provincial Health Insurance schemes (SPSs) in
         Argentina, in particular Phase 2 of Plan Nacer, is characterized by the simultaneous
         search of progress in explicit universal coverage in various areas: population, health
         services and financial protection. This simultaneity was possible thanks to the program’s
         Monitoring and Evaluation system, which provided relevant and timely information to
         support decisions made at each step.
    •    The ability to successfully implement Phase 2 of Plan Nacer was favored by the
         flexibility and adaptability of the design to local realities.
    •    No design can provide everything needed to ensure successful execution and be free of
         undesirable occurrences. Thus, in the first phase of implementation of the SPSs, more


                                                         51
       emphasis was given to overall performance, while in the later phases of implementation
       of the SPSs, emphasis will also be given to enhancing equitable outcomes.
   •   The SPSs come with a set of tools and a framework to help translate the “Nomenclador?
       (services package) into effective access to health:
          Alliances with others responsible for good health outcomes (Maternal and Child
           Health Units of Ministries of Health, Municipalities, Social Security Schemes,
           Health Zones, etc.)
          Training and communication to health teams and to the public.
          Search of consensus with health establishments, definition of explicit targets and
           ongoing discussion with them of performance.
          Package of services that focuses on priority health services, whose prices are
           determined according to an assessment and prioritization of services within each
           Province.
          Adequate use of funds received via the program, on the part of the health
           establishments.
          Medical audits
          Application of financial penalties to health establishments for failure to follow the
           rules of the program.

B. Implementation of the Different Axes of Universal Coverage: Results as Reflected in the
Project Development Objectives (PDO) Indicators, And Other Results Not Reflected in the
PDO Indicators

Results Reflected in the PDO Indicators

6.     In terms of insurance coverage under the program, 95% of the eligible population was
“nominalized? (identified with ID – i.e. Identification Number – and names recorded and entered
in a database, etc.) in the Phase 1 provinces, and 94% of the eligible population was
“nominalized? in the Phase 2 provinces, in December 2012. This result was very much helped in
the Phase 2 provinces by the Universal Child Allowance (Asignación Universal por Hijo) and
Universal Allowance for Pregnant Women (Asignación por Embarazo) policies.

7.      The program was able to identify a manageable number of performance indicators
(Tracers) that allowed the institutionalization of the agreements between different levels of
government, working towards improved health results via the use of a system of results-based
transfers.

8.       Among the tracers, one can distinguish between those measuring final health outcomes
(e.g. birth weight and APGAR score) versus those measuring the processes for generating results.
The former are measured at the time of birth, mainly in hospitals and maternity wards, and had
high levels of achievement even before the start of Plan Nacer, according to baseline data for the
Phase 1 and Phase 2 provinces. Other tracers like the percentage of pregnant women having
prenatal checkups early in the pregnancy, and the percentage of children having well-child
consultations, are measured (and administered) mainly at the level of the Centers of Primary
Attention (health centers). These had lower levels of achievement before the start of Plan Nacer.



                                               52
9.      Measuring health outcomes using reported data, to track tracer achievement levels, is
difficult because of deficiencies in reporting leading to an under-statement of the true levels of
achievement. The reported levels of achievement in most provinces are well below the
corresponding figures obtained from various statistically representative surveys (e.g. Surveys of
Living Conditions, baseline surveys, the National Nutrition and Health Survey).

10.    An analysis of the deficiencies in this capacity for reporting, done by the Plan Nacer
national Government team (the “Unidad Ejecutora Central? or UEC) and the provinces at the
time of the Mid-Term Review of the second phase of implementation of the program, identified
the possibility of substantially improving this reporting for many of the tracers.

11.    Plan Nacer, during its implementation, institutionalized formal agreements between the
Federal government and the provinces, and between provinces and health facilities – via Annual
Performance Agreements (Compromisos Anuales de Gestión) signed between the Federal
government and the provinces, and via Performance Agreements (Compromisos de Gestión)
signed between the SPSs and the health facilities. As of December 2012 all provinces had signed
Annual Performance Agreements and had succeeded in signing Performance Agreements with
more than 90% of their health facilities.

12.     The Mid-Term Review was a welcome opportunity to assess the determinants of the gaps
in reporting and in results that led to the then-reported levels of achievement (vis-à-vis the
targets). A set of actions was identified (Action Plan) relating to different aspects of the
implementation of Plan Nacer, aiming to have a substantial impact on performance in the short
term. A subset of these actions is presented in the following table.


    Table 1. Subset of Strategic Actions Implemented to Improve Performance in the PDO

                                                             order to maximize the chances of attaining the targets
•   Setting targets for these facilities                     agreed to for each facility.
•   Monitoring and close follow-up of performance of
    these health facilities

13.     The identification of these issues that were critical for the generation of results, and for
the planning and implementation of strategic actions, resulted in significant improvements in the
reported levels of the provincial performance indicators related to the Project PDO Indicators.

14.     However, it is necessary to make an observation about the periods used to evaluate the
results reflected by the Project PDO Indicators. Periodically measuring (e.g. monthly and 4-
monthly) progress in performance requires the measurement of a reference parameter that
permits a normative judgment regarding the result, i.e. it requires measurement of a parameter
that represents the potential outcome. The accurate measurement of this parameter requires the
development and implementation of a consistent methodology in the context of the information
available. In practice, whatever efforts one might make in terms of methodology, the available
information may place limits on what can be done.

15.    Under the framework of Plan Nacer, even with technically solid methodologies, the data
do not permit estimations with intra-annual variation, due to a lack of reliable information on
population and social phenomena leading to seasonality patterns. Moreover, the nature of the
required information would make it necessary to make projections of variables taking into
account a large number of socio-economic determinants where – even in cases where these can
be measured – there are important data limitations (e.g. in the case of the percentage of the
population without formal insurance coverage).

16.     These limitations become especially relevant in the context of targets for intra-year
periods (e.g. months or “cuatrimestres?), making it impossible to adequately distinguish between
variation in performance on the one hand and variation in seasonal phenomena (and
measurement errors) on the other hand. To illustrate this with a concrete example, the Phase 1
provinces have reported, on average, a performance level exceeding the target for the proportion


                                                              54
of live births (among eligible mothers) weighing more than 2,500 grams (Tracer III). But these
levels are significantly lower in the 3rd “cuatrimestre? (September-December) of each year, i.e.
there is a seasonality pattern.

17.     Below we describe the performance of the Project PDO Indicators as of December 2012.
Note that for the last “cuatrimestre? (September-December 2012), the results of the External
Concurrent Audit were not available for all provinces, and so the reported values incorporate
estimates of the post-audit values (based on pre-audit and post-audit performance data from the
first two “cuatrimestres? of 2012):

   •   Regarding the PDO indicators designed to monitor the sub-objective of establishing a
       “new incentive scheme for provinces and provincial providers" (PDO Indicators 9, 10
       and 11 of Table 3 of main text):

        Target of 60% substantially exceeded for “percentage of Annual Performance
         Agreements successfully implemented?. In 2012, 79% of the provinces achieved the
         agreed actions (relating to key dimensions of program management and
         implementation). The performance levels of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 provinces were
         89% and 73%, respectively.
        Target of 50% substantially exceeded for “percentage of authorized providers under
         Performance Agreements and provider payment mechanism with its respective
         participant province?. Performance for this indicator reached 97% for the Phase 1
         provinces and 94% for the Phase 2 provinces. It should be noted that all of the
         provinces succeeded in exceeding their provincial targets for this indicator, and the
         global achievement level was 95%.
        Target of 70% substantially exceeded for “percentage of Tracer targets achieved by
         the participant provinces in last year billing period?. Performance for this indicator
         reached 98% for the Phase 1 provinces and 91% for the Phase 2 provinces. The global
         achievement level was 94%.

   •   Regarding the PDO indicators designed to monitor the sub-objective of “improving
       critical intermediary outcomes?:

        Target of 85% exceeded for “proportion of newborns from enrolled pregnant women
         weighing more than 2,500 grams? (linked to Tracer Indicator III), with this indicator
         reaching 90% in the last “cuatrimestre? of 2012. The provinces incorporated in Phase
         2 reached 94% for this indicator, while the provinces of Phase 1 achieved a
         performance equivalent to 98% of the target (84%). It should be mentioned that since
         the 2nd “cuatrimestre? of 2010, the Phase 1 provinces have been able to report, on
         average, performance levels exceeding the targets, but with dips in performance in the
         3rd “cuatrimestre?. Furthermore, the last “cuatrimestre? of Plan Nacer coincided with
         a period of renegotiation of salaries and strikes in the health sector, adversely
         affecting reported levels of results.
        Target of 92% exceeded for “proportion of newborns, from eligible pregnant women,
         with Apgar score > “6? at minute 5? (linked to Tracer Indicator II), with this indicator
         reaching 93% in the last “cuatrimestre? of 2012. The provinces incorporated in Phase


                                              55
       2 reached 96% for this indicator, while the provinces of Phase 1 achieved a
       performance equivalent to 95% of the target (87%). Similar to the situation for the
       previous indicator, the Phase 1 provinces, on average, succeeded in attaining much
       higher levels of 94% and 93% for the first and second “cuatrimestre? (January-April
       and May-August) of 2012, respectively, exceeding the target in each of those cases,
       before seeing a dip in the third “cuatrimestre?.

•   Regarding the PDO indicators designed to monitor the sub-objective of “increasing
    access to basic health services of the target population?:

     Target of 80% exceeded substantially for “proportion of eligible population
      voluntarily enrolled in program? – at the level of the country as a whole (97%), as
      well as for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 provinces individually (99% and 96%
      respectively).
     For the “proportion of eligible pregnant women with first antenatal care visit before
      20th week of pregnancy? (linked to Tracer Indicator I), the achievement level at the
      national level in the last “cuatrimestre? of 2012 was 67%, or 96% of the target of
      70%. On average, the Phase 1 provinces attained an achievement level of 95% of the
      target (67%), while the Phase 2 provinces attained an achievement level of 96% of
      the target (68%).
     For the “proportion of eligible pregnant women who get VRDL during pregnancy and
      antitetanic vaccine previous to delivery? (linked to Tracer Indicator IV), the
      achievement level at the national level in the last “cuatrimestre? of 2012 was 93% of
      the target of 90%, reaching 83% in the last “cuatrimestre?. On average, the Phase 1
      provinces attained an achievement level of 92% of the target (82%), while the Phase
      2 provinces attained an achievement level of 93% of the target (84%). It is important
      to emphasize the value of this result, given the complexity of coordination in real
      time and in a “nominalized? manner, for this indicator. The reporting for this
      indicator requires the reporting of two linked sets of results where the verification
      needs to take place at the level of hospitals as well as Centers of Primary Attention
      (health centers).
     For the “proportion of eligible children less than 18 months old with coverage of
      measles vaccine or triple viral pregnant women with first antenatal care visit before
      20th week of pregnancy? (linked to Tracer Indicator VI), the achievement level at the
      national level in the last “cuatrimestre? of 2012 was 77%, or 80% of the target of
      95%. On average, the Phase 1 provinces attained an achievement level of 98% of the
      target (93%), while the Phase 2 provinces attained an achievement level of 67% on
      average, with 5 provinces reaching 100% for this indicator.
     The target of 60% was substantially exceeded for the “proportion of eligible puerperal
      women that received at least one Sexual and Reproductive Health Care consultation?
      (linked to Tracer Indicator VII), with the achievement level at the national level in the
      last “cuatrimestre? of 2012 reaching 90%. This target was exceeded substantially for
      the Phase 1 provinces (86%) as well as the Phase 2 provinces (92%).
     For the “proportion of eligible children 1 year old or less, with all well child
      consultations up to date (percentile of weight and height)? (linked to Tracer Indicator
      VIII), the achievement level at the national level in the last “cuatrimestre? of 2012



                                            56
             was 45%, or 91% of the target of 50%. Eight of nine Phase 1 provinces reached or
             exceeded the target for this indicator. The same was true for five Phase 2 provinces.

18.     In summary, the first group of indicators (for “new incentive scheme for provinces and
provincial providers?) substantially exceeded the targets set, for all indicators. In the case of the
second group of indicators (for “improving critical intermediary outcomes?), the targets were
exceeded for both indicators. Finally, for the third group (for “increasing access to basic health
services of the target population?), the targets were exceeded for three of the eight indicators,
while for the other indicators, the level achieved varied between 80% and 96% of the targets
originally set.


Results not Reflected in the PDO Indicators

Institutional

    •   The incorporation of the provinces of the Northeast and Northwest into IBRD Loan
        7409-AR (APL-2) provided timely financing to accompany and support the progress in
        the implementation of the Provincial Health Insurances in those provinces.
    •   The key elements of Plan Nacer – identification of the target population, prioritization of
        services for these populations, design of targets and consensual search for results among
        key actors, financing based on results and clear mechanisms for supervision as well as
        internal and external auditing – constituted critical tools for the provincial health systems
        seeking to move towards better and more equitable health outcomes.
    •   Plan Nacer has gained strong recognition that is based on the support provided by the
        health teams and provincial health ministries, which led to Plan Nacer being the only
        national program where participation is a requirement for the most relevant Social
        Policies of the National Government: the Universal Child Allowance (Asignación
        Universal por Hijo) and the Universal Allowance for Pregnant Women (Asignación por
        Embarazo).
    •   Plan Nacer participated jointly with ANSES (the National Social Security
        Administration) in the design of the Universal Allowance for Pregnant Women
        (Asignación por Embarazo) policy. This coordination, in planning as well as
        implementation of policy actions, represents an unprecedented step forward in the path of
        institutionalization of the lessons of the program.

 “With the Universal Child Allowance policy – which will necessitate enrolling in Plan Nacer and having all the
needed checkups on the part of mothers – we are making a very strong commitment to life and also to the objectives
of lowering infant mortality and lowering maternal mortality, and I am sure we will be able to succeed.?

    •   The ability of the national government and provincial governments to implement,
        gradually but steadily, a program of financing for results in a middle-income Federal
        country like Argentina, as well as the design of the program and the initial results from its
        impact evaluation, have gained strong international recognition.
    •   The characteristics of the design, implementation and execution of the program, as well
        as the results noted, were considered sufficient for the program to be recognized by IBRD
        over other projects, and to be awarded a "Good Practice Award".
    •   Advances in the process of establishing health insurance for the population were based on
        information obtained from unpublished studies, health service provider capacity, the costs
        of services, and utilization levels observed and desired for priority services – all making
        possible the formulation of agreements between the National and Provincial ministry
        teams, based on this evidence gathered.
    •   The program generated transfer mechanisms between the Federal government and the
        provinces with very low administrative burden, allowing a flow of resources almost in
        real time.

                  ISO Certification of the Processes of Nation-to-Province Transfers

Plan Nacer implemented, from July 2012 onwards, a System of Quality Management following international
standards. Thus allowed the process (termed "Transfer for Health Results Under the Sumar Program
Involving the Nation and the Provinces") to be certified under ISO 9001: 2008 by IRAM (Instituto Argentino
de Normalización y Certificación), with registration Number 4959 in January 2013. IRAM is an institution
recognized for its role in standardization and quality certification, locally and internationally.

    •   Resource transfers from the Provincial Health Insurances to health facilities initially did
        not have a predetermined circuit, generating large administrative burdens and delays in
        payments, which was detrimental to the notion of an incentive scheme as envisaged under
        the program. This led to the need for the program to ensure the existence of specific,
        formal and transparent payment circuits, involving extra-budgetary transfers from the
        accounts of the Provincial Health Insurances to health facilities, which for the first time
        started to receive and administer funds in an autonomous manner.

 •   The national government and the provinces co-financed the capitation payment paid to
     the Provincial Health Insurances to cover all services in the benefits package of the
     program. The Nation contributed 70% of the capitation value and the Provincial
     Governments the remaining 30%. This integrated funding mechanism is unprecedented in
     the public health sector of the country.
 •   The ability by the health facilities to decide on the use of the funds received led to
     changes in the levels of satisfaction on the part of the health workers, independently of
     whether or not the funds could be used for monetary incentives to individuals.

Study on the Financing and Use of Resources by Health Facilities in the Provinces of Northern
                                        Argentina

Given the diversity of institutional settings and the different relationships established by different province
with their health facilities, a study was carried out to:

• Assess the model implemented for the process of decisionmaking regarding the use of funds, applied in
  different provinces.
• Investigate the extent to which the policy regarding the use of funds has had an impact on the motivation of
  health workers.
• Identify deficiencies in monitoring of the use of funds in each province and allow for more effective
  supervision.

Main Results

The level of satisfaction with the model implemented for the process of decisionmaking regarding the use of
funds under Plan Nacer was given a score of nearly 7 out of 10 according to the managers of the health
facilities. Among the health workers, the satisfaction level was 7.2 out of 10.

Identification of Principal Determinants

• Among the reasons mentioned for the above, 8 out of 10 health workers highlighted the direct benefits to
  the population that are generated by the program.
• Since the implementation of Plan Nacer started, health personnel at the facilities covered mention the
  enhanced value placed on teamwork and the increased possibilities of professional and personal fulfillment,
  as a result of the program.
• The application of the model for the use of funds designed under Plan Nacer was found to improve the
  organization of work:

       “Plan Nacer encourages one to be more organized since there is more supervision, and it is
       a task that we all do together.? (Testimony from a health team at a Primary Attention Center
       – i.e. health center – in Chacos Province.)

• Optimizes professional practice due to the availability of more supplies and equipment, an increase in the
  coverage of the target population and an improvement of the physical working environment.
• Approximately 65% of Directors/Heads of the health establishments noted that funds received under Plan
  Nacer were distributed across the institution – contributing to supplies, instruments and medical equipment
  to enhance care for the entire population.



 •   The flexibility of the program’s design to be able to allow for provincial realities
     provided a lot of latitude in the determination of coordination mechanisms between the


                                                      59
        responsible parties at the ministerial levels and the health facilities, in the search for
        enhanced results. UEC provided technical assistance to the provinces, and put at their
        disposition the “Plan of Use of Funds? tool.
    •   In its design, the program gives the provinces the power to set the prices (fees) for the
        services in the package of services (the “Nomenclador?). This characterizes the design of
        the program as one that strengthens the Federal nature of the Argentine government, and
        provides flexibility in dealing with the heterogeneity of health conditions among
        provinces. However, the use of prices for services in the public sector is a tool never
        before used. Thus, the technical unit of UEC conceptualized and proposed to the
        provinces an assessment tool to value the services in the “Nomenclador?. The tool
        assisted the provinces to assess the contribution of each service to the national and
        provincial health objectives. On their part, the valuation of the services allowed the
        provinces to incorporate in their reasoning aspects related to resources needed for service
        provision, and the related budgetary constraints, allowing the formulation of a consistent
        set of prices (fees) for the services in the “Nomenclador?.
    •   The mechanisms for contracting health facilities in other provinces were refined.
        Framework Agreements between provinces were promoted, and later a contracted
        Provincial Health Insurance was allowed to pay a different set of prices for health
        facilities outside of its own province. An example of this is an Agreement signed between
        Salta and Jujuy Provinces, promoted by UEC.

Monitoring and Evaluation

“Plan Nacer is characterized by implementation of a system of records, audits and evaluation, which ensure
accountability and the establishment of clearly defined responsibilities. It also promotes and guarantees the use of
funds in line with agreements made under a scheme where results achieved are documentated. Unlike other plans, it
aims at improving the management of health system resources and promotes transparency in the provision of health
care."

    •   The program, from the information generated as well as the analysis of that information
        and the dissemination of the results of this analysis, has allowed the implementation of
        mechanisms to implement public policies based on evidence (evidence-based decisions).
    •   The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) component of the program included the
        completion of an impact evaluation (IE), both for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Project. The
        IE strategy for Phase I included the use of quasi-experimental methods with the provinces
        of La Rioja, Córdoba, Santa Fe and Entre Rios as control provinces. This initial strategy

           had to be abandoned as Plan Nacer was expanded throughout the country ahead of
           schedule.
    •      The joint work of the Plan Nacer (Government) and World Bank technical teams allowed
           the exploration and identification of possible new IE strategies: experimental methods
           focusing on exogenous interventions at the health facility level, exploitation of the
           administrative databases of the Provincial Health Insurance schemes, exploitation of the
           data from clinical birth records from 2004 to 2008 for Phase 1 provinces, and other quasi-
           experimental methods using instrumental variables, among others.
                     Impact Evaluation Using Perinatal Data: Provinces of Northeast and Northwest

        The exercise conducted to put together the data for this IE was done using perinatal data from public maternity
        wards, through an operation that involved teams visiting health facilities, and digitalizing the perinatal data, at
        thirteen provinces (Catamarca, Chaco, Córdoba, Corrientes, Entre Rios, Formosa, Jujuy, La Rioja, Misiones,
        Salta, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero and Tucumán). Between November 2010 and November 2011, on-site
        digitalization took place for 467,281 birth records at 287 health facilities. More than 170 consultants
        participated in this operation.

        A team of specialists led by Professor Paul Gertler (of UC Berkeley) is working on the databases to identify
        program impacts in terms of the variable available in the database. While research is ongoing, preliminary
        results show significant impacts of the program on relevant health variables (see Annex 4, especially Table 1).

    •      IE should not be seen as the most important source of information for the design of new
           operations, but rather as a means of providing ex-post empirical validation of some
           dimensions of the existing operation.
    •      The program already has established IE results in terms of the impact on service
           utilization levels and the health status among the eligible population in Misiones and
           Tucuman provinces. This IE exercise used data from provincial information systems in
           order to identify the impact on (among others) utilization levels of health services
           prioritized by the program, the quality of prenatal care and of well child care, children's
           health status at birth and decreases in neonatal mortality (see Annex 3 for some results).
    •      Recognition of the limitations of quantitative assessment tools in monitoring results along
           all dimensions of interest promoted the search for other assessment strategies such as
           qualitative ones. This included, for example, a study of the use of funds (received under
           the program) by health facilities finance in the northern provinces.
    •      A distinctive aspect of the program is its measurement of the levels of satisfaction of
           users of prioritized health services. This is a necessary first step in the incorporation of
           civil society in the process of prioritizing public policy actions.

Among the major challenges facing Plan Nacer is enhancing transparency vis-à-vis beneficiaries – making them
take on a central protagonist-type role in the program. Because, after all, Plan Nacer is not just a payment
mechanism for provincial health facilities, but also a mechanism to empower people. So that they know their rights,
and have (and act on) expectations regarding service delivery. I think this challenge is very important and the Plan
has all the elements needed to address it."

Study of Satisfaction of Users of Plan Nacer (2012)

In 2012, a study was conducted to measure user satisfaction, with a methodology that determined the level of overall
user satisfaction with the basic services package under Plan Nacer to be 66 out of a maximum score of 100.
Additionally, there was evidence that the level of satisfaction is higher when the level of utilization of services is
higher (63.9, 64.1 and 68.9 for users with very low use, low use and high use, respectively). Also, the higher the
level of integration (insertion) of Plan Nacer in a health facility, the higher was the level of user satisfaction
(measured at 61.4, 65.8 and 67.3 respectively for health facilities with a low, medium and high level of integration,
respectively).

In turn, there is also evidence that levels of user satisfaction are sensitive to the level of complexity of services.
Among users of the congenital heart disease services that were a part of the Plan Nacer benefits package, the level of
user satisfaction was 91.3 out of 100.

The methodology applied provided evidence that Plan Nacer achieved higher levels of satisfaction among users, as
compared to the situation without the program. This can be seen from the positive relationship between satisfaction
levels and the level of integration of Plan Nacer in health facilities, and also from the positive relationship between
satisfaction levels and service utilization levels (higher levels of the latter indicating greater knowledge of the
services and their quality).



    •    The External Concurrent Audit was an important management tool that facilitated, among
         other things:

          Better monitoring of the processes and results on the ground
          Warnings regarding key errors and limitations
          Possibility of guiding behavior towards what was desired via effective monetary

          Greater transparency in the process of using the financial resources of the program

Expansion of Program Coverage

Among the virtues and the challenges of the Plan is its continuity. Plan Nacer has had more continuity than many
public policies in Argentina. The challenge in order to achieve positive results lies in the continuity of its
implementation."

    •    As occurred in Phase 1, and also for the provinces within Phase 2, Plan Nacer was a
         program that allowed people without health insurance coverage by the “Obras Sociales?
         (Social Security schemes) in these provinces to be – for the first time – “nominalized?

       within the health system. Furthermore, the program provides an explicit list of services
       for those without formal health insurance coverage.
   •   A mechanism was developed that allowed the incorporation into the benefits package of
       new health services with a substantial impact on hard-to-reduce factors affecting infant
       and maternal mortality, such as treatment for children with congenital heart disease and
       maternal/neonatal services of high complexity, among others.
   •   The incorporation into the Health Services Plan (benefits package) of cost-effective
       services allowed one to make explicit the rights to health contained in the newest
       regulations. This advance in the area of health coverage was facilitated by resource
       availability which also facilitated an acceleration in its implementation.
   •   The introduction of congenital heart diseases services for children in the benefits package
       constitutes a successful and model experience for the Argentinian health sector. It marks
       the first time that catastrophic care interventions have been included in a public health
       insurance scheme in the country, and also marks the first Federal network of health
       facilities providing specialized complex care in the country, and consisting of facilities
       whose quality has been rigorously pre-certified.
   •   The incorporation of more complex services into the benefits package required the
       definition and implementation of strategies for strengthening and improving existing
       health networks at the provincial and national level.
   •   The need to strengthen and improve existing health networks required the formulation of
       appropriate coordination structures – both provincial and interprovincial. These structures
       were institutionalized by creating administrative circuits that combine the necessity of
       providing timely responses with the ability to document the whole process.
   •   The inclusion of the more complex services led to a significant increase in financial
       protection offered by the program, prompting some provinces to show greater interest in
       participating more effectively in the implementation of the strategy.
   •   The exercise of prioritization of the services under Plan Nacer took place in a context of
       limited resources and, for this reason, aimed to address fewer “lines of care? but in a
       comprehensive manner in order to increase the chances of organizational changes and
       improvements in performance.
   •   The program has made available to the Ministry and to the Provinces information on
       costs and coverage gaps for services that form part of a “line of care? under Plan Nacer.

Training

   •   Plan Nacer, through efforts on the ground, has identified provincial counterparts for
       indigenous health issues and for work from an intercultural perspective, advancing
       significantly from 2009 in terms of participation by indigenous people. Indigenous
       Peoples’ Plans have been agreed on and validated locally. In cases where participation
       was achieved not only in planning but also in the implementation of these activities,
       empowerment was enhanced among this population.




                                               63
    •   The Strategic Plan for Technical Assistance and Training has been recognized by the
        provinces as a management tool suitable for generating proposals for training and
        technical assistance tailored to their particularities. It is also valued because it adapts to
        the dynamics and heterogeneity of each province, allowing the contracting of additional
        personnel.
    •   There has been a deepening in the training of personnel, shifting to a greater focus on
        processes, with the generation and dissemination of tools such as the Distance Learning
        Program (e-learning). This was aimed at promoting the growth of skills that enable better
        implementation of the program and the achievement of better health outcomes.

From 2011 onwards, Plan Nacer incorporated a new modality of training, e-learning, through the development of
the National Distance Learning Program. The objective of this Program is to allow more people to be incorporated
in the health system, and to gain knowledge regarding the management of Plan Nacer and of public health.

The National Distance Learning Program is linked with other programs of the Ministry of Health: the National
Programmes for Control of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Comprehensive Adolescent Health, Oral Health,
Tobacco Control, Hearing, Maternal and Child Health, and Sexual and Reproductive Health. A special platform,
with assistance in its utilization, was put in place to facilitate with these linkages.
This program represents one of the options to address the need for continuous education on a large scale,
promoting equity and inclusion through access to education.

The program is free, and exponentially expands the access of people to training and retraining regarding the health
system, allowing users to choose their own time schedules vis-à-vis their learning, and to access the platform from
any location with an Internet connection. The program supports learning and allows new concepts to be added,
while strengthening existing knowledge and skills.

         Annex 10. Background Information: The Health System in Argentina


1.     Argentina is a federal country with 23 provinces and the city of Buenos Aires. While the
National Ministry of Health is mainly responsible for general health policies and regulation, the
23 provinces and the city of Buenos Aires are responsible for the provision of health care. The
Argentine health sector can be divided into three sub-sectors: public, social security and private.
The combination of Federalism and sectoral fragmentation make it a complex system.

2.      Formal insurance typically covers only public employees, not the large population that
does not belong to an Obra Social 5or have private insurance or the financial ability to pay the
full cost of care. The publicly-funded services in each province operated in the traditional Latin
American manner, with investment and recurrent costs paid out of fixed budgets. Public
providers often did not bill for services and had little or no autonomy in the use of the resources
transferred to them from the provincial Ministries of Health. These budgets were often
insufficient to provide all the care needed by the uninsured population, and the rigid budgeting
process meant that the necessary inputs were not necessarily available in the right proportions
and substitution among them was difficult or impossible. These features continue to characterize
most of the Argentine health system and required some flexibility in the use of resources from
the introduction of a new insurance scheme. Since the provinces differ greatly in per capita
income, disease burden, insurance coverage and public funding capacity, care for the uninsured
was not only inadequate on average but varied inequitably from province to province. In 2001,
for example, the highest provincial infant mortality rate was more than twice as high as the
lowest, and the variation in maternal mortality was much greater, more than 10 to 1.

3.     The new program Plan Nacer intended to increase access to health care, reduce
inequalities and speed the recovery in health following the recession especially for the most
vulnerable part of the uninsured population, pregnant women, newborns and young children.

4.     For women, the coverage is from the start of pregnancy (or at the time the pregnancy is
confirmed) until 45 days after birth or the loss of the fetus if that occurs—a maximum, that is, of
10-1/2 months. Each new pregnancy starts a new interval of coverage; even health problems that
are caused by having been pregnant, such as complications from cesarean surgery, are not
covered if they occur after 45 days. Women needing the corresponding services for such
problems are referred to the province's reproductive health program. For children, in contrast,
coverage lasts up to age six, with a concentration on interventions during the first year of life.

 Obras Sociales are national or provincial social health insurance organizations which administer funds
contributed by employers and employees and provide health care to their members and their direct
families. The obras sociales are organized by occupation or trade Penchaszadeh V. et al, Italian Journal of
Public Health, Vol. 7. Nr 4, 2010)

Basic Design of Plan Nacer

5.     Plan Nacer is an innovate approach and includes several features: an investment in
improved capacity to deliver services; a formal insurance scheme for people who have no access
to employment-based coverage and cannot afford private insurance; a pair of legally binding
agreements, one between levels of government and one between a provincial government and
providers; a scheme of voluntary affiliation by providers; and a system of record- keeping,
auditing and evaluation to ensure accountability and that funds are used as intended and results
documented.

6.       The program includes two results-based incentive mechanisms for the inclusion of the
target population and the improvement in the quality of services. The first incentive is in terms of
eligible population and rewards provinces when eligible beneficiaries get enrolled since they
receive a capitation payment for each pregnant woman and child who joins the program. The
second incentive is linked to the providers who deliver services, since they bill and are paid for
these services (fee for service) that are covered by Plan Nacer. The services that are included,
the benefit package, is known as the “Nomenclador?, and is the same in every province. The
“Nomenclador? contains over eighty services. Table 1 summarizes the services in the
“Nomenclador? in the first few years of the Project. (In 2010, as mentioned in the main text of
this report, two new sub-packages of services were included: Congenital Health Disease
treatment services, and additional complex maternal health services to better address high-risk
births).

7.      Ten indicators (tracers, trazadoras) are defined to measure the program output and health
outcomes, and are used by the National Ministry of Health to determine the financing to the
provinces (see Table 2). Targets for each tracer are negotiated annually with each province. This
is an essential feature for the program because it allows a province with a weaker health system
to aim for a lower target than better-off provinces. In terms of achieving each tracer the program
used initially an “all-or-nothing? approach. However, this approach was then changed to a
threshold approach with minimum, medium and maximum level. Depending on which target was
achieved, a certain percentage was paid. The full 4 percent are only being paid for reaching a
higher target while 1 to 3 percent is being paid for lower targets. Therefore, the provinces have a
strong incentive to achieve each target for a given tracer (but no marginal incentive to exceed it).
This scheme aims to motivate providers to increase their efforts to deliver better care even after a
target was met.

Finance Mechanism

8.      The Ministry of Health transfers the funds on a per-capita basis to the provincial
ministries in two steps: 60 percent of the financing is provided only upon verification of
enrollment and 40 percent after accomplishment of the tracers. Since provinces differ in their
capacity and resources to deliver the services listed in the plan, the target levels for the ten
tracers are negotiated between the national and provincial government and differ between the
provinces of Phase I and Phase II.

9.      The funds flow from the provinces to the contracted healthcare providers (public or
private), who can use up to half of the funds to pay incentives to staff to improve productivity
and quality of services. The program’s incentive scheme is based on two major relationships: the
relationship between the national and provincial governments, and the relationship between the
provincial government and healthcare service providers. The national government periodically
provides capitation transfers to the provincial governments. The capitation-transfer is based on
the established per capita payment multiplied by the number of beneficiaries registered in the
databases that the province maintains. Sixty percent of the total amount is transferred monthly
based on enrollment statistics, and forty percent is added to the capitation-transfer once output of
outcome results (accomplishment of the ten health indicator targets or tracers) is presented. The
second relevant relationship is between the province and each of the health facilities. Provinces


                                                71
pay health care providers for services rendered to the target population. Prices of services in the
“Nomenclador? can be reviewed twice a year. The combination of a fixed capitation payment
for enrollment that goes to the provinces, and the Fee For Service (FFS) payments to providers,
which vary according to the type and the amount of care delivered, presents a financing scheme
that aims to avoid the negative effects that the capitation or FFS payment alone might cause.
Table 1 demonstrates financing flow as described above.



      Figure 2: Relationship between National Government, Provinces and Providers




Supervision and Audits

10.     In addition to the financial incentives, management and auditing mechanisms have been
instituted to monitor the program’s progress. Legally binding management agreements signed
between the National Ministry of Health and the provincial government, and between the
provincial government and healthcare providers outline their respective roles and responsibilities
and hold parties accountable. Annual Performance Agreements between the National Ministry
of Health and provincial governments are especially important to ensure compliance to specific
targets on enrollment and tracers. Internal audits verify the work performed, while independent
auditors complete the process through regular (every four months) detailed reports to the
National Ministry of Health, monitoring the progress of the program. The feedback from the
audits and management reports is used to correct any mismanagement, break bottlenecks, and
improve the program’s functioning. The result is an innovative management model for a results-
based financing program with an effective control and monitoring system that aims to deliver
substantially better results in the health sector.

1.1 Strategic Relevance and Approach                                                                 S
Comment: The Government of Argentina set in motion an innovative Maternal-Child Health
Insurance Program in 2003, known as Plan Nacer, to improve child and maternal health care.
Plan Nacer was supported by the first phase (APL-1) of an adaptable loan and is a provincial
social insurance program providing a free basic package of cost-effective services to uninsured
pregnant women until 45 days after delivery and children under six in the country’s nine poorest
provinces. The program was expanded to the remaining 15 provinces in 2006 with a loan of
US$ 300 million and Government financing of about US$346 million. The expansion merged the
two subsequent phases of the adaptable loan into one (APL-2). Outwardly there was a consensus
to combine the two phases but provinces exerted pressure to be included in an apparently
successful program that used performance incentives. APL-1 and APL-2 have introduced
performance payments and a resource allocation system by changing institutional relationships but
without altering the existing institutional setup. The Program uses an incentive mechanism and
redefines the roles and relationships between the national Ministry of Health and the Provincial
Governments, and between the Provincial Government and the healthcare providers to enhance
quality and accountability in health service provision. The Bank sought a multiplier effect of its
financial support as its contribution averaged only US$4 million annually per province.
1.1.1. Adequacy of enabling environment?                                                             S
Comment: Within the general framework of a public sector with considerable discretionary
power, and associated vested interests, the Project constitutes a serious attempt at introducing a
system of performance indicators and associated resource allocation mechanisms, while leaving
intact the institutional structure, thereby introducing an element of incentives for improved
performance, which hitherto has been absent. This approach enables the maternal/child health
investment to take place in a more disciplined way that had been possible so far, and operate
within the policy and institutional constraints prevailing in the country.
1.1.2 Strategic Relevance and appropriateness of DOs?                                                S
Comment: The Project designed a social insurance system that increased access to health care
services for an underserved low income and vulnerable population group of uninsured children
and pregnant women with unacceptable high morbidity and mortality rates.
1.1.3 Quality of the results framework to achieve the DOs?                                           S
Comment: The results framework consisted of ten measurable tracer conditions and a set of
component-specific intermediary outcomes. The ten tracer interventions were the same for all
participating provinces and served to measure provincial and national progress towards achieving
the DOs. The tracer conditions and the intermediary outcomes focus on process interventions that
address the main causes of under-five and maternal mortality.
1.1.4 Quality of arrangements for monitoring and evaluation?                                         S
Comment: The arrangements that have been put in place are solid and practical, and accordingly



                                                        73
are operationally meaningful. Impact evaluations are part of these arrangements.
1.2 Realism of Project Design and Risks                                                                MS
Comment: The overall Project design is realistic but could have taken into consideration the
capacity of different Provinces to deal with the new system being introduced. The capacities and
complexities among different Provinces vary significantly and the targeted population is not
always well enough informed to use the new system. A more differentiated approach, reflecting
those varying provincial capabilities, and a greater emphasis on communication and community
outreach could have improved the absorptive capacity and included more beneficiaries. Several
risks identified during preparation materialized, e.g. failure to reach most intended beneficiaries,
but the proposed mitigation had no effect, e.g. outreach campaigns were delayed. Furthermore,
the institutional complexities associated with working with the Municipalities were not identified
as risks at the time the Project was prepared.
1.2.1     Appropriateness of Project design and complexity given past track record and                 MS
          absorptive capacity?
Comment: The Project design was appropriate but should have anticipated the variation among
the 15 provinces and their capacity and willingness to organize the health care providers to
provide health care and the difficulties in enrolling a low-income population.
1.2.2     Adequate attention to technical, financial and economic aspects?                             S
Comment: The Project has a solid and internally consistent framework to deal with the technical
aspects. Given the small size of this operation in the context of budgetary resources available at
the Federal and Provincial levels, the financial and economic aspects play a subsidiary role, and in
themselves should not pose an undue risk on sustainability, once Bank resources are no longer
available for the continuation of the program. That notwithstanding, the issue will need to be
addressed and increasing attention will have to be focused to the subject as the Project nears
completion.
1.2.3     Quality of institutional framework for the Project?                                          S
Comment: The Project has been framed to work within the institutional structure as it was in
existence at the time of appraisal. With greater understanding of the different capabilities among
Provinces, the institutional strengthening elements could have been enhanced to reflect the weaker
jurisdictions, particularly those that involve Municipalities, in the conduct of the Project.
Operationally, a more extensive institutional audit and greater familiarization with the different
provincial and municipal capabilities would have enhanced the design of the implementation
support.
1.2.4     Quality of risk assessment and mitigation measures?                                          MS
Comment: Risks to the country are minimal and so are sector risks. The social and cultural
aspects for reaching the intended beneficiaries of the Project were underestimated and the
mitigation measures of community-based information and outreach campaigns were only
moderately satisfactory.
1.2.5     Readiness for implementation?                                                                MU
Comment: The APL-2 was judged to be ready for implementation based on the successful
implementation of the first two years of APL-1 in nine provinces. Despite several measures
adopted by the Bank to ensure readiness for implementation, the addition of 15 provinces and
thereby covering the whole country was ambitious and resulted in a slow start up. The fact that
APL-1 so far had a successful start should not have been taken as proof of a readiness that all
provinces, including the largest and most economically advanced ones, would be capable of
replicating this early success.

In its response the task team challenged this judgment but the panel believes that the 19 months
disbursement lag for a phase 2 of an APL is ample proof of lack of readiness. The panel also notes
the low rate of coverage that is explained by the poor performance of the Central Region
Provinces (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and City of Buenos Aires). This region concentrates 80% of
the target population and had only reached 20.3% on average of coverage by to September 2009.
1.2.6     Government ownership of the design process?                                                  HS
Comment: There has been clear political will on the part of the central and provincial authorities.
The decision to widen the scope of the Project to cover a wider set of provinces was in response to



                                                         74
demand from the provinces to be included in the program.
1.2.7     Effectiveness of the Bank’s management of the preparation/appraisal process?                 S
Comment: An internal QER was enriched with comments by three peer reviewers and served to
frame the issues more sharply. However management could have addressed the readiness of the
Project to absorb all 15 remaining provinces and considered the implications of scaling-up so
rapidly without an adequate institutional audit. The task team included relevant operational skills
with good country and sector knowledge. Resources were more than adequate given the short time
(six months) between concept review and Board approval. Argentina is an important Bank client
and has a large health sector portfolio of US$1.2 billion and management obviously paid attention
to this operation.
1.3 Fiduciary, Safeguards and GAC Aspects                                                              S
1.3.1 Extent of integration and quality of procurement aspects in Project design?                      MS
Comment: The key issues and risks concerning procurement that were identified during the
assessment of the first phase of the Project (inadequate procurement information system and
omission of specifics on procurement procedures in the operational Manual) had already been
implemented at appraisal. External audits and procurement reviews also provided evidence of
adequate capacity without serious deviations but with some common deficiencies that are present
in other Projects in Argentina. The rating here would have been Satisfactory, except for later
events. In the ISR dated 12/18/2009, the Sector Manager refers to “…the ongoing INT
investigations increasingly suggests a pattern of integrity problems in the implementation unit,
especially pertaining to procurement.? The Team explained that the Minister herself initiated the
investigation, the results of which are still not in the public domain. However, the Bank and the
Ministry agreed on a plan to improve the procurement function in general, with positive steps to
reduce corruption opportunities (web disclosure, open bidding, clear evaluations, web based
records,                                                                                     etc.).

As of now the government has been slow to implement the agreed plan and this led to the Team
rating procurement in the ISR as MU (although Project implementation is proceeding well).
However, the team expressed optimism that next ISR will show marked improvements. In any
case the initial procurement risk assessment, particularly regarding corruption seems now to have
been rather naïve. In reality, capacity itself was not an issue, and the measures to improve it were
adequate (training, systems, manual, etc.). Given the APL nature of the Project, and the good early
pace of implementation, the reviewer considers that adequate measures were in place to support
early startup of procurement activities. The plans were prepared and the provinces engaged
reasonably early. The documentation indicates that the team’s procurement specialists were fully
integrated with other Project activities during the design phase.
1.3.2 Extent of integration and quality of financial management aspects in Project design?             S
Comment: The Project risk assessment included in the PAD took into account the Bank's
Country Financial Accountability Assessment, issued in September 2002, and identified the
country risk and Project risk as Moderate. The assessment adequately covered the implementing
unit’s arrangements for budgeting, accounting, internal control and funds flow, including
disbursement, financial reporting and auditing. Its preliminary conclusion is that acceptable FM
arrangements at NMH, through its International Financing Unit (UFI-S) continued in place and
would remain the same for the proposed Project; the Project control framework was adequate and
had been functioning effectively through the first year and a half of implementation of the then
current project. Implementation risks were recognized from the experience of previous Projects
and were taken into account in the design of this one. These relate principally to the weak
institutional capacity of some provincial health ministries compared with the demanding technical
requirements for the implementation of the Project. Appropriate mitigating measures, including an
operational concurrent audit under TOR and by audit firm acceptable to the Bank, were identified
and included in an action plan.
1.3.3 Quality of arrangements for governance and anti-corruption in Project design?                    S
Comment: By designing the program around the existing setup, the Project avoided altering the
political economy ramifications while introducing an empirically driven performance system for
allocating resources. The introduction of an external auditing system (third party monitoring)
provided at the same time a measure of verification, and with it a method to deal with fiduciary as


                                                         75
well as performance assessments. A greater emphasis on disclosure and beneficiaries’ outreach
could have in time also strengthened the demand side of governance, particularly to hold the local
Authorities accountable to the beneficiaries themselves.
1.3.4 Extent of integration and quality of social aspects in Project design?                            MS
Comment: The overall assessment of integration of social issues in Project design is Moderately
Satisfactory, reflecting a sound basic orientation on essential concepts and approaches, coupled
with an insufficient attention to the mechanisms of implementation, particularly on the social side.
This judgment applies both to component 3 (i) and (ii) (Communication and Community
outreach), and also to social safeguards, where the Indigenous Peoples policy was triggered for
certain                                                                                  provinces.

Program goals had a strong intrinsic focus on poverty alleviation and gender issues. The strong
performance of APL1, and enthusiasm on the government side led to high expectations and
ambitious promises for stage 2, and perhaps an underestimation of risks to performance on the
social                                                                                 aspects.

Essentially, in sub-component 3 (ii) in particular, the Project promised to deliver, through the
provincial work program agreements, increased participation of the target population, organized
community groups, and even an element of citizen oversight. There does not seem to have been
any prior assessment of the will and capacity of the provinces to do this, and the M&E indicator
(people who knew of the program, and percentage of enrollees who were satisfied) was
insufficiently challenging. Subsequently, the Bank agreed that this component had been under-
resourced. It also seems to have been under-designed.

Safeguards policy required that Indigenous Peoples Plans (IPPs) had to be prepared for identified
provinces. This would ensure inclusion, consultation, cultural and linguistic adaptation and
“participative evaluation?. For this, there was a policy framework (summarized in the PAD) and a
promise of institutional cooperation between the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of
Indigenous Affairs. Despite detailed guidance at QER, there is little evidence of specific
preparatory work to ensure that institutional capacity, political will, technical and human
resources and an acceptable time-table would be in place at provincial level, not just to prepare the
plans, but to implement them. IPPs were just listed as tasks in the provincial work agreement.

The problems of underperformance in the communications and outreach, and the nonperformance
of the OP 4.10 requirements, became apparent through supervision two years into implementation.
However, the origins lie in inadequate design.
1.3.5 Extent of integration and quality of environmental aspects in Project design?                     HS
Comment: The Project is classified as a category "C" Project and has no safeguards aspects.
However, APL-1 has financed a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) which analyses in
depth those environmental risks affecting maternal and child health. The SE identifies
environmental causes relating to mother and child mortality and morbidity; covers markets,
regulations and institutional capacity; analyzes strategic options for improving environmental
policies relating to maternal and child health; and relates all of the above to the Plan Nacer. As
such, it is a well-timed and high-quality piece of analytical work to inform government policies
and programs in APL-2.

2. IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS                                                                              MS

Comment: The task team and the panel concurred on most major issues that have affected to date
Project implementation. These are: (i) weaknesses in performance by some provincial and
municipal public and private health care providers; (ii) changing a medical culture to accept and
follow through on working under an incentive system; (iii) uneven provincial managerial
capacities; (iv) political changes at the highest levels that slowed down the Government’s
response to implementation problems; and (v) measuring and auditing performance requires a
strong IT capacity that is not present at sufficient depth in some provinces. In addition the panel
notes the lesser commitment of the larger provinces and their slow acceptance of the new


                                                          76
institutional arrangements and performance incentives. The task team groups the 15 provinces in
three categories that reflect their commitment and contribution to the DOs. The third category that
includes the three largest provinces has the largest number of potential eligible women and
children and their performance affects the overall Project implementation.
2.1 Continued Government ownership and commitment to development objectives?                            HS
Comment: The Government commitment in responding to the number of Provinces wanting to be
associated with the program is one of the hallmarks of the program. The Federal Health Council
(COFESA) has played an important role in ensuring this commitment to the DOs. The PCU at the
national level provides the proper Government stewardship commensurate with the decentralized
federal system in place in Argentina.
2.2 Extent to which the implementing agencies are able to ensure high quality                           MS
implementation?
Comment: Project implementation is the responsibility of the participating provinces and in some
cases local Municipalities. Their capabilities vary greatly and a major challenge is how best to
support and motivate the less performing provinces. Mechanisms in place to correct these
weaknesses include meetings of the provincial PIUs every three months to exchange experiences
and to learn from each other; active support from the central level PCU present at the provincial
meetings; and targeting implementation support.
2.3 Borrower’s effectiveness in resolving implementation issues in a timely manner?                     MS
Comment:
General Issues: The country's constitution defines the authority of the central level as what is
delegated to it by the constituent provinces. This dispersed authority makes it difficult at times to
assign clear general implementation responsibilities. The Project does not include civil works.
Legal covenants are in place but their compliance could not be ascertained by the panel as the
ISRs do not report on them.

Procurement aspects: The new Minister herself raised issues of fraud and corruption prompting an
INT investigation still underway. A plan was developed between the Bank and the Borrower to
improve the transparency and efficiency of the procurement function, but it is being implemented
too slowly. So, the borrower gets a good rating for raising the issue, and a bad one for slow
resolution, thus explaining the MU rating. The procurement process and related risks has not been
very well managed by the borrower, although Project implementation is proceeding reasonably
well.
As pointed out by the task team in its response to the initial draft, the implementation of the
Action Plan has shown important advances in recent months as reported in the last ISR. While
taking note of this development the panel supports the Sector Manager decision to retain the MU
rating for procurement.

Financial Management: Per aide memoirs related to supervision missions in 2007, 2008 and 2009,
the Task Team was generally satisfied with the capacity of the entity relating to financial
management arrangements; however, due to the complexities of the Project prompt corrective
action was not always taken timely. The Project has been audited by a government auditor who
identified a number of internal control issues during the audits of the Project financial statements.
Some of the issues had already been identified by the FMS and discussed with the Borrower.
Some of the audit reports and unaudited IFRs were delayed.
2.4 Effectiveness in addressing environmental and social aspects (including safeguards)?                MU
Comment: Despite optimistic language in the PAD, it appears that Government commitment was
lacking or inconsistent on implementing social safeguards, and on implementing the
communications and outreach components. This situation, had it been correctly assessed, would
have implied greater and earlier emphasis during supervision on social issues.
2.5 Timely production and utilization of M&E data?                                                      MS
Comment: There has been on the whole a slow response to the delays in the startup of the
Project. Now that it is at mid-point of the implementation period, there is an opportunity to reset
the targets and reenergize implementation, particularly among lagging Provinces through more
focused attention and support.

2.6 Effective coordination between executing agency and implementing agencies,                           S
     stakeholders and donors?
Comment: There are several coordination vehicles, including the Federal Health Council
(COFESA) and the National Health Service Purchasing Team (NHSPT), which have been useful
for exchanges of experiences, and taking stock among all concerned. Provincial PIUs meet
quarterly and meetings are attended by the national PCU. There are no other donors involved in
the Project, and stakeholders have hitherto had a minor voice in Project execution

3. QUALITY OF BANK SUPERVISION                                                                           MU
3.1 Focus on Development Effectiveness                                                                   S
3.1.1 Extent to which the Bank identified and responded in a timely manner to                            S
implementation problems?
Comment: The Bank has identified implementation issues correctly and has discussed these
issues with national authorities but political changes at the highest levels have slowed down the
Government’s response to implementation problems.
3.1.2Appropriateness of Bank advice and proposed solutions to the Borrower?                              S
Comment: Bank advice and proposed solutions are mostly appropriate but are not always
politically acceptable. A greater specificity in the advice and solutions to enable a better-graduated
response to the varying performance of the participating provinces would require a focus on
specific provincial-level issues. However the sheer size of this operation makes it logistically
difficult to work with all provinces and the task team therefore must rely on the technical
assistance provided by the central level PCU to the provincial PIUs.
3.1.3 Adequacy of Bank’s efforts to address significant risks during supervision?                        S
Comment: The scope of the Project, gaps in Project preparation, staff changes after elections
have posed constraints. The task team now has a good understanding of the major risks to DO
achievement. The delayed Mid Term Review provides an opportunity to seek corrective actions in
the lagging Provinces.
3.1.4 Extent to which Bank’s supervision efforts focused on sustainability issues?                       S
Comment: Programmatic sustainability is judged to be favorable as the institutional arrangements
and the performance incentive payments introduced by this operation are likely to stay in place
after Project closure. Financial sustainability once Bank funding has been used up and provinces
have to rely on their own resources is less certain but would vary among provinces as inter-
provincial economic disparities are significant and the willingness and financial capability of the
central government to help the poorer provinces is uncertain. Both these issues are being
addressed by the task team.
3.1.5 Extent to which the Bank’s supervision efforts made adequate use of quantitative                   S
and/or qualitative performance indicators:
Comment: Data generated at the local level and subsequently aggregated at the provincial level
are used to decide on changes in service provision and on targeting beneficiaries. The ten health
interventions used as tracers are a useful guide for assessing implementation progress across
provinces. The task team has identified the major implementation obstacles that would limit
achieving the DOs and conditions are now ready to poise the Government and relevant Provinces
to act on the issues that have been identified. Baseline data and impact evaluations will be useful
to adjust resource allocation and manage identified shortcomings as the Project continues to be
implemented.
3.2 Fiduciary, Safeguards and GAC Aspects                                                                MU
3.2.1 Quality of Procurement Oversight?                                                                   S
Comment: From a corruption point of view, the procurement risks identified at the design stage
were underestimated, as proven by the INT investigation still underway with the full support of
the Bank Management Team, initiated at the request of the new Minister (see 1.3.1.b). The Bank
team reacted proactively and effectively working with the Borrower to develop an action plan to
improve the transparency of the procurement function. The Borrower has been rather slow to
implement the plan and the Team has been putting pressure to accelerate it. It can be concluded
that Fraud and Corruption issues have been identified and are being addressed. Two very good
annual procurement reviews covering ex-ante, ex-post, and the procurement function in general
were carried out. Both reviews indicate staffing problems, lack of progress in agreed plans to


                                                          78
improve the procurement function, and slow implementation of procurement activities in general,
proposing a MU rating (2009 review). The reviewer believes the Bank Team has acted effectively
and proactively in discovering and explaining these issues to the Borrower. Although the ISRs and
reviews indicate that the procurement plan has not been updated in a satisfactory manner,
disbursements are not really an issue (as explained by the TTL). The reports indicate that there
have been no complaints. The ISRs and ex-post reports indicate that there has been an excellent
integration of procurement supervision activities with the overall supervision effort (especially
integration with FM activities to ensure full coverage of fiduciary issues) and these are reflected in
the documentation.
3.2.2 Quality of Financial Management Oversight?                                                         S
Comment: The task team performed nine supervision and technical missions between June 2007
and December 2009, and has included the FMS or an FM consultant in four of them. The intensity
and coverage of those missions corresponded to a Moderate level of risk. The FMS/Consultant has
reviewed relevant aspects of the Project and has proposed corrective actions, verifying that
mitigating measures were implemented and in most cases were working satisfactorily. In the case
of annual audit reports, the Bank provided comments in a timely manner after receipt of the
report.

Most critical records were made available for the QAG review, but some documents were missing
such as audit reports. The task team spent an inordinate amount of time searching for them in IRIS
and finally provided QAG with the needed documents. This appears to be a system's deficiency
and does not reflect on the task team.
3.2.3 Quality of Oversight of Governance and Anti-Corruption Aspects (including                          MS
procurement, financial management and other fraud and corruption issues that affect
Project quality)?
Comment: Oversight quality of GAC is mixed; although according to the QALP procurement
review the supervision reports indicate that there have been no complaints, the panel believes that
the upcoming MTR should address GAC issue up front.
3.2.4 Quality of Oversight of Social Aspects (including safeguards)?                                     MU
Comment: On social matters, the level of effort during supervision seems to have been low. This
would have identified issues with the communications program, with monitoring the behavioral
“story line? on beneficiary enrollment, with ensuring effective communications and community
outreach, and to ensure that policy requirements with safeguards were complied with. Although
the PAD suggested in places that some measure of social accountability might be introduced,
there is no evidence that during implementation this was ever under consideration.

The team is commended for prompt and focused response to IP safeguards compliance once the
issue was identified. However, matters should not have been allowed to reach this stage, as an out
of compliance operation poses reputational risk. No information is available on how the matter
was followed up after March 2009 and in its absence, it has to be assumed that the situation
remains unsatisfactory.

This assessment is based on the evidence made available so far and may be modified if
satisfactory evidence is forthcoming to show that meaningful provincial level IPPs were
developed and implemented.
3.2.5 Quality of Oversight of Environmental Aspects (including safeguards)?                              NA
3.3 Supervision Inputs and Processes                                                                      S
3.3.1 Adequacy of staffing arrangements?                                                                  S
Comment: There is a competent task team in place in country and at headquarters with all
relevant skills to address the issues at stake. Although seemingly unavoidable, three TTLs were
responsible for the Project over three and half years. The present TTL has been in place now for
two years suggesting an improved continuity in task leadership.
3.3.2 Adequacy and timeliness of country and sector management attention and actions                     S
(including follow-up letters to the borrower and comments in the ISR)?
Comment: The Project had the support of both the country and sector managers, with the latter



                                                          79
making relevant comments at each ISR, and been “on top? of the effort, including his joining a
supervision mission.
3.3.3 Adequacy and effectiveness of budget allocation and use?                                         S
Comment: All indications are that the TTL has received the resources needed to undertake
supervision work and those resources were used appropriately. Supervising implementation in 15
provinces requires a larger and stronger team in order to be able to focus more selectively on
provincial-level problem areas and to manage issues with greater selectivity
3.4 Candor and Realism of ISR                                                                         MS
3.4.1 Candor and realism of ISR ratings for DOs?                                                      MS
Comment: Achieving DOs has been consistently rated satisfactory. The panel recommends a
more cautious rating approach given the lower than expected enrolment of eligible children and
women. A moderate satisfactory DO rating would be a more realistic reflection of these concerns
until some critical milestones are achieved.

In its response to the panel's comments above the task team expressed the intention to thoroughly
assess this aspect during the October 2010 MTR.
3.4.2 Candor and realism of ISR ratings for IP?                                                       MS
Comment: Implementation progress is affected by a number of factors enumerated under
Implementation Progress. Notwithstanding these issues the ISRs consistently assign a satisfactory
rating to the IP; the panel considers a moderately satisfactory rating to have been more realistic.
The panel also considers that the risk flags for FM and safeguards (indigenous people) should
have been used. Use of these flags would have placed the Project in the “potential problem
Project? category in FY09 and FY10 and would have signaled to management the nature of the
implementation problems
3.4.3 Quality of supervision reporting?                                                               MS
Comment: The reporting in the ISRs is rather light. It could be enhanced with comments on the
RF indicators, more specificity on agreed actions, reporting on legal covenants (no covenants are
included in the ISR) and a more convincing explanation why DO and IP are rated satisfactory.

In responding to these comments the task team points out that RF indicators and agreed actions
are being commented upon in the ISRs under the “tracers system? name. Regarding the Legal
covenants, they had been already met, and they are informed under the Intermediate Results
Indicators section in the ISR.
3.4.4 Consistency between supervision reporting and supervision ratings?                              MS
Comment: ISR ratings in general are mostly favorable but are not fully supported by the narrative
in the ISRs.

In responding to the comment above the task team points out that although some indicators targets
are underperforming, the team considers the overall execution of the Project to be satisfactory
while the functioning of the incentive scheme is a valuable result. Furthermore, the team is
reviewing with the Government how to address the underreporting related with the information
source that provides inputs for the indicators. While the Project indicator targets were set using
the national statistics systems, the Government is informing the targets using the tracer systems,
based on nominalized population.
Note: HS = Highly Satisfactory; S = Satisfactory; MS = Moderately Satisfactory; MU = Moderately Unsatisfactory;
U = Unsatisfactory; HU = Highly Unsatisfactory. (Uses 6-point scale H, S, MS, MU, U, HU.)

       Annex 12. More Details on Preparation and Implementation of APL-2


1.    This annex provides additional details of preparation and implementation aspects of this
APL-2 Project, to complement what is already in Section 2 of the main body of this report.

A. Project Preparation and Design

A-1. Lessons Drawn Upon at Preparation Stage, and Rationale for Bank Intervention

2.      The lessons drawn upon at the preparation stage were appropriate, and were
incorporated appropriately into the Project design. The PAD for APL-2 mentions three major
lessons that were drawn on for APL-1 and APL-2: (a) The focus on reform of the national social
health insurance system during the 1990s proved insufficient to address the health problems of
the poor, and thus coverage of the uninsured did not expand significantly; (b) previous projects
and reforms insufficiently reached the poorest provinces where most of the uninsured live; and
(c) the Bank’s experience in supporting Argentina’s health sector indicates that Bank’s financing
should be closely linked to results. The first and third lessons were especially relevant for APL-
2.

3.     The PAD for APL-2 notes two additional lessons learned from the implementation of
APL-1. (1) The reforms introduced by Plan Nacer and APL-1 are demanding, both technically
and institutionally, requiring substantial technical assistance and intense policy dialogue for
successful implementation; and (2) The introduction of an additional element in the independent
concurrent audit to verify the compliance of the provinces with key elements of Plan Nacer has
proven instrumental in the program’s success. The design of APL-2 did incorporate expanded
technical assistance and a continuation of the independent concurrent audits following the
modality introduced under APL-1.

4.       The rationale for Bank intervention for APL-2, as for APL-1, was solid. A major
rationale for the Bank’s intervention, according to the PAD of APL-2, was its long experience
with Argentina’s health sector (more than ten years), resulting in significant comparative
advantages in supporting government efforts that combine policy reform with investments to
contribute to longer-term improvements in institutional performance. The ICR for APL-1 found
this rationale to be appropriate, and this present ICR for APL-2 finds the same.

A-2. Design and Preparation

5.      In addition to the strengths at the design and preparation stage identified by the
QALP-2 report, this ICR finds the following to be strengths regarding the quality of design,
in line with the ICR for APL-1:

   •   High relevance: The issues addressed under APL-2, as for APL-1, were still highly
       relevant for the country. The poor access and quality of health services was an issue for
       the Phase 2 provinces, as they were for the Phase 1 provinces under APL-1 earlier. As for




                                               82
       the Phase 1 provinces, this was having a negative impact on pregnant/lactating women
       and young children without formal health insurance.

   •   Pro-poor focus: The Project addressed the root cause of inequity in healthcare by
       focusing on the most vulnerable populations: uninsured children, pregnant women and
       mothers.

   •   Importance of Provincial Governments taken into account: APL-2 contributed to
       further strengthening the stewardship function of the national government in a federal
       context while also recognizing the importance of provincial governments in the delivery
       of these services. The Project strengthened the linkage between the national government
       and the provinces by establishing an incentive system between the two of them in order
       to improve the quality and quantity of specific health services.

   •   Innovative results-orientated systems of incentives: The Project incorporated a strong
       results-oriented system where provinces as well as health service providers were
       incentivized to improve performance, bringing a critical change to the system and
       orienting it to an approach focused on results.

   •   Strong collaboration with various actors: Close coordination of activities in the health
       sector was maintained with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) which
       supported the government’s pharmaceutical program (free essential medicines for the
       poor) through REMEDIAR. To ensure close coordination responsibility for both
       programs, Plan Nacer and REMEDIAR were placed under the same Secretary of Health
       (Secretary of Sanitary Programs). The Project was also closely coordinated with the Pan
       American Health Organization.

   •   Choice of Lending Instrument: The choice of an the Adaptable Program Investment
       Loan (APL) instrument allowed testing of the design and implementation of Plan Nacer
       in the Northern provinces under APL-1 so that preliminary lessons could be derived from
       ongoing experience. The lessons that had been learned were built into practices and
       norms to guide service delivery, reforms in the financing regime, and institution building.

B. Implementation

B-1. Procurement, and Governance and Anti-Corruption Plan

6.      Procurement in the QALP-2 report: Prior to the QALP-2 report of June 2010, the
rating for procurement in the ISRs had been downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
after a post-procurement review in May 2008 found moderate deficiencies in procurement
management (for the entire health portfolio) at the International Financing Unit for Health
(UFIS). UFIS is an operational unit within the Ministry of Health in charge of procurement in
Bank projects. The Bank and UFIS agreed on an action plan in order to improve the situation.
The action plan was also meant to improve the transparency and efficiency of the procurement
function, to help address issues related to an INT investigation that was started because the
Minister herself raised issues of fraud and corruption. However, at the time the plan was being


                                               83
implemented too slowly, which explains the rating that was still MU in the last ISR done before
the QALP-2 report.

7.      The QALP-2 report provided a rating of MU for implementation by the Government on
procurement issues, linked partly to the INT investigation that had just been launched. The fact
that the investigation was launched at the request of the Minister of the Health was seen as
positive by the QALP-2 report.

8.       Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) Plan: Ultimately, the INT investigation did
not result in any proven corruption under this Project or others in the health sector in Argentina.
However, a GAC Plan was developed in early 2011, and agreed between the Government and
the Bank. In June 2012 a supervision mission conducted by the Bank found that most of the
activities included in the GAC had been completed, except for four. Decent progress was noted
on these four actions in the last ISR in November 2012.

9.      Specifically, the following was noted for each of the four pending actions:

     (1) Revision of the system of independent alerts regarding internal controls against fraud and
         corruption: the Bank will hire an external consultant to advise on this, and this will be
         done around the time of the Mid-Term Review of the FESP II project (in early 2014).
     (2) Evaluation and finalization of contracts within the agreed timelines: A Plan of Action has
         been formulated to strengthen the Procurement and Contracting Unit of UFIS, and
         periodic followup will take place regarding this plan.
     (3) An exhaustive analysis regarding adequate via the external technical audit of two
         provinces selected by the Bank, under the FESP II project: The two provinces have been
         selected, and the analysis will be done when the FESP II project is at a more advanced
         stage (this requires inputs from an external consultant hired by the Bank).
     (4) UFI-S will integrate the functions of financial management and procurement by adopting
         the interface of UEPEX-SEPA (Unidad Ejecutora de Proyectos Externos–Sistema de
         Ejecución de Planes de Adquisiciones) with technical assistance from the Bank: An
         external consultant has been hired for this, and the work will soon be in progress.

10.    Procurement performance later in the Project: The Mid-Term Review (MTR) of
November 2011 found that overall performance in procurement implementation had improved.
This had justified (a few months earlier) an upgrade in the procurement rating in the ISRs from
MU to MS in June 2011. An action plan was anyway developed at the time of the MTR based on
a review of procurement in the health sector program that had recently been conducted.
Performance regarding this plan has been satisfactory.

11.    Finally, in May 2012, an external consultant conducted an Independent Procurement
Review (IPR). The Government then produced an Action Plan in late 2012 to address its findings
(agreed to by the Bank).




                                                84
B-2. Changes to the Benefits Package

12.    In early 2010, the benefits package was broadened to include two additional groups
of services: (a) a sub-package of congenital heart disease (CHD) treatment services for
children; and (b) a “perinatal sub-package? of highly complex maternal health services.
This was the result of analysis that showed that: (a) CHD was a major factor underlying child
mortality in the country (accounting for about 8% of under-five deaths); and (b) additional
services were found to be needed in the package to address more complex birth problems and
higher-risk births, and to increase the impact on maternal mortality. A loan agreement
amendment was approved in April 2010, in support of this. The inclusion of these additional
services led to a small increase in the monthly capitation payment to be paid to the provinces.

13.      A separate Fund was set up at the central level for the CHD services, but the pace of
invoicing for the CHD services was initially low, leading to a large accumulation of unused
resources in this Fund. The Fund was set up separately because in the case of the CHD services,
fee-for-service payments would go directly from this Fund to the hospitals providing the CHD
services (which were not many to begin with), instead of being first transferred to provincial
Bank accounts. (In the case of the original basic package of services, the modality of operation
continued as before, i.e. all capitation payments continued to be made to the provinces and to
flow into provincial Bank accounts, before being used for fee-for-service payments to the health
facilities.) Thus, in effect the CHD Fund was managed at the central level, although on behalf of
the provinces.

14.     But due to various reasons, in particular the complexity of the new sub-package of CHD
services, invoicing at the level of the health facilities was initially slow. By the time of the MTR
in November 2011, capitation transfers related to Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) Interventions
had accumulated to approximately US$40 million of which only 10% had been used for fee-for-
service payments to health facilities. The remainder of the funds remained in the CHD account.

15.     For this reason and to avoid any additional increase of accumulated funds, the
Government and the Bank team agreed to suspend further accrual of the capitation
payments related to CHD services until the execution of these proceeds had reached an
acceptable level. By Project close, the amount of accumulated funds in the CHD account had
fallen to around half at about US$20 million, due to a much higher rate of invoicing and fee-for-
service payments for these services at the health facility level. The reminder of the funds will be
used for CHD payments under the follow-on Plan Sumar project.

16.      The introduction of CHD services for children in the benefits package nevertheless
constitutes a successful and model experience for the Argentinian health sector. It marks the
first time that catastrophic care interventions have been included in a public health insurance
scheme in the country, resulting in a significant impact on infant and neonatal mortality, and
enhancing financial protection among beneficiary families. A well-functioning network of
establishments providing CHD treatments was created – the first Federal network of health
facilities providing specialized complex care in the country. As a result, the number of surgeries
to treat CHD rose by 97%, and the waiting list for patients with CHD fell by 80%. As noted in




                                                85
Annex 5, a survey of beneficiaries showed that the level of satisfaction of mothers of
beneficiaries of this scheme was found to be very high, at 9.1 on a scale of 10.

B-3. Provincial Counterpart Funding

17.     Provincial Counterpart Funding challenges and positive steps taken by the
Government towards resolution: From January 2011 onwards, “Phase 2? provinces started to
make their required contributions of 30% to their capitation payments, with Project loan (IBRD)
funds used to pay the remaining 70%. (Previously, 100% of the capitation payments had been
financed by the project.). “Phase 1? provinces had already had to make their 30% contributions
since 2009, under APL-1, before being transferred to APL-2 starting in August 2010. Provinces
had 15 days to make their deposit for the co-payments into the Plan Nacer provincial accounts.
If there was a delay of more than 15 days, provinces were charged a fine. If later than 45 days,
the national government suspended its payment (financed by the Project loan) of 70% of the total.

18.     This process didn’t take into account the particularity of administration processes and
provincial constraints in each province. A pattern was seen whereby towards the end of the
calendar year, provinces would sometimes not make their payments, but they would typically
repay in full the arrears of each year at the start of the following year.

19.     At Project close in December 2012, nine provinces (five from Phase I and four from
Phase II) had been temporarily suspended from receiving payments, since they had not deposited
the full amount of their counterpart contributions within the agreed time period. The national
Government responded by stating that capitation payments under the Sumar program for January
2013 onwards would not be made to any province that had not paid its debt (if any) in full under
the Plan Nacer program. This was in order to incentivize the provinces to pay their debts owed
under Plan Nacer. The strategy worked, since all provinces have now paid their debt in full
under Plan Nacer.

B-4. Impact Evaluation (IE) and Baseline Survey

20.     A broad evaluation agenda existed under the Project, including in-depth IE, and
this in turn led to its own challenges and delays. This included a delay in the baseline IE
survey for the Phase 2 provinces, which was conducted in 2008/09 instead of in the first year of
the Project (2007) as originally planned (see Annex 13 for full details).

21.     Because of the delay in the baseline IE survey, PDO Indicator baseline values could
not be obtained for individual provinces or groups of provinces. The baseline values for the
seven PDO Indicators that are linked to the provincial “tracer? indicators – PDO Indicators 2 to 8
in Table 3 of the main text of this ICR – are reported in Annex 3 of the PAD of APL-2. These
values are all national values (and are reported as such), based on national data, since provincial-
level values were not available at the time. Since APL-2 was originally meant just for the 15 new
Phase 2 provinces, it was planned that the baseline IE study would be used to obtain baseline
values for the Phase 2 provinces only (as a group), and these would be used to replace the
national baseline values reported in the PAD.




                                                86
22.    But then two unforeseen events occurred. First, the baseline IE study was delayed
substantially, and was ultimately conducted in 2008/09, well after the Project started in late 2006.
Second, in mid-2010 the Phase 1 provinces were included in APL-2, in addition to the Phase 2
provinces. At that point, APL-2 became essentially a Project with national coverage. So, there
was no longer a need for baseline values for the Phase 2 provinces only, and the original
national-level baseline values were valid after all.

  Annex 13. Impact Evaluation for Plan Nacer: Challenges and Accomplishments

A. Impact Evaluation (IE) Activities Under APL-2 and Plan Nacer – An Overview of Events


1.     Impact Evaluation (IE) is an essential part of Component 4 of APL-2, and was
designed for the fifteen Phase 2 provinces, just as an IE exercise had been designed
separately under APL-1 for the “Phase 1? provinces. The Phase 2 provinces are those that
entered into Plan Nacer for the first time under APL-2, while the Phase 1 provinces had entered
under APL-1. Both IE studies – the IE for the Phase 2 provinces and that for Phase 1 provinces –
were envisaged to generate evidence to evaluate the design and implementation of Plan Nacer.
The primary objectives of the IE in both cases were the following:

      i.   Generate evidence on the overall impacts of Plan Nacer program on access to care,
           quality of care and health outcomes.
     ii.   Evaluate design features of Plan Nacer in order to determine how the existing RBF
           model can be strengthened in order to improve priority health outcomes.
    iii.   Disseminate Knowledge based on the evaluation Program; publications and
           Seminars/BBLs.

2.      The IE for the Phase 2 provinces under APL-2 experienced major challenges and
therefore significant delays and modifications, as has been the case for the IE for the Phase
1 provinces. At the appraisal stage for APL-2, it was anticipate that a baseline study for the 15
“Phase 2? provinces (that were newly included under APL-2) would be completed within the
first year of implementation of APL-2 which was approved in late 2006. But data collection for
this baseline survey was ultimately completed in 2009 (see below for factors underlying this).
Similarly, the IE exercise for the nine “Phase 1? provinces (that were newly included under
APL-1) had its challenges and experienced delays. A description of events in each case is given
below.

3.      The teams working on the IE for both studies (for the Phase 1 and the Phase 2
provinces), have shown a high degree of adaptability, strengthening their efforts on IE and
producing a series of credible results with work still ongoing. At this point, the credible
results are from the IE of the Phase 1 provinces, with work still ongoing for the IE of the Phase 2
provinces (see below for more details). This was accomplished, mostly before 2011, via
exploring new sources of information, particularly administrative data of the Program for the
provinces of Misiones and Tucumán. Early in 2011 both teams identified the need to digitalize
clinical records of births occurring during the period 2004-2008, for the Phase 1 provinces (and
some control provinces). This information was deemed suitable as a sample frame for the follow-
up survey (for the Phase 1 provinces) and to replicate the evaluation techniques used for
Misiones and Tucuman. At the end of 2011, both teams recognized the need to increase the
number of staff working on the IE agenda, and both teams soon did so.

4.      Most importantly, the Government team has broadened the evaluation perspective,
shifting from IE, with a quantitative and causal approach, towards a more comprehensive
evaluation agenda. The Government team (National Ministry of Health) identified critical


                                                88
aspects and results of the Program that cannot be captured by means of a quantitative-causal
approach. Thus, other quantitative and qualitative studies were implemented. These studies
include the following, among others: (i) an examination of how motivation of health facilities’
staff is affected by the presence of an RBF program; (ii) an assessment of users' satisfaction; (iii)
an analysis of the synergy between the Universal Child Allowance policy and Plan Nacer; and
(iv) a review of the results linked to the implementation of a CHD Surgery Network in the
country. This evaluation agenda was funded mainly from the Government’s own funds, as a sign
of direct involvement and leadership by the Government in institutionalizing a broad evaluation
agenda, going beyond IE.

B. IE for Phase 1 Provinces in Detail

5.      The IE for the nine Phase 1 provinces was conceptualized at the start of APL-1. The
original evaluation design – the matched double-difference method – planned to use 4 provinces
adjoining the northern region (where the nine Phase 1 provinces were located) as controls. These
were Córdoba, Entre Ríos, La Rioja and Santa Fe provinces. The nine Phase 1 provinces would
be the “treatment? group.

6.      During 2006, a baseline survey was carried out in the nine provinces in the “treatment?
group, as well as the four provinces in the control group. The survey collected data on the
eligible population in the health service providers’ area of influence, on patients from exit
interviews, and on health facilities.

7.      However, in 2007 the original evaluation design was invalidated because all provinces in
the country rapidly implemented the Program, under APL-2. (As noted elsewhere in this
document, it had originally been envisaged that Plan Nacer would be rolled out in three phases,
but a decision was taken to roll it out rapidly nationwide under APL-2). Thus, the control group
provinces of Córdoba, Entre Ríos, La Rioja, and Santa Fe became “contaminated?, and could no
longer serve as controls.

8.      The strategy to evaluate the impact of Plan Nacer in the Phase 1 provinces thus had to be
modified. Among others, a follow-up household survey for the Phase 1 provinces was conducted
in 2011/12 but the composition of the sample of households in this follow-up survey had to be
modified (compared to what had been originally planned and compared to the baseline survey).
In particular, the new survey re-defined the sample of visited children born between July 2006
and August 2007 in order to include a high proportion of children who had been exposed to the
program since birth in treatment provinces but not in control provinces. With these data, an
“intention to treat? analysis will be carried out using a “difference in differences model? with
fixed effects at the provider level, comparing changes in outcomes in areas under the program
compared to areas not under the program. This analysis will shed light on the average effect of
the program on providers and on the eligible population, controlling for baseline characteristics.
In a second analysis, the team will estimate the effect of the program on the beneficiaries
themselves (“treatment on the treated estimates?), controlling for fixed effects at the provider
level and instrumenting beneficiary status using the eligible population at baseline and date of
providers’ incorporations. The data from this follow-up survey are still being cleaned and
analyzed, and results are expected in the next few months.



                                                 89
9.      These efforts focusing on surveys were complemented by a number of very fruitful
efforts focused on the collection and use of administrative data. First, in 2009/10, administrative
datasets were put together and analyzed for the two northern provinces of Tucuman and
Misiones. These data cover the periods 2005/06 and 2008 for Tucuman and 2007 to 2009 for
Misiones, and consist of data from the Plan Nacer records as well as from medical records at
health centers and hospitals.

10.     Later, in 2011, an even larger (and more laborious) effort took place, focusing on
digitalizing clinical records at maternity wards. A large administrative dataset was assembled
using data from the Plan Nacer records as well as from medical records collected from public
maternity wards, for births that had taken place between 2004 and 2008 in 9 provinces (all of the
nine Phase 1 provinces) as well as the control provinces La Rioja, Córdoba, Santa Fe and Entre
Ríos. A dataset of more than 400,000 observations was put together, in this manner.

11.     The data from the abovementioned follow-up survey of 2011/12 are still being cleaned
and analyzed, and results are not yet ready. But results from the analysis of the administrative
data from Tucuman and Misiones provinces are available, albeit with the caveat that they cover
only two provinces. Key results are reported in Annex 3.

12.     Some initial results from the analysis of the larger administrative dataset with more than
400,000 observations (assembled in 2011/12) are available. These data are still being analyzed,
and final results are expected to come in during the next few months. Some preliminary results
are reported in Annex 3.

13.     These results from the analysis of administrative data show that administrative data can
serve as an effective tool for generating solid results regarding program impact. Administrative
data are also useful, of course, for the purposes of ongoing adjustments during implementation,
i.e. for monitoring purposes. In summary, strengthening administrative data collection can
potentially lead to an effective approach for generating evaluation results and for monitoring
program implementation, partially complementing survey data.


C. IE for Phase 2 Provinces in Detail

14.     The IE exercise for the Phase 2 provinces, conceptualized at the start of APL-2, was
complicated by the fact that all provinces would be rapidly included in the program. Hence, it
would no longer be possible to have a true experimental design with a “treatment? group and a
“control group?, where the intervention is applied only to the treatment group but not to the
control group.

15.    An alternative quasi-experimental design was thus proposed. The idea was to generate
exogenous variation in the intensity of treatment, and then to assess whether higher intensity of
treatment leads to better outcomes. The exogenous variation in this case was supposed to come
from information campaigns administered to eligible persons in randomly selected localities.
These campaigns were meant to increase program enrolment. This design – known in the



                                                90
literature as randomized promotion – would produce exogenous increase in the registration level
in the Program, creating a valid instrumental variable to mitigate the selection bias inherent in a
household’s decision to enter the program.

16.     By the end of 2007, a pilot test was implemented in order to identify the most effective
promotion strategy. The pilot test was carried out in 4 provinces – Catamarca and Misiones from
the Phase 1 province group and Cordoba and Chubut from the Phase 2 province group – showing
highly satisfactory results in terms of registration rates.

17.     The baseline IE survey for the Phase 2 provinces took place finally, in 2008/09. The most
effective promotion strategies were implemented in a representative sample of localities in Phase
2 provinces. But after 15 months of promotion implementation, results showed that on average,
there was no effect on registration rates in these provinces. The exceptions were the 2 provinces
that participated during the pilot test (Cordoba and Chubut), suggesting that randomized
promotion requires detailed design and an intensive process of supervision to be successful.

18.     A second round of promotion strategies including additional activities to increase
participation and to incorporate new localities was scheduled for 2011, and a follow-up IE
survey for the Phase 2 provinces was planned for later. However, in 2009 the national
Government introduced the “Asignación Universal por Hijo? program. This is cash subsidy
program where families with vulnerable children can receive a cash subsidy (per child) if they
are enrolled in Plan Nacer. The introduction of this cash subsidy program created a strong
incentive for eligible children to be enrolled in Plan Nacer across the country, weakening the
randomization promotion evaluation design.

19.     Due to these unplanned events, the randomization promotion evaluation design approach
was abandoned. During 2011, alternative sources of information were explored in order to obtain
the fastest results without compromising methodological rigorousness. The follow up data
collection originally planned for Phase 2 provinces did not take place due to the introduction of
this cash subsidy program and the contamination of the control group.


D. Adaptability on Part of Government and Bank Teams

20.     Despite the changing circumstances on the ground and the challenges faced (as detailed
above), the Bank and Government teams showed great adaptability and flexibility, and solid
results have been generated using administrative data despite the challenges (see Section B). This
required a large and laborious effort, as mentioned above, to put together an administrative
dataset using data from the Plan Nacer records as well as from medical records collected from
public maternity wards. This is in addition to the results generated using administrative data from
Tucuman and Misiones provinces.

21.     Work using the data from the follow-up household survey for the Phase 1 provinces
(conducted in 2011/12) is ongoing, and results are expected soon. This is another example of
adaptability on the part of the Bank and Government teams, with a drive to generate results
despite challenges faced.
