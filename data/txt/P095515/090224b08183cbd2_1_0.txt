                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives are: (a) to increase access by eligible uninsured mothers and children to basic health services; (b) to strengthen the incentive
                         framework for efficiency and focus on results between the national level and the Eligible Provinces and among Eligible Provinces and service providers by linking
                         financing to both services actually rendered to the target populationand to the achievement of the MCHIP results as reflected by the selected ten tracers of the
                         Trazadoras Matrix.

                         The overall performance for the PDO indicators has improved substantially due to the substantially improved performance for most Tracer-related indicators. Out of 11 PDO
                         indicators, seven have now been fully achieved (i.e. achieved for both Phase I and II provinces). Out of these seven, the targets have been substantially surpassed for all except two
                         indicators. For the four indicators that have not been fully achieved, one of them (PDO Indicator 6) has been partially achieved since it was achieved for Phase I (but not Phase II)
                         provinces. In addition, by project close (i.e. once the results from the Sept-Dec 2012 “cuatrimestre? are known) indicators 2 and 3 have a high chance of being partially achieved (i.e.

                         achieved for Phase I provinces), since the achievement level is within 1% of the target in both cases. These final results will be known once the audited data from the Sept-Dec 2012
                         “cuatrimestre? are available (around March or April 2013).

                         The PDO has two sub-objectives: (a) to increase access by eligible uninsured mothers and children to basic health services (measured by PDO Indicators 1 to 8), and; (b) to
                         strengthen the incentive framework for efficiency and focus on results (measured by PDO Indicators 9 to 11). Performance for the second of these sub-objectives has been very
                         good, since all 3 PDO indicators for this sub-objective have been fully achieved, and substantially surpassed. Performance for the first of these sub-objectives has been at a lower
                         level, since out of the 8 indicators for this sub-objective, four have been fully achieved (with two out of these substantially surpassing the targets) while a fifth has been partially
                         achieved. However, as mentioned above, two more indicators have a high chance of being partially achieved by project close.

                         In addition, out of the ten intermediate outcome indicators, seven have been fully achieved, and the targets have been substantially surpassed in six out of these seven indicators. In
                         addition, an eighth indicator (project disbursement rate) is almost at the level of full achievement (100%), with the disbursement rate now being 98%. Out of the two remaining
                         indicators, both have been partially achieved to date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         This is the last Implementation Status and Results report (ISR) for this project, which is closing on December 31, 2012. Subsequently, an Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
                         will be completed by the Bank, within six months after the closing date. The ICR will draw on a Government report on the project’s performance and implementation, that will also be
                         written by the Government after the project close. Both the Government report and ICR will report the findings from the last “cuatrimestre? of the project period (Sept-Dec 2012),
                         which will be available only after the project closes.
