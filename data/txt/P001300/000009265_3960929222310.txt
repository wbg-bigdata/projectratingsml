MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A SECOND NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
1.    The following report on a proposed development credit to Kenya for SDR 17.4
million (US$24.9 million equivalent) to help finance a Second Natior.1
Agricultural Extension Project is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. The Project would be
*       cofinanced by IFAD for US$6.0 million equivalent.
2.    Background.  Agriculture employs 70 percent of Kenya's work force, provides
most of the nation's food, serves as the main source of raw materials for the
industrial sector, and accounts for 66 percent of export earnings and roughly 30
percent of GDP. Rapid and sustainable growth in the agricultural sector is
essential to fulfill GOK's goals of food security, higher and more equitably
distributed rural incomes, and increased export revenues. Given the limited
availability of arable land and the country's high population growth rate, future
agricultural growth has to come from intensification of smallholder production
and diversification into high value crops. Although smallholders in Kenya
produce 75 percent of total agricultural output and 47 percent of marketed
agricultural output, they have limited access to agricultural information, new
technologies, credit, inputs, and agricultural services. In recognition of these
constraints, GOK sought the assistance of the Bank in undertaking a policy reform
program (Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation I, ASAO I, Cr. 1717-KE), and
supporting it with investment projects in key agricultural services and export
promotion. In June 1983, an IDA credit of SDR 13.9 million was approved for a
first phase National Extension Project (NEP I; Cr. 1387-KE).
3.    The first phase project has been successful in extending new technologies
and farming practices, such as row planting, inter-cropping of maize with beans,
fodder cultivation and improved pest and disease control, to smallholder farnm-s.
Since the introduction of the extension system under NEP I, farmers are
maintaining better plant populations, obtaining higher coffee yields, and
starting to stall-feed grade cattle. Soil and water conservation pcactices have
improved. Many women's groups are successfully engaged in poultry keeping and
raising horticultural and other crops.  However, several areas need further
improvement, including: cooperation between the Ministries of Agriculture (MOA),
Livestock Development (MOLD) and Environment and Natural Resources for an
effective extension system carrying messages on crops, animal husbandry and farm
forestry; linkages between the research, extension and educational systems for
better analysis of on-farm issues and development of technical packages; and
tighter supervision of finances and operations.
4.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's continued involvement in the second
phase of agricu__ural extension in Kenya is necessary to strengthen the
management, expand the reach, and introduce innovations into the system. IDA's
current agricultural operations in Kenya are grouped around the proposed second
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation (ASAO II). In order to engender the
strongest possible production response from farmers to the improved incentive
structure created by this central policy based credit, and related credits in
infrastructure, marketing, and the environment, IDA is committed to supporting
vital agricultural services in research, extension, and animal health. The
proposed Project is an important element in IDA's country assistance strategy; it
serves as one of the primary lending vehicles for stimulating productivity in the
smallholder sector, and promoting the growth and equitable distribution of
incomes. IDA's support for the proposed Project at this time is especially



important. It synchronizes with the implementation of the National Agricultural
Research Project (KARP; Cr. 1849-KE), which seeks to generate technologies that
contribute to increased smallholder productivity; the proposed Project expedites
translation of research results into technical packages that farmers can readily
adopt. It is timed to start soon after the first phase project ends. Several
multilateral and bilateral donors are supporting agricultural extension
activities on a small scal_, and GOK looks to IDA for leadership in donor support
for extension.  IDA is able to fulfill this role since it has a comparative
advantage in the type of institutional development work required for the
successful implementation of a national system of agricultural extension.
5.    Project Objective.  The objective of the proposed Project is to increase
the rate of adoption and stimulate the development of technical packages that
will enable smallholder farmers to increase their productivity and incomes. To
fulfill this objective, the proposed project would: (a) consolidate and fortify
managerial gains made under the first phase project by (i) operating an inter-
ministerial frontline extension service; (ii) rationalizing the deployment of
frontline staff; (iii) strengthening supervision, monitoring and evaluation;
(iv) providing logistical support; and (v) undertaking a number of impact
assessment studies to measure the effectiveness of extension services; (b)
increase direct contact with farmers through ti) expansion into six new
administrative areas, and natural resource conservation prototypes in two arid
and semi-arid lands (ASAL) areas; (ii) greater staff mobility; (iii) improved and
extensive use of mass media; (iv) emphasis on working with groups and farmers
cooperatives; and (v) quarterly workshops for women's group representatives; (c)
improve the relevance of technologies and information for farmers by (i)
establishing a farming systems approach; (ii) working with research to
disseminate and further develop technologies suited to local resource
availability and agro-ecological conditions; and (iii) addressing issues of
direct interest to women; (d) upgrade agricultural skills of staff and farmers by
(i) holding regular training sessions for staff; (ii) providing short residential
courses at Farmer Training Centers (FTCs); (iii) improving the curricula at
agricultural educational institutions; and (iv) providing funds for short term
and degree training in agricultural subjects, both domestically and
internationally; and (e) introduce innovations into the extension system on a
pilot basis that will make it more efficient and cost effective, such as (i) cost
recovery for commodity based extension; (ii) an information system between
researchers, extension agents and farmers on a pilot basis; and (iii)
establishment of two Farmer Service Centers (FSCs) that, for the first time,
provide a variety of agricultural services under one roof.
6.    Project Description.  The proposed Project would include investments over a
seven year period to strengthen the major components of an extension service:
extension management; extension methodology; staff training; and research.
Specifically, in organization and management of extension services the proposed
Project would fund: (i) investments and operational support required to
strengthen the existing extension service and expand it to six new administrative
areas; (ii) investments required to develop two prototype projects in ASAL areas;
(iii) transportation equipment to increase staff mobility and access to farmers'
groups, and improve supervision; (iv) buildings for use as offices and training
venues; (v) office, field and training equipment to improve staff efficiency;
(vi) a computerized monitoring system on a pilot basis; and (vii) technical
assistance and consultant studies. In the area of extension methodology the
proposed Project would f.ad: (i) the production of radio and TV programs,
community media and publicity campaigns; (ii) the rehabilitation of FTCs; and



- 3 -
(iii) the development of two FSCs o' a pilot basis. In the area of staff
training, the proposed Project v' a,A.d support (i) a comprehensive review of the
curricula and operations of agricultural educational institutions; (ii) short
courses to retrain staff in crop and livestock production; (iii! short courses,
as well as degree training to upgrade staff skills; (iv) regular bi-weekly and
monthly training sessions; and (v) orientation courses for staff in the new
administrative areas. To strengthen collaboration with research, the proposed
Project would supplement NARP by providing funding for transportation and
equipment necessary for research staff to participate in training sessions,
demonstrations, and on-farm trials. The total cost of the project net of taxes
and duties is estimated at US$38.6 million, with a foreign exchange component of
US$18.0 million.  A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Kenya are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9051-KE, dated
November 20, 1990, is attached.  A map is also attached.
7.    Agreed actions.  (a) GOK has agreed to establish an interministerial
Steering Committee to guide overall Project implementation, with the assistance
of a Working Group reporting to the Steering Committee, and composed of
representatives of MOA, MOLD and KARI.  ;  At present there are multiple
extension systems operating at the frontline level. MOA and HOLD have now
entered into a cooperative agreement to reduce unnecessary duplication in
operations. During negotiations agreement was reached on (i) the schedule and
methods for implementing this arrangement throughout the area covered by the
extension service, and (ii) the role of the Working Group in overseeing such
implementation. (c) GOK agreed to prepare a framework for the management and
financing of FTCs within the overall extension system. Three PTCs would then be
rehabilitated during the first three years of project implementation according to
site surveys and business plans approved by IDA. Rehabilitation of further FTCs
would depend on a favorable outcome of FTC performance at the midterm review.
(d) To allow the flexibility to make selective adjustments in operations, the
Government agreed to prepare and submit for IDA approval the necessary annual
work plans and semi-annual progress reports, and to carry out a midterm review
and a series of impact assessment studies. GOK also agreed to assign sufficient
staff to MOA's and MOLD's central monitoring units to focus on monitoring
extension, and to test a computerized monitoring system on a pilot basis. (e)
The first phase project experienced financial difficulties. To correct the
imbalance between recurrent and development expenditures, the project would
incorporate: norms developed under the proposed ASAO II for improving the balance
between salary and non-salary operating expenditures; staff deployment and
organization studies of MOA and MOLD to improve efficiency; a mechanism to review
cost containment measures as part of the annual work program; and cost recovery
measures for commodity based extension. (f) Donor coordination was weak in the
first phase project. To ensure that donors work together towards fulfilling the
Government's goals, agreement was reached during negotiations that MOA and MOLD
would jointly host regular donor coordination meetings. Other assurances were
obtained at negotiations concerning the testing of an information system, and
prototype projects In ASAL areas. Conditions of Credit Effectiveness ares (a)
satisfactory implementation of the cooperative agreement between MOA and MOLD,
acceptable to IDA, on a pilot basis in two districts; (b) that the Forward Budget
reflect the budgetary requirements of the Project; (c) preparation of a
satisfactory annual work program for the first year; and (d) the submission to
the Bank of audited accounts for the first phase project.

8.    Benefits.  The proposed project focusses on creating a strong and dynamic
agricultural extension system which effectively delivers technical messages
particularly tailored to farmers' needs and aimed at increasing yield levels for
both staple food and export crops. The Project would thereby raise rural incomes
and employment and contribute towards the national objectives of self-sufficiency
in staple foods and increased export earnings from the agricultural sector. The
Project addresses the needs of Kenya's large population of women farmers by
increasing contact with women's groups, integrating home economics staff and
messages into the extension frontline, using mass media to reach women directly,
and encouraging the development of appropriate technology. Through the
dissemination of new technologies on fertilizer and plant protection, the Project
would contribute to the development of farming practices which protect agro-
ecological systems.
9.    Risks.  The risk of a breakdown in cooperation between MOA and MOLD would
be reduced through the establishment of a Steering Committee and Working Group,
and binding annual work plans agreed with the Bank. The risk of failing to
translate rebearch findings into appropriate technology would be reduced by
institutionalizing research-extension linkages; MOA and MOLD have already signed
Memoranda of Understanding with the Renya Agricultural Research Institute
detailing their respective responsibilities. Serious constraints to supervision
and operations caused by lack of mobility would be addressed through the
provision of appropriate transportation equipment. Expenditure imbalances would
be adjusted through adherence to norms and procedures established for their
review. Progress under the Project would be monitored through improved
monitoring and evaluation of extension services, a better impact assessment
system, and a midterm review.
10.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
