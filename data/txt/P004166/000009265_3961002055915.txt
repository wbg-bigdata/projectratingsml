KOREA
PUBLIC HOSPITAL MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Loan and Prolect Summary
Borrower:            Republic of Korea
Beneficiaries:       National Medical Center (NMC), National Institute of
Health (NIH), and selected municipal and provincial
hospitals
Amount:              US$30.0 million equivalent
Terms:               Repayable in 15 years including 5 years of grace at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Relendina Terms:     The Government would on-lend the proceeds of the loan to
beneficiaries at the same interest rate (plus 0.05%
p.a.), maturity and grace periods as the IBRD loan
agreement. Sub-borrowers would bear foreign exchange
risk.
Proiect
DescriDtion:         The project would:  (a) increase the access of the rural
and urban poor to medical care services, especially for
noncommunical diseases (NCD); (b) improve the quality of
medical care in public hospitals; (c) assist the country
in protecting the public health through a more effective
control of the safety of drugs and the quality of food,
and through monitoring communicable diseases; and (d)
provide project-related training, and carry out a health
care policy based action program and research studies.
Four project components support these objectives: (i)
expanding diagnostic and treatment capabilities of the
NMC; (ii) upgrading equipment of NIH; (iii) replacing and
adding medical equipment in provincial and municipal
hospitals; and (iv) an action program addressing critical
sector issues (hospital efficiency, diffusion of medical
technology, fee schedule) supported by relevant research
studies, publications on health policy and financing, and
a national concensus building program.
Benefits & Risks:    As a result of tne project, about half of the public
hospitals in Korea serving mainly the poorer population
groups will have upgraded and modernized their biomedical
equipment. This will allow them to detect and treat
noncommunicable diseases more effectively and give the
smaller and more rural facilities the capability to treat
more patients themselves and thus decrease the flow of
referrals to higher level hospitals. The National
Medical Center will have upgraded its biomedical



- iv -
equipment for early detection and opportune treatment of
noncommunicable diseases. To. strengthened technical
capability of the National Instituts of Health will
improve its efficiency in monitoring food safety. drug
quality and communicable diseases in order to better
protect the people's health. An action program on health
sector financing alternatives and cost containment
measures will have facilitated making policy decisions to
contain health care expenditures without jeopardizing
access to services and quality of medical care.
There are no major risks in this project. A minor risk
might be dofaulting by project institutions. However,
the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the ongoing
Health Technology Project is operating in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank and it is expected that the PIU
for the proposed p:oject will also perform satisfactorily
and closely monitor loan repayments. The experience with
on-lending under the population project was also positive
and there were no arrears. The risk of slippage in
implementing the Action Program and the research studies
would be addressed through semi-annual supervision
missions to maintain the policy dialogue.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. Population. Health and Nutrition Status
1.1       Population Status.  Korea's 1990 population is estimated at 42.8
million, of which 72 percent live in urban areas. Population density is 431
persons per square kilometer, which makes it among the world'a most densely
populated countries. The crude birth rate and crude death rates were,
respectively, 16.4 and 5.8 per 1,000 population, giving a natural population
increase of one percent. Urbanization, industrialization and a successful
family pla.-aang program have had a major demographic impact. Age structure by
the three main age groups is as follows: 0-14 years: 25.9 percent; 15-64
years: 69.4 percent; 65 and over: 4.7 percent. The dependency ratio
therefore is 44 percent.
1.2       The total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.6 children per woman in
reproductive age in 1990, which is below the replacement level of 2.05.
Government policy aims at a zero percent population increase by 2020 at which
time the population would have stabilized at about 50 million. This goal is
clearly within reach. Widespread usae of modern contraceptive methods and
increase in the age at marriage account for the low fertility rate. The
contraceptive prevalence rate is over 70 percent and the most popular family
planning method in 1989 was IUD's (40 percent) followed by sterilization (31
percent), condoms (24 percent) and oral pills (5 percent).
1.3       Health Status.  Conventional health indicators shcw that the healta
status of Koreans has in nved greatly in recent years. Life expectancy
increased from about 55 r_.rs in 1965 to about 67 years in 1990 for males and
from 58 years to 75 years for women. The national average life expectancy at
birth is 71 years. The 1990 infant mortality rate of 11 deaths per 1,000 live
births compares favorably with most developed countries. The 1989 maternal
mortality rate is 30 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is low compared to
other developing countries but still three to four times higher than the
average for developed countries. Immunization rate is a high 95 percent, and
85 percent of babies are delivered in a hospital setting. These advances
result from improvements in education, nutrition, public health services,
housing and personal incomes. By the end of August 1991, 157 persons were
identified as HI'J seropositive of which 13 developed AIDS.
1.4       The incidence of communicable dineases has diminished sharply and
many have been controlled (smallpox, polio, cholera, diphtheria, rabies,
malaria). Korea has had successful communicable disease prevention programs
through investments in water supply and sewage disposal systems, low-income



-2-
housing, aggressive public health measures, and health promotion and
protection programs.
1.5      Rapid growth of the Korean economy -- accompanied by industrial4za-
tion and urbanization -- has changed life styles and affected the health
status of Koreans. Thte mortality profile and the disease burden have shifted
over the last 30 years from a typical developing country's profile of high
fertility/high mortality and prevalence of infectious as.d parasitic diseases,
to a developed country profile of noncommunlcable chronic and degenerative
diaeases, and a rapidly increasing incidence of diseases resulting from social
and environmental factors.  Personal behavior, food, and ths nr>-^. of the
environment have become the prime determinants of health and d&._; se in Korea
as in all developed countries.

1.6      The principal causes of death in the 1980s were cancer, heart
disease and stroke. accidents and violence, which together accounted for six
deaths out of ten in 1988 (Table 1.1). During the period 1981-88 death rates
for cancer and for accidents and violence increased consistently, but the
death rate for heart disease and stroke has started to decline, a trend which
is consistent with experiences of most industrialized nations. The prevalence
of these conditions and therefore the disease burden caused by them has
increased dramatically (Table 1.2). Cancer rates per 1,000 population
increased eightfold between 1980 and 1989, and the rates for heart disease and
stroke, and for accidents and violence increased ninefold during the same
period. The number of deaths from traffic accidents increased fourfold
between 1970 and 1988 or an average 16% per year, whereas they decreased in
most industrialized countries. The number of motorvehicle deaths per million
population for Korea was 2.75 in 1987 compared with 0.77 for Japan. The
number of deaths was 57 per 10,000 vehicles or thirty times higher than
Japan's 1.9.

1.7       Nutrition Status.  The nutrition status of the Koreans is generally
satisfactory. The average daily caloric intake per capita in 1988 was 1,935
which is slightly below the 2,132 figure recommended by FAO as the per capita
energy requirement for Koreans. A national nutrition survey "arried out in
1989 with a sample of 2,000 households still indicated some small disparity
between urban and rural areas. One study documented an increase in obesity
which is a different type of malnutrition. MOHSA encourages breastfeeding as
part of its health education programs and with the support of WHO has
organized seminars to promote breastfeeding practice.
B. The Health Care System
1.8       The basic structure of the Korean health care system reflects the
influence of the Japanese system, which in turn was inspired by the German
social insurance model. After the Second World War. Korea adopted features of
the United States private health care sy4tem. The Ministry of Health and
Social AAf'airs (MOHSA) has formal responsibility for policy making and
admini.ttation of the health system. The Economic Planning Board (EPB) has
importanit powers in overall planning and resource allocation and therefore
directly affects health policy decisions. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
has juriadiction ove . city, county and provincial governments and is
responsible for executing MOHSA policies.
1.9       The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA).  MOHSA is
responsible for broad health policy coordination (see Organizational Chart,
Annex 1). Its programmatic responsibility is mainly for the maintenance and
promotion of traditional public health activities such as the control of food
and water quality. and of safety of pharmaceuticals; immunization, family
planning and MCR programs; epidemiological surveillance, health education and

disease control; management of MCH centers, health subcenters and primary
health care posts; and for the administration of the social welfare and
national pension eystem. Its share of the national general account budget was
4.7 percent in 1990 up from 2.7 percent in 1983 and 4.2 percent in 1989 (Table
1.3). The 1991 estimate is 5.1 percent. Social welfare expenditures absorbed
84 percent of its budget in 1990 versus 61.52 in 1983. The major factor
behind the increase in social welfare expenses is higher medical insurance
payments which went from 12.52 of MOHSA's budget in 1983 to 38.72 in 1990.

The Private Sector
1.10        Korea has a large and strong private sector.  Provision of
personal health services is mainly in the domain of the private sector with
concentration in urban areas. Private clinics and hospitals account for 95
percent of all medical facilities, employ 72 percent of physicians and 55
percent of nurses, and manage 80 percent of hospital beds. Private medical
schools account for more than 71 percent of medical schools and 60 percent of
the dental schools. Traditional oriental medical schools are operated by the
private sector. However, private sector activities are concentrated in urban
areas, creating a maldistribution of resources between the urban population
and the people living in agricultural and fisheries areas. Almost 90 percent
of the hospital "eds are in urban areas and 86 percent of the physiciane
practice there.
1.11      The government has taken steps to correct the skewed urban/rural
distribution of personnel and facilities and to etrengthen rural medical care.
Between 1978 and 1985, 67 rural hospitals with a total of 6,580 beds were able
to borrow from external sources (OECF) at lower than market interest rates.
Medical school and dental school graduates can choose to work as "public
health doctors" in "doctorless" areas instead of doing their military service.



-5-
The Public Sector
1.12      The public sector's main responsibility is to perform the
traditional preventive public health functions in order to protect the health
of the people. Several national institutes assiot it in performing these
duties and among them are the National Institute of Health and the National
Institute of Safety Research. Government also has a residual responsibility
for curative care activities especially for the inhabitants of rural and
isolated areas and for people on public assistance in urban and rural areas.
It operates 260 health centers, 1,318 health subcenters and 2,038 primary
health care posts. About half of the staff of health centers and subcenters
are "public health doctors". Primary health care posts cover communities of
less than 500 residents and are staffed by community health practitioners
(CHP) supervised by health center/subeenter doctors. The CHP's are qualified
nurses or midwives and the government and the cornunity each pay half of their
salary.
1.13      Public Hospitals.  Public hospitals were established by the King in
19i0 to provide medical care to low-income persons. In 1982, 34 of these
facilities were given more autonomy and were allowed to function as
independent organizations supervised by their respective municipalities or
provinces (Annax 2). The law authorized each hospital to charge for services
provided in order to cover its operating expenses. In the first years of
financial independence, the income of these hospitals had to be supplemented
by their public owners. With the gradual extension of universal health
insurance, most subsidies have been removed and income is derived from patient
chargea; 28 of the 34 hospitals have reached financial self-sufficiency for
recurrent expenses   Seven hospitals are located in rural areas with low
population density and still receive government subsidies for equity reasons.
Capital expenditures for remodeling and expansion of services and facilities
come from the budgets of MOHSA for national hospitals and the Ministry of Home
Affairs for municipal and provincial facilities.
1.14      Only about 10 percent of Korea's hospitals are in the public sector:
one national medi..-al center (735 beds), three national mental hospitals (1,950
beds) and two more under construction for an additional 600 beds, three
national tuberculosis hospitals (1,170 beds), and 34 municipal/provincial
hospitals. Among the latter, four are located in large cities (Seoul, Pusan,
Taegu, Inchon), 23 in medium-size cities, and 7 in farming and fish-ries
areas. Nine of the 34 facilities have more than 200 beds, nine have between
100 and 200 beds, and 16 have less than 100 beds. The municipal and
provincial hospitals have 5,135 beds or about 4 percent of the total number of
hospital beds in Korea.
1.15      Average occupancy of the 34 public hospitals was a high 92 percent
in 1989 and the average length of stay was 7 - 8 days or about half the
national average. Their historical mission was to serve the poor and their
client population is still mainly the poor. Less than 10 percent of the
Korean population receives medical care under the Medicaid and the public
assistance program, but 41 percent of the inpatients and 25 percent of the
outpatient visits in these public hospitals were classified under these
welfare programs in 1989.
1.16      Of the 34 public hospitals 33 created a national Association of
Municipal and Provincial Medical Institutes (AMPMI) in 1987 which is
recognized by the Ministry of Home Affairs. AMPMI is autonomous and its
budget comes from fees paid by the member hospitals. Its mandate is to



represent the interests of its members. Its staff of seven organizes training
seminars, manages a pension fund for the employees of the member hospitals.
promotes good working conditions and handles labor relations, organizes group
purchasing and collects statistical information on their members.
1.17      The National Medical Center (NMC).  NMC is a 735-bed refevral and
teaching hospital located in Seoul. It is the only national public acute care
hospital. A 1953 agreement between the government of Korea and three
Scandinavian countries led to the opening of a 382 bed facility in 1958. Ten
years later the government assumed full responsibility for NMC, expanded it to
604 beds and then again to its rresent capacity of 735 beds in 1990.
Organizationally it is part of MOHSA and reports to the Director General of
Medical Affairs (Annex 1).  NMC has three functionst patient care, teaching
and research. As a referral hospital it receives about 70 percent of its
patients from the metropolitan area of Seoul and the balance from the rest of
the country. Its bed occupancy in 1990 was 93 percent and it attended to
about 900 outpatients per day including 60 to 80 emergency cases. Total
number of employees in 1991 is 1,080 or about 1.5 staff per bed, which is a
low ratio given the heavy outpatient load.
1.18      As a teaching and training institution, NMC receives medical interns
from three universities (Seoul National, Yonsei, and Korea). Medical
residents doing their apprenticeship to become specialists are part of the
house staff. It also has a school of nursing with a student capacity of 120
and eight full-time faculty. Until 1990 all nursing students were national
scholarship holders but as the supply of nurses has become satisfactory, most
students now must pay tuition and fees. Its research budget is quite modest
-t less than one million US$ per year.
1.19      NNC's 1990 budget was US$35 million and its 1991 budget is US$43
million. About 80 percent of its income is derived from patient charges with
the balance from the MOHSA budget. All hospital revenue goes to the national
treasury and NMC operates on a prospectively MOHSA approved budget. Four
fifths of its budget deficit is caused by the provision of uncompensated care
to the very poor and the remainder from unanticipated salary increases, or the
startup expenses of new clinical programs (e.g. harelip surgery, cancer
registry). Capital expenses are paid by the government but restrictive
funding in recent years has pushed NMC to lease some major items of biomedical
equipment and lease payments are operating expenses. Even so, NMC lacks up to
date biomedical equipment especially for diagnosis and treatment of
noncommunicable diseases (cancer, heert disease, diabetes). Over 70 percent
of its medical equipment is more than 20 years old.
1.20      The National Institute of Health.  The Korea National Institute of
Health (NIH) was established in 1963 by merging four research institute3 and
laboratories into one institution. Its functions are: (a) epidemiological
survsy and research on communicable diseases; (b) research and production cE
vaccines and diatnostic antigens; (c) establishing standards and research on
food and food additiveis; (d) establishing standards and quality control of
drugs; (e) standardization of radiation dosimetry, radiation protection, and
inspection of radiological equipment; (f) in-service training for public
health workers; and (g) administering national qualifying examinations for
health personnel. A branch of NIH was established in the Southern city of
Masan mainly to store drugs, vaccines, and antigens for use in national
emergency situations. Annex I contains the organizational chart of NIH.
Detailed functions of its seven departments are described in Annex 3.



7-
1.21      The Korea National Institute of Health is part of MOHSA and reports
to the Director General of the Public Health Bureau (Annex 1). The Director
General of NIH is appointed by the Minister of MOHSA and the Institute
receives its budget from MOHSA. Its 1990 budget was US$15 million and the
1991 assigned budget vas US$18 million. The Institute does not have other
sources of income. Its ability to carry out its quality control and research
functions effectively and efficiently is being hampered by a lack of
appropriate equipment. Much of its equipment is outdated, with 40 percent of
it over 10 years old, frequently out of service, and slower, less accurate and
less sensitive than newer more technologically advanced equipment.
1.22      The National Institute of Safety Research.  Founded in 1988, the
National Institute of Safety Research (NISR) is the nation's leading safety
research center doing research, demonstration and evaluation studies on the
safety and efficacy of existing and new chemical substances, including drugs,
and of new materials. NISR grew out of the former Department of Drug and Food
Safety Research established in 1981 in MOHSA to study the efficacy and safety
of drugs, cosmetics, food additives, medical instruments, pesticide residues,
and other chemical substances. It is now an independent institute formally
reporting to the Director General of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau in
MOHSA. It is divided into the department of toxicity and the department of
pharmacology and pathology. Research projects are commissioned by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Ministry of the
Environment, MOHSA, and the private sector. NISR collects and analyzes
information on the effects of pharmaceuticals and practices toxico-
pharmacology tests on pharmaceuticals and food additives. It has established
an information system on toxic materials and other chemical substances
hazardous to the people's health.
1.23      Institute of Environmental Research.  This institute is part of the
Ministry of the Environment with its own scientific and technical capability.
It plays an important role in protecting the health of the people through
research, demonstration, and evaluation studies on water, air and noise
pollution and other environmental hazards that may negatively affect the
public's health.
The Social Security System.
1.24      Korea's social security system has three components: (a) social
insurance (medical insurance, pensions, industrial accident compensation); (b)
public assistance (subsistence aid, medical aid, disaster relief); and (c)
social welfare services for the physically handicapped, eldcrly, wouen,
children and the mentally incapacitated.
1.25      The Medical Insurance Slstem.  After a twelve year gradual
expansion, participation in Korea's medical insurance system became mandatory
for all citizens on July 1, 1989. The system operates largely through non-
profit medical insurance societies of three types: (a) the Industrial
Establishment Medical Insurance societies (154 societies with 372 of the
population) covering employees of industrial companies with five or more
workers; (b) the 266 Regional Medical Insurance societies (with 13 million
urban and 6.2 million rural residents or 442 of the population) covering the
self-employed farmers and pensioners; and (c) the Korea Medical Insurance
Corporation with 4.6 million members or about 102 of the population which
covers government and private school employees. The 420 societies and the
corporation are members of the National Federation of Medical Insurance (NFMI)
organized as a special public corporation financed by membership fees and fees



- 8 -
for reviewing and processing claims. The insurance societies are similar to
the sick funds in several Western European countries and in Japan, and perform
four functions: (a) review the qualifications of the insured and dependents;
(b) collect contributionsl (c) pay the provider for services rendered to the
insured; and (d) designate medical institutions for the care of the insured.
The la'ge number and small size of medical insurance societies is inefficient
and lacks the cost saving potential and bargaining strength of a more unified
system.
1.26      Medical insurance is financed by contributions from the insured and
the employer and by government subsidy. Contributions to the Industrial
Establishment Medical Insurance societies are shared equally by employer and
employee and the rates are determined through a collective bargaining process
within a range of 3 percent to 8 percent of the insured's income. The
Government pays 50 percent of the cost of the Regional Medical Insurance
societies, 50 percent of the insurance for civil servants as employer, 20
percent of the contribution of private school employees, and most or all of
the contribution for the poor on public assistaxice. The insured pays part of
the cost of services received, i.e., 20 percent of inpatient services, up to
55 percent of the cost of outpatient visits, 30 percent of prescription drugs,
and 60 percent of non-prescription drugs.
1.27      Public Assistance.  The medical insurance societies do not include
medical assistance for low-income families, which is part of government paid
public assistance and covers 3.9 million people or about 9 percent of the
population. They are grouped by degree of medical indigence into three
classes. The poorest (1.6Z) receive free care, and the cther two less poor
groups pay part of the cost of their care.
C. Health Care Resources and Utilization
1.28      Hospital Beds.  The number of hospital beds has about doubled
between 1980 and 1989 and has reached a satisfactory ratio of 3.0 beds per
1,000 population (Annex 4). About half of these beds are in general acute
multi-specialty hospitals, about 25 percent are in community hospitals of
lesser clinical scope, and another 25 percent are in clinics with fewer than
20 beds. Urban areas have 86 percent of the hospital beds and the
bed/population ratio per 1,000 is 3.4 versus 1.3 in rural areas. Not-for-
profit hospitals have about 60 percent of the beds and their average hospital
size is 240 beds. For-profit hospitals have about 22 percent of the beds and
are smaller with an average bed capacity of 69. Public sector hospitals are
fewer in number and some are specialty hospitals (tuberculosis, leprosy,
mental) with an average size of 300 beds. (See also paras. 1.13-1.16 on
public hospitals). The strongest growth in hospital beds occurred in the
first half of the decade (Annex 4) but has slowed considerably (e.g., a 5
percent growth in 1989 versus a 21 percent growth in 1983). The national
hospital occupancy rate in 1989 for all hospitals was a satisfactory 78.82
(urban: 82.42 and rural: 772), and the average length of stay was a high 14
days (urban: 13 and rural: 23). Hospital admissions in 1990 were 62 per 1,000
population (up from 46/1,000 in 1989) and the number of outpatient visits per
person per year was 3.2. These two figures are about half the corresponding
figures for developed countries but in line with middle-income country
utilization rates.
1.29      Medical Technologies.  In Korea there is widespread and increasing
demand by health professionals and patients for greater technological sophis-
tication in the provision of medical care, driven by an increase in noncommu-



- 9 -
nicable diseases and by the universalization of health insurance. Comparative
data are not readily available for all types of technologies but limited
information shows that Korea has ten times fewer CT scanners per million
people than Japan, five times fewer MRI's (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and
four times fewer linear accelerators. In the process of expanding medical
technology. Korea needs to address several problems. First, the uncontrolled
introduction and diffusion of medical technologies could drive up aggregate
costs to an unaffordably high level. Second, geographic maldistribution could
lead to inequitable access to available equipment. Finally, additional
inequity could result from the cost for some procedures not being eligible for
reimbursement under national health insurance and, therefore, only people able
to pay would have access.
1.30      Health Manpower.  With 31 medical schools (and four more in the
planning stage) Korea has one of the world's highest medical school/population
ratios. The total number of physicians increased about 77 percent between
1980 and 1989. going from a ratio of 1,493 people per physician to a ratio of
938 (Annex 5), which is about double the ratio of developed countries. The
last three years the annual percentage increase in physicians has plateaued at
about eight percent. The most striking feature of the physician manpower
market is the geographic maldistribution of physicians. Seoul has 24 percent
of the population but 42 percent of the physicians. Rural areas have 28
percent of the population but only 14 percent of the physicians. The most
striking aspect of the shifting physician marketplace is the growing supply of
physician specialists. The percentage of physicians that are specialists rose
from 32 percent in 1980 to 48 percent in 1989. The increasing proportion and
number of specialists may create inflationary supplier-induced demand, and
especially procedure-based demand, above what can be justified medically.
1.31      Between 1980 and 1989 the number of dentists more than doubled and
the ratio increased from one dentist for 10.500 people to one for 4.900
(Annex 6). The annual percent increases are accelerating going from a 9
percent yearly increase in 1981 to a 13 percent increase in 1989.
1.32      The nurse population has expanded at an annual rate of about 8-9
percent and the ratio of population per nurse was almost halved between 1980
and 1989, going from one nurse per 937 persons to an acceptable ratio of one
nurse per 506 persons (Annex 7). The number of specialized nurses represents
only about one percent of all nurses, but their number is increasing at a much
faster rate than that of general nurses, indicating a slowly increasing supply
of public health nurses, mental health nurses, anesthetists, and visiting
nurses. There were also 128,867 nursing aides or one per 330 persons.
Combining the two categories of nursing gives a high ratio of one nursing
personnel per 200 people.
1.33      Impact on Health Care Costs.  The increase in availability of
hospital beds and a growing supply of physicians that are both paid for their
services by a national insurance scheme are the major ingredients for rapid
cost escalation (see next paragraph). Lack of regulations and the absence or
non-enforcement of macro level cost containment measures fail to stem the cost
inflation. Policymakera face critical questions on how to control costs,
promote economic efficiency (output per billion Won invested), promote
technical efficiency (output per employee or productivity), enhance quality
and effectiveness (minimize unnecessary and inappropriate care), and ensure
the equitable distribution of resources.

D. Health Care Exgenditures and Financing of Services
1.34      The Korean health economy is riding the tide of a cost explosion.
Health care spending as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product has expanded
from 2.8 percent in 1975. to 5.2 percent in 1985. to 6.6 percent in 1989, and
an estimated 7.3 percent in 1990. This percentage puts Korea at the high end
of the range for developing countries and at the level of most developed
countries. The 1990 GDP is estimated at US$234 billion and health care
expenditures in 1990 would then be about US$400 per capita or one third of
Japan's and one sixth of the US per capita expenditures for health care.
1.35      Sources of Funds.  Direct patient payments have declined from 80
percent of health care expenditures in 1980 to 51 percent in 1990. The
expansion of national health insurance benefits may reduce patient payments to
49 percent of expenditures by 1992, but this figure is still much higher than
any of the OECD countries because of the high rate of cost sharing in Korea.
Cost sharing is achieved through deductibles and co-payments, e.g., co-payment
rates for inpatient hospital care are 20 percent and for outpatient services
the rates range from 30 to 55 percent depending on the place of service. The
co-payment rates for drugs are 30 percent for prescription drugs and 60
percent for non-prescription drugs.
1.36      National and local tax revenues financed 24 percent of the US$17.1
billion health care expenditures in 1989 as compared to 11.5 percent in 1985.
The Korean Government pays half the premium and all the administrative expense
of the Regional Medical Insurance program which covers 44 percent of the
population (farmers, fishermen, self-employed, and pensioners). The
Government provides facilities and 3,250 "public health doctors" (medical/
school graduates serving in lieu of military service) for health care services
in rural areas. The Government as employer also pays 50 percent of the
insurance premium for civil servants and their dependents, and pays 20 percent
of the premium for private school teachers and staff.
1.37      Private insurance premiums are estimated to account for 13 percent
of sector financing, up from 4.5 percent in 1985. Adding industrial accident
insurance, the total of third-party payments is 17 percent. Other non-
specific and non-identified sources classified under miscellaneous account for
the remaining 8 percent of sector financing.
1.38      Uses of Funds.  Three major expenditure categories accounted for 89
percent of total health sector spending: drugs, herbs and injections
represent 36 percent, hospital charges equal 29 percent, and medical fees
represent 24 percent. The miscellaneous category that makes up the remaining
11 percent includes construction, research funds and other non-specified
expenses. Private sector spending is estimated to be 76 percent of total
apending, down from 88 percent in 1985 and 91 percent in 1980.
1.39      Causes of Cost Escalation.  The rapid increase in health care
expenditures and their share of GDP (para 1.34) are a combination of four
underlying causes: demand factors, supply factors, inappropriate financial
incentives, and administrative inefficiency.
1.40      More money has become available in the 1980s and has fueled demand
for medical care. This money has come from two sources: health insurance and
rising personal incomes. Health insurance changes patient behavior and
consumers tend to consume more services as the effective "out-of-pocket" price
is lower. Providers at the same time tend to induce demand and order more



- 11 -
services for their patients because it is in their financial interest to
hospitalize patients, to order more tests, and to prescribe and sell more
drugs.
1.41      The supslv of all factors of production has increased sharply in the
1980s as witnessed by the number of beds 'para. 1.24), the number of physi-
cians and specialists (para 1.26), and the diffusion of medical technologies
(para 1.25). Utilization of this installed and growing productive capacity is
expected to increase in the 1990s and will push up health care expenditures.
1.42      Hospitals and physicians are paid on a fee-for-service basis
according to a national fee schedule adjusted annually (para. 1.35). Retro-
spective reimbursement based on fixed fees controls the price of the service
but provides financial incentives to increase the volume of services in order
to increase revenue and profits. Effective cost containment seeks tc coatrol
both price and quantity of services.
1.43      The large number (408) and small size (between 30.000 and 200.000
members) of insurance societies cause inefficiency in the administration of
the national health insurance. Administrative expense of the Korean sickness
funds is on average over ten percent of operating expenses reaching as high as
22 percent. This is two to three times more than the cost of administering
national health programs in the U.K., Canada, Japan and the US but much less
than the average of 33.5 percent for commercial health insurance carriers in
the US.
1.44      Korea's universal health insurance coverage is a major social policy
accomplishment. The resulting cost explosion confronts the country with
difficult policy decisions. It must address the issues of managing the demand
and supply of medical care, correcting the financial incentives and reducing
administrative inefficiencies in order to reach the goal of making affordable
quality medical care accessible to all citizens.
E. Hossital Financing
1.45      Korean hospitals -- public or private -  are reimbursed according to
a relative value fee schedule adopted in 1976. The fees have been increased
yearly at approximately the rate of general inflation in the economy. New
fees are created for new items but items are only added slowly, especially for
high technology services, as utilization increases quickly as soon as the
service becomes reimbursable under t-e national insurance system. Inpatient
and outpatient services are reimbursed by a split system involving: (a) a
tiered fee schedule reimbursing for treatment activities; and (b) a flat fee
schedule for reimbursement for materials. The plus factor of the treatment
costs (1,720 items) includes labor time and is paid on a four-tiered system:
clinics (less than 20 beds) receive fee plus 7 percent; general community
hospitals receive fee plus 13 percent; multi-specialty hospitals receive fee
plus 20 percent; and the 25 large university hospitals receive fee plus 30
percent. Materials include 8,100 items reimbursed according to a flat fixed
fee schedule: 6,710 items are drugs or injections, other items are medical
supplies, and one item is a fixed diagnostic fee for a first medical visit.
1.46      A major financing difference between private and public hospitals is
that public hospitals do not receive the plus payment and are strictly
reimbursed according to the fee schedule. Similarly, the only patients for
whom no plus is paid are the poor and the medically indigent that are fully or
partially covered by a public assistance program. These patients receive



- 12 -
medical care services in public hospitals and clinics and in about half of the
private hospitals that have been certified by the government for that purpose.
Private hospitals however are not keen on serving patients for whom they are
not paid more than the fee schedule and consequently they do not seek their
patronage. This partly explains why a high percentage of the patient popula-
tion of public hospitals aro publicly assisted patients.
1.47     Urban private hospitals are often able to finance their capital
needs out of their own resources. Equipment, especially the "big ticket"
items, are either self-financed or leased. The assets of public hospitals
belong to the national, provincial or municipal government, and public
hospitals - although autonomous in their operations - cannot borrow from
commercial banks. The Government has in the past provided incentives on a
selective basis to rural areas and priority social programs. This has been
the case with an OECF loan to 67 private hospitals in medically underse;ved
rural and fisheries areas, an IBRD loan to ten hospitals for financing MCH
units, an ADB loan to a public national hospital, and a KFW loan to three
hospitals. Through the proposed project the Government would on-lend to
municipalities and provinces for modernizing their public hospitals.
F. Government Health Policies
1.48      The Government has made a number of policy decisions to make the
health sector more equitable and efficient. It has enacted legislation to
provide medical insurance coverage to the whole population as of July 1, 1989;
it has divided the country into eight large medical regions and 140 Service
Areas; it has created and defined a referral system to assure an orderly flow
of patients within and among these eight regions; and, most important, it has
expressed the political will and commitment to assure that in the 1990's
health care services of consistently good quality should be available,
affordable and accessible to the whole population (Annex 12). These policy
measures are in line with the Government's determination to develop Korea's
social sectors more quickly, and, in the case of the health sector, to respond
to increased medical demand resulting from the universalization of medical
insurance, rising incomes, technological innovations, an aging population
structure, and the shift in the epidemiological profile from communicable to
noncommunicable diseases (NCD). Government action has narrowed the
urban/rural resource maldistribution by giving medical school graduates the
option to work in rural areas in lieu of military service, and by investments
in the rural hospital and health center infrastructure to improve the diagnos-
tic and treatment capabilities of these lower level facilities.
1.49     Achieving the policy of universal health insurance coverage in July
1989 after a 12-year period of gradual expansion was a major accomplishment of
the country's social development policy. Insurance has been accepted as an
appropriate mechanism for achieving the social policy of access to affordable
health care for all citizens, and access to health care is legally guaranteed
irrespective of income and location. It was an important and necessary first
step. Policymakers are now faced with three policy issues: (a) eauity:
further redressing the regional imbalances, and ensuring financial access for
all; (ii) costs: containing escalating medical costs in an economic environ-
ment where hospitals with an increasing supply of beds and a growing supply of
physician specialists are guaranteed under national health insurance to be
reimbursed for services provided to an insured population demanding more
medical care; and (iii) aualitvt monitoring quality of medical care and the
medically justified use of medical resources in a financial environment where
incentives are conducive to provide more services even if they are not



- 13 -
necessary, appropriate or proven effective, to prescribe and sell more drugs,
to emphasize lucrative diagnostic procedures, to prolong hospital stays, and
to request numerous follow-up visits.
G. Bank's Role in the Korean Health Sector
1.50      The Bank has assisted the Korean health sector with a population
project (Ln. 1774-KO), a Health Technology Project (Ln. 3330-KO), and a health
sector report with special emphasis on health insurance (Report No. 7412-KO,
June 1989).
1.51      Population Proiect.  In December 1979 the Bank provided the Govern-
ment with a loan of US$30 million for a project expected to cost US$91.5
million to expand and further strengthen the family planning and maternal and
child health programs. In March 1986, the Bank's Board approved a two year
extension (Phase II) to use the undisbursed balance of the loan to on-lend
US$17.5 million to private, non-profit hospitals to establish "Comprehensive
Maternal and Child Health Centers". These hospitals were to serve as referral
points for the rural Maternal and Child Health Centers and to assist them in
upgrading their services. The loan was closed on December 31, 1987 and was
fully disbursed. The Project Completion Report (PCR) was published on October
3. 1989 (Report No. 8114). The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) was
issued June 29, 1990 (Report No. 8895). The conclusions of the PPAR regarding
relevant lessons deal with the population and family planning activities of
the project and not with Phase II. With reference to private hospitals, the
PPAR notes that Phase II of the project was justified and that its primary
value was the fact that it on-lent to private hospitals to permit them to
expand their operations and to acquire more sophisticated equipment.
1.52      The Health Technology Proiect, approved in May 1991, builds on the
experience of the second phase of the previous project by using on-lending to
address the capital needs of selected private hospitals requiring quality-
improving investments. By making MOHSA responsible for project implementation
and accountable for its performance to other ministries and to the Bank, the
project is intended to strengthen the institutional capacity of MOHSA.
1.53      The purpose of the sector report (1989) was to study the effects and
implications of health insurance on the health sector, and to suggest reforms
that would help Korea meet its health care objectives in a cost-effective and
equitable manner. The intention of the study was to provoke consideration of
a wide range of options in the organization and design of the insurance system
and in the regulations governing public and private investments in medical
manpower and facilities.
1.54      The proposed project would build on the experience under the two
previous projects but with an emphasis on modernizing the public hospitals
that are the major source of medical care for the poor. It would also carry
out an action program focusing on health care financing policies and cost
containment issues which would build on the sector analysis done by the Bank
in its 1989 report.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin
2.1       The Government included the project in its FY90 list of projects
suitable for external financing and formally asked the Bank for assistance in
December 1990. A Bank mission identified the project in December 1990 and a
Bank project preparation mission visited the country in March 1991. Most of
the preparation work was completed by the Government according to guidelines
formulated by the Bank. The project was preappraised in September 1991.
Project preparation was vell advanced and no appraisal mission was deemed
necessary.
B. Prolect Rationale. Objectives and Scope
2.2       This project would be the means for the Bank to assist public
hospitals serving the poor in modernizing their biomedical equipment for early
detection and opportune treatment of noncommunicable diseases, and support: the
Government's equity policy of making affordable quality medical care accessi-
ble to all citizens. It would increase Government's effectiveness in carrying
out its mandated public health protection responsibilities for monitoring the
safety and quality of food, food additives and drugs; producing vaccines and
diagnostic antigens; and monitoring communicable diseases. The project would
reinforce an objective of an earlier project by continuing to strengthen the
institutional capacity of MOHSA to give it a better understanding of hospital
and sector financing which would be beneficial in performing its role of
formulating health policies and developing cost containment measures.
2.3       This project would be a vehicle for the Bank to continue its policy
dialogue with the Government on the financing of the health sector, and to
monitor the impact of national health insurance on equity, cost and quality of
medical care. The Bank would bolster its growing experience in helping a
middle-income country adapt to an epidemiological transition which could be
utilized in similar countries.
2.4       The objectives of the project are to: (a) increase the access by
rural and urban poor to medical care services, especially for early detection
of noncommunicable diseases; (b) improve the quality of medical care in public
hospitals; (c) assist the country in protecting the health of the population
through a more effect'.ve control of the safety of drugs and the quality of
food, and through monitoring communicable diseases; and (d) address critical
health sector policy issues focusing mainly on sector financing and cost
containment.
2.5       The Bank loan would finance the purchase of biomedical equipment and
the beneficiary hospitals and Institute would finance complementary inputs
(consumables, transportation and installation, operation and maintenance
costs).
C. Proiect Descrintion
Prolect Components
2.6       The proposed project's objectives would be achieved through the
implementation, over four years, of the following four components:



- ;5 -
Comnonent A:  Expansion of the diagnostic and treatment calabdlitiesl  o   h
National Medical Center (NMC) (US$12.5 million equivalent). This component
would add new biomedical equipment and replace and upgrade antiquated biomed-
ical equ4.pment in a national tertiary level referral hospital located in Seoul
and serving mainly low-income clients. Clinical services to be supported
would focus on the most prevalent diagnostic categories, such as coronary
heart disease, cancer, stroke, and chronic liver disease. NMC is also a
teaching hospital accepting interne and residents from three medical schools.
It therefore requires up to date and more advanced equipment than a general
acute care hospital.
Component B: Strengthen the Technical Capability of the Korean National
Institute of Health (NIH) (US$12.5 million equivalent). This component would
add and replace research and testing equipment for monitoring the safety of
drugs and food, for producing vaccines and antigens, and for monitoring
communicable diseases. More accurate, sensitive and technologically advanced
equipment would enhance NIH's capability to carry out quality control func-
tions benefitting the health of the whole population.
Component C: Strenaxthen Selected Public Hos2itals (PH) in Prevention and
Treatment of Non-Communicable Diseases (US$12.5 million equivalent). This
component would add and/or replace biomedical equipment in selected municipal
and provincial hospitals in order to modernize their equipment and upgrade
their diagnostic and treatment capabilities, especially for noncommunicable
diseases. It would allow smaller public hospitals to treat more patients in
situ and thereby decrease referrals to higher level tertiary care facilities.
The maximum allowable amount of equipment purchases per selected hospital
would be US$1.0 million to ensure that at least ten hospitals would be
benefitted. The mlunicipalities and provinces that are the owners of these
hospitals would sign subloan agreements with the Government to finance the
purchase of the biomedical equipment. About fifteen hospitals would be
included in this component.
Component D: Action Program and Trainina (US$275,000 equivalent). This
component would carry out a health sector policies and cost containment action
program addressing critical sector issues (hospital efficiency, diffusion of
medical technology, fee schedules) supported by relevant research studies,
publications on health policy and financing, and a national consensus building
program. It would also provide for training of MOHSA, NMC and NIH staff.
2.7       The Health Sector Policies and Cost Containment Action Program
(Annex 12) formulated by the Government would be carried out during the life
of the project. It would be financed by the Government at a cost of about
US$250,000. Policy objectives for the 1990. focus on equitable access,
affordable cost and acceptabl' quality of health services and progress would
be monitored through a set of equity measures, cost-containment measures and
quality measures as shown in Annex 12. The World Bank has engaged in a policy
dialogue with the Government during project preparation and agrees with the
country's policy objectives. During preparation of this project as well as
the previous project (Loan 3330-KO), the Bank has raised awareness of the
government - of MOPH and of the Economic Planning Board, pointing out the
criticality of short and medium term health sector financing issues and the
need for policy decisions. The health sector chapter in the Seventh Five-Year
Plan was drafted by an ad hoc task force of non-government health economists
and health specialists. The Korea Hospital Management Institute was created
in December 1991. An action program has now been defined and three priority
areas have been agreed to for immediate attention: (i) hospital management



- 16 
efficiency; (ii) management of biomedical technology; and (iii) insurance
reimbursement and regulation of fee schedules.
2.8       Four research swudies would also be carried out during 1992-94 on
the following topics: (i) a study of national health expenditures; (ii)
econometric models of the affordable number of hospital beds, number of
physicians and other health personnel, and of reimbursement for hospital and
physician services; (iii) evaluation of the impact of National Health
Insurance on the Government'. policy objectives of equity, cost and quality;
and (iv) evaluation of alternatives for paying providers of medical care
services. A regular health policy and financing publication would disseminate
research fundings and annually a national health policy forum would be held.
Draft Terms of Reference for the research studies were submitted to the Bank
prior to negotiations.
Decision-making Criteria for Selectina Hospitals and Eguipment
2.9         Hospital Selection. Criteria for selecting hospitals to partici-
pate in the project is only an issue for the municipal and provincial
hospitals under Component C. The NMC and NIH are national facilities and are
the only ones of their kind; their applications would be endorsed by their
respective Director Generals. About 15 of the 34 provincial and municipal
public hospitals in Korea would be selected to participate in the project.
Respective municipal and provincial authorities will assume responsibility for
repaying the loan and propose hospitals for participation on the basis of
their need for additional equipment. A public hospital's application would
require endorsement by the Office of Mayor or Governor which has jurisdiction
over the medical facilities in its administrative area. The HMD would make
the selection, taking into account improvement in equitable access of the poor
to health care. Financial evaluation of the hospitals is not necessary since
all applicant hospitals are public institutions and their capital costs are
financed by national and local budgets. Almost all public hospitals are
financially self-sufficient for operating costs (para 1.13).
2.10      Equipment Selection.  The selection of biomedical equipment to be
procured under the proposed project would be subject to criteria (Annex 9) and
follow procedures (Annex 10) which have been prepared by HMD and LMD in MORSA
and are satisfactory to the Bank. Selection would be made by an Equipment
Selection Committee (ESC) (Annex 11). NMC and NIH would submit their equip-
ment lists and technical specifications for approval by ESC. Hospitals
proposed by cities and provinces as eligible for an equipment loan under the
project would also submit their schedule of requirements and technicel
specifications for approval by the ESC.
2.11      The Guidelines for the Allocation of Loan Proceeds per component is
shown in Annex 8. The total amount of allocation for each component is
indicative only. The final figure could be slightly higher or lower within
reasonable limits. Unused amounts for ohO component could and should be used
for another component. During negotiations the Government provided assurances
that allocations of loan proceeds would follow the agreed guidelines.
2.12      During negotiations the Government provided assurances that the
equipment approved for purchase under this project would meet the agreed
selection criteria and that the selection process would follow the agreed
guidelines. The Government also provided assurances that no material changes
in the criteria would be made without first being discussed and agreed with
the Bank.



- 17 -
Proiset-Related Training
2.13      The project would include US$28,000 for seminars and overseas study
tours for loan and equipment managers and would be financed by the MOHSA
budget. Any training that may be needed for NMC and NIH staff would be part
of their regular training program and financed out of their training budget
augmented by WHO support.

3.2       Base costs are estimated in December 1991 prices.  The cost of the
equipment is equivalent to the requested loan amount excluding contingencies.
Transportation and installation costs are based on experience with other
recent Bank projacts in Korea. The initial supply of consumables and the cost
of operation and maintenance were estimated according to standard procedures
in use also in recent Bank projects in Korea. Duties and taxes are estimated
at US$5.6 million and are not included in the total. project cost.
3.3       The contingency allowance of US$5.8 million, about 15 percent of
baseline costs, includes contingencies for unforeseen physical conditions and
for estimated price increases. Physical contingencies were estimated at 5
percent of baseline costs for equipment, transportation and installation,
consumable materials and O&M expenditures. Price contingencies were calculat-
ed for both local and foreign costs in accordance with the following expected
annual average price increase percentages: foreign cost at 3.92 p.a. and local
cost at 52 p.a. throughout. Accordingly, aggregated price increases are
estimated at about 10.3 percent of baseline costs plus physical contingencies.
3.4       The foreign exchansge component of US$35.1 million (about 81 percent
of total estimated project costs) has been calculated on the basis of the
following foreign exchange percentages: equipment, 100 percent; transportation
and installation, 10 percent; consumables, 10 percent; training and research,
10 percent and O&M, 10 percent.
B. Financing
3.5       The proposed loan of US$30.0 million equivaleat would finance about
85 percent of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project, or 69
percent of total project costs net of taxes and duties. The Government and
hospitals would be responsible for the remaining US$13.6 million equi-alent
(Table 3.3). The loan amount is limited to US$30.0 by Korea's foreig..
borrowing program and is therefore less than the foreign exchange of the
project. The loan would finance 79 percent of the baseline cost of nquipment.
Equipment procured under the project for the public institutions would be
financed on the basis of subloans from the Government to the borrowing NMC.
and municipalities and provinces on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank. All loan proceeds would be on-lent. Major points of the terms and
conditions are outlined in Annex 16. including: sub-loans would be denominated
in Korea Won and the sub-borrowers would bear the full exchange risk of the
Won against the World Bank currency pool; the maturity and the grace periods
for the sub-loans would be the same as the ones for the IBRD-GOK loan; and the
interest rate would be the IBRD floating interest rate for the currency pool
plus 0.052 p.a.. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances
that a subsidiary loan agreement would be applied to all sub-loans under the
project. As a condition of effectiveness of the loan, the Government would
enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with NMC for carrying out Component A
and with NIH for carrying out Component B. As a condition of disbursement for
expenditures under Component C, the Government would have entered into a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the concerned municipality or province.
3.6 All costs for transportation and installation of equipment, operation and
maintenance and consumable materials, including contingencies, would be
financed by the beneficiary institutions. In the case of imported equipment.
the costs of transportation to the point of entry into Korea would be included
in the cost of the equipment. Cost of special training and installation if
included in the equipment contract, would also be considered as the cost of
equipment.

3.7       When fully operational, the installed equipment would annually
generate recurrent costs for consumable materials, maintenance and spare parts
of about 8% and 72, respectively. of the equipment purchase price. These
additional expenditures constitute a very small percentage of a hospital's
annual operating budget and therefore would be accommodated by the
institutions without ditj.iculty.
C. Proiect Management and Implementation
3.8       Overall responsibility for project management would lie with the
Hospital Management Division (HMD) in the Bureau of Medical Affairs (BMA) of
the Ministry of Health (MOHSA) (Annex 1). HMD would coordinate its actions
with the Logistic Management Division (LMD) in MOHSA. and other related
government agencies and professional institutions which might be involved in
project related activities or policies. HM would be responsible for the
financial management of the project. It will assign one staff member to carry
out the following financial management tasks: appraising subsidiary loan
proposals. drafting subsidiary loan agreements. recording subsidiary loans,
collecting on subsidiary loans, checking compliance with covenants. and taking
corrective actions against problem subsidiary loans. One person would be
recruited to assist in the start up activities during the first year of
implementation at a cost of US$16,500 paid out of the MOHSA budget.
3.9       The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) (Annex 17) would be the one
established by ministerial decree for the previous health project (Ln 3330-
KO). It would be headed by the Director General of the Bureau of Medical
Affairs (BMA).  The Equipment Selection Committee is directly under the
Project Director (para. 3.10). The Director of the Division of Hospital
Management(HMD) serves as Project Executive Director, and manages the work of
the Planning and Executing Team and of the Technical Cooperation Team. The
Planning and Executing Team consists of HMD's Deputy Director, one accountant
and one full-time health services management specialist. The Technical
Cooperation Team would support the Planning and Executing Team with its
technical expertise in biomedical equipment. Its staff are drawn frcm the
Logistics Management Division. During negotiations, agreement was reached



- 21 -
that the PIU would be maintained until completion of the project with
structure and functions satisfactory to the Bank.
3.10      A Policy Implementation Com ittee would supervise the execution of
the Health Sector Policies and Cost Containment Action Program with the
assistance of the newly created autonomous Korea Hospital Management
Institute. The Committee would include representatives of government, the
providers, the consumers and academics. The organization of the Committee is
shown on page 6 of Annex 12. During negotiations, agreement was reached that
the Action Program would be carried out without substantial amendments unless
prior approval of the Bank was obtained.
EauiRment Selection
3.11      The Equipment Selection Committee (ESC) established for Loan 3330-KO
but with its membership composition modified (see para 3, Annex 11) would
review and approve all requests for equipment submitted under this project by
the beneficiary institutions. It will be chaired by the Project Director, the
Director General of BMA., and consists of two vice chairmen (the Director of
LMD) and Director General, KRHA, a secretary (staff, LMD), and six committee
members including a Director of HMD. The ESC would be responsible for
applying the agreed equipment selection criteria (Annex 9) to the schedule of
requirements and technical specifications submitted by NMC, NIH and the
qualifying hospitals. To carry out this responsibility it would follow the
agreed procedures listed in Annex 10. Internal committees in NIH and NMC
would prescreen equipment requests before submitting them to ESC. The ESC
would remain in existence for the duration of the project and its Terms of
Reference are contained in Annex 11. It may carry out additional tasks as
judged necessary by its Chairman, such as visiting the physical sites where
equipment is to be installed and determining their suitability, and providing
recommendations on the efficient use of the equipment. During negotiations
agreement was reached that the ESC would be maintained until completion of the
project with structure and functions satisfactory to the Bank.
3.12      LMD would assist ESC by providing technical advice and data on the
availability of certain large equipment items, on utilization and maintenance
of equipment and it would also assist hospitals in making warranty claims.
Equipment procurement would be undertaken by the Office of Supply, Republic of
Korea (OSROK), the procurement agency of the Government which is highly
experienced in procuring equipment under the Bank's international competitive
bidding procedures. On the basis of equipment specifications provided by the
institutions, OSROK would prepare bidding documents, invite bids, evaluate
them in conjunction with the institutions and make contract awards with the
agreement of the institutions.
3.13      The hospitals are required to register ownership of equipment within
two months after installation and to bring warranty problems to the attention
of the company directly or to LMD or OSROK for assistance.
Status of Prolect Preparation
3.14      Project preparation is completed and a number of activities relating
to the initiatior. of project implementation are already underway. The targets
in the project implementation schedule (Annex 18) are judged to be reasonable
and are satisfactory to both MOHSA and the Bank. The physical facilities
required to house the equipment to be procured under the project already exist
in the hospitals; extra space requirements are expected to be minimal.



- 22 -
Equipment lists and specifications will be prepared by NMC, NIH. and by
selected hospitals. The mechanisms for reviewing the equipment lists and
specifications have been set up and are satisfactory to the Bank. As noted
above the Equipment Selection Committees satisfactory to the Bank has already
been established and members have been appointed. Arrangements to act as
procurement agency have already been made with OSROK, which is very
experienced in procurement under the Bank's International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) procedures. ?roject management mechanisms satisfactory to the Bank have
also been set up within MOHSA, management authority has been defined and
supporting staff have been identified. The Terms of Reference for the
research studies have been prepared. The advanced stage of project
preparation would allow full implementation to commence immediately after loan
signing.
Procurement
3.15      Procurement arrangements are shown in Table 3.4.  About 85 percent
of equipment would be procured on the basis of ICB procedures in accordance
with Bank Guidelines. Equipment items in contracts valued at less than
US$200,000 may be procured up to an aggregate limit of US$4.5 million through
shopping procedures providing for the comparison of quotations from at least
three suppliers. Spare parts for existing equipment and proprietary items may
be purchased directly from the suppliers thereof. Local equipment manufactur-
ers would be extended a 15 percent preference margin, or the prevailing
customs duties, whichever is lower, on bid evaluation under ICB. Costs of
transportation and operation and maintenance would be financed by NMC, NIH and
selected hospitals under local procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank.
Installation costs and cost of consumables, if not included in the equipment
contracts, would also be financed by the hospitals.
3.16      In viev of successful procurement under ICB procedures in recent
Bank projects in Korea, OSROK would not be required to refer equipment
contracts to the Bank for prior review before making contract awards.
However, complete bidding documents including commercial terms, schedule of
requirements and technical specifications will be sent to the Bank for
reference and record before each invitation to bid. Bid evaluation reports
and documents will be retained by OSROK for selected ex-ost review by Bank
missions. An action plan for equipment procurement is given in Annex 19, and
the procurement arrangement is shown in Table 3.4 below.

Note:  Figures in parentheses are the amounts to be financed by the loan
NBF: Not Bank-Financed
Disbursements
3.17      The proposed loan of US$30 million would be disbursed over a period
of 4 1/2 years (Annex 20). This is about one year less than the period in the
standard profile for Korea for all sectors as a whole because of the quick
disbursing nature of the project. The completion date of the proposed project
would be June 30. 1996 and the Closing Date, December 31. 1996. Disbursements
would be made on the basis of (a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for
imported equipment; (b) 100 percent of the local expenditures (ex-factory
cost) of locally manufactured equipment; and (c) 65 percent of the cost of
other local expenditures for equipment. Except for equipment contracts
exceeding US$200,000 equivalent each, all reimbursement would be made against
statements of expenditure (SOE) for which full documentation would be retained
in OSROK, Seoul, for review as requested by visiting Bank missions.
Administrative and accounting capability is adequate to support the SOE
procedure. To the extent possible, withdrawal applications should be
consolidated into amounts of US$100,000 or more prior to submission to the
Bank.
3.18      To facilitate disbursements, two special accounts, maintained in US
dollars would be set up at the Korean Exchange Bank (KEB) in an amount of
US$2.0 million for MOHSA and US$1.0 million for NIH to cover the estimated
average amount required to finance project expenditures for the next four
months. Applications for replenishment of the special account would be
submitted to the Basnk on a quarterly basis, or whenever the amount drawn down
exceeds 50 percent of the initial deposit, whichever comes first.

Project Monitoring and Evaluation
3.19      In order to monitor ongoing progrese in the onlending of funds and
in equipment procurement under the project, the semi-annual reports
(para. 3.20) would initially include the following indicators for each year of
the project: number of municipal and provincial hospitals that applied and
that were approved by medical region; number of subloan agreements signed;
number and type and cost of equipment ordered, delivered and installed by
component and by medical region with corresponding dates; updates on loan
allocations by component; number of persons trained and number of hours of
training; summaries of the decisions of the ESC committee; and an updated
project implementation schedule and an equipment procurement action program if
needed. Completed activities need not be reported again to avoid repetition.
The Bank would supervise the project twice a year and its missions would
review with the PIU the semi-annual progress reports (para. 3.20) and monitor
progress of the Action Program and the research studies (paras. 2.17 and
2.18). Supervision would be carried out by the Task Manager (Public Health
Specialist) accompanied once a year by a biomedical equipment specialist and
once a year by a procurement specialist. The project implementation schedule
is shown in Annex 18.
Accounts. Audits and Reporting
3.20      MOHSA would maintain project accounts in accordance with sound
accounting practices. The Inspector-General (also Auditor-General) in MOHSA
would audit all project accounts of all the sub-borrowers (Annex 16, Point 14)
and the Statement of Expenditures related to the operation of the Special
Account (para. 3.18). During negotiations, the Government provided assurances
that audited accounts, including an auditor's opinion on the Statement of
Expenditures, would be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the
Korean financial year. The Government also provided assurances that it would
submit semi-annual progress reports to the Bank on about March and September
and provide status reports for visiting missions.
D. Environmental Aspects
3.21      The proposed project would have no significant negative impact on
the environment. The project will strengthen NIH's technical capability to
monitor food safety and drug quality, and communicable diseases through
upgrading its technical and scientific equipment, and training its staff. The
medical equipment supplied under the project will be located in properly
designed facilities which operate under standard safety procedures.
E. Impact on Women
3.22      The equipment to be procured under this proposed project would be
available to diagnose and treat all citizens. The project is therefore gender
neutral.

IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
4.1       As a result of the project, about half of the public hospitals in
Korea serving mainly the poorer population groups will have upgraded and
modernized their biomedical equipment. This will allow them to detect and
treat noncommunicable diseases more effectively and give the smaller and more
rural facilities the capability to treat more patients themselves and thus
decrease the flow of referrals to higher level hospitals. The National
Medical Center will have upgraded its biomedical equipment for early detection
and opportune treatment of noncommunicable diseases. The strengthened
technical capability of the National Institute of Health will improve its
efficiency in monitoring food safety, drug quality and communicable diseases
in order to better protect the people's health. An action program on health
sector financing policies and cost containment measures will have facilitated
making policy decisions to contain health care expenditures without
jeopardizing access to services and quality of medical care.
B. Risks
4.2       There are no major risks in this project.  A minor risk might be
defa'lting by project institutions. However, the Project Implementation Unit
(PIE, under the ongoing Health Technology Project is operating in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank and it is expected that the PIU for the proposed
project will also perform satisfactorily and closely monitor loan repayments.
The experience with on-lending under the population project was also positive
and there were no arrears. The risk of slippage in implementing the Action
Program and the research studies would be addressed through semi-annual
supervision missions to maintain the policy dialogue.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.1       Before negotiations the Government submitted draft Terms of
Reference for the research studies (para. 2.8).
5.2       During negotiations the Government agreed to the following:
(a) Allocation of loan proceeds would follow agreed guidelines (para.
2.11)
(b)  Equ.,pment would be selected according to criteria and guidelines
acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.12);
(c) Subsidiary loan agreements will be entered into for the carrying out
of the respective parts of the project (para. 3.5);
(d) the PIU and the ESC will be maintained until completion of the
project with structure, staff and functions satisfactory to the Bank
(paras. 3.9 and 3.11);
(e) the Action Program would be carried out without substantial
amendments unless prior approval of the Bank was obtained (para.
3.10); and
(f) Audit reports would be submitted by the Government to the Bank
within six months of the end of the Korean financial year
(para. 3.20).
5.3       During negotiations, understandings were reached that:  Semi-annual
progress reports would be submitted to the Bank around March and September and
status reports would be provided to visiting missions (para. 3.20).
5.4       As a condition of effectiveness of the loan, the Government would
enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with NMC for carrying out Component A
and with NIH for carrying out Component B, and provide satisfactory legal
opinions relating thereto (para. 3.5).
5.5       As a condition of disbursement for expenditures under Component C,
the Government would have entered into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with each
concerned municipality or province and providing a satisfactory legal opinion
in relation to each such subsidiary loan agreement (para. 3.5).
5.6       Subject to the above conditions, the project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$30.0 million equivalent to the Republic of Korea
for a term of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.

Korean National Institute of Health
De2artment of Microbiology
1.        The prime activities of the department focus on the control of
communicable diseases. The department undertakes not only epidemiological
surveillance of bacterial and fungal infectious diseases, but also disease-
monitoring information activities to prevent communicable diseases in the
community, in collaboration with-a nationwide network of provincial health
laboratorias and county centers. Microbiological research investigations of
various etiologic agents are conducted. The department also carries out
quality control of biological products such as vaccines, diagnostic antisera
and blood products, and microbiological investigations of foods and drugs
according to the minimum requirement.
2.        The department makes an effort ro develop either new biological
production to improve old ones; a successful development was achieved recently
in the production of the purified pertussis vaccine and Leptospira vaccine. t
Leptospira v&ccine was developed to cope with recent outbreaks of this disease
in some of the rice-farm areas of the country.
3.        Implementing the quality control function of biologics such as
vaccines, diagnostic antisera and blood products, and also microbiological
investigations of foods and drugs, the department, at the same time, supplies
and supports various media, reagents, physiological solution and highly-
purified distilled water to all laboratories of the NIH including autoclaving
services for the successful operation of NIH's research and development
DeDartmgnt of Viroloev
4.        It conducts epidemiological surveys, diagnosis and research on viral
diseases, including research and development of biologicals and rickettsial
products and their national level evaluation for quality control.
5.        Recent attention has been paid to infectious viral diseases such as
hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, herpes and rubella, and those particularly
prevalent among infants including measles, mumps, poliomyelitis and Japanese
encephalitis and other viral diseases of respiratory origin such as influenza
and parainfluenza. Therefore, the major emphasis is to be placed on R&D of
epidemiological investigations in close relations with various viral diseases
to define or study the structure, morphology, chemical and physical
properties, and growth kinetics of viruses.
6.        The National Influenza Center in the department collaborates with
the Incernational Influenza Center through the World Health Organization
(WHO). For surveillance against encephalitis, continuous efforts can be made
chrough the estimation of vector population, viral infection rate among vector
mosquitoes and amplifying hosts; such information enables the NIH to predict

ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 4
the critical period of encephalitis epidemics to release precautionary
warnings to the people particularly to the susceptible group as preventive
measures.
7.        Virological examinations are performed utilizing monoclonal antibody
techniques through cell fusion to develop diagnosis and control viral
infectious diseases. Subsequent characterization of viral agents is to be
accomplished by the use of an electron microscope. Continuous investigation
is also carried out to develop vaccines, and a nationwide examination of
biological or vaccine products conducted according to the standards required
for the quality control.
8.        Concerning parasitology, the department is engaged in performing
such functions as medical ecology, laboratory diagnosis and control of
parasitic diseases. Research and development is primarily directed toward
ecological investigation of various parasitic infections and transmLssion
which involves intermediate hosts and disease vectors. In laboratory
diagnosis, emphasis is placed an parasitological and immunoserological
diagnosis specific to the parasites involved. The department i3 also involvtd
in the field of medical entomology, including taxonomy, ecology and control of
medically important insects and arthropods.
D22artment of Drufs
9.        The department undertakes R&D on drugs, narcctics, psychotropic
agents, crude drugs, medical devices and cosmetics. In addition, it
established drug standards and test methods and performs the national
evaluation or regulatory analyses of drugs to assure their quality. It
performs government batch certification for antibiotics and contraceptives
before marketing and regulatory assays on the drugs in the markets to evaluate
and assure the quality of marketed or pre-marketed drugs.
10.       Regulatory assays extend to narcotics and psychotropic materials in
accordance with the special laws or government provisio.a as well as cosmetics
and medical devices. The regulatory assays are usually available for such
apparatus as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas
chromatography (CC) to facilitate its simplicity, accuracy and rapidity. In
particular, these apparatuses enable the department to analyze compound drugs
into a simultaneous determination according to quantitative and qualitative
analyses.
11.       One other important function of the drug department is to establish
standards of identity, strength, quality and purity and their test methods for
the drugs, antibiotics and raw materials of cosmetics which particularly are
excluded from the pharmacopoeia or similar official provisions.
12.       In order to determine relevant standards and test methods, the
materials to be tested with supporting refGrences are examined and scrutinized
by the division of the department concerned. They are used as the reference
standards for the quality control of marketed or pre-marketed drugs by

provincial institute of health, municipal institute and the pharniaceutical
manufacturers as well as NIH.
DeRartment of Hygiene
13.       The department undertakes research and evaluation of food hygiene
which includes foods, additives and packaging and also carries out regulatory
tests on milk products, nutritional products, potable water and imported
products. It establishes various food standards and test methods and carries
out technical training for the provincial and municipal institutes to test
foods properly.
14.       More emphasis has been placed on investigation of hazardous
materials such as pesticide residue contained in cereals, vegetables and even
in fruits. It is stepping up its efforts to develop a monitoring system for
heavy metal contaminants particularly in marine and fisheries such as fishes
and shellfishes. Studies on nutritional values of vitamins, inorganic
materials and other nutritional ingr-dients are on-going to make these factors
applicable to people's dietary lit                                              t
15.       One of the most important functions of the department is the quality
control activities on foods and food additives including natural, processed
foods, vegetables, fruits, potable water, detergents, which extends to
manufacturing apparatus and packaging.
Department of Radiation Standards

HEALTH SECTOR POLICIES AND COST COTAIMENT ACTION PROGRAM
A. Introduction
1.          The Government of the Republic of Korea has made great efforts to
improve access for the whole population to health cars services by expanding
insurance coverage and by increasing the number of hospital beds. Korea
achieved universal health insurance coverage in July 1989 after a twelve year
period of gradual expansion. The demand of health care was expected to
increase dramatically by providing national health insurance. Therefore, the
Government has continuously increased the number of hospital beds since 1978
and has added medical equipment and related facilities. All people nation-
wide have access now to health care services without geographic or financial
barriers.
2.          The next issue for the Government is to manage the demand and
expenditures which have accelerated quickly along with the expansion of
insurance coverage and the increase in hospital beds. The country has put
into place a legal, political and financial structure to implement the social
policy of providing access to quality and affordable health care for all
citizens irrespective of income and location. The challenge for the 1990's is
to guide the implementation of this social policy by balancing equity concerns
with reasonable cost and acceptable quality.
B. Policy Objectives for the 1990's
3.          Government health policy aims at containing health care costs
while at the same time meeting the increasing demand for health care. Even
though the costs should be minimized, it is more important to assure access
for all people to good quality of health care services by efficient management
of the limited health care resources.
4.          The health sector policy objectives for this decade are:
(a) ensuring equitable access to health care services by all
citizens;
(b) providing affordable and cost-effective health care
services;
(c) providing health care services of consistently good quality.
C. Key Indicators
5.          Key indicators selected for evaluation and monitoring progress
towards reaching policy objectives are as follows:
Eauity Measures
6.          The first problem identified in Korea health sector is the unmet
demand for health care. Unmet demand is caused partially by insufficient



- 45 -
AMEX .12
Page 2 of 8
supply of health care services.  Another, even more significant reason for
insufficient supply is inequitable distribution of health facilities. About
75% of total health facilities are located in the largest cities. Thus, it is
a most important goal for the Government to rovide equitable access to good
quality and affordable health services for al. people.
7.          Equity in access will be measured in two ways:  (1) supply
dimension; and (2) consumption dimension.
8.          Equity in supplying health services will be measured by
availability of services. Especially basic health services, such as primary
health care services and health examinations, should be provided to all people
based on need. The availability of services will be based on an analysis of
the present distribution of health facilities and personnel and its relation
to medical regions and socio-economic status of the targeted population.
9.          Equity in health care consumption will be measured by the actual
consumption status which are utilization rates. In order to measure equity,
the utilization rate will be compared by region and by socio-economic status
of users. Examples of utilization rates are annual number of hospital
admissions and patient days per person, number of physician visits per person
per year; immunization rates for communicable diseases, such as hepatitis,
and the six childhood diseases; infant, perinatal, and child mortality rate,
maternal mortality rates; morbidity and mortality for specific diseases such
as cancer, heart disease, stroke, infectious and parasitic diseases, and
respiratory and digestive diseases.
Cost-Containment Measures
10.         The major reason for the policy is to contain health care costs.
The cost of health care services is expected to increase sharply because of
improved accessibility to health care services nationwide, as a result of
providing universal coverage for health insurance and of increasing the number
of hospital beds. This measure is selected as the primary index of overall
sector performance because it measures the influence of a wide-range of
government interventions on health markets.
11.         Cost containment could be measured by:
(a)   total individual health care expenditures as percent of
house income;
(b) total health care expenditures as percent of GDP;
(c)   increase in fee schedule of medical services as compared
with general inflation;
(d) medical care index versus consumer price index;
(e) expenditures for drugs as percent of total health
expenditures; and
(f)   increase in availability and use rates of sophisticated
medical technology.

ANNEX 12
Page 3 of 8
Oualitv Measures
12.         It is important to control the costs of health care but it is
equally important to improve the quality of services. The quality could be
defined by the outcomes of treatment and by the satisfaction with treatment
received.   Standards of care for specific procedures for some types of
diseases are already available. However, standards should be expanded further
for a broader range of treatment procedures.
13.         Comparison of the benefit of treatment with the market costs for a
variety of health care types, such as hospitalized care, nursing home care,
home health care would guide the regulators and consumers: what are the most
cost-effective ways to treat modern diseases and health problems. The purpose
of this measure is to monitor the progress of reforms designed to shift
patients with at least one chronic/degenerative disease from a hospital
setting to the community. By being treated in the community, the patients
would maintain their lifestyle and social and economic activities. They do
not need to be isolated for cane and incur expenses for similar outcomes and
quality of treatment.
14.         Criteria and standards of industrial countries could be applied in
addition to the traditional criteria for measuring quality. Some examples of
the criteria are as follows:
(a)   standards of accreditation for hospitals;
(b)   licensure standards for medical specialists and paramedical
staff;
(c)   rates of selected invasive surgical procedures.
15.         In summary, the three sets of key indicators selected to monitor
progress in achieving national health policy objectives are designed to
measure: (i) equity; (ii) the reduction in health care expenditures; and (iii)
cost effectiveness of providing better quality of care.
D. Specific Programs and Regulations
16.         The actions for cost containment enunciated in this statement
corresponds to the objective of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1993-97) for the
health sector. Health care cost containment was flagged as an issue in the
evaluation of the Sixth Five Year Plan. Goals and action programs presented
here are designed to address the issues. At the same time the Government
would also reach the goals and targets of the Seventh Plan.
17.         The action program consists of:  (1) Hospital Management
Efficiency, (2) Medical Technology Management and (3) Health Insurence
Reimbursement Regulation. In addition, there is an emphasis on assisting the
implementation of these policies, such as (a) conducting research projects to
provide data for achieving the policy goal and (b) building National Consensus
on alternatives for solving the issues. The action program will be executed



47
ANNEX 12
Page 4 of 8
by the relevant institutions and divisions at MOHSA, and the implementation
assistance will be the responsibility of a task-force establishod for that
purpose.
Efficiency of Hospitals
Obiective
18.         Hospitals are the main vehicle through which medical care is
provided and expenditures for hospital care account for about 30 percent of
all health care expenditures. Saving expenses on hospital operation and
producing the quality of services by improving efficiency is the priority
strategy for minimizing health care expenditures while solving needs.
Actions:
(a)   Develop by December 31, 1992 measures, including finpicial
incentives, to reduce the current average length of hospital stay
of 14 days to 1.1 days;
(b)   Require hospitals to establish cost accounting systems and to
conform to national, uniform and transparent hospital accounting
practices by July 1993. This would provide baseline to regulate
service fees. Through the standardized accounting system, each
hospital could be managed in more systematic and efficient manner.
The benefit of the savings through efficient management are
expected to be returned to save expenses of consumers or to
improve the quality of services.
(c) Develop alternative treatment to short-term acute care hospitals
for long-term care patients (physically and mentally handicapped,
rehabilitating and convalescing patients, elderly patients) such
as home care programs, residential care facilities, skilled care
nursing homes.
Management of Biomedical Technology
19.         It is inevitable to use modern and sophisticated medical equipment
for coping with epidemiological needs which are no longer for communicable
disease treatment but for more complicated problems which most industrial
countries have.
20.         The improved life status of Koreans accelerates unnecessary use of
expensive medical equipments. Such unnecessary consumption serves the
interest of providers because the procedures are more profitable. Without any
Governmental policy for regulation, the unnecessary use of expensive medical
equipment will continuously increase.
21.         Thus, this action program contains a section on the management of
sophisticated medical equipment so that the Government can protect payers and



- 48 -
ANNEX 12
Page 5 of 8
distribute the saved benefit to more people regardless of socio-economic
status and geographic distance. Details are as follows:
Objective
22.         To make sophisticated medical technology accessible to all
patients when its use is medically appropriate and necessary, and to regulate
the introduction and diffusion of expensive biomedical technology.
Actions:
(a)   Make an inventory of all sophisticated medical equipment, its
location, rates of utilization, and unit cost per procedures. To
be completed by December 31, 1992.
(b)   Study and make recommendations for sharing medical equipment among
institutions and among and within medical regions. To be
completed by June 30, 1993.
(c)   Strengthen and apply strictly the existing regulations governing
the purchase of biomedical equipment.
Regulation of Fee Schedule and Insurance Reimbursement
Obhective
To set limits on the supply of money available to purchase medical
care; to control reimbursement of the expenses through health
insurance mechanism; ana to control volume of services rendered.
Actions:
(a)   Control better the volume of services provided by tightening
inspection of medical insurance claims.
(b)   Limit the reimbursement of the cost of a brand name prescriprion
drug to the amount of the sale price of its generic equivalent.
E. Organization and Actions for Program Implementation
Committee for Policy Implementation
PhtE_se
To effectively achieve the policy goals; to evaluate the policy
implementation and feedback the results of the process; to build a
national consensus on how to achieve the health sector policy
objectives of equitable access, affordable cost and acceptable
quality through involving all interested parties: the consumer,
the provider, the payer and the Government.



- 49 -
ANNEX 12
Page 6 of 8
,&ctions:
(a)   Initiate a periodic high quality health policy and health
financing publication to disseminate research findings, present
and discuss health policy and financing alternatives, and provide
examples how other countries attempt to balance equity concerns
with reasonable cost and acceptable quality. Start publication of
first issue in December 1993.
(b)   Organize annually a National Health Policy forum starting in 1993
with the explicit objective of buildeng consensus on health care
strategies and strategy implementation mechanisms.

law as a legal entity on December 3, 1991 and initiated operations in January
1992. The goal of the KHMI is to improve the efficiency of hospital
management and the quality of hospital care. The Institute will be
responsible for implementing research studies related to the action program
outlined above and for providing information to the Policy Implementation
Committee. KHMI is affiliated and shares research staff with Seoul National
University. It is independently operated with initial financing by the
Government (1.3 billion Won in 1992) and will spend 60 million Won in 1992 on
the action program. The total budget and the share to be provided by KHMI

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR RESEARCH STUDIES
This annex summarizes the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the four research
studies listed in the Health Sector Policies and Cost Containment Action
Program (Annex 12). The Govern ent's letter of March 2, 1992 transmitting the
detailed TORe is in the project file.
A. Study of National Health Care Expenditures
This two year study would provide the first comprehensive review of
national health care expenditures by using existing data and collecting new
data on the sources and uses of funds. It would examine the current resource
allocation in terms of equity, allocative efficiency and effectiveness, and
develop a time series of national health care expenditures.
MOHSA will carry the overall responsibility for timely and quality
execution of the study selecting a principal investigator from among
internationally recognized scholars at the leading Korean universities. Study
findings would be disseminated through publications and seminars and the key
audience would be policy makers.
B. Econometric Resource Allocation Models
Different mixes of two health sector inputs, hospital beds and
physicians, would be simulated to determine optimal and affordable levels of
resource allocation. Models of input mix would be built and tested using
existing data to analyze allocative efficiency, resource constraints and
achievable effiency. The three year study would provide better knowledge for
decision makers to determine the rate and the direction of growth and the
distribution of the two most expensive health sector inputs.
The Korea Institute of Health and Social Affairs (KIHSA), a semi-
autonomous research institute under the aegis of MOHSA, would be responsible
for the conduct of the study and would use their own research staff.
C. Evaluation of National Health Insurance
Statutory national health insurance was fully implemented in July 1989.
The proposed two year study would be the first comprehensive evaluation of its
impact on the equity of service delivery, the cost of providing health care
and the quality of health services. Impact evaluation studies have already
been carried out on the Regional Medical Insurance group of insurance
societies that provide benefits to the self employed, pensioners and farmers,
and this study would build on that experience.



- 53 -
ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 2
Anticipated outcomes of this evaluative study would be recommendations
to policy makers on corrective measures to make the National Health Insurance
more responsive to consumer needs and more cost-effective. Findings would be
widely disseminated to government, provider groups and consumers.
The study would be conducted by the National Federation of Medical
Insurance and the Medical Insurance Bureau of MOHSA with technical support
from non-government sources.
D. Alternatives to Fee-For-Services Payment
The one year study would, first, evalurte the present fee-for-service
payment mechanism in terms of its effect on cost increase, and the demand for
and the utilization of health care services, and, second, examine alternative
ways of paying doctors and hospitals. Alternatives would be evaluated
according to the government's health sector objectives of cost containment,
equitable distribution and access to services, and acceptable quality care.
Anticipated outcomes of the study findings would be in the form of
recommendations to policy makers for adjustments in the present system and/or
adoption or experimentation with other reimbursement models. The study would
be conducted by the recently created Korea Hospital Management Institute using
its own research staff and that of Seoul National University.

PUBLIC HOSPITAL MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Sub-loan Agreement Between NMC. NIH. Relevant Municipal and Provincial
Governments and MOHSA
Major Points of Terms and Conditions
1. General Terms and Conditions
The sub-loan agreement is subject to all relevant terms and conditions of the
loan agreement between IBRD and the GOK and must be satisfactory to IBRD.
2. Sub-borrower
The borrowing entity where the equipment supplied with funds from this loan
will be installed must legally be a registered juridical body for health care
services with annual budgets approved through either MOHSA or MHA. The
borrowing entity is called the sub-borrower.
3. Sub-loan amount and denomination
The sub-loan is denominated in Korea Won. The amount of the sub-loan is the
upper limit of the expected equipment cost expressed in Korea Won.
4. Currency exchange risk
The Government of Korea will not bear any currency exchange risk. The sub-
borrowers will bear the full exchange risk of the Won against the World Bank
currency pool. The sub-borrower borrows the Korea Won equivalent of the pool
of currency as determined by the World Bank at the disbursement date.
5. Payment
To keep sub-loan administration simple, the sub-loan payment dates will be the
same as those of the IBRD-GOK loan agreement advanced by a few days or weeks
(to be determined by MOHSA) to enable the collection of funds for repayment.
6. Maturity and grace period
The maturity and the grace period for the sub-loan will be the same as the
maturity and the grace period for the IBRD-GOK loan. If the interests accrued
during the IBRD-GOK loan grace period are capitalized, then the interests will
also be accrued during the sub-loan grace period.
7. Interest rate
The interest rate is the IBRD floating interest rate for the currency pool
plus 0.05% p.a.

ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 3
8. Commitment fees
The commitment fees are the same as IBRD commitment fees (presently 0.25%).
The sub-borrowers will pay the commitment fees on the un-drawn balance of the
sub-loan irrespective of possible changes in the purchasing schedule.
9. Arrears penalty fees
The sub-borrower will pay a 0.05% penalty fee on arrears.
10. Pre-payment
If the sub-borrower wants to pre-pay the sub-loan, it must first request
approval from the Borrower. If agreed, the sub-borrower must pay the pre-
payment fee as stated in the IBRD-GOK loan agreement.
11. Collateral
There is no need for a collateral from the sub-borrower.
12. Restrictions on equipment
The sub-borrower must register the medical equipment in its books within one
month after delivery. The sub-borrower is not allowed to sell, transfer or
lease the medical equipment, nor use it for any other purpose unless agreed by
HMD.
13. Information
(a) The sub-borrower will advise MOHSA upon equipment installation.
(b) The sub-borrower must know the sub-loan procedures related to the
project.
(c) upon MOHSA's request, the sub-borrower must provide:
(i) annual reports on the operational status of the medical equipment
purchased under the sub-loan;
(ii) any information related to the project.
14. Financial audit
MOHSA would audit the project account of the sub-borrower including the
Statement of Expenditures related to the operation of the Special Account
established under the Bank/GOK Loan Agreement for this project.

ANNEX 16
Page 3 of 3
15.  Non-compliance
If the sub-borrower fails to comply with any of the sub-loan terms and
conditions, MOHSA may terminate the sub-loan agreement and immediately
claim the full payment of the sub-loan outstanding balance plus any loss
that the Government of Korea would have incurred as a result of the non-
compliance.
