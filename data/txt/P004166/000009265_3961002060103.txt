MEMORANDUM AND RECMMEINDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A PUBLIC HOSPITAL MODERNIZATION PROJEC.
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent
of US$30 million to help finance a project for public hospital modernization.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a 15 year
maturity including a grace period of 5 years. The proceeds of the loan would
be relent to the beneficiary hospitals at the same interest rate (plus 0.05%
p*a.), maturity and grace periods as the IBRD loan.
2.        Background.  Rorea's rapid economic growth in the last two decades
has brought about an impressive increase in real living standards and equally
impressive improvements in traditional health indicators, reaching a life
expectancy of 71 years, a natural population increase of 1Z pea., an infant
mortality rate of 11 per 1,000 live births, and a 952 immunization rate.
Economic success and the control of communicable diseases have, however,
brought about a changed disease burden.  The major causes of death and
disability are now noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, cancer,
stroke, and violence and injury. The demand for medical care is rising
rapidly as a result of higher income, the introduction of mandatory national
health insurance in 1989, chronic and degenerative diseases, and changing
technology. At the same time, there is growing concern in Korea over equity
issues, including a perceived increase in income inequality and in equitable
access to quality medical care. The Government has made a number of policy
changes to make the health sector more equitable and efficient, including
introduction of universal medical insurance in July 1989, and a regional
system of medical referral.  It is committed to making health services
accessible to the whole population. Policy makers for health care now face
three main issues: (a) equity -- further redressing regional imbalances and
ensuring financial access for all; (b) cost containment in an environment
where supply and demand are both increasing; and (c) monitoring of the quality
in medical care.
3.        Health care services in Korea are mostly delivered by the private
sector, accounting for about 902 of hospitals and about 73% of total health
sector expenditures in 1989. However, about 3.2 million people, or 7.5% of
the population are classified as poor or medically indigent and are not
covered by National Health Insurance. Government-financed public assistance
pays for most of their medical care. The poor have traditionally sought
medical care at public facilities, and continue to do so out of habit, and
because private hospitals have no financial incentives for serving the poor.
The public health sector includes several national institutes, including the
National Medical Center and National Institute of Health. In addition, the
Government operates 260 health centers, 1,318 health subcenters and 2,038
primary health care posts.  The Government is also responsible foec' protecting
the health of the public through activities with large externalities such as
ensuring the safety and quality of food, food additives, and drugs; producing
vaccines and diagnostic antigens; monitoring communicable diseases.
Investment is needed to carry out these public sector functions with more



-2-
efficiency and efficacy through upgrading equipment needed for research,
testing and monitoring.
4.        Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the project are to:  (a)
increase the access of rural and urban poor to medical care services.
especially for early detection of noncommunicable diseases; (b) improve the
quality of medical care in public hospitalst (c) assist the country to protect
the health of the population through a more effective control of safety and
quality of drugs and food. and through monitoring of noncommunicable diseases;
and (d) address critical health sector policy issues, focusing mainly on
sector financing and cost containment.
5.        Project Description.  The objectives would be achieved through: (i)
expansion of the diagnostic and treatment capabilities of the National Medical
Center (NMC); (ii) augmenting the technical capability of the Korean National
Institute of Health (NIH); (iii) strengthening of selected public hospitals in
prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases; and (iv) carrying out; a
Health Sector Policies and Cost Containment Action Program addressing critical
sector issues relating to hospital efficiency, introduction and diffusion of
medical technology, fees, and insurance premiums. Research studies would be
carried out on national health expenditures, econometric models to study the
affordable number of hospital beds and number of physicians, evaluating the
impact of National Health Insurance on the Government's policy objectives of
equity, cost and quality, and evaluating alternatives for paying providers of
medical care services. Other elements of the Action Program include
publications on health policy and financing and a national consensus building
program. The project would finance additional and replacement equipment;
local and overseas training for staff of NMC, NIH. and MOHSA; the Policy
Action Program; and the research studies.
6.        The estimated total cost of the project is US$43.6 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$35.1 million (811). The
Bank loan of US$30 million would finance about 851 of the foreign exchange
component. or 69Z of total project costs net of taxes and duties. The
beneficiary government hospitals and the Institute would finance complementary
inputs (transportation and installation costs, maintenance and consumables,
and contingencies). Equipment procured under the project would be financed on
the basis of subsidiary loans (about 15) from the Government to the borrowing
NMC, NIH, and municipalities and provinces on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. All loan proceeds would be on-lent. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operation. in Korea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.10283-KO, dated June
29, 1992, is being distributed separately.
7.        Proiect Implementatio.  The project would be implemented over a
four year period. Project implementation would be the responsibility of the
Bureau of Medical Affairs in MOHSA with participation of the Economic Planning
Board in policy research. Between 10 and 20 municipal and provincial
hospitals would be selected to participate in the project. Local authorities
would first recommend hospitals on the basis of their need for additional
equipment and their willingness to assume responsibility for repaying this
loan. The Hospital Management Division of MONSA would make the final



- 3 -
selection, using the potential improvement in equitable access of the poor to
health care as a final criterion. The selection of equipment would be made by
an Equipment Selection Committee and would take into account regional
distribution, epidemiological need, and efficiency in equipment maintenance
and utilization. Research and policy studies would be implemented according
to a schedule specified in the Action Program (par&. 5).
8.        Proiect Sustainability.  Commitment to addressing critical sector
issues under the Action Program is reflected in the Government's health sector
policies which are already targetting efficiency, equity and quality issues
and the country's Seventh Five-Year Plan (1992-96) which in its health sector
chapter sets specific goals and allocates resources. A significant step that
has already been taken was the creation of the Korea Hospital Management
Institute in 1991. The proposed present investment can be easily amortized by
the borrowing institutions as the expense would be less than two percent of
their annual operating budgets and the investment would generate additional
revenue.
9.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  The Bank's first
prej4ect in the health sector was a population project (Ln. 1774-KO), which was
approved in 1979 and closed in 1987. Project performance was satisfactory.
The PPAR (No. 8895, June 29, 1990) praised the major redesign of the project
during implementation to meet the rapidly changing needs of Korea's health
sector and its support for loans to private hospitals. A second project,
Health Technology Project (Ln. 3330-KO) approved in May 1991, focusses on
private sector hospitals, on equity and efficiency in the diffusion of medical
technology to private hospitals and private sector development; and would
strengthen the institutional capacity of MOHSA for planning and managing
hospital sector development and financing. Implementation of the project has
successfully commenced.
10.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The Korean health care system is
well structured and maturing rapidly. Through the proposed project the Bank's
involvement would: (a) introduce improvements in allocating equipment to
increase access to medical services by the urban and rural poor seeking care
in public hospitals; (b) continue policy dialogue through the preparation and
implementation of an action plan and research studies on major health policy
issues; (c) increase Government's effectiveness in carrying out its mandated
public health protection responsibilities for monitoring the safety and
quality of food and drugs more efficiently; and (d) support the institutional
development of MOHSA and the health policy decision making process. The Bank
would also gain experience in helping a middle-income country adapt to an
epidemiological transition which could be utilized in similar countries.
11.       Actions Aareed.  During negotiations, the Government agreed that:
(i) loan proceeds would be allocated and equipment selected according to
criteria and guidelines acceptable to the Bank; (ii) the subsidiary loan
agreement acceptable to the Bank would be applied to all subloans; (iii) the
Health Sector Policies and Cost Containment Action Program would be carried
out as agreed with the Bank; and (iv) the PIU and the ESC would be maintained
until completior of the project. The signing of subsidiary loan agreements
with MNC and NIH would be a condition of loan effectiveness, and with
municipalities and provinces it would be a condition of disbursement.

12.       Imoact on Women and Environmental Aspects.  The equipment to be
procured under this proposed project would be available to diagnose and treat
all citizens. The project is therefore gender neutral. It is not expected to
result in any negative environmental impact.
13.       Program Objective Catepories.  The primary objective of the project
is to increase access to medical services by the urban and rural poor.
Support under the project to public hospitals would directly benefit the poor.
Public hospitals account for only 102 of hospitals in Korea but they care for
the majority of the poor. In 1989, public assistance patients accounted for
411 of inpatients and 252 of outpatients in public hospitals.
14.       Proiect Benefits.  As a result of the project, about half of the
public hospitals in Korea serving mainly the poorer population groups will
have upgraded and modernized their biomedical equipment. This will allow them
to detect and treat noncommunicable diseases more effectively and give the
smaller and more rural facilities the capability to treat more patients
themselves, and thus decrease the flow of referrals to higher level hospitals.
The MNC will have upgraded its biomedical equipment for early detection and
opportune treatment of noncommunicable diseases. NIH will have improved
efficiency in monitoring food safety, drug quality and communicable diseases
in order to better protect the public health. A Health Sector Policies and
Cost Containment Action Program will have facilitated making policy decisions
to contain health care expenditures without jeopardizing access to services
and quality of medical care.
15.       Proiect Risks. There are no major risks in this project. A minor
risk might be defaulting by project institutions. However, the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) under the ongoing Health Technology Project is
operating in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and it is expected that the PIU
for the proposed project will also perform satisfactorily and closely monitor
loan repayments. The experience with on-lending under the population project
was also positive and there were no arrears. The risk of slippage in
implementing the Action Program and the research studies would be addressed
through semi-annual supervision missions to maintain the policy dialogue.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
