MNMORANDUM AND RECOmmENDATON OF THS PREsDENT
OF TE INTERNATiONAL BANK FOR REcoNSTRucFIoN AND DEvELoiNzNT
TO THE ExEcuTIVE DuEcroRs
ON A PROPOSED LoAN TO THE
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
FOR AN EMERGENCY OIL SPLL RECOVERY AND MmGATIoN PROMECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Russian Federation for the equivalent of US$99 million to help finance
an Emergency Oil Spill Recovery and Mtigation Project. The loan would be at the World
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including five years' grace.
The proceeds of the loan would be on-lent to Komineft at an interest rate 75 basis points above
the primary loan's interest rate, for a term of 15 years, including a 5 year grace period.
Cofinancing of US$25 million equivalent for the Project is expected from the European Bank
for Reconstrution and Development (EBRD).
2.          CounDy Policies and World Bank Group Assistance SmMegy. The most recent
discussion of the Bank's Country Assistnce Strategy (CAS) was on May 19, 1994. At that time
the Bank recommended an Intermediate Case lending program, on the order of US$1.0 to
US$1.5 billion anually, not including adjustment lending. The program would be composed of
a core set of projects, largely in the infrastructure and social sectors, and an additional set of
projects that would go forward only when the Goverment satisfied key conditions for sectoral
reforms. Due to its emergency nmatre, the proposed Project falls outside these definitions. It
does, however, address a severe environmental situation and will help to improve the
performance of the energy sector infrastructure. The proposed project is, therefore, consistent
with the objectives of the most recent CAS and is justified for a priority use of Bank resources
in supporting the program of stabilization and structural reforms in Russia.
3.          Scope of the Emergency. During 1994 one of the world's largest oil spills
occurred in the Usinsk region of the Komi Republic as a result of leaks from the regional
pipeline. Subsequent failure, in autmn 1994, of temporaiy dams and diles constucted to
contain the oil resulted in significant environmental and health impacts on downstream
communities. In excess of 100,000 tons (730,000 barrels) of oil are estimated to remain trapped
in bogs and creek beds, three times the amount released during the Exxon Valdez spill.
Contament structres have been built in some areas to hold the oil but large amounts of the
oil remain at risk of release when spring thaw raises water levels by up to 9 meters. Significant
new stucres and reinforcement of existing structures to contain the oil need to be completed
in the very short time prior to spring thaw. The Government of Russia and Komineft, the
pipeline operator, lack the resources to adequately cope with the problem. Release of the oil into
the river systms could devastate the downstream cmunities as well as cause significant
ecological damage in the xegion.
4.          Additional significant spills are likely without immediate rehabilitation of the
pipeline, in particular, completion of replacement of those parts of the pipeline with the highest
risk of failure. The alternative of shutting the pipeline down until remediation is complete is not
feasible due to the economic importance of the pipeline to the region. The pipeline annually
transports over $750 million of oil (at world market prices) production, which direcdy and



2
indirectly supports tie employment of over 20,000 people. Oil production and transport is also
importat to provide fuel for the heating plant seving the Usinsk region. Furthernore, oil flows
can also only be arested for a brief duration, particularly in the winter, before the oil in te
pipeline, gatheing lines, and oil wels begin to solidify due to the nature of the oil. If complete
solidification occurred, wells and pipelines could reqwire abandonment or expensive and risky
measures to effect restart.
5.          Backgmniwdto the Prvject. Russia's oil sector, which is essenti to the country's
economic reform efforts, has a history of oil losses from gathering lines and pipelines. One of
the world's largest oil spills occurred in the Komi region last year, with serious leaking from
the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline. In October 1994 the Komi Republic Emergency Situations
Commission declared an emergency situation in the Kolva River area. The Russian Government
lacs the funds to filly contain and stabilize the spilled oil before the spring thaw, to avoid
further extensive contmination of downstream rivers in the Pechora Basin and, possibly, the
release of oil into the Barents Sea. The downstream rivers are the main source of water for
communities along the rivers, and they contain significant populations of fish and wildlife which
are important ecologically, as weln as to subsistence users. Their floodplains are also heavily
relied upon for livestock gazing. The spill area is a migration corridor for herded reindeer.
Thus, large-scale releases from  the spill sites could have extensive   n-health and
environmental consequences.
6.          This sitation was dised with Government during Mr. Preston's visit to Russia
in November 1994 and resulted in an offer of Bank assistance if Russian techmical 6i14 financial
ources proved insufficien. The Prime Miniser of Russia wrote to the Bank on Janumay 23,
1995 requesig emergency assistance in containment and cleanup of the existing situation,
mitigatig against similar events in the future and in mobilizing international assistance. in
agreeing to prepare an Emergency Project, the Bank noted that financing could not be mobilized
quicldy enough to perform essential work before the spring thaw in the Komi Republic and asked
that Komineft engage an international mamgement contractor (IMC) to begin work by early
March and that Govermment provide US$12 million to fund initial payments to the IMC before
donor financing became available. Komineft selected the IMC on February 13, the Government
ansferred US$12 million to the account of Komineft and continment and cleanup operations
have commenced.
7.          The 146 kan Kharyaga-Usinsk regional pipeline, which has a capacity of 220,000
barels of fluid per day (bpd) and curently evacates about 140,000 bpd of oil, is owned and
operated by Komnmeft, the regional oil and gas production association, and connects a number
of producing areas' to the main oil trunkline system operated by Transneft. The Kharyaga-
nludg the Polar Lights Projeat in whih IFC and EBRD he invesms. Polar lights sells its oil
to Komineft which then tansports it through the Kbaryaga-Usinsk pipdine and onward into the nationa
Trmseft system for export to Eumpe. Total a-tem production in the region served by the pipeline
include 4 million ons per yea (80,000 bpd) produwed by Kominef and at least 3 million tons (60,000
bpd) produced by four joint ventures, KomiArcicOil, Polar lights, Nobel Oil, and KomiQuest.



S
Usinsk pipeline was built piecemeal2 over the period 1975-1989 and has had a history of leaks,
caused in part by intenal corrosion related to the large amount of formation brines in the fluids,
produced largely from Komineft's own oil wells, which are not separated prior to pipeline
transport. Komineft replaced 47 km of the southern section of pipeline, source of most of the
recent spills, with a new parallel pipeline in January 1995 and has also completed 60% of the
rest of the pipeline's southern and middle sections. These incomplete sections represent the
highest risk for new oil leaks. A Russian contractor on site is continuing work on the
replacement pipeline with interm commercial bank financing arranged by Komineft and EBRD.
The new lines are of unknown integrity, so detailed surveys and integrity testing of them is
necessary. Dewatering/treatment facilities at the production sites and replacement of water
injection lines, which are leaking produced salt water into the environment, are also required
to extend the life of the replacement pipeline. Development of an entirely new pipeline may be
required to prevent leaking in the longer term.
8.          Project Objectives. The objectives of the Project are to assist Komineft and the
Russian Federation to: (i) stabilize the oil in the spill area prior to spring thaw to mnimize the
amount of oil released during runoff and prevent ecological damage in the Pechora River Basin;
(ii) contie cleanup in an enviro lly appropriate way and minimize, to the extent possible
given the limited time available and difficult site conditions, damage to the impacted areas and
people; (iii) support safe pipeline operations in the near term and evaluate the need for a
replacement pipeline investment project for the longer term; and (iv) identify and implement
other measures to mitigate against future oil spills.
9.         ProjectDescripton. The Project would provide financing to support an emergency
operation that would include: (i) containment and cleanup of the spill, envirnmental monitoring
of the affected areas, and assistance to affected people; (i) completion of the replacement of the
remaining southern and entire middle sections of the pipeline and investment in associated
pipeline facilities to enhance safe operations, including completing partally built water
separation facilities; (iii) integrity assessment of the southern, middle and northern sections of
the pipeline end undertking repair and remediation as required; (iv) enhancement of the
emergency spill repair, containment and recovery capacity for Komineft; and (v) studies for
future oil transport options, including a possible dry oil pipeline, to mitigate against similar spills
in the Komineft system. Details on the Project compones are given in the Technical Annex.
10.         Project Cost and Fiwwing Pan. The total cost of the Project, net of taxes and
duties, is estimated at $140 million, including $21.1 million for physical conigencies and $3.5
million for price contngencies. The high physical contingncies are due to the uncertainty about
the amount of oil that will be contained in current sites and the amount that will flow into the
river systems after the spring thaw and require urgent and extensive recovery operations. The
proposed World Bank and EBRD loans would finance 100% of foreign costs and 75% of local
costs (net of duties and taxes), primarily those of the pipeline replacement contractor which is
Russian, and through sub-contraing to be organized by the IMC. The high level of local cost
fnancing is necessitated by the financial constraints of Komineft and the high expected levels

northem section in 1986.

of local procurement in the Project. The World Bank would finane $99 million, the EBRD $25
million and Komineft $16 million of total costs net of taxes and duties, which are estimated at
Rb1SO billion and are to be covered by Komineft.
11.        Reracdtive Fnancing. Up to 20% of the Bank loan (US$20 million) and $2.5
million of the EBRD loan would be eligible for retroactive financing for expenses incured after
March 1. 1995 for the containment and cleanup contract and for the pipeline replacement
completion contract. The large level of retroactive financing is pemitted under the Bank's
Operational Directive on Emergency Recovery Assistance (OD 8.50) and is justified by the fact
that coutainment and cleanup operations and completion of replacement of the pipeline sections
most at risk of furtier failures had to be undertake prior to spring thaw (late April-early May)
and well before Bank financing would be available. Procurement for the retroactive expenditures
has been according to World Bank and EBRD rules.
12.         Prject Implementadon. The Russian Federation wiil be the Borrower of the
World Bank loan, which it will on-lend to Komineft. At the request of Ministry of Finance
(MOF), the government of the Komi Republic has signed a Declaration of Commitment to the
objectives of the Project and to take all measures within its control to facilitate project
implementation. The Loan Agreement and the Project Agreement will not become effective until:
(i) signaure of the subsidiary loan agreement between Komineft and the Ministry of Finance;
(ii) presentation of legal opinions rehting to the Loan Agreement, the Project Agreement, and
the subsidiary loan agreement; and (iii) effectiveness of the EBRD loan. 'he EBRD Loan will
also be made to the Russian Federation and on-lent to Komineft.
13.        Komineft will coordinate and have overall responsibility for the physical execution
and technical aspects of the Project, including maintaining compliance with conditions and
overseeing disbursements and financial record keeping of the Project. In order to facilitate rapid
Project implementation a high level Emergency Oil Spill Recovery and Mitigation Project
Working Group has been established by the Russian Government to resolve legal, administrative,
fiscal and general implementation issues and expedite necessary clearances. The Working Group
is chaired by the Minister of Fuel and Energy and includes high level representation from the
Russian Federation, the Komi Republic and Komineft.
14.         The Project will be implemented with the assistance of the IMC which is
experienced in land cleamnp under Arctic  itons and a local pipeline contractor to complete
emergency pipeline replacement. Pipeline inspection services and remediaiion works will be
undertaken by pipeline contractors experienced in arctic construction. Environmental consulting
senrvces from an international firm experne   in the region will provide assistance i
environmental monitoring and management including development of enviromental guidelines
for the cleanup. Procurement is complete for the IMC and emergency pipeline replacemet
contracts and according to Bank prourement rules. Othr  procurment aangements for the
proposed Project would follow the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement, with the emergency
siuation justifying a higher usage of non-ICB procurement methods than is customary for normal
operatons, as the Bank's Operational Directieve on Emergency Recovery Assistance (OD 8.50)
supports. Direct contracting was used to engage the IMC for spill coninment and cleanup and
for a separate contract with the eisting local pipeline contractor for emergency pipeline



5
replacement work to complete the replacement of the southern and middle sections of the
pipeline. All consultant services would be acquired using the applicable Bank guidelines.
15.         Project Sustainabiliy. The Project includes measures to rehabilitate the existing
pipeline, improve pipeline operations and enhance emergency response capabilities to ensure
sustainable and safe pipeline operations in the future. Komineft will establish a pipeline
maintenance fund to ensure adequate funding for future pipeline operations. The Project will
also support development of options for pipeline replacement in the longer term.
16.         Lessons Learnedfrom Previous Bank Operzions. Lessons from past emergency
lending operations3 emphasize the importance of simple and effective implementation
arrangements. Previous Bank experience in oil pipeline emergency recovery efforts is limited
to the Ecuador Emergency Petroleum Reconstruction Project (Loan L2803, US$80 million,
FY87). That project was successful due to the commitment of the borrower to the project and
to the assignment of the management and execution of the emergency pipeline repairs to an
international oil company familiar with the situation. In the proposed project, Komineft has
engaged an international firm for contaimnent and cleanup familiar with the Komi region and
with experience in oil spill cleanup efforts in Arctic conditions, and a Russian firm experienced
in the region to complete emergency pipeline replacement. Govermnent's commitment to the
project has been demonstrated by providing US$12 million to finance the IMC until World Bank
and EBRD fmnancing can be made available to reimburse Komineft. Komineft has also obtained
short term credits to fmance the emergency pipeline work prior to loan effectiveness. The fact
that Komineft is fully responsible for environmental cleanup and pipeline reconstruction will also
simplify implementation of the longer term options for oil spill mitigation in the region.
17.         Lessons learned from previous projects in Russia indicate the need to: (i) identify
consistent counterparts with authority to move the project forward; (ii) coordinate among key
parties on critical issues; (iii) involve local consultants and institutes in the process; (iv)
streamline the Government's procedures for loan signing and effectiveness after Board approval;
and (v) set up early in the Project a Project hnplementation Unit with experienced advisers to
facilitate procurement. The fact that Government has requested Bank assisance on an emergency
basis, is willing to pre-finance the IMC on Komineft's behalf, and has set up a special
coordination and oversight working group indicates that a substantial level of coordination and
commitment to the project has already been achieved. It is also anticipated that the IMC will
make maximum use of local resources and sub-contractors already engaged in containment and
cleanup activities. Consultants experienced in procurement matters have already been engaged
to assist Komineft.
18.         Rationalefor World BankInvolvement. Government has indicated that Komineft
and Government cannot deal with this enviromnental disaster without external assistance.
Specifically: (i) they lack the technical and financial resources to complete the cleanup in time
to prevent an ecological disaster; and, (ii) other donors have made it clear that they will not
assist Russia without Bank involvement. The Bank has agreed to assist Russia through an
Emergency Loan since an urgent response is vital, the enviromnental impact of the spill is

6
substantial and, without immediate action, the situation is likely to deteriorate, with additional
spills highly likely. The proposed Project is justified on the basis of the sev-rity of the present
and potential environmental disaster, as well as the importance of securing continuation of oil
production in a sustainable way in the Komi region. In addition, this emergency operation
should provide a vehicle for studying and introducing oil spill mitigation measures in Russia's
pipeline network.
19.          Agreed Actions. To facilitate implementation of the Project the Head of the Komi
Republic has signed two decrees to accelerate project implementation: (i) permits, licenses and
cleanup methods will be approved by one government official on an emergency basis; and (ii)
the $75 million in fines imposed on Komineft by the local environmental authority for spills,
which accrue to the Komi Republic will be used by Komineft for expenditures under the Project.
20.           During negotiations, Komineft agreed to the following future actions with respect
to Project implementation: (i) maintenance of a Project Implementation Unit with management
and staffing acceptable to the Bank; (ii) provision of effective and timely emergency social
assistance to affected communities; (iii) maintenance of a 1.5 debt service ratio; (iv) maintenance
of acceptable levels of working capital; (v) submission of Project accounts and financial
statements audited by an auditor acceptable to the Bank; and (vi) preparation of an
Implementation Completion Report and project operational plan.
21.           Actions to be taken prior to loan effectiveness will be: (i) signature of a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Russian Federation and Komineft; (ii) receipt of legal opinions in
respect to the Loan Agreement, Project Agreement and the subsidiary loan agreement; and (iii)
effectiveness of the EBRD loan.
22.           Environmental Aspects. The Project has not been given an environmental rating,
in accordance with emergency procedures, although the cleanup and mitigation actions are
expected to have a significant beneficial impact on the environment.  Although a full
Environmental Assessment Report is not practical in this emergency situation and will not be
required, an environmental analysis report has been prepared which addresses relevant factors
to the greatest extent possible. Indeed, without the Project the potential negative consequences
from further discharges of oil in the spring will far exceed the potential impacts of the
emergency project. Nonetheless, there are a number of impacts4 associated with oil spills that
can be reduced by selection of appropriate cleanup technologies, close monitoring of cleanup
operations, provision of adequate backup oil contaimnent structures, and the establishment of
clear guidelines and procedures to protect the most sensitive areas. Safeguarding the interests
and health of people in the spill-impacted area is also of concern. The proposed Project includes
4 These impacts include: physical interference to habitats associated with the construction of earthen
berns, dams, and dikes to contain the oil; alterations of water drainage networks by construction of
roads, dikes, ditches, etc.; physical effects on vegetation and substrates during oil recovery operations
in bogs, swamps, and stream channels; mixing of oil deeper into the substrate during mechanical
removal operations; inadvertent releases to waterbodies during cleanup operations; alteration of
vegetation and air-quality impacts from in-situ burning of oil; disposal of oily wastes in landfills;
disposal of oily water separated from treated oil; siting and preparation of work areas and storage sites;
and longer-term effects from remaining oil residues after cleanup has been terminated.

technical assistance to help Komineft develop strategies for anticipating environmental and
human-health problems and taking actions to prevent or minimize them.
23.         Program Objecdvc Categories. The proposed Project supports several aspects of
the Bank's program objectives including: (i) reducing environmental pollution in the longer term
by introducing mitigation measures that will curtail liquid emission and oil leakages; (ii)
providing sustainable oil production and promoting an environment that will attract private
investment therein; and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity in terns of the petroleum
industry's ability to deal with oil spills in the future.
24.         Participatory Approach. The Komi oil spill has attracted worldwide attention
from environmentally concerned NGOs and the public in general because of its size and the
threat to the Pechora Basin. Until approaching the Bank, Government and Komineft have issued
a number of differing statements about the impact of the spill and their need for external
assistance. The Bank has had informal contacts with major environmental NGOs regarding the
situation and has determined that continued efforts should be made to consult informally with
NGOs regarding project design and environmental criteria for cleanup. Regional NGOs in the
Komi Republic, such as the Committee for the Revival of the Komi People, the Consultative
Committee of Finno-Ugric Peoples, and the Save the Pechora Committee, have been consulted
about project design; the latter committee is assisting in the socio-demographic assessment of
the present and future needs of affected people.
25.         Project Benefits. The main benefits from the proposed Project are: (i) the
prevention of a continued ecological disaster if oil not contained before the spring thaw
contaminates the Pechora Basin; and (ii) restoration of safe pipeline operations in the Konii
region. In addition, the Project will undertake to identify and implemerit measures to mitigate
against such oil spills in the future. The environmental benefits are thus substantial, but difficult
to quantify. Compared with the alternative of shutting down the Kharyaga-Usinsk pipeline, at
present transporting $750 million of oil (at world market prices) per annum and directly and
indirectly employing 20,000 people, the benefit-cost ratio of the Project is in cxcess of 15 times.
Assuming that the present capacity utilization remains constant, the pipeline should generate
annual revenues in excess of $25 million. The direct financial return of the pipeline over the
expected 10 year life of the replacement infrastructure would be in excess of 30%, and the
Project's net present value would be in excess of $65 million at a 15% discount rate.
26.         Risks. The proposed Project has been developed as a series of measures to
minimize potential environmental damage and significant financial loss, under conditions of
severe risk and very limited time. Under ideal conditions neither the containment and cleanup
nor the pipeline replacement measures proposed would be undertaken exactly as planned.
27.         There is a very short time period available to construct a number of significant
new contaiment structures and to stegthen the existing, inadequately designed, structures
needed to hold the spilled oil during spring run off. Completion of the replacement of critically
weak parts of the middle section of the pipeline, a good part of which is inaccessible in the
summer, will also be very difficult in the short time available until spring break up. Complete
success of these operations is unlikely. Oil will be spilled into the river systems and there will
continue to be a risk of further leaks from the pipe' ne. However, even partial success is better



8
than inaction, which carries signiificantly greater risk of loss. Significant release of spilled oil
would result in an ecological disaster in the Pechora River. Failure to improve the condition
of the pipeline could result in major new oil spills. Shutdown would mean the loss of major
portions of Komineft's oil production capacity and thus, considerable social impacts.
28.        Implementation of the cleanup operation itself is a major risk since it will depend
upon the cooperation of Komineft and local and international contractors as well as Government
authorities in Moscow and Syktyvkar (capital of the Komi Republic). Govcrnment's
commitments will be necessary to ensure rapid customs clearance of urgently-needed equipment
and accelerated clearance of the cleanup work plan. This risk has been largely addressed
through the provision of special decrees by the Komi Republic, which, inter-alia, provide for
accelerated clearance procedures.
29.         Komineft's pressing financial needs may hinder Project implementation and may
also outweigh its adopting best practices in pipeline operations. The Bank, by association, may
be perceived as condoning the continued operation of faulty pipelines. This risk has been
addressed through the inclusion of Project components designed to improve pipeline operations
and reduce the risk of future failures. Komineft also faces fines in excess of $75 million which
if enforced would severely restrict its ability to resume proper funding for maintenance and
operations. This risk has been minimized through a resolution of the Komi Republic allowing
Komineft to apply loan expenditures as a credit against the fnes.
30.         Toe ultimate cost of the cleanup is highly uncertain and could exceed the loan
amount. To mitigate against this risk, the management contract govering the containment and
cleanup activities has been structured to provide an ongoing monitoring of contract progress and
costs and to provide an opportunity to terminate the work once maximum cleanup benefits, that
are technologically and economically feasible, have been attained. EBRD has agreed to finance
the services of an international fim to assist Komineft in monitoring these costs.
31.         Finally, existing technology may be inadequate to fully cope with the spill
conditions and there is a possibility that some of the measures taken to combat the spread of the
spill may prove to be as deleterious as the spill itself. Environmental guidelines under which
the cleanup will be conducted will be developed by enviromental consultants with due regard
to best international practice. These consultants will also review the work plan of the IMC and
prepare an economic assessment of the mitigation efforts to ensure that the cleanup is cost
effective and that bio1 4hysical and socio-economic impacts of the cleanup are taken into account.
32.         Recommendaidon. I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the World Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed Loan.
