Operation Type           Standalone, single-tranche


Main Policy Areas        The operation will focus on two specific policy areas: (a)
                         strengthening the PA’s fiscal position by undertaking reforms to (i)
                         increase government revenues and (ii) improve the efficiency of public
                         expenditures; and (b) enhancing governance and transparency in the
                         public sector.
Key Outcome Indicators   Selected Key Outcome Indicators for 2013 are as follows (baseline is
                         2012):

                            Domestic revenues from Value-Added Tax (VAT), customs, and
                             income tax combined in 2013 have increased by at least 10 percent
                             in nominal terms and are higher as a share of GDP compared to
                             2012.
                            The 2013 central government nominal wage bill growth has not
                             exceeded 4.25 percent (in Shekel terms) and is lower as a percent
                             of GDP than the 2012 wage bill.
                            The number of households in the “vulnerable category? has not
                             exceeded 19,200.
                            The share of outside referral costs to total public healthcare
                             spending has decreased by at least two percentage points in 2013
                             compared to the 2012 figure of 31 percent.
                            The conduct of public procurement is based on new implementing
                             regulations to the Public Procurement Law, as well as on the
                             National Standard Bidding Documents for Goods, Works and
                             Consultants Services, and Procurement Manual.
Program Development      DPG V has been designed to support the achievement of the following
Objective(s) and         development objectives in the context of the PA’s National
Contribution to CAS      Development Plan (NDP): (a) strengthening the fiscal position by
                         undertaking reforms to (i) increase government revenues and (ii)
                         improve the efficiency of public expenditures; and (b) laying the
                         institutional foundations for improved governance and transparency in
                         the public sector. The operation will directly contribute to Pillar 1 of

                                               i
                            the ISN, aimed at strengthening the institutions of a future state to
                            efficiently manage public finances and ensure services to citizens.
Risks and Risk Mitigation   The NDP’s success depends on parallel actions by the PA, the
                            Government of Israel (GoI) and the donor community.
                            The key risks are:
                             A highly volatile and uncertain political situation, primarily due to
                                 the lack of progress in peace negotiations and the political split
                                 between the West Bank and Gaza.
                               Dependence on large levels of donor aid, not only to finance
                                recurrent budget expenditures but also as a driver of growth.
                               Lower than expected economic growth due to external and internal
                                stressors.
                               Substantial fiduciary risks.
                            The above risks cannot be fully mitigated by the current operation.
                            However, the operation was designed to minimize the likelihood and
                            the potential impact of some of the abovementioned risks. The
                            proposed fifth DPG sends a strong signal to donors that the World
                            Bank places great importance on progress of the NDP and that donors
                            should continue to support it. Most importantly, the operation
                            leverages around US$200 million per year in additional financing
                            through the multi-donor PRDP Trust Fund, which the Bank
                            administers. This mitigates the risk of declining levels of donor
                            assistance to the PA’s finances. A simple design and strong PA
                            ownership of the reform program supported by this operation, which
                            contribute to fiscal consolidation and consequently reduced reliance on
                            donor assistance, are also mitigating factors. Fiduciary risks are
                            mitigated through additional arrangements discussed in Chapter VI,
                            Section D. On balance, the potential benefits of the operation justify
                            the Bank’s engagement despite the significant risks identified above.

                          PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
                 PROPOSED FIFTH DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT
                 TO THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION
               (FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY)


                                           I.    INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed DPG V is a standalone operation aimed at supporting the Palestinian
Authority (PA) in implementing some of the reform priorities under its National Development
Plan (NDP) as well as some recently emerged reform priorities.1 Against the backdrop of
shrinking donor support in recent years and the associated fiscal challenges, the PA is making efforts
to keep the NDP on track, while responding to some new reform challenges. The DPG V will provide
support to the PA’s 2013 budget in the amount of US$ 40 million. While this is a standalone
operation, it builds upon the reform progress of the previous four DPGs in several policy areas.

2.       DPG V will support the reforms designed under the NDP in two broad areas: (a)
strengthening the PA’s fiscal position; and (b) laying the institutional foundations for improved
governance and transparency in the public sector. The operation supports efforts seen as crucial by the
PA to overcoming the urgent fiscal issues, reducing the PA’s reliance on foreign assistance for
recurrent expenditures while increasing the efficiency of government expenditure programs. In
addition, the operation supports improving governance and transparency in the areas that are important
for better management of public finances.

3.       DPG V, as envisaged in the 2012-2014 Interim Strategy Note, remains a key instrument
aimed at supporting the PA’s strategic priorities, advancing the policy dialogue, and also
providing essential financing for the PA’s budget. Given the severity of the political situation, in
particular the constraints to the PA’s authority in Gaza, it receives few revenues from Gaza. Public
sector investment and growth are constrained by various restrictions imposed by the Government of
Israel (GoI), and donor assistance continues to provide a life line to the PA’s budget. The financial
significance of this operation is not only in that it provides US$ 40 million in Bank financing, but that
it directly leverages the support of other donors through the PRDP Trust Fund in the amount of
roughly US$ 200 million per year. The operation also provides a positive signaling effect to other
donors who provide assistance directly to the PA.


                                     II.        COUNTRY CONTEXT

A.       POLITICAL CONTEXT

4.      There has been no recent progress on the Israeli / Palestinian political dialogue, and
peace negotiations have been on hold for a period of three years. Palestinians continue to refuse
negotiations until Israel halts all settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, while the
Government of Israel has continued to expand settlements at an increasing rate. Despite strong
opposition from Israel, the PA submitted a new application to the United Nations (UN) General
Assembly seeking recognition as a non-member state, after failing to secure full membership the
previous year. The UN General Assembly voted in favor of this application on November 29, 2012.
The positive vote opened the door to the Palestinian Authority to apply for membership in different
UN agencies but put a further strain on its relationship with Israel. Israel unexpectedly suspended

 New reform priorities are related to heightened fiscal challenges, which are primarily the result of faster-than-
anticipated reduction in the levels of donor aid flows. Details of the support program are discussed in Chapter V.

and remitted lower than accrued amounts in January, February and March to collect utility and other
debts owed to it by different entities of the Palestinian Authority.2 Recent diplomatic moves are
receiving considerable attention and some are optimistic that the peace process will restart.

5.       Reconciliation talks between Fatah and Hamas were recently revived, but no final
agreement has yet been reached. The military confrontation between Hamas and Israel that took
place in November 2012 rekindled internal calls to end the Palestinian divide. The Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas and the Hamas leader, Khaled Meshaal, met in Cairo last January and
agreed to renew efforts to implement the unity deal that was signed two years ago. Among other
things, they agreed to form a national unity government headed by Abbas and to hold the long overdue
presidential and parliamentary elections. The two sides have since showed signs of good will and
allowed rallies supporting each other’s parties in the West Bank and in Gaza for the first time since the
2007 divide. Hamas also permitted the central election committee to resume the registration of voters
in the Gaza Strip. Recent statements by both parties, however, confirm that they have not yet agreed
on a joint program to end the institutional division. Furthermore, disagreements over which party
should be in charge of organizing the elections continue to stand in the way of a final unity deal . The
Palestinian Legislative Council has not been operational since the internal divide emerged. This has
made the reform process increasingly difficult as Presidential decrees to pass laws are used sparingly.

6.       The Arab Spring has added new variables to the Palestinian-Israeli equation. Revolutions
in the region have signaled the risk of the status quo to both Palestinian and Israeli leaders. Events in
Egypt placed uncertainty on the future of Arab states’ relations with Israel, while the unrest in Syria
could have implications for the support to the political party of Hamas, which forms the de facto
authority in Gaza. Moreover, these events in the region further complicated the peace process.

7.       Civil unrest and repeated civil service strikes have recently added to the complex
political situation. In September, Palestinian protestors took to the streets of the West Bank to
demonstrate against the rising cost of living. Protests began after the four percent increase in fuel
prices that came into force in early September 2012, in line with a recent price hike in Israel. The PA
has also raised the VAT rate from 14.5 to 15 percent following an increase in the VAT rate in Israel.3
These measures immediately translated into higher prices for Palestinians whose real wages had
already declined by almost 3 percent in 2011.4 In addition, more than 154,000 civil servants have been
on regular strikes to protest against frequent delays in their salary payments, which have been paid in
tranches since June 2012. This has led to a decline in the quality of public service delivery in the West
Bank and Gaza (WB&G).

B.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

8.      After growing at an annual rate of 11 percent during 2010-2011, growth of the
Palestinian economy has recently slowed down significantly. According to the Palestinian Central
Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), the real GDP growth rate in the West Bank and Gaza declined to 5.9
percent in 2012, as growth dropped both in Gaza and the West Bank. For instance, between 2010 and
2011, Gaza was growing at an average annual rate of 15 percent. This high growth rate reflected the
low base from which it started and could be attributed to a combination of higher aid inflows, the

  The Government of Israel has publically stated that it is not withholding revenues from the Palestinian
Authority, but that it is deducting utility and other debts owed to it by different public agencies of the Palestinian
Authority.

  The Paris Protocol of the Oslo Peace Accords indicates that the PA will maintain its VAT rate within two
percentage points of that in Israel and that the differential in oil derivative product prices should not exceed eight
percent.

easing of restrictions on entry of goods from Israel, and increased imports through tunnels from Egypt.
In 2012, however, Gaza’s growth rate dropped to 6.6 percent. This is attributed to the waning of the
rebound effect and to a strong decline in the agriculture and fishing sector due to frequent electricity
blackouts and unfavourable weather conditions. Growth in the West Bank has mainly been driven by
an expansion of the services sector, particularly real estate activities, health, and education in addition
to wholesale and retail trade. Average real GDP growth in the West Bank exceeded 9 percent between
2010 and 2011, but it declined to 5.6 percent during 2012 reflecting lower donor aid and the absence
of further progress in easing of restrictions on internal movement and exports. Consequently, growth
in the exports of goods accounted to a mere 3 percent in nominal terms.

9.      The decomposition of recent growth trends in the West Bank and Gaza underscores the
importance of aid in driving the economy. Most of the growth witnessed over the last years was in
the public and non-tradable sectors and was driven by donor-supported PA expenditures. To illustrate,
public administration and defence and other public services5 grew from 20 percent of GDP in 1994 to
25 percent in 2012 (Figure 1 below). Meanwhile, the manufacturing and agriculture sectors,
constrained by the Israeli restrictions on movement and access, declined from 19 to 10 percent and 13
to 5 percent respectively. The pattern was similar in both the West Bank and Gaza.

10.      Economic activity in the private sector has not expanded sufficiently to enable the PA to
significantly reduce its dependence on donor aid. On the contrary, the restriction system put in
place by the GoI continues to stand in the way of potential private investment.6 Movement into and
out of the West Bank remains severely constrained, and Area C, which makes up about 60 percent of
the West Bank territory, is still off limits to almost all Palestinian development.7 Businesses in the
West Bank are hurt by the tight restrictions on import procedures including the sizeable list of “dual
use? items that cannot be imported because the GoI views them as security threats8. Restrictions on
visas for foreign investors and tight restrictions on access to resources such as water and the
electromagnetic spectrum are some of the other constraints affecting private investment. Access to
Gaza remains highly controlled, and only consumer goods and construction material for donor
supervised projects are allowed in. Exports from Gaza are also prohibited, except for certain
agricultural products. In sum, the conditions for sustainable economic growth have not been put in
place.

11.    The recent slowdown in economic growth has also been reflected in higher
unemployment levels, especially among the youth. When compared to Q4 2011, the overall
unemployment rate in the West Bank and Gaza increased by 2 percentage points to reach 22.9 percent
in Q4 2012. In the West Bank, unemployment increased to 18.3 percent even though the labor force

  The Government of Israel states that these restrictions are necessary for security purposes.

  The 1995 Interim Agreement between the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Government of
Israel (GoI), Chapter 2, Article XI, 3c, divided the West Bank into three areas under different jurisdictions;
Areas A, B and C. Area A represents 18 percent of the West Bank and is under full Palestinian security and civil
control and consists primarily of urban centers. Area B comprises 21 percent of the West Bank and is under
Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control and includes mostly peri-urban areas and small towns. Area
C was defined by the Interim Agreement as "areas of the West Bank outside Areas A and B, which, except for
the issues that will be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations, will be gradually transferred to Palestinian
jurisdiction in accordance with this Agreement.?
8
  The dual use list contains goods, raw materials and equipment that in addition to their civilian use can be
utilized for military purposes, and therefore cannot be imported by Palestinian businesses. Dual use trade
restrictions are not uncommon internationally and may serve legitimate security concerns. The list of dual use
items, the import of which to West Bank and Gaza is banned by GoI, is relatively extensive. Consequently,
these restrictions raise the cost of inputs and force Palestinian businesses to use an inefficient input mix and in
some cases drop certain product lines. Most Palestinian industries are negatively affected by the dual use list,
particularly food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, textiles, ICT, agriculture and metal processing.

participation rate decreased from 47.3 to 46.1 between Q4 2011 and Q4 2012. Gaza’s unemployment
rate continues to be amongst the highest in the world at around 32.2 percent in Q4 2012 with a labor
force participation rate of 40 percent. Youth unemployment continues to pose a serious concern. In the
West Bank, only 40.3 percent of young Palestinians aged 15-29 were active participants in the labor
force in Q4 2012, and 27.9 percent of those were unemployed. In Gaza, the youth unemployment rate
was 48.9 percent with a participation rate of 34.2 percent. The persistence of high unemployment
reflects the skewed nature of growth with the expansion of the labor intensive sectors, in particular
manufacturing, constrained by the Israeli trade restrictions. Palestinian youth feels highly discouraged
from joining the labor force because of the lack of opportunities. Previous to the year 2000 when the
second Intifada broke out, a large portion of Palestinian youth was employed in Israel. However,
Israel’s share in the overall West Bank and Gaza employment has declined from 21 percent in 2000 to
around 12 percent9 since 2002 .

                                    Box 1: Poverty in the West Bank and Gaza


    Almost 26 percent of Palestinians lived in poverty in 2011. The overall figure at the national level masks
    a wide regional divergence. In Gaza, the poverty rate was 39 percent, which is more than twice as high as
    that in the West Bank at 18 percent. This regional contrast was driven by the severe economic shock that
    hit Gaza following the internal divide, which led to a dramatic poverty increase in 2007, leaving one in
    two Gazans living below the poverty line.

    Similar to other countries, larger households in the West Bank and Gaza tend to suffer from higher
    poverty levels. In 2011, the highest poverty rate of 50 percent was amongst individuals who are part of
    households comprising 10 or more members. Additionally, the incidence of poverty amongst households
    headed by civil servants was ten percentage points less than those headed by workers in the private
    sector. This is explained by the ongoing strain on private sector activity caused by the Israeli restrictions.

    Notably, social transfers have continued to play a key role in reducing poverty levels, especially in Gaza.
    In the absence of all social programs, the official poverty headcount rate in 2011 would have been 11
    percentage points higher. If these social payments were to be reduced or discontinued, it is expected that
    a large number of households would fall back below the poverty line.


12.      Average inflation for the West Bank and Gaza was contained at 2.8 percent in 2012. In
the West Bank, the average CPI increased by 4.1 percent when compared to 2011 mainly due to
increases in the VAT and fuel prices. The PA raised the VAT rate from 14.5 to 15 percent in
September 2012 following a hike in the VAT rate in Israel. The PA also raised the price of certain fuel
products by 4 percent after fuel prices in Israel were increased. These measures have immediately
translated into higher prices for Palestinians, but not in Gaza. Gaza’s inflation, at 0.5 percent,
continues to be lower than the West Bank’s due to lower prices of petroleum and other products
imported through the tunnels from Egypt, as well as increased and diversified imports of cheaper
consumer goods and foodstuffs as a result of the easing of Israeli restrictions.

13.      In recent years, the PA has succeeded in substantially reducing the recurrent budget
deficit. The Bank estimates show that the deficit has dropped from as much of 23.7 percent of GDP in
2007 to 14.2 percent of GDP in 2012. The trend from the earlier years was reversed in 2012, as the
deficit increased by 1.1 percentage points. This is largely due to the slowdown in growth from 12.2 to

completely banned since the year 2000, following the second Intifada.

5.9 percent in 2012, the failure of the government’s optimistic revenue forecast to materialize , and the
doubling of net lending, the growth of which was commensurate with the deficit increase10.

14.      The PA has been making efforts to strengthen domestic revenues performance, but the
results of these efforts have not substantially materialized yet. Raising income tax revenue has
been a key aim for the PA. Several measures were taken during the current year which raised income
tax revenue to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2012 from 1.5 percent in 2011.11 These measures include raising
the income tax rate on high income categories from 15 to 20 percent, effective January 2012.
Additionally, income tax exemptions for 15 of the leading private sector companies were suspended
for a period of two years (2011-2012). More recent efforts by the PA have been focused on
modernizing the tax administration system, widening the tax base and improving compliance. Work is
currently underway to unify the structure of the tax administration and strengthen the Large Taxpayer
Unit (LTU). The PA has also been discussing with the GoI methods for enhancing clearance revenues’
procedures given their importance as the PA’s main source of income representing around t wo thirds
of total revenues. The two parties have already exchanged letters specifying precise steps; however, no
final agreement has yet been reached.

15.      The PA has also made significant progress in reducing government spending. Recurrent
public expenditure already fell from 48 percent of GDP in 2009 to 34 percent in 2012 (see Table 2
below). The PA has recently adopted additional measures aimed at controlling the wage bill, the
largest spending item, representing 50 percent of current expenditure. These include a complete hiring
and promotions freeze that was announced on August 25, 2012 by a presidential decree to be followed
by a “net zero hiring policy? in 2013. The PA has also applied cuts to the salaries of high ranking
employees, and has cancelled all abroad travel allowances. As a result, the wage bill was reduced
from 26 percent of GDP in 2006 to 17 percent in 2012 (Figure 3 below).

   Net lending stems from Israel’s deductions from clearance revenue payments to the PA on the account of debts
owed to it by the Palestinian power distribution companies, other utility companies and municipalities for
purchased electricity and water services.

   This figure is still below the 3-4 percent of GDP rate in other developing countries in the region such as Jordan
and Lebanon.

16.     In spite of the PA’s reform efforts, lower than expected foreign aid, in addition to
hindering growth, are putting the PA’s fiscal situation under significant stress . Donor aid for
recurrent spending and development projects has declined from US$1.98 billion in 2008 to US$930
million in 2012. This has been compounded by shortfalls in revenue in addition to higher than
expected expenditures, particularly pension payments.12 The lower than expected level of donor aid
had to be compensated from domestic sources instead. This has been causing frequent delays in salary
payments to public employees, accumulation of arrears to the private sector (which now amount to
around US$600 million), and increased borrowing from local commercial banks.

17.     The PA’s external debt, estimated at around 10 percent of GDP, is relatively low, but the
stock of government debt to domestic banks has been growing. External debt, contracted in earlier
years and on largely concessional terms, has been dropping. On the contrary, debt to domestic banks
increased to US$1.4 billion or 14 percent of GDP at end-December 2012 from 10 percent in 2010.

  The PA reports that the majority of the higher than target pensions are payments to retirees from the security
sector. These pension payments were not accounted for in the 2012 budget, however, the PA has continued to
make them.

      18.      When compared to 2011, the external current account deficit as a percentage of GDP is
      estimated to have declined by 0.4 percentage points in 2012. Estimates by the IMF indicate that
      imports as a percentage of GDP increased from 59 percent in 2011 to 61 percent in 2012. Exports of
      goods and services marked a slight increase from 15.4 percent of GDP to 15.8 percent of GDP, but
      still remain among the lowest in the world. Finally, while both net factor income and official transfers
      are estimated to have dropped slightly, private transfers are estimated to have increased from 2.7
      percent of GDP to 4.9 percent of GDP.

      19.      The Palestinian banking sector continues to perform well. The Palestinian Monetary
      Authority (PMA) continues to enhance its institutional capacity and is steadily building the
      capabilities of a central bank. The PA has recently passed a new payments law which enables the
      PMA to introduce a national centralised system for the automated settlement and clearance of financial
      transactions. This system will also enable banks to provide modern e-banking services including e-
      signature. The year-on-year growth of the sector’s net assets was 7.5 percent in December 2012. The
      continuous improvement in the financial markets infrastructure carried out by the PMA has enabled
      the rise in the private credit-to-deposit ratio from 30 percent at the end of 2010 to 38 percent in
      December 2012. However, the sector’s overall loan-to-deposit ratio continues to be lower than in most
      countries at around 56 percent as of December 2012, reflecting a high level of perceived systemic risk.
      At the end of 2012, the percentage of nonperforming loans to total credit remained low at 3.3 percent.

      20.     However, the banking sector is significantly exposed to the PA and this is becoming a
      source of concern. As of end 2012, the PMA reports that the Palestinian banking sector has provided
      around US$1.4 billion in credit facilities to the PA, - about 14 percent of the sector’s total assets and
      112 percent of its equity. Credit to the public sector and PA employees combined represented around
      50 percent of the sector’s gross credit as of December 2012.

      21.     The PMA has been carefully monitoring risks associated with the banking sector’s high
      exposure to the PA through quarterly stress tests according to Basel II principles. These tests
      have been carried out on all banks operating in the West Bank and Gaza since March 2011. The
      results are used to evaluate the banking system’s resilience to numerous economic, political and
      concentration shocks that can lead to delay of loan instalments by the PA in addition to loan

                                                               10
delinquency by PA employees and private businesses. These shocks are tested in nine different
combinations and the banking sector’s capital adequacy is evaluated under each. The latest stress tests’
results indicate that the banking system as a whole is resilient to a variety of shocks and is well
capitalised with the Tier 1 capital as a ratio of risk weighted assets at 22.1 percent by the end of
December 2012. The Tier 1 ratio fell close to the required minimum of 8 percent only under two
extreme scenarios. In order to further strengthen the resilience of the banking sector, the PMA has
ordered some of the larger and more exposed banks to raise their capital, increase their risk reserves,
and diversify their portfolios. Individual banks are also instructed by the PMA to perform their own
semi-annual stress tests using customized scenarios tailored to the specific characteristics of each.

C.      MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

22.      Further growth slowdown in the West Bank and Gaza is expected in 2013. This projection
assumes no significant easing in various movement and access constraints in the West Bank and Gaza.
Controls on trade with East Jerusalem, as well as imports and exports to Israel and foreign markets are
expected to be only modestly eased, and it is assumed that there will be no significant easing of
restrictions on economic activity in Area C. These restrictions pose a binding constraint to tradable
sector growth and consequently to private sector-led growth. As foreign aid to the public sector is not
expected to increase enough to offset the impact of the restrictions on the private sector, as was the
case in earlier years, and space for new domestic borrowing is highly constrained, some fiscal
tightening, liquidity constraints in the private sector caused by PA’s payment arrears, along with the
other factors described above are expected to result in a one percentage point drop in GDP growth to
approximately 5 percent.

23.      Inflation is expected to remain at roughly the 2012 level of around 2-3 percent, but the
West Bank and Gaza remain vulnerable to increases in food and fuel prices. Due to constrained
finances in the public sector and limited fiscal space for public sector wage growth, combined with the
liquidity-constrained private sector, the contribution of wage growth to inflation will be moderate. In
addition, the projected inflation figure takes into account the expectation of Israeli inflation not
exceeding 3 percent and relatively stable prices at international commodity markets. However, given
the dependence on imports for virtually all fuel and much of the food products, the West Bank and
Gaza remain highly vulnerable to international commodity price shocks and import restrictions that
may limit the supply of these goods and result in higher prices. Recent protests in the West Bank over
moderate increases in the rate of VAT and fuel prices attest to that price sensitivity.

24.    The PA’s recurrent fiscal deficit is expected to drop from 14 percent of GDP in 2012 to
10 percent of GDP in 2013, but the financing need would remain large at US$1.2 billion, only to
cover recurrent expenditures and the repayment of salary arrears in the amount of US$72




                                                              11
million accumulated in 2012.13 A further US$350 million are needed to finance development
projects, bringing the total financing need for the 2013 budget to US$1.5 billion. Notably, the PA is
pursuing a two-pronged strategy to improve its fiscal stance. On one hand, it has intensified efforts to
enhance domestic revenue performance through a range of measures (discussed in detail below) and it
is introducing a number of measures to reduce public expenditures. As a result of these measures, and
in particular because of an increase in the excise tax on tobacco, revenues are expected to increase by
2.2 percentage points while expenditures are projected to decline by 1.9 percent. On the other hand,
the PA has intensified efforts to mobilize donor assistance, which it sees crucial to maintaining the
achievement of recent years against the backdrop of restrictions to private sector investment and
growth.

25.      With technical assistance from donors, the PA has prepared a new revenue strategy and
has already started implementing it. The PA is improving the efficiency of tax administration
through measures like the merger of the VAT and customs administrations, and strengthening of the
Large Taxpayers Unit.14 It also plans to simplify tax laws and procedures, introduce risk-based
verification programs and also to introduce taxpayer education and assistance programs. The
establishment of the Tax Identification Unit, which will collect information from third parties and
conduct compliance verification, is expected to boost Personal Income Tax (PIT) compliance.15 These
reforms are expected to increase domestic tax revenues by about 0.5 percentage points of GDP already
in 2013 and further in subsequent years. Furthermore, the PA understands that even a modest
improvement in clearance revenue receipts (which account for 70 percent of all domestic revenues)
would have a substantial payoff. Thus, in July 2012 an understanding was reached between the Israeli
Minister of Finance Steinitz and the PA’s Prime Minister Fayyad, the main objective of which is full
data-sharing pertaining to clearance revenues. Although discussions have been held on the issue, the
final agreement is not in sight yet due to significant differences between the two parties over
implementation modalities. Finally and most significantly, revenue performance in 2013 is expected
to get a sizeable kick from an increase in the excise tax on tobacco by about New Isreali Shekels (NIS)
2 per package, which alone is expected to contribute about US$100 million to revenue growth.16

26.       The PA announced a number of short-term measures and some structural reforms to
improve efficiency and sustainability of public spending. A Cabinet Decision was adopted in
March 2013 introducing a net zero hiring policy for 2013, which means that the number of newly-
hired staff shall not exceed the number of those who retire or depart for other reasons. The wage bill
is expected to drop by about 0.3 percentage points of GDP in 2013 as a result of this and a few other
measures, the PA announced at the very final stages of the budget preparation. In shekel terms the
wage bill is expected to increase by only about two percent. If civil service reforms proceed as
expected, the share of wage bill in GDP will continue dropping over the medium term. The PA’s line
ministries completed the production of job classifications, an important initial step of the much needed
civil service and pay and grading reform. Furthermore, the PA is introducing measures to improve the
targeting and sustainability of social expenditures by improving the efficiency of the cash transfer
program which currently costs US$105 million per year. Measures are also underway to improve the
efficiency of health expenditures, in particular through streamlining the referral costs which increased

13
   The estimate for financing requirements, like the PA’s budget, does not assume a reduction in previously
accumulated non-salary arrears, which would further increase the financing requirement. The PA has stated that
any unexpected excess financing would be used for this purpose.
14
   After some delays a new director was appointed to head the Large Tax Payers Unit.
15
   According to an international expert working on this reform, only about 10 percent of all doctors and lawyers
currently pay PIT. Only by broadening the PIT base by these two categories of professionals, it would be
expected to increase the number of tax payers by 3,000-4,000 individuals. Currently, only around 14,000
individuals pay Personal Income Tax. Thus, the potential for increasing the base is significant and the marginal
return on tax compliance measures is expected to be high.
16
   The increase in tobacco excise tax was done by the Government of Israel and the PA followed with an
equivalent increase.

                                                      12
twenty fold between 2000 and 2011 to a staggering US$150 million per year. Both of these reforms
are supported by this operation (see the Policy Areas section for more details) and have a significant
potential not only to curb two rapidly-growing categories of expenditures, but also to significantly
reduce inefficiencies in social assistance and healthcare programs financed through the PA’s budget.

27.      Unsurprisingly, the reform efforts that are needed to address some of the main sources
of inefficiency in public spending are constrained by political economy and social considerations.
Further reductions in the size of the public sector wage bill, which at 17 percent of GDP remains high
by international standards, requires a reduction of staff assigned to certain functions and
comprehensive pay and grading reforms. Intensified efforts are needed to improve the solvency of the
power sector, which, despite some recent improvements, currently still requires about US$160 million
in subsidies annually just to stay afloat. As it is, the pension system is not sustainable in the long run
and requires comprehensive reform.17 However, the cost of such reforms in terms of jobs and living
standards cannot be offset by private sector growth under current constraints. Nevertheless, given the
persistent shortage of donor aid, which will probably not be reversed in the near future, the PA will
need to consider additional measures to further contain public expenditures. A number of such
measures have been proposed by the IMF in their March 2013 staff report for the meeting of the Ad
Hoc Liaison Committee.

28.       In any case, despite the significant fiscal tightening that is foreseen in 2013 and other
structural reforms, which should lead to continuous fiscal consolidation over the medium term,
external financing requirements are expected to remain high in the interim. Export growth will
probably remain sluggish and the West Bank and Gaza will continue to heavily depend on imports to
meet even some of the basic needs. Consequently, although expected to shrink further by 3.6
percentage points, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) will remain extremely high
in 2013 at 30 percent of GDP. Absent significant improvements in the investment climate, the large
deficit is bound to persist unless sharp downward adjustments are made to the fiscal deficit. However,
this this could have severe social and stability implications.

29.     The Palestinian economy requires sustained, substantial and predictable donor aid and
therefore, the reinvigorated donor pledges, which are expected to significantly increase the level
of donor budget support in 2013 compared to 2012, are both welcome and essential.18 The aid
needs to be in the form of grants. With debt to domestic banks at US$1.4 billion (as of December
2012) and equivalent to 112 percent of banking sector equity and 14 percent of its total assets, further
domestic borrowing is becoming increasingly unfeasible. Under the current circumstances, the PA
does not have access to international finance even on concessional terms for a number of different
reasons. Therefore, there is no immediate alternative to grant assistance. Predictability of donor aid is
also important, as unpredictable aid flows introduce an additional layer of uncertainty to decision
making and prioritization activities for the PA.

30.     With a combination of aid mobilization and ongoing fiscal tightening efforts, the
macroeconomic framework is expected to be adequate for the purpose of this operation. While
this macro-fiscal framework is subject to a number of risks, many of them beyond the PA’s control
(see Chapter 6, Section E), there is probably no feasible alternative to a framework that relies on the

17
   Although West Bank and Gaza have introduced a funded pension system, individual accounts are not
increasing due to arrears to the system by the PA and it de facto operates as a pay-as-you-go system. The PA has
accumulated arrears to the pension system of close to US$2 billion.
18
    Table 2 above projects “identified external aid? for recurrent deficit at US$1.1 billion, which is a significant
improvement over 2012, when short of US$800 million in recurrent budget support was received from external
sources. Saudi Arabia has pledged significant additional financing at the March 2013 meeting. Any financing in
excess of the deficit and planned reduction in wage arrears could be used to reduce some of the US$600 million
in arrears to the private sector.

                                                        13
large amounts of donor aid on the one hand, and on the other, efforts to boost domestic revenues and
curb public expenditure growth as much as feasible, without causing politically and socially untenable
impacts on citizen welfare and social stability.


     III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

31.      The NDP 2011-2013 that was approved in April 2011 is the roadmap for PA’s reform
program, but within this framework, recent unexpected developments have given rise to some
new priorities. It had been assumed that the relaxation of the GoI restrictions on movement and
access and a slower than observed reduction in donor aid inflows would underpin challenging
structural reforms envisaged in the NDP. Neither of the two assumptions has materialized.
Consequently, while the PA remains committed to implementing the NDP and continues doing so, it
has delayed some of the planned reforms and is pursuing others more vigorously to respond to the new
circumstances. Specifically, reforms aimed at reforming the pension system have been delayed.
Moreover, the pace of civil service and electricity sector reforms has considerably slowed down. On
the other hand, reforms aimed at enhancing revenue performance, short-term measures to contain the
cost of the wage bill, and reforms aimed at eliminating important sources of inefficiency in healthcare
and social protection systems have gained priority.19 Despite some reprioritization, the NDP is the
anchor of the PA’s reform program.

32.     The NDP builds upon the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) of 2008-
2010. The NDP outlines the government’s 2011-2013 policy agenda, macroeconomic and
accountability framework. The PA is looking forward to future statehood and forging ahead with
improving institutions, and with 23 new sector strategies that were developed through numerous
consultations with many stakeholders such as various NGOs, civil society and international
organizations as well as the private sector and local government actors. The government’s program
incoprorates targets and sector objectives to guide implementation and allow monitoring.

33.     The NDP has been developed with the purpose of establishing a solid foundation for the
future creation of a Palestinian state. The authorities’ goal is to provide a framework that is able to
rise to the challenge of providing its citizens with adequate service delivery. In line with the
recommendations of the 2011 World Development Report entitled Conflict, Security, and
Development, the NDP maintains the PA’s commitment to developing public institutions and local
communities towards dampening the ramifications of conflict on the economy of the West Bank and
Gaza. The NDP also strives to reduce the social disparities among the Palestinian population that have
been adversely affected by various restrictions on access and movement in the West Bank and Gaza.
The authorities hope that this policy agenda will consolidate institutions which will spur investment
and invigorate the private sector. This NDP has four major sector strategies which include
governance, social development, economy and infrastructure.

A.          GOVERNANCE

34.      The authorities have been improving their institutional capacity since the 1990s. Through
consultations with relevant ministries and non-governmental agencies and stakeholders, the authorities
have laid plans to continue to build institutions for the public expenditure and governance component
of the NDP. The governance policy has been broken down by sectors: justice and rule of law,
security, international relations, administrative development, local governance and administration,
public financial management, public information, statistics and research, and land management.

19
  DPG V has been designed to support the PA in implementing the NDP, but also its newly emerged priorities.
A more detailed discussion of these new policy priorities supported by DPG V is presented in the Policy Areas
section of the PAD.

                                                     14
35.     The NDP has outlined several strategic objectives for the governance sector:

        i.   To provide national security and public safety throughout the country –This objective
             builds upon the successes of the PRDP 2008-2010 in imposing public order and a rule of
             law and building infrastructure for the security sector. For the 2011-2013 NDP, the
             authorities have outlined priority policies to provide that all citizens are ensured the
             fundamental right to safety and security.
        ii. To deliver justice and the rule of law for all citizens –This strategy envisions improving
            the institutional capacity of the justice sector over the next three years. The justice sector
            objectives build upon the reforms outlined for the PRDP 2008-2010.
        iii. To modernize and streamline public administration –This objective has been developed
             around a framework which outlines a unified approach to upgrading the organizational
             structure of ministries and agencies, as well as strengthening institutional capacity.
        iv. To empower local government and bring public services closer to citizens – In order to
            tackle the fragmentation of service delivery, authorities have put in place a strategy to
            build local government units (LGUs) capacity to provide adequate service delivery to
            local municipalities.
        v. To attain financial independence and economic stability –The PA is committed to
           continuing the prudent fiscal policy measures such as were outlined in the PRDP 2008-
           2010, with the goal of increasing growth and in due course, financial self-sufficiency.

36.      The objectives have all been developed with quantifiable goals in order to measure the
improvement or deterioration in areas targeted by specific reforms. This will ensure that
authorities have a clear framework to monitor and evaluate progress of the proposed programs.

B.      SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

37.     In the social sector, the PA’s aim is to improve service delivery among its citizens and to
reduce disparities that are occurring in service delivery to certain groups . The authorities intend
to work with private sector and non-governmental organizations to guarantee more effective and
higher quality service delivery. The PA is also striving to preserve its cultural heritage and create new
employment opportunities for all citizens. Specifically, these objectives include:

        i.   To support and empower the poor and other vulnerable citizens and their families – This
             objective outlines a continuation to the refinement and implementation of the Palestinian
             National Social Safety Net Program (PNSSP). The authorities plan to offer more
             development assistance to the poor as well as implement appropriate legislation for the
             protection of vulnerable populations;
        ii. To prepare children and youth for a fulfilling life and productive work –This commitment
            to shaping and molding human capital by preparing them for work with either the private
            or public sector will ensure quality education is provided to citizens;
        iii. To restore excellence in higher education and academic research – In order to meet the
             demands of the labor market, the PA is committed to provide education that will prepare
             the students to be able to develop up-to-date skills – including the existing vocational
             educational curriculum. This will ensure the progression into a knowledge-based
             economy as well as create prosperity;



                                                   15
       iv. To promote and sustain a healthy society – Public investment in the health sector has
           allowed better service delivery in the sector. Thanks to external financing the health
           sector has been able to improve many facilities. The authorities aim to establish an
           affordable healthcare system for its citizens;
       v. To safeguard and renew Palestinian heritage and culture – The PA has established a
          Culture Fund in order to support and develop cultural centers across the West Bank and
          Gaza, as well as support events throughout the year;
       vi. To promote the full participation and empowerment of women in society – The authorities
           strive to create an equitable society for all citizens, including women, to participate fully
           in the job market. As of now, female participation is rising but not quickly enough. The
           PA is committed to enforce laws that abolish discrimination based on gender and laws that
           punish violence against women; and
       vii. To invest in youth to enable them to reach their full potential in their homeland – The
            authorities are aware that with 30% of their population aged between age 15 and 29, they
            must pay special attention to ensure youth participation in the workforce by providing
            education that will develop their skills. The authorities also wish to ensure that the youth
            participate in their political institutions.


C.     ECONOMY

38.     The PA has committed itself to pursuing reforms in different areas to support
sustainable economic growth. Given the various constraints on economic activity and political
challenges that both the public and private sectors face daily, it is paramount to have a sound
economic policy that will foster growth. The authorities would like to counteract the constraints in
order to be able to have a sustainable growth path and they have outlined the following strategic
objectives:

       i.   To ensure a positive investment environment – The authorities are aware of the
            importance of the private sector as a driver of growth and will continue to partner with
            them. The authorities are also aware of the legal and regulatory framework reforms that
            must be implemented;
       ii. To enhance the competiveness of Palestinian products and services – The authorities
           strive to encourage investment in sectors that already enjoy a competitive advantage. This
           will not exclude other sectors that have high growth potential, which the authorities look
           to expand;
       iii. To promote economic integration and access to external markets – The authorities are
            consolidating the economic institutions that will be needed to manage stronger economic
            growth that is expected to ensue once statehood is achieved. Authorities remain
            committed to pursue economic policies to promote investment and increase productivity
            and quality across sectors;
       iv. To ensure a vibrant labor market and combat unemployment – The authorities are
           cognizant that skills are important for employment. They are determined to foster a
           capable, qualified workforce that can compete with outside labor markets as well as attract
           foreign investors to invest in the West Bank and Gaza. Authorities plan to integrate the
           education sector as an integral part of building a competent workforce; and




                                                  16
        v. To strengthen consumer protection institutions – The goal of this strategy is to ensure
           public safety and the assurance of high quality goods to citizens. The authorities plan to
           ensure quality standards and enforce penalties on non-compliant parties.

D.      INFRASTRUCTURE

39.      The authorities continue to build on the previous goals of connecting marginalized areas
to public infrastructure networks. The current program relies on community-based initiatives to
provide service delivery. Due to the stalled political situation this sector has experienced setbacks as
restrictions have long delayed major public infrastructure projects. The authorities plan to continue
the dialogue and consultation with international partners in order to achieve their strategic objectives.
These include the following:

        i.   develop integrated and sustainable national infrastructure networks;
        ii. secure an adequate supply of energy and natural resources;
        iii. protect the environment;
        iv. maintain the long-term quality, affordability and safety of infrastructure systems; and
        v. ensure adequate, safe and affordable housing.

E.      PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

40.      The authorities are committed to ensuring an adequate allocation of resources for
quality public services, positive socio-economic outcomes and good governance for citizens. In
order to improve accountability for public interest, the NDP outlines four main elements: (i)
transparency; (ii) performance; (iii) partnership; and (iv) oversight. These four elements are a part of
an institutional reform agenda which will allow the PA to build upon its recent achievements as well
as improve on areas that still need attention.

41.      The NDP is a clear framework complete with tangible goals and objectives in order to
keep the authorities accountable for their progress. The fact that the NDP has been conceived
through dialogue and consultation with a multitude of stakeholders both domestically and
internationally enhances the accountability framework.

F.      CONSULTATIONS

42.     The NDP is based on 23 new sector strategies that were developed through numerous
consultations with many stakeholders such as NGOs, civil society organizations, and
international organizations as well as the private sector and local government actors . The NDP
as a whole was the subject of further consultations. In sum, more than 240 consultation events were
conducted with over 2,000 participants representing various stakeholder groups. The government also
built partnerships with local communities through its program of Community-Based Projects which
integrates community participation into the identification of priorities and needs. Over the course of
the plan’s implementation, the government has been using public consultation as a means to help with
monitoring and evaluation.

43.     One of the more challenging reforms drawn from the NDP and included in the current
operation is public procurement. The new procurement law was developed in a highly transparent
and participatory process. Professional Associations such as the Palestinian Contractors’ Union, the
Engineers’ Association and the Lawyers’ Association have been involved in the dialogue with the PA


                                                   17
for the reform of the country’s procurement system and are supporting the enactment process of the
new procurement laws and regulations.

44.    Finally, it is noteworthy that the Bank held consultations with PRDP-TF donors during
the preparation of this operation on the content of the government’s program it aims to support.

                IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

A.         LINK TO CAS AND BANK’S MENA STRATEGY

45.      Since the West Bank and Gaza is not a member of the World Bank, there is no Country
Assistance Strategy. Instead, the Bank relies on strategy notes to guide its work and keep the
Executive Directors informed of its activities. This operation has been designed to support the Interim
Strategy Note for the West Bank and Gaza 2012-2014 (the ISN), which was discussed by the Board on
April 6, 2012.

46.     The ISN was designed to support the implementation of the PA’s NDP in areas where
the Bank has a competitive advantage over other donors. The Bank’s program under the ISN has a
two-pillar focus:

           i.   Pillar 1. Strengthen the institutions of a future state to efficiently manage public finances
                and ensure services to citizens; and
           ii. Pillar 2. Supporting the creation of an enabling environment for private sector-led growth.

47.      This operation had been envisaged as one of the core operations under the ISN and it has
been designed to support Pillar 1 objectives of the ISN.20 The ISN specifically notes that “ongoing
series of development policy grants will maintain their focus on fiscal management and public
financial management.? The ISN also notes that “the Bank will regularly monitor the reform agenda
supported by the DPGs.? The operation will directly support the achievement of all three ISN Pillar 1
outcomes: 1.1. Greater economic stability and transparent financial management; 1.2 Reinforced
public administration; 1.3. Public services more responsive to users’ needs. Under outcome 1.1, DPG
V will cover each area of engagement proposed by the ISN: (i) Revenue and expenditure management;
(ii) Public financial management (PFM); and (iii) Public procurement. Under outcome 1.3, DPG will
cover targeting poverty-related assistance.

48.     It is noteworthy that this operation is also well-aligned with the Bank’s strategic
priorities in MENA in the areas of governance, growth and inclusion, among others. The
government program supported by the operation aims to improve social inclusion through better
targeting of social assistance to the neediest segments of the Palestinian population. While measures
supported under the first policy area of this operation aimed at strengthening the PA’s fiscal position
have also been designed to improve the efficiency in public sector governance, measures under the
second policy area of this operation are specifically geared towards this strategic objective of the
Bank’s engagement in MENA.

B.         COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

49.   The Bank works closely with the IMF and other donors to support the PA’s
implementation of the NDP. Consultations have been held with the IMF and other donors on the


20
     The ISN does not have a base case and high case lending scenarios.

                                                        18
operation’s design. The IMF team was closely involved in the development of the policy matrices for
the Bank’s previous DPGs, as well as DPG V.

50.     In the West Bank and Gaza, the IMF and the World Bank have a complementary
division of labor and regularly share information and consult on policy advice to the PA. The
IMF monitors the macroeconomic framework and helps the PA produce accurate and timely accounts.
The Bank also conducts its own macro-fiscal monitoring and closely consults with the IMF in this
area, but it concentrates on helping the PA address the underlying structural issues such as power
sector net lending, transfer payments or pension arrears.

51.       The IMF has resumed full contact with the PA following the establishment of the
Caretaker Government in June 2007 and is providing technical assistance on a variety of issues.
The IMF helped the PA produce the macroeconomic framework used in the NDP and continues to
work with them to regularly update the macroeconomic projections. The IMF also provides technical
assistance to strengthen public financial management and in doing so works closely with the Bank’s
resident Public Financial Management (PFM) expert. Both the Bank and the IMF are providing
technical assistance to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) to help them develop better
basic statistics. Good basic economic data is essential to monitor progress of the NDP reforms.
Therefore, the Bank has provided funding to support building the capacity of the PCBS. In this effort,
the Bank is coordinating closely with the IMF statistics team to identify exactly how the funds are best
utilized.

52.     In addition to the IMF, the Bank has held consultations with all donors who provide
financial support for the PA’s budget. As they have done with the earlier DPGs, PRDP TF donors
will continue to rely on the DPG V policy and results matrix as the sole criteria to evaluate the PA’s
performance in implementing NDP for the purpose of quarterly disbursements under the TF. This has
proven to be an efficient and effective way to leverage donor support around important structural
reforms. Thus, the importance of the DPG program goes significantly above and beyond the operation
itself.

53.      More broadly, a more formal aid coordination mechanism in the West Bank and Gaza
was set up following a decision made at the December 14, 2005 meeting in London of the Ad Hoc
Liaison Committee (AHLC). The aim behind this mechanism is to improve the effectiveness of aid
coordination structures in providing coherent technical assistance and financial support based on
national priorities to the Palestinian people in line with the OECD-DAC Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness. The AHLC is chaired by Norway and brings together in a meeting on a semi-annual
basis several donors as well as the PA and the Government of Israel. The Bank acts as Secretariat to
the AHLC, submitting a report prior to every meeting that provides an update on recent economic and
fiscal trends, as well as on broader economic and institutional developments in the West Bank and
Gaza. The Bank’s report has often helped to set the agenda and frame the discussion at the AHLC
meeting. The Bank’s report for March 2013 AHLC meeting provided an assessment of lon g-term
impacts of the political “status quo.?

54.     At the local level, the donor coordination structure comprises the Local Development
Forum (LDF), in addition to four strategy groups (SGs), each one supported by roughly five
sector working groups (SWGs). The LDF includes representation from the PA as well as all donor
and aid agencies. The four SGs cover the clusters of economic policy, governance, infrastructure, and
social development, and are intended to focus on overarching issues such as policy formulation and
programmatic coordination. Each of the SGs and SWGs is co-chaired by a PA agency and a donor
agency. The Bank acts as a co-chair of the Economic SG (together with the PA’s Ministry of Finance)
as well as the Private Sector Development and Trade SWG (together with the PA’s Ministry of
National Economy).


                                                  19
C.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

55.     Since the establishment of the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank (TFGWB) in 1993, a
wide range of lessons have been learned, enabling largely successful Bank engagement in a
fragile political and security environment. The Bank has been continuously active in the West Bank
and Gaza since 1993 and this operation is the fifth DPG since 2008. The preparation of this operation
benefited from lessons learned in the ICR for DPG IV, as well as earlier operations and the lessons of
implementation experience drawn in the ISN 2012-2014.

56.     The IEG’s review of the World Bank Group’s program in 2001-2009 found that, despite
some progress, institutional development was uneven. The evaluation concluded that the program
was affected by factors outside of Bank’s control and noted that this issue has to be recognized to
improve long-term effectiveness of the Bank’s program. The IEG report, in particular, highlighted the
importance of supporting the PA in efforts to reduce aid dependency, which is one of the indirect
objectives of this operation to be achieved through fiscal consolidation.

57.    Several important lessons have been drawn from the ICR for DPG IV and earlier DPG
ICRs. Below is the summary of some of the main ICR lessons:

           Even in an environment of high risk, DPGs can be successful if the design adequately
            takes the risks into account and ensures government ownership of the reform program .
            Client commitment to the program is a key for success under difficult circumstances.
            DPG IV was firmly embedded in the government's own medium-term economic program,
            which is the main reason the operation was relatively successful in achieving its intended
            development objectives, despite a truly difficult operating environment. Furthermore, the
            operation was designed with another important objective in mind: to provide
            indispensable financial assistance to ensure the provision of essential public services.
           Even single tranche operations can and should be designed with a medium-term agenda
            in mind. While it would probably not be appropriate to design a programmatic DPG given
            the high level of uncertainty in the West Bank and Gaza, this operation was designed with
            some medium-term objectives in mind and was used as a platform to support dialogue on
            the medium-term program and a tool to prepare a follow up operation. However, due to a
            rapidly-changing operating environment which can cause a drastic shift in priorities, it
            would be unrealistic for the Bank to commit to a medium-term program.
           Political economy analysis of potentially controversial reforms should be carried out to
            minimize the likelihood of slippage.
           Technical challenges of implementing specific reforms ought to be taken into account in
            operation design.

58.     Finally, the Bank continues to manage the PRDP-TF, through which donors provide
budget support based on the Bank’s monitoring of the PA’s progress in implementing the NDP
reform program. The PRDP-TF provides a key mechanism for donor coordination in support of
implementing the PA’s NDP. Collaboration with other donors, especially through the Trust Fund,
helps focus the dialogue with the authorities on key issues considered critical for reform. This
collaboration provides significant weight to common points in the reform agenda and therefore should
be maintained and enhanced.

D.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

59.      The preparation of this operation has been informed by a number of analytical pieces
produced by the Bank, but also other development partners, such as the IMF. In addition to the
standardized formal studies, including an investment climate study, a public expenditure review and a
study of the fiscal management of local government, other informal analytical pieces have been
produced (in the form of hand-over notes), in particular in the area of fiscal management and public
finance management, which have benefited the preparers of this operation. While the Bank and other
institutions have produced a considerable number of analytical publications, those most relevant to the
design of this operation are listed below.

60.      In September 2011, a comprehensive poverty assessment report titled Coping with
Conflict: Poverty and Inclusion in the West Bank and Gaza was released. The report concluded that
the labor market outcome is one of the strongest drivers of poverty in the West Bank and Gaza, with
the unemployed facing the highest risk of poverty. The report also notes that public sector employment
is increasingly playing the role of a safety net in combating poverty, especially in Gaza. The findings
of this report were taken into consideration in crafting the prior actions supported by this operation, in
particular those pertaining to wage bill management and social safety net reforms.

61.     In May 2011, the WB&G Improving Governance and Reducing Corruption study was
issued. This report is the first to assess governance reforms, measure corruption in the delivery of
public services as well as to shed light on weaknesses that need to be addressed in order for the West
Bank and Gaza to further reduce corruption as well as build sound institutions for good economic
governance and a favorable investment climate for businesses. This study covered the experiences
with corruption in the West Bank and Gaza as well as the perceptions of corruption. The report
concluded that Palestinian perceptions of corruption were much higher than actual experience in the
access of public services. It also found that the West Bank and Gaza ranks well compared with other
countries in the region in terms of the effects of corruption on business activity.

62.      An assessment of Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) practices was
made by the Bank in 2011 drawing upon the PEFA methodology. It provided a rough indication of
the relative strengths and weaknesses in the PA’s public financial management system and the areas of
progress since 2006. The exercise informed the preparation of DPG V. As the next step, the Bank
intends to build on these efforts by leading the work on a full PEFA assessment which was initiated in
January 2013, in cooperation with other donors. The completion of a comprehensive PEFA assessment
would validate or disprove the indicative ratings of the previous one, and help in setting reform
priorities for the coming period.

63.      Building upon the recommendations of the 2007 Public Expenditure Review of
controlling the wage bill, the World Bank produced, in September 2010, a report on Governance
and the Wage Bill. This report was produced in order to assess the effectiveness of the existing
systems for controlling the payroll. This report also identifies future measures to support aggregate
fiscal control and more effective human resource management. Supported by this operation, the PA
has launched the process to complete job classifications in all line ministries.

64.    The World Bank issued the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
Accounting and Auditing in September 2010. This report analyzed the corporate sector accounting
and auditing practices in the West Bank and Gaza using the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). This study was limited by the blockade in Gaza and therefore focused more on the
West Bank and its practices.21 The recommendations of this ROSC were for authorities to improve

21
 In spite of the difficult political environment, the authorities have been able to offer a financial sector with
most services available: banking, securities, and insurance. The Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA) has

                                                       21
ethics, quality control and professional standards to be consistent with international practice. The
World Bank also recommended that the accounting and auditing professionals have adequate training
and capacity to carry out their functions and that a properly funded system of monitoring and
enforcement should be established.

65.     In February 2010, the World Bank produced the report Rationalizing Pensions for
Government Workers in West Bank and Gaza. This is the first systemic quantitative analysis of the
main obstacles to long-term sustainability of the current pension schemes. The report includes
recommendations for short-, medium-, and longer-term pension reform options to ensure fiscal
sustainability of the new pension scheme during the transition period until its maturity and the phase
out of old schemes. Parametric reforms recommendations included increasing retirement age,
reducing accrual rates, adjusting indexation mechanisms and eliminating early retirement. While this
operation will not support any pension reform-related actions, the policy dialogue in this area
continues, and it is expected that the next development policy operation will support government
policy actions in this area.

66.     Finally, in July 2012, the IMF prepared a study titled Improving Income Tax and Tax
Incentives Proposed Tax Policy Topical Trust Fund. This report is based on the analytical work
carried out by the IMF staff to understand the reasons behind relatively low Personal Income Tax
(PIT) and Corporate Income Tax (CIT) revenues collected by the PA and to design a reform plan to
enhance revenues, increase tax progressivity, and reduce opportunities for tax avoidance and abuse
created by numerous loopholes that exist under the current PIT and CIT legislative and administrative
arrangements. The report also addresses issues such as different approaches to taxing different
sources of income, primarily capital income, and simplifying and rendering more effective tax
administration for SMEs. Notably, the report recommends the continuation of reforms the PA is
conducting to reform the Buildings and Land Tax, recommending updating property tax evaluations
for all municipalities as the top reform priority at the moment. The findings of this report were
discussed in the dialogue with the PA as this operation was prepared. However, while the report’s
findings are expected to guide tax reforms in the coming years, they cannot be implemented within the
timeframe of this operation. Other analytical work carried out in the context of ongoing technical
support to the Ministry of Finance by the IMF, DFID, and USAID has enabled the PA to design a
revenue strategy, specific aspects of which are supported by this operation.


                                  V.       THE PROPOSED DPG V

A.      OPERATION DESCRIPTION

67.      The proposed operation aims to support the PA in strengthening its fiscal position and
laying the institutional foundations for improved governance and transparency in the public
sector. The program supported under DPG V will be organized in two policy areas to support the
following aspects of the PA’s NDP: (Policy Area 1) Strengthening the fiscal position by undertaking
reforms to (i) increase government revenues, and (ii) improve the efficiency of public expenditures;
and (Policy Area 2) laying the institutional foundations for improved governance and transparency in
the public sector. Given a sharp and larger than expected reduction in donor budget support in recent
years, the urgency of conducting these reforms has increased substantially. The operation will directly
contribute to Pillar 1 of the ISN aimed at strengthening the institutions of a future state to efficiently
manage public finances and ensure services to citizens. DPG V builds upon the achievements of the
previous four DPGs and its strategic focus is unchanged from that of DPG IV (see Box 2).



acted as the Central Bank of WB&G, and due to its high level of technical competence it has been making great
strides with improving the financial sector.

                                                     22
           Box 2: A summary of previous World Bank budget support operations in WB&G


     The Bank has already conducted four budget support operations in the West Bank and Gaza between
     2008 and 2011 (DPG I, II, III and IV). The previous programs all focused on two main policy areas: I)
     Strengthening the PA’s fiscal operations; and II) Increasing government transparency and accountability
     through improved public financial management.

     Objectives targeted under policy area 1:
     I.1 Control public sector wage bill.
     I.2 Reduce net lending and improve targeting of social safety net.
     I.3 Improve domestic revenue collection.

     Objectives targeted under policy area 2:
     II.1 Improve efficiency and transparency of the budget preparation process.
     II.2 Establish upgraded institutional and regulatory procedures to support PFM reforms.
     II.3 Strengthen PFM infrastructure and improve auditing functions.
     II.4 Increase financial accountability through improved and more transparent municipal accounts.

     Main results achieved:
     While work on meeting the above objectives under DPGs I-IV still continues and progress is hampered
     by factors outside of the PA’s control, substantial results have already been achieved. First, the size of
     the wage bill, although still unsustainable under the circumstances, has dropped from a peak of 26
     percent of GDP in 2006 to 17 percent in 2012. Second, while net lending remains a problem, specific
     and important actions have been taken to bring it under control. Third, the targeting of social assistance
     has been in particular improved through the introduction and continuous improvements to the cash
     transfer program, which is considered among the best in MENA. Fourth, the efficiency and
     transparency of the budget preparation and execution process has also been significantly improved. For
     instance, regular monthly fiscal reports are published on the MoF website and their quality and content
     has been continually improved. A new computerized financial management system was introduced
     with a connection to all line ministries. The internal audit process has also been strengthened. Finally,
     it is also noteworthy that a new modern legal framework for public procurement has been introduced
     and further actions have been taken to develop the institutional foundations to reform the public
     procurement process.

68.     DPG V will support the PA in implementing a set of revenue boosting measures. As the
shortage of revenues to finance even the basic government operations has made the fiscal situation
extremely difficult, with technical support from DFID and the IMF in particular, the PA has recently
accelerated efforts to improve domestic revenue performance and has prepared a revenue strategy;
implementation of the strategy is well underway. The reforms are currently focused on increasing the
tax base through better compliance. They are underpinned by measures to enhance tax enforcement
capacity of domestic institutions and an agreement with the Israeli authorities is under discussion on
data sharing relevant to clearance revenues, which would be an important tool in identifying non-
compliance.

69.     On the expenditure side, the program will support both short-term measures and some
structural reforms the PA is undertaking to improve the efficiency and sustainability of public
expenditures. Short-term measures are aimed at reducing the government wage bill relative to GDP,
primarily, but not exclusively, through hiring control. The PA has commenced some structural reforms
aimed at improving public sector efficiency and sustainability of the wage bill,22 albeit at a relatively
slow pace.

22
  Although the size of the wage bill as a percent of GDP has fallen impressively in the past four years from 22
percent in 2009 to 17 percent in 2012, the wage bill is still large by international standards. Further reduction in
the size of the wage bill will require deep structural reforms of the civil service, including a pay and grading

                                                        23
70.      This Development Policy Grant will not support reforms in some important policy areas
that were supported under the previous DPG as progress has been hampered by different
exogenous factors. For instance, with regard to the pension system, the majority of the administrative
reforms supported under DPG III and IV were implemented, while the parametric reforms are not
progressing as planned. The decrees that were specified by the PA’s pension reform plan have not
been issued. This is partly because the Palestinian legislative council has not been operational since
2007 and the President is reluctant to issue decrees as an alternative. Additionally, in the short run
these reforms may inflict costs in terms of poverty and living standards. At the time when private
sector growth remains constrained and unable to offset such costs and when the PA is unable to offset
them either through temporary social programs, due to the fact that its finances are already under stress
as a result of recent reductions in donor aid, the PA has decided to delay the pension reforms. A
similar logic applies to the electricity sector reforms. The PA continues paying part of the electricity
bills owed by Palestinian electric utilities and municipalities to the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC),
as the former are insolvent due to a combination of technical losses, theft, and poor bill collection
rates. Electric utilities lack investment capital to address the technical losses, but efforts to strengthen
the financial performance of the sector continue. The PA is currently developing a broad sector
strategy and is also working with international consultants on an effort to identify the key factors that
contribute to payment arrears to the Israeli Electric Corporation (IEC), but no reform actions that
would lead to concrete results were taken during the preparation of DPG V. Consequently, the DPG V
will focus on reforms deemed feasible under the existing exogenous and other justifiable constraints.
However, reengagement in some important reform areas not pursued by DPG V is expected in
subsequent operations.

71.     This operation will also continue to support reforms in the area of public sector
governance, in particular public finance management. Strengthening public finances is important
both in terms of building the capacity of the PA to independently, transparently, and efficiently
manage its economy, but also for instilling donor confidence that the financial support which they
provide to the PA in generous amounts is appropriately used.

72.     The Bank’s DPG program not only provides support to the PA’s reform program and
essential budget financing, it also leverages a significantly larger financial support from other
donors. The results framework developed in the context of the DPG is also used to assess the PA’s
reform progress. These assessments, conducted by the Bank on a quarterly basis, are used to decide
on disbursement of budget support financing from the PRDP Multi-Donor TF, which the Bank
administers. Thus, in addition to providing US$40 million per annum in direct budget support, the
DPGs leverage additional budget support, which in 2012 amounted to US$225 million.




reform. The Bank has produced a paper with concrete recommendations for civil service reform at the PA’s
request. The implementation of civil service reform and pay and grading reform has started, but its pace is slow,
primarily due to political economy considerations.

B.       POLICY AREAS


Policy Area 1: Strengthen the PA’s Fiscal Position

Domestic Revenue Performance

Description of the situation:

73.      Domestic revenue performance has stagnated in recent years. Since its formation in
1994, the PA’s capacity to collect revenues has been built virtually from scratch with a good
degree of success. Between 2003 and 2007, public revenues increased by about 5 percentage points of
GDP. However, since 2008, revenue performance has deteriorated. Clearance revenues (70 percent of
all revenues) dropped from 18 percent of GDP in 2008 to 14 percent in 2011 and remained at that
level in 2012. Then, the portion of tax revenues collected internally by the PA fluctuated between 4
and 5 percent of GDP over the same period. Unsatisfactory revenue performance can be explained by
two factors. After having dropped already in 2007, revenues from Gaza have remained stagnant in
nominal terms and in 2012 they amounted to 4.4 percent of total clearance revenues (down from 17
percent in earlier years). Furthermore, tax revenue collection in the West Bank has also lagged GDP
growth, dropping from 16 to 14 percent of GDP. This is explained by tax enforcement leakages.
Enforcement weaknesses are, in particular, evident with PIT, where the collections amount to only 1.7
percent of GDP, which is very low even by regional comparison.

Policy Challenge:

74.      Given the current fiscal challenges the PA is facing, enhancing domestic revenues has
become necessary. To a large degree, revenue performance is contingent upon the political situation
in the West Bank and Gaza. The effectiveness of clearance revenue collection largely depends on the
actions taken by the GoI and to a lesser extent those of the PA. However, even internally collected
revenues, which depend much less on the actions taken by the GoI, have been low relative to GDP in
comparison to other countries in the region. Thus, the main policy challenge is to boost internally
collected revenues primarily by eliminating different loopholes in the system and strengthening tax
enforcement, while at the same time continuing discussions with GoI to strengthen clearance revenue
collection.

Government actions to date and future activities to address the challenge:

75.     With the support of the IMF, DfID, and USAID, the PA is taking a number of measures
to boost revenue performance. In 2012, it increased the rate of VAT from 14.5 to 15 percent and the
top corporate income tax rate from 15 to 20 percent along with a number of measures to increase the
tax base. A comprehensive action plan to reform tax administration has been developed, with the main
objective to enhance VAT, Customs and income tax compliance. The plan, whose implementation has
already advanced, includes the creation of unified revenue administration, strengthening of the Large
Taxpayer Unit, expanding the number of companies under its jurisdiction, and the computerization of
taxpayers’ records. An important step being taken, which is expected to bear early fruit is to create the
Tax Identification Unit to collect third party information and use it to verify accuracy of personal
income tax liabilities.23 To strengthen clearance revenues, the PA has reached an understanding at the
technical level with the GoI on a set of measures, which would, inter alia, enable both sides to have

23
  Information will be collected on bank accounts, vehicle registration, property tax, etc. This information will be
cross checked against individual tax liabilities and given some evidence that, for instance, currently 90 percent of
doctors and lawyers are not registered to pay tax, the marginal return on this investment is expected to be
substantial.

                                                        25
full access to data collected through shared electronic interfaces. An agreement with the GoI to
facilitate clearance revenue enforcement could substantially boost PA’s revenues, but it has not yet
been finalized.

Prior actions supported by the operation:

   The VAT Administration and the Customs Administration have been successfully merged in
    accordance with a decision of the Ministry of Finance and a new single administration has a new
    organizational chart and is fully staffed and operational.
   A new Tax Identification Unit has been established within the Revenue Administration of the
    Ministry of Finance and is adequately staffed.

Expected results:

76.       As a result of the measures taken by the PA, domestic revenues from VAT, customs, and
income tax combined in 2013 will increase by at least 10 percent in nominal terms and will be
higher as a share of GDP compared to 2012. Ultimately, the PA’s dependence on external financing
for its recurrent expenditures will be reduced.


Public Sector Wage Bill and Civil Service Reform

Description of the situation:

77.      Despite having dropped substantially in recent years from 26 percent of GDP in 2006 to
17 percent in 2012, the public sector wage bill in the West Bank and Gaza remains very high by
international standards. The main driver behind the high wage bill is high public sector employment
relative to the population, which is well above the regional average, approached only by some far
wealthier Gulf States.

78.      The public service is widely percieved to be overstaffed. This is considered a consequence
of the PA operating as an employer of last resort – particularly in the period following the second
intifada from 2000 to 2005, together with patronage hiring in those early days. Efforts have been made
in the past to retire redundant staff in the security sector and restructure it into three branches, but
overstaffing remains, even though effectiveness has been increased.

Policy challenge:

79.      Addressing the issue of a large and unsustainable wage bill, which the PA is currently
struggling to fund, requires both short-term measures to contain the growth of wages and staff
on the PA’s payroll, but also wide ranging structural reforms. Some reforms cannot be
implemented quickly and require adequate know-how at the technical level, including the right
instruments to minimize the potential social and poverty impacts of these measures, and finally a
strong political commitment. The reforms will need to bring mandates, reporting lines, structures and
staffing into better alignment with the PA’s strategic priorities (relying on functional reviews and other
reform tools) and ensure fiscal sustainability of the aggregate wage bill. The current political
situation, which limits private sector employment opportunities, has given an important social
dimension to public sector employment, thus hampering the accumulation of political capital
necessary for these reforms. Thus, the reforms have to be planned and executed carefully to prevent
negative social and political consequences.



                                                   26
Government actions to date and future activities to address the challenge:

80.     The PA has introduced some short-term measures to control the wage bill. It introduced a
hiring and promotions freeze for 2012 starting in August 2012, and adopted a “zero net hiring policy
for 2013,? which aims to limit new recruitments in 2013 to ensure they do not exceed the number of
retirement-related and other kinds of departures from the PA. This is expected to keep the number of
staff on the PA’s payroll in 2013 at the December 2012 level. This new policy represents a sharp
departure from policies exercised in recent years when 3000 net staff increase limits have been set.
Furthermore, during the final stages of the 2013 budget preparation, and after this operation had
already been negotiated, the PA announced other control measures of public sector pay practices.
Together, the PA projects these measures will cap the wage bill growth in shekels at about 2 percent.

81.      Furthermore, in recent years, the PA has also launched structural reforms of the civil
service, introducing in particular more transparency in recruitments with the July 2005 Civil
Service Law and consolidating the databases for both civil and security sector payroll from
2008.24 Recently, the General Personnel Council (GPC) launched a general review of all posts in each
line ministry or agency, called “Job Descriptions and Job Classification? (JDs and JC). This review
was undertaken following key recommendations made by the World Bank in 2011-12. The ultimate
objective is to rely upon the job classifications as criteria to determine budget allocations for staff
costs to various ministries. GPC also intends to carry out a series of functional reviews, looking at the
overall machinery of government and major ministries and departments.

Specific measures proposed to be undertaken:

82.     Having in mind the importance of a fast enough reduction in the relative size of the
public sector wage bill to the overall fiscal stance of the PA, this operation will support the
following measures:

    All new hiring and promotions of the employees of the Palestinian Authority have been effectively
     frozen during the period of August 25 – December 31, 2012 in accordance with a decree of the
     President of the Palestinian Authority.
    The Cabinet of Ministers has adopted a decision mandating zero net hiring of civil and security
     personnel in the 2013 Budget of the Palestinian Authority.


Expected results:

83.     The 2013 central government nominal wage bill growth has not exceeded 4.25 percent (in
Shekel terms) and is lower as a percent of GDP than the 2012 wage bill.25




24
   In addition civil service reforms supported by this operation, it is noteworthy that the PA is also upgrading its
HR management systems. It has developed an in-house HRMIS with impressive capabilities. It introduced
electronic archiving of files on each employee, including the PA staff in Gaza. The system has been designed to
manage staff performance evaluations and promotions. The system has been designed to benefit five different
groups of users: managers in line ministries, employees, auditors, and job seekers. The system enables easy
access to data and statistics on public sector employment and pay.
25
   As noted above, after this operation had already been negotiated, the PA announced additional actions, which
it hopes would limit the wage bill growth in the 2013 budget to around 2 percent.

                                                        27
Social Assistance

Description of the situation:

84.      The PA has been a regional leader in the social protection reform efforts and has
improved benefit targeting to those most in need, as well as the overall transparency and
accountability of the system. It implemented a formula based targeting, which takes into account
easily identifiable characteristics and recent poverty data. The Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA)-
managed Palestinian Cash Transfer Program (CTP) provides quarterly cash transfers to approximately
95,000 poor households throughout the West Bank and Gaza and is funded by the PA, European
Union (EU) and the World Bank. CTP targeting, which relies on a proxy means test (PMT) formula is
effective with errors comparable to programs widely considered successful worldwide. The program’s
Management Information System (MIS) with a poverty-targeting database contains information on
approximately 150,000 households and monitors and tracks CTP applications, enrollment and
payments. This database is used by various development partners for their own programs.

85.     However, between 2010 and 2011 the number of CTP recipients has increased from
64,000 to 95,000 households, which costs US$105 million per year, and is not covering only those
identified as poor. By design, the CTP eligibility is contingent upon a household’s poverty level
based upon the application of the PMT formula. But faced with pressures against graduating ineligible
households from the CTP, the MoSA decided to expand the CTP to also include the following
population categories, which may not meet the PMT formula based criteria: (i) households falling in
between the deep (or extreme) poverty line and the national poverty line; (ii) households who were
previously receiving benefits under the Transition Assistance Program (TAP); and (iii) households
characterized as "vulnerable" (this included households whose head is female, elderly, disabled, and/or
chronically ill). Most of the households classified under TAP are poor and receiving the minimum
amount of benefit. However, close to a half of households classified as “vulnerable? were not poor and
were, therefore, receiving cash assistance through the CTP to the exclusion of extremely poor
households which were on “waiting lists.? It is estimated that the benefits accruing to non-poor within
the “vulnerable? group amount to around US$8 million per year.

Policy challenge:

86.     To ensure that the CTP is effective (providing regular adequate cash transfers to poor
households) and sustainable, households which no longer qualify for CTP assistance should be
‘graduated’ into other social assistance programs. This would require extending the application of
the CTP formula to the “vulnerable group,? whose eligibility for social assistance is currently
categorical and not formula-based.

Government actions to date and future activities to address the challenge:

87.     The PA is conducting a range of activities to enhance efficiency and sustainability of its
social assistance programs. It has been active in increasing outreach to the poorest households to
ensure that all of them are included in the database, which is necessary for achieving the CTP’s
objective of providing assistance to all poor households. In June 2012, MoSA has completed the
database update campaign whereby about 33,000 households across the West Bank were recertified.
As a result, the total of 2,466 households was excluded from the CTP for being no longer eligible. A
few others were diverted to non-cash assistance programs while MoSA is currently in the process of
determining the status of 4,471 households. Furthermore, to ensure fiscal sustainability of the CTP
program and further increase the percentage of social assistance going to the poorest segment of the
population, MoSA has decided to extend the application of the PMT formula, also to beneficiaries
under the “vulnerable group.?


                                                  28
Specific measures proposed to be undertaken:

   The Ministry of Social Affairs of the Recipient has adopted a decision mandating the application
    of a proxy means test formula set forth in the Cash Transfer Program’s Operational Manual to
    determine the eligibility of households categorized as the “vulnerable group? to recei ve cash
    benefits under the Cash Transfer Program.
Expected results:

88.     The planned reforms will support continued development of an effective and fiscally
sustainable social protection system, which can effectively meet various needs of disadvantaged
and marginalized households throughout the West Bank and Gaza. In particular, the aim is to
create a system that can effectively provide assistance to the neediest categories of the population.
The immediate result in 2013 will be to limit the growth of CTP households under the “vulnerable
group? to a maximum of 19,200. As the non-poor households are excluded from the program, savings
of around US$8 million per year will be generated that will enable additional poor beneficiaries to
become eligible for benefits under the CTP.

Medical Referral System

Description of the situation:

89.     In recent years there has been a steep increase in P A’s health expenditures on outside
treatment referrals, usually at the tertiary care level for those services that are not available in
Ministry of Health (MoH) facilities. The number of referrals has increased from 8,123 in 2000 to
56,468 in 2011. The corresponding expenditure has also increased significantly from less than US$10
million in 2000 to as much as US$125 million in 2011. This high and increasing level of expenditure
on outside referrals is not fiscally sustainable. Currently, unpaid bills to outside service providers
amount to more than NIS 72 million (US$ 18 million). Finally, according to an assessment conducted
by the Bank, this rapid growth in referral costs cannot be explained by demographic or
epidemiological factors alone, although the demographic transition and the increase in the incidence of
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may have played a minor role. Thus, there is a large scope for
efficiency improvements.

     Note: Data for 2000-2002 and 2004 do not differentiate between WB and Gaza. Cost estimates refer to budget
     spending (2000-2002) and estimated cost based on contracts (starting 2003). The drop in 2006 was due to the
     suspension of services over several months.


Policy challenge:

90.     The high level of MoH spending on outside referrals is of increasing concern and has
been the focus of World Bank technical assistance (TA) efforts in the past several months. This
TA has identified specific issues related to sustainability, access, efficiency, purchasing and overall
processes that need to be addressed in order to improve equity and efficiency of outside referrals.

91.      The immediate challenge for the PA is to address excessive referrals while ensuring
equitable access to appropriate and needed care for populations throughout the West Bank and
Gaza. The PA has identified health sector reform as a major priority, with a future aim of adopting
universal health coverage, while acknowledging that it must first focus its efforts on cost containment
of the current health sector system.

92.      The Bank has previously been engaged in unsuccessful efforts to reduce the cost of
medical referrals in the Palestinian public healthcare system. The current Minister of Health has,
however, demonstrated firm commitment to reforms of the healthcare system, giving top priority to
the reduction of referral costs. While risks to the success of the current reform efforts certainly exist,
in particular given the high financial stakes involved, the commitment shown by the current
government, and in particular the Minister of Health to these reforms, along with the importance of
such reforms for overall fiscal sustainability, provide a strong rationale for the Bank’s renewed
engagement in this area. Furthermore, a detailed assessment that the Bank has conducted clearly
identifies the sources of growth in referral costs and the Bank is providing technical assistance to help
the authorities address the main problems on the basis of the recent assessment.




                                                         30
Government actions to date and future activities to address the challenge:

93.      The PA put forth the Palestinian National Health Strategy (NHS) for the period of 2011
to 2013 “Setting Direction – Getting Results?, with the main focus on health financing and
insurance system reform, and improved financial management. One major accomplishment has
been the institutionalization of the National Health Accounts (NHA) system, which enabled the
production of an insightful report in 2012. This system, along with Bank technical assistance, will be
critical in assessing the fiscal and financing implications of various reform options to improve
efficiency and equity in the health sector and specifically with respect to outside treatment referrals.
To this end, the Government has brought the administrative unit in charge of the “special treatment
referrals? under the authority of the General Directorate for Health Insurance, and now all referrals are
channeled through the Directorate, while at the same time more stringent criteria and controls for
outside treatment referrals are being applied. The PA has also been supported by the Bank-funded TA.
The TA missions collaborated closely with MoH staff, including health care workers, staff from
NGOs, research institutions, centers and international organizations.26

Specific measures proposed to be undertaken:

94.     A number of areas need to be addressed in order to improve the equity, efficiency and
sustainability of outside treatment referrals: (1) reducing benefit coverage by improving
effectiveness of primary and secondary services; (2) reducing the number of service providers and
strengthening regionalization; (3) identifying criteria for provider selection; (4) addressing contract
management weaknesses and improving information management and monitoring approaches; and (5)
improving existing processes by integrating clinical and financial information into one system,
developing authorization guidelines, revising classification of procedures and strengthening diagnostic
capacity at a facility-level. A medical committee was recently established with clear terms of
reference to rationalize the referral process in a transparent, equitable and efficient manner. This
operation supports the following action, which represents an early, but a decisive step to reform the
medical referral process:

    The medical referral process has been strengthened through formal decisions and instructions
     taken by the Minister of Health to expand and refresh the membership of medical referral
     committees, to centralize the process by bringing the referral audit function under the direct
     authority of the General Directorate for Health Insurance, and instructions to medical referral
     committees to make referrals to medical institutions in Israel only when absolutely necessary and
     with the Minister's prior approval.


Expected results:

95.    It is expected that through these efforts, the number of outside treatment referrals will
fall compared with 2012 and the associated costs will decrease as a share of total public
expenditures on healthcare by at least two percentage points in 2013 from 31 percent in 2012.
Furthermore, through a number of the recommended actions related to design, organization,
management and quality of services, the MoH is expected to provide more equitable and effective
primary, secondary and tertiary care services.

26
   The overarching objective of the TA is to increase efficiency of public health expenditures with a view to
ensuring fiscal and financial stability of the proposed universal health coverage. To achieve these aims, in
addition to improving equity and efficiency of outside referrals, this TA is undertaking an assessment of the
fiscal space from the expenditure side and sustainability for universal health coverage and institutional capacity-
building.

Policy Area II: Improve Governance and Transparency in the Public Sector

Public Procurement

Description of the situation:

96.      The Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), prepared by the Bank in 2004,
highlighted several shortcomings in the legal framework, institutional setup, and the capacity of
the procurement staff. The CPAR provided recommendations to assist the PA develop its capacity
to plan, manage, and monitor public procurement effectively. It also provided recommendations to
improve accountability, integrity, and transparency of the system, in addition to those aimed at
preventing corruption and harmonizing the national procurement law and regulations with
internationally accepted principles and practices. One of the proposed reform objectives was also to
increase opportunities for local suppliers, contractors and consultants. In response to the CPAR
recommendations, the PA launched, with Bank support, the reform of the public procurement system
by the drafting of the new public procurement law (the PPL) and detailed implementing regulations
starting in early 2006. The law was finally enacted on December 25, 2011 and further activities to
ensure its implementation are underway, albeit at a slower pace than had been anticipated.

Policy challenge:

97.      A key challenge for the PA now is to develop the supporting institutional infrastructure
to implement the PPL. The enactment of a good procurement law is only the first step in the
development of a sound procurement system. Other critical components of the procurement system
need to be put into place, including the adoption of the supporting regulations for the new law,
establishing an independent public procurement policy body, implementing national standard bidding
documents, instituting a training program of the procurement workforce, and taking additional
measures necessary to make the law effective. The reforms represent a major institutional
transformation which will take a couple of years to complete and building institutional and human
resource capacity to support it is a particular challenge.

Government actions to date and future activities to address the challenge:

98.     Pursuant to the new procurement law of December 25, 2011, the Council of Ministers
approved on September 25, 2012 a decree establishing the Higher Council for Public
Procurement Policies and determined its membership. The Higher Council consists of a Chairman
and eight members, four representing PA ministries and the other four from outside the public sector.
A draft report on the structure, roles and responsibilities of the Higher Council and related institutional
arrangements was recently prepared by the international legal expert, hired through the Institutional
Development Fund (IDF) grant. An action plan for the first year has been prepared. An important
activity that the Council has already completed is the preparation of a complete set of draft
procurement regulations, which will govern the operations of the reformed public procurement system
based on the Public Procurement Law.

Specific measures proposed to be undertaken:

   The Higher Council for Public Procurement Policy has been established by a cabinet decision of
    the Cabinet of Ministers, its members have been appointed and it has completed prepared a set of
    draft regulations on public procurement.



                                                    32
Expected results:

99.     While it will take several years to achieve the intended objectives of the ongoing public
procurement reforms, some specific results are expected to be achieved before the end of 2013.
These results are: (1) The conduct of public procurement is based on new implementing regulations
to the PPL; and on (2) the National Standard Bidding Documents for Goods, Works and Consultants
Services, and the Procurement Manual. Ultimately, after the procurement reforms have been fully put
into practice (beyond the scope of this operation), the system will be made more transparent, as all the
information will be provided online and based on the standardized documents and procedures. A
formal complaint mechanism will also be introduced.

Other Public Finance Management Reforms

Description of the situation:

100.    Since its inception, the PA has implemented a wide range of reforms and other activities
to build public finance management capacity. Reform progress in recent years has been impressive,
despite the fact that the connection with the MoF office in Gaza was severed in 2007 creating a
massive loss of capacity. However, the progress has been uneven across different areas of PFM. The
budget preparation procedures in particular are highly centralized and still relatively basic. On the
other hand, more progress has been made to strengthen the budget execution process.

101.    In the face of recent fiscal challenges, two issues have repeatedly resurfaced as
bottlenecks to more efficient and effective public finance and fiscal management. One specific
problem cited by the MoF is the absence of a formal cash management system, which makes short-
term expenditure planning more complicated than necessary. Furthermore, while the MoF now has a
much better infrastructure for PFM – especially through the new accounting system it introduced- it is
underutilizing the system for management and reporting purposes. Consequently, some important
information on public expenditures was not until recently publicly available and easily accessible to all
relevant stakeholders.

Policy challenge:

102.     The PA needs to improve the transparency of its expenditure reports to inform budget
planning and structural policies. Budget planning and cash forecasting at the municipal level are
hampered due to the lack of clarity on the mechanism applied by the PA to allocate property tax
receipts to municipalities. Property tax is one of the most viable sources of revenue for municipalities.
Although property tax collection has increased, the amounts received by the municipalities have been
fluctuating substantially due to the fact that the PA deducts the utility bills (called “the intercept?)
owed by municipalities to the GoI and transfers only netted amounts to municipalities. The lack of
transparency in the calculation of the intercept makes it almost impossible for municipalities to use it
as a reliable source of income for planning purposes. Finally, while budget execution reports have
improved in recent years and the MoF is now producing reports based on the IMF GFS 2001 manual,
transfer expenditures are not disaggregated in budget execution reports. This clouds policy making
related to this growing category of expenditures.

Government actions to date and future activities to address the challenge:

103.    In recent years, the PA budget execution system has been improved in several ways. The
following actions are noteworthy: (i) the implementation of an Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS) to strengthen expenditure control and prevent significant deviations from
the approved budget; and (ii) the devolving of budget execution payments to line ministries through
banking arrangements (treasury single account) ensuring the necessary spending oversight by the

                                                   33
Treasury. Efforts are also underway to improve cash planning and forecasting, assisted by the Bank.
Public expenditure reporting has also improved in recent years and the MoF now produces monthly
fiscal reports reflective of GFS 2001 methodology.

104.     Furthermore, the authorities are taking action to improve the transparency and
predictability of municipal tax receipts and strengthen municipal finances in general.
Specifically, the PA and its Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) have demonstrated reform
commitment through the following actions: (i) the formation of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on
Municipal Finance Reform; (ii) support to improving municipal capacity in financial management;
(iii) measures to improve municipal revenues, particularly the property tax. Since 2008, the MoF has
been rolling out a program to improve property tax collection. Collection has increased from US$10
million in 2006 to US$30 million in 2010; and (iv) the interest of the PA/MoLG in designing a system
with effective incentives for efficient municipal behavior through the Municipal Development
program.

105.     The PA plans to improve reporting on its transfer expenditures, which until recently
have not been broken down into subcategories in official fiscal reports. New reporting practices
will better inform policymaking pertaining to this continuously growing category of expenditures.

Specific measures proposed to be undertaken:

   As of January 2013 the MoF has started the practice of publishing quarterly reports on the
    allocation of property tax to municipalities that specifically indicate each deduction from the
    amount collected and the amounts paid to local government units.
   Starting in January 2013 monthly fiscal reports published by the MoF on its website are revised to
    include a breakdown of transfer expenditures into main subcategories (e.g. pensions, social
    benefits).

Expected results:

106.    The implementation of the proposed measures will enable the PA to better plan
expenditures, reduce the accumulation of arrears pertaining to lower priority expenditures and
improve fiscal sustainability. The immediate results expected in 2013 are that municipal authorities,
other stakeholders, and the general public will be able to easily access information that indicates the
amount of property tax collected, deductions from property tax collected by the central government
and the breakdown of transfer expenditures into main subcategories from the Ministry of Finance
website. Given that these reforms have already been implemented, it is noteworthy that more details
on transfer expenditures are now provided than had been discussed with the Bank when the prior
action was agreed.

                             Box 5: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality


Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The operation supports the Palestinian National Development Plan (PNDP) which was developed through
wide consultations within the government and with elements of civil society. The PA therefore has strong
ownership of the proposed operation. Reforms supported by the operation focus on key measures that are
politically feasible and are also necessary for achieving goals of the PNDP.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework

The operation’s policy matrix, which is attached to this document, is at the core of the accountability
framework. The matrix outlines key prior actions that have clear outcome indicators in addition to other
proposed activities that go beyond the time frame of DPG V. The matrix reflects reform priorities that were
developed jointly with the PA during preparation of DPG V. The matrix was also discussed with the IMF
and other key development partners operating in West Bank and Gaza including DFID, Norway, Australia,
and France in order to ensure maximum aid coordination.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances

Bank staff and PA officials from various ministries have worked closely to identify the reform program
supported by this DPG V. It focuses on strengthening the PA’s fiscal position and enhancing governance
and transparency in the public sector which are key priorities for the PA especially given its current
stressful financial situation. The majority of sensitive policy reforms covered by the operation are backed
by analytical work by the Bank or the IMF. Even though additional reforms needed to address some of the
main sources of inefficiency in public spending were identified by the DPG team, those were not pursued
by this operation due to specific country circumstances related to political economy and social
considerations.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

The number of prior actions has been reduced as the operation was developed, keeping only those actions
that are critical for the success of the reforms supported by the operation. The prior actions are rooted in the
reform priorities of the PA and in the ISN for West Bank and Gaza. The program focuses on outcome-
oriented actions that will enable the program to achieve its overall objectives.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support

The PA has put in place a mechanism for regular quarterly monitoring of implementation progress. It has
been producing quarterly reports on DPG implementation. This very same monitoring and evaluation
framework and the DPG results framework are used to monitor progress against the PRDP Trust Fund.
The Bank reviews these reports in consultation with the IMF. The DPG program is expected to provide
predictable financial support that is incorporated into the PA’s budget and is consistent with its
macroeconomic framework.




                                                      36
                           VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

107.      Government actions supported under this operation are not expected to have any
negative impact on poor and vulnerable groups in the West Bank and Gaza. For instance,
measures aimed at improving tax revenue collection will not change tax rates or increase the tax
liability of the poor and vulnerable groups. They are aimed at improving the collection efficiency and
reducing tax evasion by private enterprises and wealthier individuals.27 Measures aimed at containing
government expenditures and improving their efficiency will not cut any benefits to the poor. No
negative effects are expected as a result of the measure to limit hiring, as it entails that all vacancies
created as a result of retirement, or other eventualities will be filled through new recruitments.

108.     On the contrary, these measures are aimed at protecting the fiscal space for pro-poor
expenditures. For instance, the prior action that will apply the proxy means targeting methodology as
criteria for the inclusion of new beneficiaries into cash transfer programs will prevent non-poor
households from receiving cash benefits at the detriment of poor households that have not yet been
included in the program due to limited budget. Currently, it is estimated that about US$8 million
worth of CTP benefits per year accrue to non-poor. By expanding the use of proxy means targeting to
determine CTP eligibility for the so called “vulnerable group,? and graduating the households who are
no longer poor from the program, fiscal space is being created to provide benefits to those who are
most in need. These measures are expected to further increase the proportion of benefits going to
extremely poor from the current estimate of about 80 percent. The measure aimed at rationalizing the
cost of medical referral, by preventing unwarranted referrals for outside treatment, will improve the
sustainability of health care spending, while ensuring a more equitable access to outside treatments
and is not expected to have a negative impact on poor and vulnerable categories of the population.

109.    Over the medium-term, the reforms supported by this operation are expected to
translate into augmented fiscal space for essential poverty-reducing programs and improved
prospects for employment opportunities in the private sector. Measures aimed at increasing
government revenues combined with measures to reduce inefficiencies in public expenditures will
increase the fiscal space for essential poverty-reducing expenditure programs. Improved fiscal
management is also an important requirement for economic growth and job creation. The measures
supported by this operation to strengthen the public procurement process should reduce the
procurement costs and thereby increase the fiscal space for essential public services; these reforms
should also enhance business opportunities for more domestic companies and consequently support
growth and employment of the private sector. This would have a positive poverty and social impact.
Other PFM reforms supported by this operation are aimed at strengthening public finance management
practices, which usually strengthen accountability of public officials, increase efficiency and efficacy
of public expenditures, all of which are important determinants of economic growth and development.

B.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

110.     DPG V will not have significant effects on the country's environment, forests and other
natural resources. The environmental and natural resource implications are driven by the activities
embedded in the design of an operation. In the proposed operation, none of the prior actions as listed
in the policy matrix will have environmental impacts or risks.



27
  Individuals with gross taxable annual income of less than NIS 50,000, which is significantly above the
household poverty line (NIS 27,516) are within the 5 percent tax bracket and with allowances pay a maximum of
NIS 1,000 of tax.

                                                     37
C.      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION


111.    The PA has put into place a mechanism for regular quarterly monitoring of
implementation progress. The PA has been producing quarterly reports on DPG implementation.
This very same monitoring and evaluation framework and the DPG results framework are used to
monitor progress against the PRDP Trust Fund. The Bank reviews these reports in consultation with
the IMF. The Bank focuses on progress on structural reforms while the IMF provides detailed input
on fiscal and PFM issues. In the previous Reform Trust Fund, monitoring proved to be a major
challenge. Many of the benchmarks had been developed without input from the PA line ministries.
However, in PRDP DPG I - IV, the policy matrix was anchored in the PRDP/PNDP, which was
developed after wide consultation throughout the PA and among other stakeholders. The policy
matrices reflected what all parties, not only deemed important, but also achievable and what could be
monitored. The PNDP DPG V continues this approach. The matrix is based on the PNDP and reflects
lessons learned from the last operation.

112.    The Bank team managing the PNDP DPG V is located in the Bank’s Jerusalem office
and is thus able to have daily contact with their PA counterparts. The Bank team continues to
include a Senior Public Finance Management Specialist in the Jerusalem office to work alongside the
TTL/Country Economist monitoring the PNDP DPG V. The task team leader for the social safety net
reform projects is also resident in the local Bank office. The main ministries responsible for
implementing the reforms supported by the PNDP DPG V are the MoF, MoSA, and the Ministry of
Health, with which the Bank has developed a strong relationship. The IMF has a resident advisor to
the MoF’s macro-fiscal unit and the Bank team works closely with him and the rest of the IMF
mission to provide assistance to the MoF, and to review implementation progress on budget-related
and PFM issues.

D.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public Financial Management System

113.   While several challenges in the PFM system remain, reforms are underway, but need to
be further developed and enhanced. DPG V will be executed through the Government’s PFM
systems. Based on the information from the Bank, IMF, and donor reports on PFM, the Palestinian
PFM system is deemed to be adequate insofar as the Bank’s criteria and standards for approval of
development policy operations are concerned. Recent improvements in PFM include the following:

           Launch of the Integrated Financial Management System (Unified Bissan) that helped
            consolidate budget implementation processes, strengthen payment controls and improve
            fiscal reporting. This system has been rolled out in all line ministries.
           All PA revenues are accounted for in the Central Treasury Account.
           Transformation of line ministries and agency bank accounts into zero-balance accounts.
           MoF is exercising control over budget expenditures, and has imposed strict limits on non-
            wage expenditures and makes adjustments as needed. Additionally, the Budget is
            published on MoF’s official website and is made available to the public.
           MoF established a central internal audit function; the internal audit department’s role is
            gradually evolving in line with international standards and has begun to be decentralized
            from MoF to 15 key line ministries.



                                                 38
           Salaries of the PA’s civil and security servants have been paid through direct deposit into
            personal employee bank accounts.
           A practice of auditing the final accounts has been initiated and final accounts for the FY
            2010 were audited by the State Audit Administrative and Control Bureau (SAACB)
            though with some delays (published in the SAACB website in March 18, 2013). The
            SAACB issued a qualified opinion on some components of the financial statements that
            need to be addressed.

114.   However, more improvements need to be adopted to further consolidate progress and
address the challenges facing the PFM systems. As part of the NDP process a PFM strategy was
developed by the PA. Key elements of the strategy with respect to fiduciary controls include:

           Further developing cash management by strengthening cash forecasting and improving the
            link with the commitment control system.
           Building capacities for financial management at both the MoF and line ministries, given
            the objective of devolving more financial management responsibility from MoF to line
            ministries.
           Further enhancing the internal audit function and continuing the decentralization of this
            function to all line ministries.
           Strengthening accounting and reporting by fully adopting International Public Sector
            Accounting Standards, and by increasing budget transparency.
           Continuing to build the State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau audit capacities as
            well as the legislative framework.
           Ensuring better integration of donor programming into the annual development budget.


115.     The fiduciary risk related to this operation is considered to be Substantial. An ongoing
PEFA (first quarter 2013) will provide a more updated insight on the current situation of the PFM
system. The 2010 financial and compliance audit report by the SAACB also points to PFM
weaknesses that need to be addressed, in some cases requiring technical assistance. In view of the
substantial fiduciary risk, the following additional arrangements will be applied to this operation: a) a
dedicated foreign currency bank account will be used to segregate grant proceeds from the PA’s other
bank accounts so as to enable an audit of the account; and b) The PA will hire an independent external
auditor acceptable to the Bank to perform an audit of the dedicated account. See Annex 4 for further
details on the PFM environment.

Disbursement

116.    Once the Grant is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the PA will submit a
withdrawal application to the Bank. Similar to DPG IV disbursement arrangements followed by the
PA, the Grant proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the development
policy program. Once the World Bank is satisfied with the program being carried out by the PA and
with the appropriateness of the PA's macroeconomic policy framework, the Grant proceeds will be
disbursed in a single tranche to a US Dollar Dedicated Account that forms part of the PA’s official
foreign exchange reserves to finance budgeted activities/expenditures. In the absence of a central bank,
the dedicated account will be held at the Bank of Palestine, a commercial bank that is deemed
acceptable to the World Bank. Transactions and balances of the account will be promptly and fully
incorporated into the Government accounting records and financial statements. The PA will confirm to
the Bank within 30 days of disbursement, the receipt of Grant funds and that the Grant proceeds have

                                                   39
been credited to the Central Treasury Account (CTA) (including the date and number of the CTA
account in which the funds have been deposited), as well as the exchange rate applied.


Flow of Funds

117.     Upon effectiveness of the Grant, the Bank will disburse the funds to a dedicated US
Dollar Account (DA) maintained by MoF under the CTA at the Bank of Palestine. Within one
week of the receipt of funds in the deposit account, the MoF will convert the US dollar amount into
NIS at the prevailing exchange rate at the date of conversion. If any portion of the credit is used to
finance ineligible expenditures as defined in the Grant Agreement, the Bank shall require the PA to
refund the ineligible amount.

External Auditing of the Grant Dedicated Account

118.    The PA will hire an independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank to perform an
audit of the DPG V dedicated account. The audit will be conducted in accordance with international
standards and with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The audit report will be approved and
signed by the MoF before it is submitted to the Bank. The audit report will be submitted to the Bank
within six months from the release of the single tranche payment. The external audit fees will not be
financed from the Grant funds. For DPG IV, MoF submitted an acceptable external audit report in a
timely manner, the external auditor expressed unqualified “clean? opinion on the related dedicated
account, and the management letter did not include significant weaknesses in the PA internal control
system.

119.    In general, the auditor will be required to:

           Validate the transfer and deposit transactions relating to the Grant;
           Verify the extent to which the Bank’s requirements under the Grant agreement are being
            met, and whether the PA’s procedures are adequate to serve that objective.;
           Verify that no funds are kept in or paid into the Dedicated Account other than those
            disbursed by the Bank for this particular operation;
           Ensure that all payments from the Dedicated Account are for eligible budgetary purposes,
            following procedures established by the PA's MoF; and
           Ensure that the MoF follows adequate disbursement procedures as per PA and
            governmental standards, including accuracy of exchange rate prevailing at the date of
            conversion from US Dollar to New Israeli Shekel and within one week of the receipt of
            funds in the deposit account.

E.      RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

120.     The implementation of the government’s reform program under the NDP and likewise
this operation which is designed to support it are exposed to multiple and significant risks.
These risks are primarily related to the internal political situation in the West Bank and Gaza, as well
as the actions of the Government of Israel (GoI) and the donor community.

121.    The key risks are:

         i. The political and security situation in the West Bank and Gaza is very fragile, as
            demonstrated by the very recent outbreak of conflict in Gaza, which remarkably increased
            the level of uncertainty pertaining to the economic and political situation. The recent
            social unrest and civil service strikes also attest to the fragility of the political situation.
            The highly volatile political situation could deteriorate, with the consequence of stalled
            reforms. If the security situation relapses, private sector confidence and investment will
            decline, public revenues will fall and government reforms may stall. What is critical at
            this juncture is that the PA has continued to implement structural reforms despite the
            highly difficult economic environment and fiscal pressures and remains committed to
            continued reforms. 1
         ii. The PA is striving to improve its fiscal position, but for the foreseeable future it will
             remain dependent upon high and predictable levels of aid. While the PA has charted a
             course toward lesser dependence on external aid and is actively undertaking the relevant
             reforms, it will take many years for the PA to achieve fiscal sustainability and that will
             only be possible if there is a political settlement that allows for strong private sector-led
             growth. Thus, a further reduction in donor assistance is a significant source of risk to
             PA’s finances and the Palestinian economy as a whole.
         iii. The PA will not be able to meet its fiscal goals without substantial economic growth.
              However, under the recent political uncertainties, the broad relaxation of movement and
              access restrictions imposed by GoI in both Gaza and West Bank and restrictions on
              economic activity in Area C slowed down. The international donor community is
              continuing to monitor the closure system and its economic impact.
         iv. Fiduciary risks are also substantial, as discussed in Section D above.

Risk mitigation

122.    The above risks cannot be fully mitigated by the operation. However, the operation was
designed to minimize the likelihood and the potential impact of some of the abovementioned
risks. This proposed fifth DPG sends a strong signal to donors that the World Bank places great
importance on progress on the NDP and that donors should continue to support it. Most importantly,
the operation leverages around US$200 million per year in additional financing through the PRDP
Trust Fund, which the Bank administers. This will mitigate the risk of reduced donor assistance on
PA’s finances. A simple design and strong PA ownership of the reform program supported by this
operation, which contribute to fiscal consolidation and reduced reliance on donor assistance over the
medium term, are also mitigating factors. On balance, the potential benefits of the operation justify
the Bank’s engagement despite the significant risks identified above.

                 West Bank and Gaza—Assessment Letter to the World Bank
                                   January 15, 2013

Contact person: Mr. Christoph Duenwald, cduenwald@imf.org, (202) 623-7184, and Mr. Udo
Kock (+972 545 663 741; EST + 7 hours)


Economic Conditions and Outlook

The Palestinian economy is facing serious risks, with a slowdown in growth and rise in
unemployment in both Gaza and the West Bank. During 2008–10, the West Bank’s real GDP grew
by an annual average rate of 9 percent, reflecting sound economic management and reforms supported
by donor aid, and an easing of Israeli internal barriers. However, growth declined to 5.5 percent in
January-September 2012, while unemployment rose to 19 percent on average from 18 percent in the
same period the year before. The economic slowdown reflects continued fiscal retrenchment combined
with severe financing difficulties, declining donor aid, and very limited easing of restrictions on
movement and access. In Gaza, after a rebound in real output by about 20 percent on average in 2010–
11 following the easing of tight restrictions, growth has declined to 7.7 percent in January-September
2012, and unemployment has risen to 31 percent from 28 percent in the same period last year. Looking
ahead, with persisting restrictions, financing difficulties due to aid shortfalls, and a stalemate in the
peace process, there is a high risk of a continued economic slowdown and a rise in unemployment.

The Palestinian Authority (PA)’s severe financing difficulties in 2011 and in 2012 have led to a
substantial rise in domestic payment arrears and debt to commercial banks. In 2011-2012, donor
aid for recurrent spending and development projects has been lower than needed to finance the already
tight budgets. The consequent liquidity difficulties have been compounded by shortfalls in revenue in
the context of a decline in economic growth and slower-than-expected implementation of clearance
and domestic tax administration measures, as well as higher pension payments. Domestic payment
arrears, including to the private sector and public pension fund, are estimated to have risen by about
US$0.3 billion in the first half of 2012 with the increase in the second half of 2012 yet to be
determined. The stock of government debt to domestic banks has increased to US$1.2 billion
(12 percent of GDP) at end-November 2012 from US$1.1 billion at end-2011.

Inflation has remained low so far in 2012, despite a moderate jump in the West Bank’s CPI due
to increases in the VAT rate and fuel prices. The WB&G’s CPI inflation rate (in NIS) was 2.2
percent in November 2012, compared to 2.8 percent at end-2011. Inflation was significantly lower in
Gaza (-0.4 percent) than in the West Bank (3.6 percent), reflecting the relaxation of the blockade on
imports of consumer goods and foodstuffs and supply of goods through the tunnels with Egypt.
Inflation in the West Bank increased to 6 percent (yoy) in September –October 2012 following
increases in the VAT rate and fuel prices. While Gaza’s inflation had risen sharply above that of the
West Bank during the blockade, it has been on a declining trend since 2009 following the end of the
Gaza war.

The WBG’s banking system continues to perform well, with limited exposure to global markets
and conservative practices in private sector lending, although the Palestinian Authority (PA)’s
debt to domestic banks has risen. Significant improvements in financial market infrastructure—
including a credit registry with a modern credit scoring system—have enabled a rise in the private
credit to deposit ratio from 33 percent at end-2010 to 38 percent at end-September 2001. The rise in
private sector credit, in the year ending in September 2012, was sharper in Gaza (47 percent) than in

                                                   54
the West Bank (7 percent), reflecting Gaza’s increased consumer credit demand as restrictions on
imports were relaxed. The share of non-performing loans in total loans has fallen steadily, from 7
percent at end-2008 to about 2 percent at end-September 2012.

Risks and Challenges

To stem the risks of a continued economic slowdown, a rise in unemployment, and a deepening
fiscal crisis, urgent and concerted actions are needed by the PA, the GoI, and the international
community.

    It is important for the PA to adopt a 2013 budget that limits as much as possible the
     expected financing gap. Along with its efforts to address the immediate financing difficulties,
     it is also important for the PA to employ its enhanced institutional capacity to press ahead with
     measures to further raise public sector efficiency and phase out reliance on recurrent aid. It is
     essential that the PA continues to build on its track record by taking measures toward
     comprehensive pension and civil service reforms, further strengthening the social safety net,
     completing the commercialization of electricity distribution, and enhancing the legal and
     regulatory framework facing businesses.

    Additional aid is essential to sustain orderly reforms and fiscal adjustment. There is
     increased public anxiety that, even with additional austerity measures by the PA, much needed
     social spending would be cut and wage payments would continue to be delayed. The PA’s
     persisting domestic payment arrears could lead to liquidity difficulties by private sector
     suppliers and public sector employees, which in turn could lead to a rise in banks’ non -
     performing loans. It is thus critical that the PA’s efforts be complemented by the prompt
     disbursement of additional aid to help cover the financing gap expected in 2013.

    Sustained economic growth requires the easing of restrictions on the WB&G’s external
     trade, and access to the West Bank’s Area C. The easing of these controls would relax a
     key constraint on private sector growth and employment, raise the WB&G’s economic and
     budgetary revenue potential, and help ensure a sustained rise in Palestinians’ living standards.
     Joint PA-Government of Israel measures to raise clearance revenue should be implemented
     promptly to support the fiscal adjustment efforts.

Status of IMF Relations

WB&G is not a member of the IMF and therefore not eligible for financial assistance. Since the 1993
Oslo Accord, the Fund has been providing policy advice and technical assistance in the
macroeconomic, fiscal, and financial areas. IMF staff is producing regular reports on implementation
of the PA’s financial sector reforms, public finance reforms and budget execution. Together with
World Bank reports focused on structural reforms, the assessment of overall reform progress will be
taken into consideration by donors in their disbursement decisions.

               ANNEX 4: PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

The proposed DPG will be executed through the PA’s public financial management (PFM) systems. In
order to assess the fiduciary risks with respect to the proceeds of this operation, this annex summarizes
the current state of certain aspects of these systems as well as ongoing reform efforts to further
enhancement. This annex builds upon current analyses and previous reports, including the IMF and
several PFM related assessments reports, and particularly the fiduciary assessment which was
conducted by the World Bank in December 2011 and was updated in December 2012.

The Palestinian PFM system is considered to be reasonably adequate as far as the Bank’s criteria and
standards for approval of general budget support operations are concerned. The following description
of ongoing reform activities provides a more detailed assessment of the certain aspects of PFM reform
in West Bank and Gaza.

State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau

The State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau (SAACB) is the supreme institution for oversight
and external audit over actions of all entities receiving funding from the Palestinian National
Authority.28 The SAACB has been operating for several years, continually building its capacity.

While the audit of the FY 2011 financial statements has not commenced yet, SAACB has completed
the audit of the FY 2010 financial statements and issued a qualified audit opinion on the PA financial
statements as well as on PA compliance with applicable laws and regulations for the year ended
December 31, 2010. The SAACB identified significant issues in the PFM system that should further
be addressed by the PA, such as:

     1. Absence of an accounting policy on how to present and calculate arrears.
     2. Lack of clear internal control policy regarding the management of the advance accounts
     3. Discrepancy in budget and cash statements
     4. Non-completion and inaccuracies in the bank reconciliations of the Petroleum Authority


According to the audit law, the financial statements should be audited in a period of 24 months after
the end of the fiscal year. However, MoF and SAACB are striving to comply with international
practices which require the finalization of auditing the financial statements in period of six months
after the end of each fiscal year.

Currently, the EC is providing funding for an audit advisor which is the firm of PKF (UK LLP). The
PKF advisors have started their three year contract which will require them to achieve the following
objectives (a) build audit capacity, (b) improve the management structure of SAACB, (c) conduct a
legal review of laws and regulations to identify areas for improvement, and (d) address the shortage of
IT skills within SAACB. In addition they are providing technical assistance for the FY 2011 financial
audits.




28
   The SAACB is the responsible party for the external audit of the public institutions including NGOs and local government entities
including Municipalities. A total of more than 1000 institutions fall under the SAACB mandate. SAACB is responsible for three area of
audits; operational, financial, and compliance.


                                                                 56
Going forward, there are several issues affecting the SAACB operating environment that need to be
addressed, such as:

    Independence: The SAACB is not fully independent of the government and MoF. Although
     SAACB is legally independent, it is beholden to the MoF for funding in a challenging fiscal
     environment. SAACB’s independence is critical if the organization seeks to comply with
     international standards.

    Staffing and administrative issues: SAACB has approximately 150 staff. SAACB staff is part
     of the civil service and thus their salaries are paid centrally from MOF. SAACB is working on
     hiring, and enhancing its staff capacity, as well as conducting the required audit to meet its
     mandate. Also, in Gaza there are 50 auditors who cannot perform their duties due to political
     reasons. SAACB personnel are under the civil service regulations which may hinder the
     strategic planning for human resources strategy aimed at orderly conducting mandated audit
     assignment. These human resources and administrative issues are being addressed through a
     review of the civil service law and work on position structures for all PA institutions.

    Mandate and scope of work: The SAACB has a broad mandate under the law; it is mandated to
     carry out ex-post audits for all the Palestinian Authority (PA) organizations. SAACB’s mandate
     includes conducting external audit assignments of institutions at the levels of central
     government, local government, and non-government organizations. Also, it is mandated to
     monitor financial and administrative performance and to identify financial and administrative
     irregularities, including fraud and corruption.

    SAACB small size is disproportionate with its scale of activity. SAACB cannot exercise its
     mandate fully due to a scarcity of resources on one hand and weak administrative and financial
     independence on the other. With 150 staff only, the SAACB suffers from limited human
     resources, which affects its ability to perform its control functions.

    During the past few years, several donors have been involved with SAACB. The European
     Union has financed a consultancy to develop SAACB capacity as an external audit agency. The
     Bank intends to work with SAACB to roll out the use of country systems and it is planned that a
     road map will be developed to enable the SAACB to audit some Bank-financed projects on a
     pilot basis.

Financial Controllers

A key component in the MOF internal control framework is the function of the Financial Controller.
This is the traditional ex-ante model (pre-audit) used by governments. The current MoF financial
controller mandate requires each financial controller at the respective line ministry to review and clear
all transactions, including those relating to the Bank financed projects before being processed for
payments. Financial Controllers are appointed by the Accountant General and are decentralized and
housed in line ministries.

Going forward, it is important to have a strategic design for the internal control framework at the MoF,
of which, the internal audit function and financial controllers will be important components. This
design should organize and coordinate how and to what extent various elements of a modern internal
control framework interact and complement each other. One current weakness is the absence of a
comprehensive policies and procedures manual.


                                                   57
Internal Audit

The Internal Audit Department (IAD) was created in 2004 within the MoF with the dual mandate of
performing the central internal audit, and decentralizing the internal audit function from the MoF to
line ministries.

The scope of the Internal Audit Function across the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is governed
by regulation No. 11/2011 (the Charter) issued in August 2011, which clarifies roles and
responsibilities of the IAD as well as reporting requirements. Recently, a Central Harmonization Unit
(CHU) was established within the MoF pursuant to article No. 5 issued by the Minister of Finance.

According to the law, the CHU is responsible for setting and updating the internal audit methodology
as well as proving advice to the internal audit units in line Ministries. The CHU also supervises the
decentralization transition process to ensure that each line ministry has an effective internal audit
function. The IAD adopted the International Internal Auditing Standards (published by the Institute of
Internal Auditors) that were customized to meet West Bank and Gaza. In practice, the internal audit
and the CHU are not fully operational and decentralized due to capacity and financing constraints.

The EC has been providing support to the decentralization of the IAD through a private consultant.
During the past years, the IAD has been decentralized to 15 line ministries and has issued more than
30 risk assessment and internal audit reports.

Accounting and Reporting

The Auditor General opinion and the audited financial statements for the FY 2009 were published and
are made available to the public. Also, the audit of the 2010 financial statements has been completed
and the Auditor General expressed a qualified audit opinion. The Auditor General qualifications were
related to the fairness of the financial statements as well as to the compliance with applicable laws and
regulations (see above).

The Chart of Accounts (COA) is now compliant with the including the date and number of the CTA
account in which the funds have been deposited (Unified Bisan) requirements. The COA is an
integrated chart of accounts reflecting the concept of a uniform account code structure. This
incorporates both the budget structure and accounting structure. As the government moves towards
program budgeting, this will require some modification to the COA.

At the present, the major weakness in the financial system is on the revenue side. It is stated that the
problem was the reliability and completeness of tax information. There is a need to upgrade the tax
systems to provide better accounting and reporting of tax revenue.

The MOF has developed a module for budget commitment control in the Bisan mainframe to provide
additional controls over the budget as well as to provide information for cash management. However,
this module has not been yet implemented and rolled out.

Implementation of Integrated Financial Management System

The MoF developed an Integrated Financial Management System and has been rolled out to all line
ministries and is considered the official country system to account for public financial resources.
Transactions are entered by the line ministries with approval for the transaction by Financial
Controllers who are housed in all line ministries.

The system is a data-based system that uses a uniform account code structure that is a single coding
structure for all financial information; as a result, the quality of management reporting has improved.

                                                   58
The IFMIS is used by all Bank supported projects. A system audit was conducted in 2008 by an
independent accounting firm, and pointed out a number of weaknesses. The MoF stated that corrective
actions were implemented to address these issues, but a further review is merited. It is advisable to
conduct another system audit to review the integrity of information.

Use of Country Systems for Bank Financed Projects

At the present, all Bank financed projects are being audited by private external auditors due to limited
operating capacity of the State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau (SAACB). The Bank fully
relies on the financial controllers review for Bank-financed projects related disbursements. However,
for Bank-financed projects, the Bank uses the following country systems: MoF Financial Controllers,
and Central Treasury, and the Government Integrated Financial Management System. While external
audit and internal audit are still aspects to be considered for future utilization for Bank financed
projects.

Central Treasury System and Bank Funded Projects

Due to the lack of a fully-fledged central bank in the West Bank and Gaza, MOF created a Central
Treasury Account to account for all national revenues and disbursements at the Bank of Palestine. The
Central Treasury Account includes sub accounts managed by each line ministry and disbursing units
as needed. To enhance control and cash management, MoF introduced the concept of the zero-balance
account as a main component of a Single Treasury Account. Accordingly, sub accounts were created
for every disbursing line ministry with a disbursement ceiling based on its operational budget;
ministry’ disbursements are deducted from its ceiling on a daily basis. At the end of the day, the
balances are transferred and netted in the main Single Treasury Account of the MOF. Bank
reconciliations and consolidations are performed daily at the ministries and MoF levels through the
Unified Bisan with acceptable reliability.

Currently, World Bank funds as well as all donor funds are not channeled through this Single Treasury
Account but rather through separate dedicated accounts held under at the Bank of Palestine for funds
receipts and disbursements.

Each implementing Ministry has the management responsibility of the Dedicated Account for
disbursements on project related disbursements. Withdrawal Applications are reviewed and signed by
MOF before submitting to the Bank.

Anti-Corruption Overview

A 2011 World Bank study summarizes the progress made and challenges ahead in this areas as
follows: First, the PA has made significant strides to improve economic governance over the past
decade. Second, reform efforts have achieved varying degrees of success and the PA needs to
prioritize and address the ongoing challenges. Finally, the PA should take a more proactive approach
to investigating and prosecuting corruption, as well as communicating its anti-corruption activities to
build public confidence in government accountability.29

However, the report indicates some positive actions that have been implemented recently. There is
now an anti-corruption law and a fairly new Anti-Corruption agency. These two developments will
need some time to have an impact on the corruption perception. Another positive note is that CSOs
and media play a very important role. This is critical in addressing corruption issues.

Management of Foreign Exchange

Due to the fact that there is no Central Bank in West Bank and Gaza, the foreign currency
management is carried out through the Ministry of Finance. DPG proceeds will be deposited in a
dedicated bank account under the Central Treasury Account held at Bank of Palestine. Bank of
Palestine financial statements for the year ending December 2011 were audited by Ernest &Young,
and expressed an unqualified “clean? opinion. The annual report and semi-annual reports for 2011 are
published on Bank of Palestine website.

Selected Key Areas for Future Actions

More remains to be done to further improve the PFM system. This includes the following key actions:

       Ensure better integration of donor programming into the annual development budget. A clear
        action plan with commitments by all parties should be developed by the Ministries of Planning
        and Finance as part of the ongoing effort to develop a medium-term planning process.
       Fully implement internal audit function. Significant effort is already underway, but it will need
        considerable effort and support from the donor community and continued ownership and
        commitment from the PA to enhance the internal audit function in the WB&G and continue
        the decentralization plan into line ministries.
       Although external audit development has started, building the capacity of the institution to a
        satisfactory level will require more extensive and further capacity development.
       Improve cash forecasting and planning in order to address the current challenging fiscal
        conditions.
       Developing a Complaint Handling System: The PA should develop a public Complaints
        Handling System to promote more transparency and accountability and to help monitor
        Governance and Anti-Corruption risks.

Conclusion

In recent years, the PA has made significant progress in reforming PFM. This progress includes the
partial implementation of the Single Treasury Account Concept, the Government Integrated Financial
Management System, implementation of initial steps toward program budgeting. While the
effectiveness of SAACB is being strengthened with donor support, this effort is a work in progress.
There is significant effort to improve internal controls and implement modern internal audit, but much
remains to be done in terms of implementation.

While these reforms are underway, the tangible benefits of these reforms are not yet fully realized,
particularly with respect to weak capacity at both the MOF and line ministries and the internal control
framework not being fully implemented. Also, SAACB needs much additional work to carry out
external audits of government’s programs according to international standards.

In light of the fact that the fiduciary risk is assessed as Substantial and that reform is ongoing, the
Bank proposes implementing additional fiduciary measures appropriate for such level of fiduciary
risks.
