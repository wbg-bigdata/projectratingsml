MUHURI IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 725-BD)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Muhuri
Irrigation Project in Bangladesh, for which Credit 725-BD in the amount of
US$21.0 million was approved on June 16, 1977.   A Supplementary Credit
1504-0-BD in the smount of US$10.0 million wva approved on June 19, 1984.
The fi-st credit was closed on June 30, 1986, three years behind schedule.
It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on January 21, 1986.
The second credit was closed on June 30, 1986, on schedule. It was not
fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on February 12, 1987. An
amount of US$4.53 million was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programe.
Staff of the Bank's Asia Regional Office contributed minor changes to
update its information. It is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report; the President's Report; the Credit Agreements; supervision reports;
and various project-related Bank files.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on November 29, 1989, for comments
by January 18, 1990, but none were received.

MUHURI IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Credit 725-BD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.1           The Muhuri Irrigation Project was the fifth IDA credit to
Bangladesh for irrigation development. Two IDA credits had also been
provided to finance technical assistance for project preparation. These
projects were designed to support the plan of the Government of Bangladesh.
(GOB) for agricultural development which gave high priority to increasing
food production through further expansion of irrigation.
Objectives
1.2           The objective was to achieve an expansion of the dry season
irrigated area and a substantial increase in crop yields through the
creation of conditions favorable for growing high yielding varieties (HYV)
of rice. This would be achieved by constructing a regulator and closure
dam across the mouth of the Feni River, re-excavation of over 250 km of
natural drainage canals to function as supply canals to over 1100 farmer
operated low lift pumps (each 56 llsec). The project which provided flood
control and drainage facilities to about 27,000 ha and irrigation to about
20,000 ha was estimated at US$ 52 million with an IDA credit of US$ 21
million in conjunction with a Canadian credit for CAN$ 9 million (subs-
equently converted to a grant) to be disbursed over a period of 6 years.
Implementation Experience
1.3           The implementation of the project which commenced in FY78
and was scheduled to be completed in FY83, experienced delays from the
outset and continued up to FY84 when the designs and contract award for
the closure dam were finalized. The credit became effective six months
late, the contract for the major regulator was signed in September 1977,
13 months after bids had been received, changes to the design of _he
regulator caused further delays, the finalization of the design of the
closure dam took over 2 years and finally, due to objections of owners,
the acquisition of land delayed project completion to FY86 (implementation
period of 8 years as against an appraisal estimate of 6 years).
1.4           Due to implementation delays and major changes to the design
of the regulator and the closure dam, project costs estimated in FY84
increased to US$65.8 million (cost overrun of 27X). To meet the cost
overrun, IDA through a supplemental credit (Cr. 1504-BD) allocated US$10
million.  At the closing of the credit, a total of US$27.56 million or 100%
of the initial credit and 661 of the supplemental credit was disbursed.



-2-
Results
1.5           The project now providess (a) a reliable source of fresh
water for irrigation; (b) eliminates tidal fluctuations and prevents
overland saline water intrusion; and (c) flood control and improved
drainage. These facilities have resulted in a rapid expansion of area
under boro (from 2000 ha to 17,000 ha), an increase in area under HYV
aman, a reduction in the number of transplantings during the aman (the
usual practice under controlled conditions) and reduced damage to the aus
crop. This has resulted in a total increase in production of 92,000 tons
of paddy. The project ERR is now estimated as lX as against the ap-
praisal estimate of 162. In addition, the project area benefitted from
(a) protection against the cyclonic storm of May 1985 (b) the accretion of
over 4000 ha of land below the closure dam and (c) improved road and
nav.gation facilities. Fisheries development is expected to be inten-
sified as an open body permanent lake of about 2000 ha has been created.
Sustainability
1.6           Irrigated boro cultivation in the project area, within two
years of operation has increased from 2000 ha to 17000 ha. Farmers in the
first year experienced the benefits of controlled conditions during the
monsoon and the availability of adequate and reliable water supply during
the dry season and as such their response to a shift from local T-aman to
HYV and early commencement of boro have been encouraging. The sus-
tainability of the project infrastructure will not be a concern as the
present O&M program is adequately conducted by BWDB and will further be
improved under the improved O&M component of BWDB Systems rehabilitation
scheduled to commence in FY91.
Findings and lessons
1.7           The problems experienced during implementation betray a
failure both of appraisal and of earlier stages of preparation, to address
the need to carry out adequate surveys and investigation and c-ilection of
data before designs and estimates are prepared for major structures. In
spite of this, the project was well conceived with appropriate components
and institutional arrangements for inter-agency cooperation, progressive
farmers and good agricultural extension. The main findings are listed
below:
(a)   implementation delay was to a great extent due to slow
decision making by BWDB, appointment of consultants and
awarding contracts for the major structures;
(b)   consultants' performance was unsatisfactory.  As the success
or failure of project implementation in Bangladesh depends
on an effective consulting input, it is vital to be selec-
tive in prequalification of consultants and to conduct a
satisfactor,' evaluation;

(di  project infrastructure was not extended to command area
development. However with the assistance of DANIDA a part
of the system in a command area was provided with channels.
This was a major contributing factor to the rapid growth in
the area. It would be z4visable to include this development
in future projc..ts with a part of the cost contributed by
beneficiaries; and

project.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification and Preparation
2.1     Following earlier studies, which resulted in works with only
limited benefits, the East Pakictan Water and Power Development Authority
(EPWAPDA) in 1964 commissioned a study to find the best solution to the
flooding, draining and irrigation problems from flows from the Selonia and
Muhuri rivers (see Figure 1). Completed in 1967, this study proposed
improvements of drainage sluices along the Muhuri and construction of
embankments with drainage canals, construction of large drainage sluices
at the outfalls of the Muhuri and Kalidas Paharia rivers into the Feni
river and provision of four pumping stations for irrigation. The irriga-
tion development, which was proposed to use only Muhuri flows, was limited
to some 3,500 ha.
2.2     A subsequent IDA mission recommended that the flood control and
drainage studies be reviewed and updated, and that the feasibility of
diverting water from the Meghna river into the area to increase the
irrigation potential be investigated. EPWAPDA c'mmissioned the Muhuri
River Project Feasibility Study in 1970. The study proposed a single
regulator on the Feni river, thereby doubling the catchment area and
substantially increasing the water supply for irrigation. The regulator,
tied into the coastal embankment. was to provide the necessary control
against tidally induced flooding during monsoons and salinity intrusion
during the dry season. The study further proposed an alignment for a
channel to divert water from the Meghna river to the Muhuri river valley.
A report on a revised study following the same proposals was published in
1973. This concentrated on the economic justification for the project at
the expense of evolving feasible designs for the regulator and closure
dam. The controlling parameter for the regulator design was the design
flood discharge and the low dry season inflows were estimated on the basis
of limited data.
Appraisal
2.3     An IDA appraisal mission visited Bangladesh in late 1974.  The
mission concluded that the civil works for the project would be complex in
relation to works previously undertaken in Bangladesh and to estimate
project costs would entail an unusually large degree of uncertainty. To



-4-
avoid possible cost overruns and to ensure that the project was viable, it
was decided that IDA assistance to the project would be finalized after
evaluation of the bids for the major civil works contract for the project.
The appraisal team reduced the dry season irrigable area from 23,000 ha to
20,000 ha to take account of possible water abstractions in India.
2.4     The project wuz igotiated in August 7975 and documents for pre-
qualification of int ...ional competitive bid (ICB) contractors were sent
out in November during a period of internal turmoil in Bangladesh. Only
one foreign contractor showed interest and, in order to reduce delays, IDA
and BWDB agreed on post-qualification instead. Eight bids were received
in August 1976 including two from foreig-.i contractors. The lowest bid,
form a Bangladeshi contractor, was some 462 of the highest which was from
a foreign contractor but none of the bi(1s fully complied with the bid
documents. BWDB's engineering consultan%s recommended a negotiation
involving the highest bidder in conjunction with a local contractor but
IDA's recommendation of the lowest bidder, strengthened by a foreign
implementation assistance team, eventually prevailed and the SAR was
revised to take account of the costs estimated on the basis of the lowest
tender.
The Appraised Proiect
2.5     The objective was to achieve an expansion of the dry season
irrigated area and a substantial increase in cron yields through the
creation of conditions favorable for growing high yielding varieties (HYV)
of rice. This vould be achieved by constructing a regulator and closure
dam across the mouth of the Feni river which would:
1.8   form a fresh water reservoir from which water would be
pumped via improved waterways where necessary, using many
small (56 1/s, 2 cusec) low-lift pumps (LLP) for dry season
irrigation; farmers groups would construct field irrigation
channels to convey water from the pumps to the fields;
1.9   prevent salt water intrusion and .looding from the sea; and
1.10 improve wet season drainage by storing flood water in the
reservoir during high tides for release at low tides.
Drainage and irrigation would be further improved by
deepening and widening waterways throughout the project
area.
2.6     The DCA stated that the project was to assist GOB to finance
irrigation, flood control and drainage in an area of about 67,000 a.ures
(27,000 ha) around the confluence of the Muhuri and Peni Rivers. The
project was to consist of:
Part A: Civil Works



A.   Construction of 5 miles (8 km) coastal earthfill embankments
and a 1.5 mile (2.4 km) dam across the Feni River Channel.
B.    Installation ef a reinforced-concrete regulator on the right
bank of the mouth of the Feni River with automatic flap
gates on the down-stream and radial or slide gates up-stream
with a lifting device, and a mechanical boat transfer system
at a suitable location.
C.    Construction of an electricity substation for power supply
to the regulator, about 8 miles (13 km) of transmission
lines and provision of a standby generator.
D.    Construction of one large and about 30 small drainage
structures with flap gates and improvement, by installation
of flap gates and invert paving, of the existing drainage
structures;
E.    Improvement of about 110 miles (177 km) of natural channels
and excavation of about 6 miles (10 km) of new channels.
F.    Improvement of about 9 miles (15 km) of existing roads and
construction of about 9 miles (15 km) of new roads for
access to the project works.
G.    Construction of workshops, offices and housing for project
staff.
H.    Acquisition and use of vehicles and equipment for main-
tenance of project works.
I.    Utilization of consultants' services to assist the Water
Board in the planning, design and execution of civil works.
Part B: Pumps
A.    Acquisition and ir.stallation of low-lift pumps or any other
appropriate devices to raise water from the channels to the
irrigable farmlands within the project area and provision of
workshops, vehicles and equipment to maintain said pumps oi
other devices.
Part C: Training and Agricultural Extension Services
A.    Training of village extension agents and model farmers, and
provision of management training and assistance to farmers'
groups or cooperatives.
B.    Acquisition and utilization of agricultural equipment and
transportation to facilitate the strengthening of extension
services.



-6-
Part Ds Evaluation
A.    Carrying out of studies to assess the socio-economic
characteristics of the beneficiaries of the project in order
to permit an assessment, after project completion, of the
direct and indirect economic and financial benefits derived
from the facilities constructed under the project.
2.7    h'e description in the SAR differs slightly from that in the DCA
in the following respects:
A.    The SAR does not mention a mechanical boat transfer system
nor the sub-station.
B.    The number of two cusec low-lift pumps was given as 1,100.
C.    There was no mention in the SAR of training of village
extension agents and model farmers, nor of the studies to
assess the socio-economic characteristics of beneficiaries
in the description of project components although the latter
is discussed in the chapter on Organization and Management.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTAlION
Start-up
3.1     From the outset the project suffered delay.  The credit became
effective six months late after delays in reappointing BWDB's engineering
consultants for design and supervision of construction, establishing the
project fund and approval by GOB of the Project Proforma. Indecision by
BWDB, due in part to pressure from the highest bidder and the need to sign
the DCA, delayed the signing for the regulator till September 1977, some
13 months after bids had been received. An order to start work on the
regulator was issued to the contractor in February 1978, but excavation
did not begin until the arrival of the contractor's foreign Implementation
Assistance Team (IAT) in October 1978. Work was again delayed by negotia-
tions for a further amendment to the contract to clarify the procurement
and ultimate disposal of plant and materials to be imported by the
contractor.
Design
3.2     Design of civil works was generally carried out by foreign
consultants (International Engineering Company), assisted by BWDB. The
quality and timeliness of the design by this consultant was often unsatis-
factory and cause of delay. The tender drawings for the regulator
indicated sheet piles 9m long but working drawings issued two years later
had sheet piles 18m long, which caused delay while the contractor obtained
a larger pile driver. The backfill originally specified for the regulator



-7-
retaining walls was not available locally and could only have been
obtained at excessive cost: the consultant was persuaded by IDA and BWDB
to change the design to allow backfill with materials available locally,
but this caused several months' delays.
3.3     Tendering for the construction of the closure dam was delayed
because the design prepared by the consultant was technically unacceptable
and its estimated cost excessively high (US$78 million compared to US$7.8
million including contingencies in SAR). Another design was submitted in
May 1982 with an estimated cost of US$17 million, but this was not
acceptable on technical grounds. After a design prepared by BWDB was
reviewed by IDA, it was agreed that a consultant specializing in estuary
river closures should be appointed to amend the design. The amended
design was put out to tender in late 1983 and was completed at a cost of
US$22.2 million.
Revisions to the Project
3.4     Although the principle of the project was unchanged, there were
many changes to the financing and several design changes during implemen-
tation. An EEC grant of US$5.6 million was arranged in 1978 to meet local
labor costs. Following a cost overrun, IDA, in the framework of the
Bank's special assistance program devised in 1983/84, provided a sup-
plemental assistince credit (part of Cr. 1504-BD) for SDR 9.6 million
(US$10 million).
3.5     Following detailed hydraulic studies, and to facilitate construc-
tion under estuary conditions, the closure dam was moved about 1.5 km
upstream and the length was reduced from 2.4 km to 1.4 km. The closure
dam was designed to withstand cyclones, which was not envisaged in the
SAR. A count of boats using the river indicated that the boat transfer
system was not justified. Earthwork in improved and new waterways
increased substantially as did the land to be acquired for these, to take
account of the increased width and the area required for placing spoil.
Drainage structures for water control in the areas below reservoir water
elevation were deleted as the area accreted to a level above the reservoir
water elevation.
3.6     The provision of low-lift pumps and agricultural equipment was
omitted from this project but provided from other IDA-aided projects. The
standby generator for Feni regulator was omitted.
Construction and Procurement
3.7     Due to poor performance of the BWDB contractor and the consultant,
little progress was made towards the construction of Feni regulator during
the first 18 months of the implementation period. Up to November 1979,
the only activity at the regulator site was for supporting works such as
buildings, offices, godown and some excavation, largely by manual labor.
It was only after strong pressure from IDA missions that construction of
the regulator finally began in November 1979. 8WDB decided to procure the



-8-
construction equipment themselves (against IDA advice that BWDB should
instruct the contractor to procure), but they failed to make the required
equipment available during the 1979/80 dry season, and the construction
activities had to depend on meager existing equipment.
3.8     Work on the regulator was further delayed by changes in design,
internal disputes within the contractor's management and the liquidity of
the contractor. The regulator was substantially completed in 1984, some
three years late, which permitted construction of the closure dam to
begin. The foreign contractor for the dam mobilized immediately after
contract award, and initial progress was generally satisfactory. The
contractor had no experience in constructing dams in tidal water and found
it necessary to significantly increase his technical manpower, including
six marine-work specialists, in order to achieve river closure in February
1985 and completion later that year. The only major work then outstanding
was excavation of waterways. This was considerably delayed by land
acquisition difficulties, but has now been completed. Actual work is
compared with the SAR implementation schedule in Figure 2.
Quality and Performance of Project Works
3.9     The project works are successful in achieving their objectives:
forming a freshwater reservoir storing water for dry season irrigation,
reducing the effect of catchment flooding due to improved drainage, and
preventing salt intrusion. The closure dam successfully withstood a tidal
surge caused by a cyclone in May 1985 when the dam was still only partly
complete and thereby saved considerable damage and loss of life.
3.10    The quality of construction of major works viz the 40 bay regulat-
or and the closure dam is satisfactory. During the first two years of
operation (1986 and 1987), sedimentation of the reservoir area and risk of
the flap gates of the major regulator being blocked by silt deposited at
high tides were major concerns. Recent soundings of the reservoir bed
near the closure dam indicate that sedimentation is not a problem and by
regularly opening the radial gates during the dry season, the outlet canal
is kept open to enable the flap gates to operate. The water used for
flushing purposee is negligible and does not affect irrigation issues.
The opening of radial gates during the monsoon season at low tides has
caused extensive scouring to the flexible apron of the stilling basin and
the slopes of the outlet canal. With funding from the Second Flood
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1876-BD) and the flood rehabilitation com-
ponent of the Second Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation
Project (Cr. 1870-BD), preventive measures to arrest the erosion have been
undertaken. Further, during the 1989 monsoon, BWDB will operate the gates
only during high tides and also ensure that gates are uniformly opened.
The Feni River beyond the outlet canal is eroding its left bank and is
presently threatening sections of the coastal embankment. River training
works, consisting mainly of short spurs, will be constructed during the
1989/90 construction season.



-9-
PumPS
3.11    The SAR proposed that the project would provide BADC with 1,100-2
cusec (56 liters per second) low-lift pumps for sale or hire to farmers'
groups to lift irrigation water from the waterways. This component was
cancelled because it was considered that BADC had adequate pumps supplied
under other IDA credits. 'When a shortage of BADC pumps developed in the
project area, the BWDB transferred surplus pumps from the Barisal Project
(Cr. 542-BD). Nine hundred fifty pumps were fielded in the 1987/88 boro
season.
Training and Agricultural Extension Services
3.12    Although agricultural activities were started late, when they did
start, progress was good. BWDB agricultural staff began demonstrations
during the 1982/83 boro season with three groups of farmers; the number
was extended to 12 in the next season and then to 16 the following year.
Demonstrations on boro were expanded each year and, by 1985/86, they
included new HYV (especially varieties that combine high yield with early
maturity), many of them obtained from the Bangladesh Rice Research
Institute (BRRI); influence of sowing date on yield of the different HYV;
improved water management practices; and on the response to zinc and
sulphur. Assessment of costs and returns on boro cultivation were also
made each season.
3.13    Demonstrations were further expanded from May 1984 to the produc-
tion of transplanted aman and other rabi crops such as HYV wheat, mustard
and potatoes. Cooperation among the various agencies involved in rural
development improved significantly in 1984/85, resulting in a planned
program of implementation, reduced duplication of demonstration activities
and a significant increase in the command area of two-cusec pumps in the
demonstration plots from an average of '6 to 28 ha.
3.14    In 1985/86, the Noakhali Integrated Rural Development Project
(NIRDP), financed by DANIDA, extended its activities to the project area.
NIRDP has contributed by selecting a number of the more viable cooperative
group of farmers and provided these groups with concrete-lined water
distribution systems (about 170 meters out of a requirement of 1000 meters
for each command area) and ensuring that extension services, credit and
information on improved technology were readily available. At the end of
1987/88, water distribution systems were provided to 106 areas under low-
lift pumps (out of a total of 1100). Farmers' response has been very
satisfactory, and indications are that farmers would extend canal lining
at their own expense. In demonstrations, society formation, loan disbur-
sement and supply of transport to DAE and BRDB field staff in three out of
the four upazilas in the project area, DANIDA's assistance greatly
improved morale and efficiency among staff and made cooperation of
activities in the project area much easier.
3.15    BWDB agricultural staff started a training program in 1984 for 132
farmers and 12 block managers. Training activities were strengthened by
the appointment of training coordinators in each upazila and the provision



- 10 -
of training aids. In 1985 DANIDA provided funds for training 15 trainers
from the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Bangladesh Agricul-
tural Development Corporation (BADC) and Bangladesh Rural Development
Board (BRDB) at the Bogra Rural Development Institute. The trainers
organized courses for DAE block supervisors, BRDB inspectors and village
cooperative societies (KSS), managers and pump operators.
Evaluation
3.16    An agro-economic benchmark survey was initiatel in March 1981.
The field work for this was completed in August of the same year and the
report published in June 1983. This gave an indication of crop areas,
yields and farm sizes. The report did not analyze the proportion of the
area covered by the different size of holdings nor did it provide suffi-
cient information on land tenure or the extent of the project area. It
did not facilitate an assessment of the benefits derived from the project.
No evaluation study to assess the impact has been conducted. However, in
their PCR, BWDB made an assessment on agricultural development on data
collected from DAE and block supervisors. Findings are discussed under
Section IV, Project Impact. In 1986 BWDB prepared a draft PCR and a
report on agricultural development based on inadequate monitoring of
agricultural data in the project area.
Costs
3.17    Investment costs are detailed in Tables 1 and 2 and summarized
below.

The total project cost has increased by about 95Z in taka or 27Z in dollar
terms.



- 11 -
3.18    By far the greatest cost increase was for the closure dam which,
at US$22 mills 7, was about 2002 of SAR estimate in US$ equivalent (about
50O in Tk equivalent). Although delay, in conjunction with inflation,
contributed to this, the major reason is that the cost based on the
feasibility study was seriously underestimated at appraisal (mainly on
protection works). The actual cost of land acquisition was nearly six
times the appraisal estimate in dollars (10 times in taka) due to the
increase in price of land, which more than doubled from Tk47,000/ha at
appraisal to an average of nearly Tkl20,000tha (currently Tkl80,0001ha),
and an increase in area from 200 ha to 800 ha: the SAR did not allow for
acquiring land for channel improvements. The cost of management and
administration increased by Tkl05 million over the SAR estimate due to a
significant increase in project staff, costs attributed to BWDB head-
quarters, and the three-year delay in project completion. The cost of
roads was underestimated because the SAR assumed these would be con-
structed using Highway's budget. The main saving was the omission of low-
lift pumps (US$2.2 million). Although channel excavation has increased,
the apparent cost is less than the SAR because the unit rate was overes-
timated and much of this work since 1982 has been done under the Food for
Work Programme.
Project Financing and Credit Allocation
3.19    The project was financed by an IDA credit of US$21 million in
conjunction with a Canadian credit for Can$9 million (equivalent to US$8.6
million). Of the remaining US$22.4 million to be contributed by GOB,
taxes and duties accounted for US$9.8 million. The Canadian credit was
later converted to a grant and an additional grant of 5 million Units of
Account (US$5.6 million) was arranged with the Commission of the European
Communities. In addition, IDA, under its supplemental Cr. 1504-BD)
allocated SDR 9.6 million (US$10 million) to meet the estimated cost
overrun.
3.20    The original IDA and Canadian credits financed 10OZ of all foreign
expenditure and ex-factory costs of locally manufactured equipment, 502 of
local expenditure on civil works and other equipment and 702 of local
expenditures on consulting services. The EEC grant financed the dif-
ference between the IDA and Canadian finance and 90? of GOB's share of
lccal expenditure on civil works. The IDA supplemental credit increased
the disbursement percentage for civil work's local expenditure from 502 to
70X. The proposed and actual financing plans were:

IV. PROJECT IMPACT
Agricultural Impact
4.1     Although the full impact of the project is difficult to assess
from one year's post-project production figures, which have not been
collected specifically for the project area, some indications of future
patterns in production and yields are evident. The project has achieved
its objectives of:
- providing a reliable source of fresh water for irrigation
and increasing the area irrigated in the dry season,
- eliminating tidal fluctuation and preventing overland
seawater intrusion and
- improving drainage and reducing crop damage due to floods
thereby facilitating the shift from local variety to HYV
during the Aman-cropping season.
4.2     These benefits have resulted in a rapid expansion of area under
boro, an increase in area under HYV aman, a reduction in the number of
transplantings which were needed for the establishment of aman rice from
two or three (frequent annual monsoon damage) to only one, reduced flood
damage to the aus crop and higher yields form both aman and boro crops.



_ 13 -
4.3     By providing such tangible benefits to farmers and establishing a
working cooperation among various rural development agencies, the project
has also established conditions for the more rapid development of the
agricultural potential of the area.
4.4     Net Cultivable Area.  At appraisal, the net cultivable area was
estimated at 27,125 ha (67,000 ac) of which about 20,000 ha (50,000 ac)
was estimated as irrigable. The PCR mission estimated on the basis of
union maps benefitting from the project is about 31,200 ha, some 15X more
than assumed at appraisal. About 800 ha (2,000 ac) of this area has been
acquired for civil works.
4.5     The area that can be irrigated in the dry season is limited by the
inflow to the reservoir and the storage available. Taking account of
upstream abstractions and assuming available storage in the reservoir, the
PCR mission of 1986 estimated that, based on 75Z dependable low monthly
flows in the Muhuri at Parshuran and in the Feni at Kaliarchi, it would be
possible to irrigate 14,500 ha in three years out of four: the estimated
future benefits have been based on this. Although pump layouts have been
designed for 18,600 ha, the PCR assumes that the number of pumps fielded
will be limited to a number sufficient to irrigate only 14,500 ha unless
more detailed analysis indicates that there is sufficient water available
to reliably increase the irrigated area. Agriculture statistics indicate
that 16,657 ha and 17,025 ha were provided with irrigation during the boro
crop of 1986187 and 1987/88 respectively which indicates that if the
present upstream abstractions within and outside the country continues,
appraisal estimates will be achieved. However as the appraisal estimate
is based on an artificial boundary for the project with no topographical
constraint the cultivated area will be extended beyond its project area.
This factor, combined with increased upstream abstractions particularly
outside the country, will seriously affect the supply of adequate supplies
of irrigation specifically during the months of February and March (the
flowering period of rice). The issue will be addressed during the prefea-
sibility study for the South East Region Agriculture Development Project
where the proposal to augment the Muhuri Reservoir from the Meghna River
will be given priority.
4.6     Cropping Pattern.  Since appraisal, and even before the project
impact was felt, there had been a shift towards HYV.  This shift was very
marked in the aus, where HYVs rose from nothing at appraisal to about 40%
of the crop by 1984. Although there has also been an increase in HYV aman
from about 112 to about 162, the proportion of local aman decreased from
902 to 502 of the aman crop. Local boro has practically disappeared
(Table 3).
4.7     For the future without-project situation, it has been assumed that
there will be only a minor change in the pattern that existed in 1984/85,
just before the project effects began to be felt. The cropping intensity
has been assumed to increase slightly from 1702 to 1752 mainly through
slight increase in the aus crop and a significant increase in wheat, the
area of which is increasing mainly because of promotion of HYV wheat by
DAE.



- 14 -
4.8     With the project at full development, it has been assumed that the
boro area would increase to the extent that the available water resources
permit and consequently the area under local aus would decrease. The area
of HYV aman would increase at the expense of local aman and the cropping
intensity would increase to about 200Z.
4.9     No changes in other rabi crops are assumed as a result of the
project. Table 4 compares PCR and appraisal estimates of future cropping
patterns.
4.10    Yields.  Compared with those estimated by the benchmark survey,
yield estimates obtained for the years 1983/84 and 1984/85 are high
particularly for HYVs and aman pajam. Since the project could not have
contributed to such high yields, it is assumed that they are the result of
other factors, such as increased use of fertilizer and plant protection
chemicals, better HYVs and planting in rows. It is also possible that the
two years were good crop years with low levels of crop damage. Neverthe-
less, the estimated future yields without the project have been based on
these and those with the project at full levelopment estimated from them.
Any overestimate of the future without-project yields should therefore be
compensated for by the corresponding with-project yields. These will be
increased due to better drainage, reduction in flood damage, improved
agricultural techniques and more farmers undertaking supplementary irriga-
tion of aman in dry years (a practice which would be aided by the expan-
sion of the DANIDA assisted programme of canal lining and increased
purchase of pumps by farmers). The assumed yields with the project at
full development are compared with estimates for future yields without the
project and those of the 1980/81 benchmark survey below.

The PCR yield estimates are compared with those at appraisal in Table 4.
4.11    Production.  Table 4 also compares appraisal estimates of produc-
tion with those of the PCR. It shows a total increase in production due
to the project of 92,100 tons of paddy at full development compared to the
appraisal estimate of 53,000 tons to paddy and 16,500 tons of vegetables.
This can be attributed to the PCR estimate of an increase of 151 in the
project area and the fact that despite the higher area of boro in the SAR,



- 15 -
less benefit was assigned to the effect of drainage and flood protection
for y4.elds of aman and aus.
4.12    Farm Budgets.  Model farm sizes for farm budgets have been based
on the benchmark survey findings which grouped farmers into five classes
as follows:
Size of Holding         2 of Farmers
a) 0    - 0.S ac           25
b) 0.5  - 1.0 ac           24
c) 1.01 - 2.0 ac           29
d) 2.01 - 5.0 ac           19
e) over 5 ac                3
4.13    Four models have been chosen to demonstrate the financial benefits
of the project to farmers as follows%
a) Model Al  : a 0.2 ha owner farmer
b) Model A2  : a 0.2 ha teniant farmer
c) Model B   : a 0.6 ha owner farmer
d) Model C   : a 1.5 ha owner farmer
For estimating the benefits for the Model Al and AZ farmers, it is assumed
that without the project they would grow mainly local aus and aman for the
sake of security and would change entirely to HYVs with the project. It
is also assumed that without the project this group would have no area
under boro but that with the project they would cultivate HYV boro. The
predominant tenancy arrangement is that the tenant pays 502 of input costs
(excluding labor and animal power) and gives the landlord 502 of the gross
production from the land.
4.14    Model B farmers are assumed to have a cropping pattern represent-
ing the average without and with project situations of the area. Model C
farms, being large, are assumed to have a lower than average cropping
intensity but a higher percentage of their net cultivable area under boro.
4.15    From Tables 5 and 6, which show the per hectare crop input re-
quirements, and Table 7, which shows the costs of production and net
returns, budgets for the four categories of farmers have been calculated
and are shown in Table 8. The results may be summarized as follows:
Model Al                Model A2
0.2 ha Owner Farmer     0.2 ha Tenant Farmer

Net income                    11,706     18,087          28,959    42,372
Increase with project                        552                        462
Return/man-day                    61          90            482        569
Increase with project                         48Z                       182
4.16    From the above results, it is clear that although most farmers
benefit substantially from the project, the greatest percentage benefits
accrue to the small farmers, whether owners or tenants.  This provides
some reasons for the very favorable comments expressed for the project by
most farmers.
Fisheries
4.17    Before the project, the project atea contained four aquatic zones;
estuary, tidal stream, upland stream and standing water. The completion
of the closure dam and regulator eliminated the tidal zone and excluded
the estuary-dependant fish and marine prawn, which used the estuary as a
nursery. The tidal and estuarial zone were only moderately productive due
to the instability of the water regime and as a result only small fish and
prawn were caught. The project has stabilized the fresh water regime
which now provides potential for fish production if sound management
techniques are employed.
4.18    It is estimated that, with stocking and taking account of the
lowering of the reservoir level during the vet season, the reservoir could
produce, say, 700 tons of fish per year which could be increased to, say,
900 tons or more if cage culture was developed. This is comparable with
the 1,000 tons estimated production of the estuary before the project.
Fish production from streams and khals is expected to be about the same as
before the project.   As a result of the reduced flooding, there is scope
for developing fisheries in the estimated 3,000 ha of existing fish ponds
in the project area. The average yield of 160 kg/ha. The remaining 1,500
ha production costs would be equivalent to 650 kg/ha. The remaining 1,500
ha would remain undeveloped and the yield would drop to 100 kg/ha due to
lack of natural stocking by floodwaters. Estimated fish production before
and with the project is summarized below:
Fish Production (tons/year)
Before     With
Pro ect    Project
Estuary/reservoir    1,000         900
Streams, khals          300        300
Ponds                   480      1,650
1,780      2,850



- 17 -
4.19    Fish production with the project could be about 60X great.r than
before the project. However, since future development would require
further planning, investment and sound management, benefits from increased
fish production cannot be accurately quantified at this stage and have
been omitted from the economic re-evaluation.
Cyclone Protection
4.20    Benefit from cyclone protection was first realized in 1985 when
the closure dam across the Feni River adjacent to the regulator prevented
a cyclone-induced tidal surge entering the mouth of the river, thereby
avoiding considerable damage to crops, livestock and houses and loss of
life in four out of nine unions in the Sonagazi upazila. The damage and
loss caused by this cyclone in the five unprotected unions outside the
project area were roughly estimated to reach about Tk 33 million as
followss
Tk million
Aman (5,600 ac, 5,100 tons x Tk 4,600/t)    23.46
Livestock (270 cows x Tk 3,000)                0.81
(7,300 sheep and goats x Tk 500)      3.65
(10,000 poultry x Tk 50)             0.50
Houses (2,000 No. x Tk 2,500)                  5.00
Total                                 33.42
Damage and loss in the four unions within the project area would not have
been avoided if the ciosure dam had not been built.
Land Formation and Erosion
4.21    Some 4,000 ha of new land has been formed in the last four years
downsxream of the closure dam by deposit of silt. At present this land is
used for grazing but is expected to become cultivable in due course if
protected from the sea by an embankment. Erosion of the left bank of the
Feni river downstream of the closure down is threatening a part of its
coastal embankment. River training works are being planned to arrest the
erosion; Bank erosion of the Muhuri, Feni and Salonija rivers within the
project area has been prevente4 due to the formation of the reservoir.
Navigation and roads
4.22    The anticipated advantage of the improved navigation on the
improved waterways has been less than expected since transport in the
project area is now largely by road. However, the improved waterways
specifically the Muhuri, Feni and Saloniya rivers have facilitated the
transport of building materials from the southeastern hills. Fishermen
boating into the Bay of Bengal cannot now take their boats up the river,
but this does not appear to be a serious problem. However, the newly



- 18 -
constructed and improved roads and the bridges in the project area have
considerably increased traffic volume as well as reduced transport costs.
Local matket places and several other economic activities within the zone
of influence of the newly constructed roads have also been induced by the
project.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.1     The zujor direct benefit from the project is the incremental
production of paddy. The provision of drainage and flood protection
facilities has caused a major shift in the cropping patterns and increased
cultivation of high yielding rice varieties in the wet season, while
provision of freshwater in the reservoir and improved waterways increase
the irrigated area of boro in the dry season. The annual production at
full development (FY1989190) is expected to reach 241,000 tons of paddy,
602 higher than without the project. The incremental paddy production
from the project would reduce imports thereby saving foreign exchange of
about US$19 million per year to the country.
5.2     Other benefits generated by the project include greater potential
for fish production (see 4.17), cyclone protection (see 4.20) land accre-
tion (see 4.21), navigation (see 4.22) and increased employment.
Assumptions
5.3     The economic analysis of the project was carried out in 1986
constant prices, with past expenditures re-stated in 1986 price terms
using the cost of living index. All costs, except for land acquisition
and taxes have been included in this analysis. Local costs component was
translated into border prices using a standard conversion factor (SCF) of
0.80 and foreign exchange component was valued at the official exchange
rate of US$1.0 = Tk30.3. The economic wage for unskilled labor for both
construction and farm worker has been taken at 75% of the market wage rate
of Tk3O per man-day. Several specific conversion factors (CP) have been
estimated (see Table 9) and have been used in this analysis. Table 9
presents the economic costs of the project. Exclusion of the cost of land
acquisition was based on the assumption that the land involved was taken
out of production and, therefore, its cost to the economy was taken as the
agricultural production foregone. Such foregone production, which was
estimated at Tkl2,300/ha based on the net benefits of the without-project
cropping pattern with cropping intensity of 170Z, has been subtracted from
the benefit stream. Operation and maintenance costs of civil works were
estimated at Tkl5.6 million per year (Tkl9.5 million x SCF), or 1.5% of
total costs of civil works. Replacement cost of regulator gates has been
assumed after 20 years at Tk7l.7 million. Residual value of vehicles and
equipment and material has been estimated at TklO million and Tkl million
respectively which has been credited to the project in FY1986187. The
additional costs of channel improvement financed by the food for work
programme have been included in the calculations by taking the economic
price of the wheat supplied. The DANIDA-financed brick-lined irrigation



- 19 -
channels have also been included in the cost streams. Tables 10 and 11
show phasing of LLPs and their capital, replacement and operation and
maintenance (0&M) costs.
5.4     The quantifiable benefits included in this analysis are the
incremental paddy production and cyclone protection. Farmgate prices of
internationally traded goods have been projected on the basis of the
January 1987 World Bank's Commodity Prices Forecasts in 1986 constant
value. The 1986 and projected 1990 and 1995 prices of paddy, wheat and
oilseeds in 1986 constant values based on import parity prices have been
used as shown in Table 12. The non-traded ,)ods are based on the present
financial farmgate prices adjusted by SCF. Because quantities of fer-
tilizer used in the project are small and for simplicity in the economic
calculations, their projected 1990 prices in 1986 constant values have
been used (Table 12). The projected prices of triple super phosphate
(TSP) and murate of potash (MOP) are based on import parity prices, while
projected price of urea was based on export parity price assuming that
Bangladesh will become a net exporter of urea by the end of 1990 when the
Chittagong Urea Plant reaches full production. A summary of economic
farmgate prices of outputs and inputs is presented in Table 13. Economic
production costs are summarized in Table 14 and the net incremental
production benefit calculated in Table 15. Benefit from cyclone protec-
tion damage has been estimated at Tk3l.4 million per event in economic
terms and assumed to recur once every 10 years.
Re-estimated ERR
5.5     In estimating the internal economic rate of return (ERR), a 40-
year period of analysis has been used. The construction period was ten
years. Full development is expected to be achieved in project Year 13
(FY1989190). Economic costs and benefits streams are presented in
Table 16. The re-estimated ERR is 12%, less than the 16% estimated at
appraisal. Factors contributing to the lower ERR are cost overrun, delay
in realizing benefits, lower real price of rice and reduced boro irrigated
area compared with the appraisal forecast.
Employment Created
5.6     The largest indirect benefit generated by the project is increased
employment. During the project implementation period about 12 million
man-days were generated from the construction of civil works, of which
about 2 million man-days were generated tinder the food for work programme.
In addition, about 840 permanent and temporary jobs ere generated under
the BWDB. About 50,000 families would benefit directly from the increase
in farm income and agricultural production.   As a result of a shift in
cropping patterns, improved cultural techniques and an increase in dry
season cropped area, employment related to agricultural production is
expected to reach 11.5 million man-days per year at full development or
20% more than without project.

VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1     The Government institutions mainly involved in the project are:
-BWDB, responsible for management and execution of the project
including design, construction, operation and maintenance of
civil works.
-BADC, responsible for selling and hiring low-lift pumps.
-BRDB, responsible for formation of pump groups and their
integration into the Upazila Central Cooperative Association
structure.
-DAE, responsible for agricultural extension services.
6.2     In order to achieve cooperation between the agencies a Project
Implementation Committee (PIC) was established. The PIC consists of
senior officers of the implementing agencies and upazila chairman and is
chaired by the Project Director. Representatives from DANIDA and other
organizations are invited as required. The PIC, which first met in April
1985 and has met regularly since then, has been successful in achieving
good cooperation between the agencies involved. The project was included
in the portfolio of the Central Evaluation Committee (CEC) in order that
progress and problems could be reviewed and resolved at a high level but
this was not effective in resolving BWDB's major implementation problems.
BWDB
6.3     BWDB was responsible for civil construction and must take the
greatest responsibility for the delays incurred. Credit effectiveness was
delayed while BWDB negotiated with their consultants; there were further
delays while the contract for the regulator was negotiated and again while
plant and equipment were procured by BWDB.
6.4     Although most delays could be attributed to poor project manage-
ment, political upheavals and the country's particularly severe financial
constraints during the construction period were also major contributors.
Civil servants were averse to making decisions on procurement and award of
contracts for fear of being accused of corruption.
6.5     Although IDA realized before appraisal that BWDB's organization
and management were particularly weak, it was felt that provision of
substantial consultant assistance and the strong likelihood of the regula-
tor contractor being foreign would be adequate, provided BWDB were streng-
thened by such measures as creating direct lines of responsibility between
individual board members and BWDB departments, greater delegation of
decision making authority and improved administrative arrangements   In
the event, relations between BWDB and its consultant were consistently
poor, the regulator contractor was local and many of the possible strengt-
hening measures were not implemented.



- 21 -
6.6     BWDB's performance in agriculture was good (see 3.12 to 3.13).
Unlike the other agencies which carried out demonstrations on small plots,
B'WDB demonstrations and training programs were with whole pump groups and
covered most aspects of improved technology including better HYVs, date of
planting, soil fertility, water management and row planting. The success
of the demonstrations can be measured by the extent of conversion to HYV
boro, the shift to earlier planting of boro and the adoption of row
planting throughout the project area.
6.7     Operation and Maintenance.  Operation and maintenance of civil
works are the responsibility of BWDB. An organization for this has been
proposed but not yet adopted. If farmers are to pay water charges to
cover the cost of this (see 6.12) the charges should be kept reasonable by
avoiding extravagant use of manpower for O&M. It is not expected that
BWDB would maintain field irrigation channels which would remain the
responsibility farmers' groups as would the operation of pumps.
Maintenance of pumps would be the responsibility of the owners, whether
BADC, BWDB or farmers' groups.
BADC
6.8     BADC were to procure 1,100 low-lift pumps for the project, but
this was cancelled on the grounds that pumps were available for BADC from
other sources. In fact BADC had difficulty in providing sufficient pumps
and it was necessary for BWDB to provide surplus two-cusec diesel pumps
from Barisal. Although GOB policy is stated to be that BADC should no
longer hire pumps but should only sell them, this has not yet been en-
forced in the project area. The SAR envisaged that BADC would provide
farm inputs this has been largely taken over by the private sector.
BRDB
6.9     Up to January 1987, BRDB had formed 759 societies in the four
upazilas which included the project area as shown in Table 17, of which
443 societies are village cooperative societies (KSS), which include most
of the pump groups, 149 are BSS (landless groups) and 167 MSS (women's
groups). Short-term credit disbursement in Feai, Sonagazi and Chagalnaiya
upazilas reached about Tk 3 million in FY1985/86 with loan recovery of
about 80?. Until recently, there has beer. no credit disbursement in
Mirsarai upazila since 1983184 due to poor loan recovery. Since 1983184,
119 pumps have been sold by BADC and BWDB out of a total of 520 pumps
fielded in 1987. Formation of pump groups could be limited because many
members of KSS, originally formed by central cooperative banks, are no
longer eligible for credit due to defaulted loans. Rescheduling of the
outstanding loans would promote the use of credit for purchasing pumps.
However, it is anticipated that fielding of LLPs in the project area would
continue provided BADC continues to rent pumps.



- 22 -
DAE
6.10    DAE is responsible for providing technical advice and assistance
to farmers on all crops through the training and visit system. In the
early years of project implementation, departmental efforts were con-
centrated on developing the system and building up staff to maintain it.
Moreover, dry season irrigation being only one aspect of its responsibili-
ties and with few staff trained in irrigated crop management, DAEs role
remained secondary to that of BWDB agricultural staff who concentrated on
working with farmer groups on dry season irrigated boro cultivation. It
was only towards the end of project implementation that the interest of
the DAE staff in irrigated agriculture became evident. Cooperation with
other agencies improved as a result of the establishment of a functioning
PIC; staff training was started with assistance from DANIDA and participa-
tion in BRDB farmer training programmes and assistance to pump groups
systematized. However, despite prodding from IDA, a consolidated agricul-
tural development support programme has not yet been produced, partly
because the area falls within two agricultural districts. Individual
Upazila Agricultural Officers nevertheless consult with the other agencies
in drawing up their annual plan of work for presentation to the Upazila
Parishads.
Compliance with Covenants
6.11    The covenants of the Development Credit Agreement were generally
complied with except for the following. There is no evidence that the CEC
ever reviewed progress of project implementation as required by Section
3.05 of the DCA. Section 3.08 required GOB to acquire, where needed, land
required for construction of project facilities. There were considerable
delays in acquiring land, particularly for excavation of waterways.
Section 4.01(b) of the DCA requires GOB to furnish financial statements
and audit reports to IDA within six months of the end of the financial
year. These were always late and audit queries, for the most part, went
unanswered. Section 4.02(a) of the DCA required the Project Director to
submit to IDA a detailed O&M manual by July 1980. Although a draft manual
was prepared in 1983 this required substantial improvement.
6.12    Cost recovery.  Section 4.03 of DCA required GOB by July 1979 to
prepare proposals to recover from farmers benefitting from the project the
full costs of O&M and replacement of low-lift pumps plus the O&M cost of
civil works. Recovery was to begin 18 months after completion of physical
works. GOB was also required to recover as large a portion of the capital
costs of the civil works as appeared compatible with the maintenance of
adequate incentives for farmers. GOB has failed to comply with cost
recovery covenants on many irrigation projects and this has been the
subject of separate study by IDA, who consider that in order to attempt to
recover costs (i) the irrigation facilities must be fully operational (ii)
the procedures for assessing water charges must be simple and fair and
(iii) collection arrangements must be workable. Provided the number of
pumps fielded can be matched to the water available, there should be no
difficulty in keeping the Muhuri Irrigation Project fully operational.
This project is therefore most suitable for initiating cost recovery as



- 23-
soon as satisfactory procedures for assessing and collecting charges have
been established.
Performance of Consultants
6.13    BWDB employed foreign firms of consultants for design and assis-
tance with supervision of construction of civil works. The first firm,
which had already carried out the feasibility tudy and which was re-
employed from 1977 to 1983, was unsatisfactory in many respects: it did
not fulfil it's obligations regarding delivery of detailed construction
drawings, used uneconomical design criteria and prepared designs that were
technically unsound. Relationships between the consultants and the
contractor and BWDB were mainly poor and changes of staff did not produce
lasting improvements. Eventually in 1983 a second firm of consultants was
engaged for the design and supervision of construction of the closure dam:
this firm performed well.
6.14    Two man-months of foreign expert services were provided in 1986
for consultancy services for agricultural extension, during which a good
draft project completion report and a report on agricultural development
were prepared.
Performance of IDA
6.15    This project was well conceived.  Although there were some minor
discrepancies between the SAR and DCA, probably due to the long period
between the appraisal mission (late 1974) and issuing the SAR (hay 1977),
these were not significant. The construction schedule proposed in the SAR
was over-optimistic.
6.16    IDA adopted an innovative approach for estimating project works,
although its results remained disappointing in the end. It was a wise
decision to await the results of tenders for construction of the regulator
in order to have a more reliable cost estimate befcre the credit amount
was finalized. The difficulties in estimating the cost of constructing
the regulator were foreseen, but the more severe technical problems of
design and construction of the closure dam across the estuary were not
given sufficient attention at appraisal. The reliance placed on BWDB's
consultants was not justified by their performance, and the costs actually
encountered were not anticipated with sufficient accuracy. These were the
major contributory factors to the need for the supplementary credit, but
even by 1984 the cost estimate for the dam was inaccurate and resulted in
the amount of the supplementary credit being about 502 more than was
disbursed.
6.17    Twenty supervision missions visited the project over a period of
eight years and were able to give considerable technical advice and
assistance but were unable to overcome the considerable delays. Many of
the technical shortcomings of the first consultant was discovered by IDA
missions: a consultant on one mission was instrumental in obtaining the
services of the closure dam consultant who performed well.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
7.1     This was a well conceived project with appropriate components and
institutional arrangements for inter-agency cooperation, progressive
farmers and good agricultural extension. There are some problems with
credit but these are not yet serious. Estimated benefits are considerably
greater than foreseen at appraisal but are offset by the substantial cost
overrun and considerable delay. Based on a dry season irrigated area of
14,500 ha the ERR is estimated to be 12X.1 If the inflow to the reservoir
could be shown to be sufficient to irrigate the maximum area for which
pump layouts have been designed (18,600 ha) the estimated ERR would
increase to 13Z.
7.2     Much of the delay was due to slow decision making by BWDB: ap-
pointing consultants, awarding the contract for construction of the
regulator and procuring plant and equipment caused substantial delays
which could have been avoided.
7.3     The firm of foreign consultants appointed for the design of the
regulator was unsatisfactory: their designs were late, changed and so
uneconomical that the firm was replaced in 1983.
7.4     The substantial changes in detailed design between appraisal and
construction show the advantages of completing detailed design b fore
appraisal and before tender. Although tenders were received for the
regulator before appraisal, substantial changes to the design caused
delay. Estimated costs for the closure dam varied widely while various
detailed designs were being considered and resulted in the Supplemental
Assistance Credit being larger than necessary. A lesson learnt from this
is that prior to appraisal for a project which comprises major works like
the Feni regulator and the closure works under estuary conditions.
detailed investigations, design, estimates and tender documents should be
complete.
7.5     Only civil engineering contractors with substantial financial
resources should be awarded high risk contracts such as the regulator and
closure dam. In the case of the regulator, the contractor's resources
were barely adequate to cope with the additional costs of delays, many of
which were beyond his control, but for which he was not adequately compen-
sated in a timely manner. The consequent lack of funds contributed to
further delays. BWDB's procedure for settling claims should be improved.
For both these contracts, lack of specific technical expertise was suc-
cessfully overcome by the contractors employing foreign specialists.
lArea assumed on water availability as estimated on inadequate data
and on the presumption that the proposed Meghna Huhuri transfer under the
regional development plan of the South East will not be implemented. Based
on appraisal estimate of area the ERR is 152. It may be mentioned that the
area cultivated in FY86 was 17,000 ha.

7.6     Soime of the construction plant required for the regulator contract
was supplied by BWDB. This caused delay, resulted in some unsatisfactory
plant and has left BWDB with plant which is difficult to maintain or is
not required. It would have been preferable for all plant to be provided
by contractors who would have been responsible for specifying, procuring
and paying all duties and would have retained ownership on completion.
7.7     A major contributory factor to the success of the project is the
responsive attitude of farmers, who are quickly taking advantage of
project facilities. This has been assisted by the project-directed
extension services, which have carried out many demonstrations of improved
crops and techniques in the project area.
7.8     Supplementary irrigation in the wet season is not yet a popular
concept with farmers. For those who rent pumps from BADC or BWDB it is
impracticable to complete the formalities and obtain the pumps at short
notice. As more farmers' groups buy pumps, supplementary wet season
irrigation, when required, may become more widespread, in which case,
careful consideration of reservoir operation will be necessary. If the
reservoir level is kept high during the monsoon season, there is a risk of
the radial gates being closed when a flood occurs. If this coincides with
a power failure, the time taken to raise the 40 gates manually may be too
long to prevent overtopping. The need for a standby generator should be
reconsidered before radial gates are closed during the monsoon season.
7.9     Project infrastructure was not extended to onfarm development.
This is a major factor in irrigated areas under LLP being about 502 of the
irrigable command. DANIDA'S assistance in the construction of lined
canals assisted immensely in reducing the adverse effects caused by
inadequate and substandard distribution systems constructed by farmers.
In future projects, it would be advisable to include the development of
command areas In the facilities to be provided by the project.
7.10    The fisheries in the estuary have been curtailed by the construc-
tion of the closure dam but the reservoir has potential for development of
fisheries. This should be studied and suitable development that does not
conflict with the use of the reservoir for irrigation and flood control
should be implemented as soon as practicable. The reduced risk of flood-
ing in the project area enables improved development of pond fisheries to
be undertaken. This also requires organization and implementation.
