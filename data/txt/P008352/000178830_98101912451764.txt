I. THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY
A. Introduction
1.01      In the Government-controlled area of the island, manufacturing has
become a 'Large and significant sector in the Cyprus economy, particularly
after the 1974 events, and the Government recognizes that the expansion and
modernization of this sector will be the main source for steady future growth
in Cyprus. The new 1979-1981 Third Emergency Action Plan is therefore
expected to emphasize industrial development based on a two-tier strategy:
(i) to increase the efficiency and productivity of the multitude of existing
small-scale enterprises, and (ii) to establish additional medium and larger
scale enterprises. This represents a shift in strategy to gradually increase
the capital-intensity of industries to improve the country's ability to earn
foreign exchange, to increase remuneration per worker, and to provide employ-
ment for an increasingly skilled labor force.   The more capital intensive
investments are expected to be in export-oriented, competitive industries with
high value added, based on comparative advantages and the use of domestic raw
materials where possible. The Government is expected to participate in some
medium to large scale projects now being studied, e.g., a phosphate fertilizer
plant, the expansion of cement capacity and a possible ship repair yard for
small to medium sized craft.
1.02      Since sufficient reliable data are still not available for the
northern, Turkish-Cypriot controlled area, it has only been possible to
meaningfully review the economic situation and prospects for the southern
Government-controlled part of the island. However, it is known that in the
northern area the industrial activity continues to be seriously affected by
shortages of foreign exchange, and by the lack of experienced managers and
skilled technical labor. Reliable total unemployment figures for the north
are not available.
B. Structure of the Manufacturing Sector
1.03      Cyprus' manufacturing secitor is based on traditional industries
such as fEood processing and beverages, clothing and footwear, and construc-
tion materials, which account for about half of total manufacturing output.
The post-1974 period has seen the development of new industries producing
chemicals, intermediate and equipment goods.
1.04      The manufacturing sector is characterized by its fragmentation into
numerous small enterprises. Small enterprises with less than 5 employees
represented in 1976 some 83% of all industrial enterprises in the south, and
more than one fourth of total manufacturing employment. Subsectors with the
highest share of small enterprises have been transport equipment (repair
shops), electrical machinery, metal products, rubber products, footwear and
clothing, and wood and furniture; footwear and clothing alone accounts for one
third of all small enterprises. Enterprises with 5 to 19 employees (SSI) 1/
1/   Sizes of enterprises are currently defined in Cyprus as follows:
"Small" : 1- 4 employees   "Medium" : 19-50    employees
SSI    : 5-19    "          "Large"  : above 50    "



- 2 -
account for 12% of all enterprises, and those with 20 or more employees for
5%; the former ones are mainly in footwear/clothing, food/beverages and wood/
furniture, and the latter ones mainly in footwear/clothing, food/beverages and
textiles. The share of small enterprises in industrial activity reached a
peak in 1975, mainly as a result of the emergency measures taken after 1974
to reactivate the economy and absorb the refugees in productive employment.
Value added per worker in manufacturing has remained comparatively low ($4,430
in 1975), due in particular to lower performances in the small enterprises
where labor productivity has been between half and two-thirds of the produc-
tivity in larger enterprises.
1.05      The strategy followed in 1975 and 1976 to reactivate the economy and
to create employment at low investment cost had the effect of reducing unem-
ployment from 16% of the labor force in 1975 to about 2% by mid 1978, and of
returning capacity utilization in manufacturing to efficient levels (about 80%
in 1973 and 1977, after a drop to 60% in 1975). The scarcity and increasing
cost of labor is now becoming a constraint on the future expansion through
small enterprises based on labor value added. However, considering that
13,500 Cypriots (6% of the labor force) presently work abroad, of which 7,000
on construction contracts in the Middle East, a partial repatriation of this
work force could substantially change the present tight labor situation in the
south.
1.06      In contrast to the above, the reactivation and development of the
industrial sector in the north has proceeded at a considerably slower pace,
reflecting serious difficulties in mobilizing foreign and domestic resources
as well as shortages of managerial and technical skills. Expansion of manu-
facturing output has been particularly constrained by the continuing lack of
foreign exchange to purchase raw materials and spare parts. To overcome this,
a principal objective of economic policy in the north is to expand commercial
links abroad and develop exports based on locally available resources.
C. Performance of the Manufacturing Sector
1.07      The disruption due to the 1974 events had only a temporary effect
on manufacturing output in the south, which resumed growing at a rapid pace
after 1975, increasing by some 28% in 1976 and 15% in 1977 in real terms. A
growth of about 11% in real terms is expected for 1978. The share of manu-
facturing value added in GDP has increased from 15% in 1975 to 18% in 1977;
the most important contributions to growth originated in footwear and cloth-
ing, non-metallic minerals (including cement), food and beverages. Emerging
sectors with highest growth rates have been those producing machinery and
equipment, and chemical products.
1.08      The very satisfactory increase in output resulted in particular
from the substantial investments made in manufacturing, which represented
between 17% and 22% of Domestic Fixed Investments since 1975. During the
post-1974 adjustment of the economy, the share of food/beverages, wood/
furniture and equipment goods in investment declined to the advantage of
investments in footwear/clothing and chemicals, whereas non-metallic minerals
(mainly cement) continued to receive the major share (about 30% on average) in
order to respond to the rapidly increasing demand from Middle East countries.



- :3 -
The temporary strategy of developing labor-intensive industries to absorb the
excess labor force resulted in comparatively low investment costs per worker
during 1975-1976 ($4,900 including, and $3,600 excluding the cement plants);
investment: costs per worker were marlkedly low in leather products ($1,450),
and in footwear and clothing ($1,750).
1.09      The employment in manufacturing since 1975 has increased by an
average of 16.5% p.a. and representeid in 1977 about 20% of total productive
employment:.  Manufacturing was the major source of additional employment in
the island, contributing 37% to the overall increase over 1975-1977. Again,
footwear and clothing, and non-metallic minerals made the major contribution
to additional employment in the sector and the economy.
1.10      Exports of manufactured goods from the south increased from CL 24
million in 1975 to CL 65 million in 1977, and have represented an increasing
share of manufacturing gross output (33% in 1977 as compared to 22.5% in 1975)
and of total exports (59% in 1977 versus 49% in 1975). Exports of footwear
and clothing recorded an average increase of 68% p.a. in real terms from 1975
to 1977 and represented about 30% of manufactured exports in 1977. The
exported share of the subsector's output increased from 37%, in 1975 to 53% in
1977. Exports of food products, beverages and tobacco represented some 28% of
the 1977 manufactured exports, with the share of exports in the subsector's
productiona increasing from 20% to 36%. Exports of non-metallic mineral
products (principally cement) contributed 18% to total manufactured exports
and represented 58% of the subsector's production in 1977. Emerging exports
with highest growth rates have been chemical products (cosmetics, detergents,
insecticides, paints) and special-purpose machinery (concrete mixers, water
pumps).
1.11      Available data and surveys indicate that the average propensity to
export is substantially higher in the larger enterprises (37% in enterprises
with more than 20 workers as opposed to 21% in SSIs and 0% in small enter-
prises).  As a result, medium and larger scale industries hlave accounted for
more than 80% of total manufactured exports.
1.12      Arab countries are the predominant market for Cyprus' manufac-
tured exports, followed by the EEC and in particular Great Britain; the
share of exports to Eastern European countries, formerly major clients of
Cyprus, and to other countries have correspondingly declined. Regarding
exports of clothing and footwear, which constitute the major manufactured
exports, the share of Arab countries increased over 1975-1977 from 52% to
67%, the share of EEC from 16% to 18%, and that of Eastern European countries
declined from 20% to 12%. Most of clothing and footwear exports to the Arab
countries and Eastern European countries have been for the least quality-
conscious segments of these markets. Cement exports, the third major com-
ponent of industrial exports, have gone entirely to the Arab countries.
1.13      However, given the volatility and the expected saturation of, and
intense competition in some of the Middle Eastern markets, Cyprus aims at
expanding or opening markets in Europe, in particular in the EEC which has
granted Cyprus duty free entry for manufactured goods originating in Cyprus.
A deeper penetration in European markets will require a substantial effort,



- 4 -
particularly regarding consumer goods, to raise the quality of production
to Western European standards. Achievement of higher quality will require
complementary investments, especially in footwear and clothing; the emergence
of labor shortages reinforces the need for more productive utilization of
labor and for a higher intensity of capital in manufacturing.
D. Prospects for the Manufacturing Industry
1.14      A distinction can be made between three components constituting the
manufacturing sector:
(a) the fragmented small and SSI industries, mainly represented
by the footwear and clothing industry, where the efforts
for, and the effects of rationalization should be highest;
(b) the other existing medium size industries as they were
structured and operating in 1978, including the cement
industry; and
(c) the larger and more capital intensive projects under
implementation or scheduled for construction under the
1979-1981 Plan (para 1.02).
1.14       In Table .1 below the projected figures for increases in employment,
value added, exports, and required investments for the period 1978-1981 are
summarized. It should be realized that some of the larger projects will just
come into operation at the end of the projected period, and their full opera-
tion benefits are thus not reflected.
1.15      In Table 1 the figures for increases in employment, exports, and
required investments in the manufacturing industry in the south for the period
1979-1981 are given, and related to the situation existing in 1978.  The data
indicate that total investments of CL 76.3 million in current terms during the
period under review will increase annual manufactured exports by 63% in volume
by 1981 (or CL 47.1 million in 1977 CL which, if adjusted to current CL, would
amount to CL 78.6 million by 1981). 1/
1.16      Estimates of the June 1978 IBRD Economic Mission indicate an average
value added in the manufacturing industry of 38%.  Using this value added as a
(conservative) indicator of net export earning, thus assuming all raw materials
and semi-finished products were imported, the net foreign exchange earnings
resulting from the projected CL 76.3 million investments in manufacturing
would result in additional net foreign exchange earnings of 0.38 x CL 78.6
million, or CL 29.9 million by 1981 through increased exports of manufactured
goods. In addition there would be foreign exchange savings through import
substitution, the magnitude of which could not be determined but are believed
to be substantial.
1/   To simplify calculations of these approximate figures, the phase dif-
ference between investments and production has not been taken into
consideration.



1.17      The figures in Table 1 are based on information prepared by the
Planning Bureau and the Ministry of Industry, and were reviLewed by the Bank's
1978 economic mission. The projections appear reasonable subject to continued
economic stability in Cyprus and in its potential major export markets. Of the
total investment required in manufacturing for the period :[979 through 1981 of
CL 76.3 million, CDB is projected to disburse CL 12.5 million or 16.4% of the
total.

II. THE TOURISM INDUSTRY
A. Performance and Prospects
2.01       The tourism industry suffered a severe setback as a result of the
1974 events, but has made a remarkable recovery since 1976 in the south. In
1975, not only was tourist traffic temporarily interrupted, but 6,000 out
of the 10,000 hotel beds were located in the highly developed resorts of
Famagusta and Kyrenia in the north and remained idle. Although some of the
hotels in the north have been reopened, a large portion of the available
capacity remains unutilized. Hotels in the uninhabitated part of Famagusta
are vacant, and would require considerable investments for their rehabilita-
tion in the event of a political settlement.  Construction of new hotels and
apartment hotels had raised the number of available tourist hotel beds in the
south to nearly 7,000 by end 1978, and this number is expected to increase to
11,200 beds by 1981, 15,400 beds by 1983, and 25,000 beds in 1985. 1/ The
inflow of tourist and other longer term visitors is correspondingly expected
to increase from 216,000 in 1978 to 432,000 in 1985. This objective does not
appear unreasonable, assuming continued political stability, completion of
hotel projects as planned, and adequate promotional efforts.

Demand for hotel space in the south far outstrips available resources, and
many tour operators have to be turned down each year. This is evidenced,
for example, by the 4-5 star hotels on the coast--such as those financed by
CDB--which have shown a remarkably high bed occupancy rate of 89% during the

period January-October 1978. In contrast, expansion of tourism in the north
is constrained by lack of trained manpower and by difficulties faced in
establishing links with foreign tourist agencies. As a result, nearly all
tourists in the north are from Turkey, and hard currency earnings from tourism
are small.
2.02      If an early political settlement is reached, there is a possibility
that the resort area of Famagusta with its hotels might again become acces-
sible to the south; the rehabilitation of the existing hotels there would then
take preference over the construction of new hotels. This eventuality would
not necessarily diminish the economic prospects of the existing hotels, nor
of the hotels now under construction in the southern part of the island; the
scope of the tourism industry in Cyprus is such that it is expected that the
existing Famagusta hotel capacity, as well as the new capacity in the South,
could be put to full productive use.
B. Financing of Tourism Projects
2.03      Financing for tourism projects, mainly hotels, is provided in the
form of equity capital by the promoters, commercial bank loans, Government
loans provided through the Loan Commissioners (para 3.01), and loans and
equity provided by CDB. CDB funds have contributed towards the completion
of 458 beds since 1974, or 18% of new beds provided. In projects under
construction, CDB is involved in projects totalling 2,674 beds, or 63% of
all capacity under construction. The total gross capital Eormation over
the 5-year period 1974 through 1978, amounted to CL 10.8 million, with CDB
contributing 12%; for the similar period 1979-1983, total gross capital
formation is estimated at CL 27.9 million, with CDB contributing 18%.
III. THE FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT
A. The Banking System
3.01      The financial community in Cyprus includes the Central Bank, two
Greek-Cypriot, one Turkish-Cypriot, and six foreign-owned commercial banks;
two cooperative banks, three long-term lending financial institutions, and
the Loan Commissioners complete the banking structure. Thie two Greek-Cypriot
banks are the Bank of Cyprus Ltd., and the Cyprus Popular iBank; the foreign
banks are British owned (Barclays Bank International Ltd., Chartered Bank,
Grindlays Bank Ltd.), Greek owned (National Bank of Greece S.A.) and partly
American owned (Hellenic Bank Ltd.); only the British banks are active in
the south and north Cyprus. A Turkish bank (Turkiye Is Bankasi A.S.) and the
Turkish-Cypriot Bank (Turkish Bank of Nicosia) operate only in the north. One
of the cooperative banks is Greek-Cypriot, the other Turkish-Cypriot, and they
operate in the respective par.s of Cyprus.  A1l the long term iending finan-
cial institutions are Greek-Cypriot: the Mortgage Bank of Cyprus Ltd. (a
subsidiary of the Bank of Cyprus), Lombard Banking (Cyprus) Ltd. (a subsidiary



- 8 --
of National Westminster), and CDB. The Loan Comirissioners is a Government
agency currently operating only in south Cyprus, and lending directly and/or
through banks to industry, hotels, agriculture, and for village and other
community projects.
3.02      Total assets of all banks (including the Turkish-Cypriot institu-
tions) amounted to CL 487.7 million as of October 31, 1978 (latest available
data), which represents an average growth of 15.7% p.a. since mid-1975; total
assets of commercial banks totalled CL 426.1 million (+15.3% p.a.) and CL 61.6
million for the financial institutions (+18% p.a.). The total amount of bank
credit outstanding was CL 281.9 million and was exactly matched by CL 281.8
million of savings and time deposits in the commercial banks. They had there-
fore no problem in finding resources of appropriate maturity (mainly time
deposits) to finance the CL 68.9 million of outstanding loans to industry.
Yet in order to ensure the continued availability of bank funds for investment
in high priority sectors such as manufacturing, the percentage liquidity (part
of the minimum liquidity ratio) which is allocated to such financing through
the Central Bank Special Fund 1/ was increased from 3% to 5% in March 1978 and
to 6% in February 1979.  The other financial institutions had an outstanding
loan portfolio totalling CL 46.7 million, of which CL 6.7 million were for
industry, with CDB providing 85% of the latter. Local investments, foreign
and other assets accounted for 20% of the commercial banks' total assets, and
for 17% of the financial institutions at end October, 1978. Equity funds
were 12% of the total assets of the financial institutions in October, 1978,
compared to 30% by mid-1975; the respective figures for the commercial banks
were identical. Commercial banks operating in the south received 95% of all
the bank's deposits and had granted 96% of all advances and loans.
3.03       CDB has a special position in the financial sector as it lends
exclusively at medium and long term, but has to borrow all its resources.
Until mid-1974, CDB's competitive position vis-a-vis the commercial banks
was weak as the latter, which were very liquid, used to finance long-term
investments through less costly short-term loans which they would roll over.
Since then the situation has improved as the commercial banks and CDB now see
each other's roles as complementary, with CDB having the leading part in
appraisal of subprojects and long term financing, and with the commercial
banks providing mainly working capital and short term loans. Although the
commercial banks are in a position to grant loans up to 8-9 years through
allowance for delayed repayments of principal, they concede to CDB a definite
quality edge in the appraisal of subprojects.  This frequently gives CDB a
natural lead in the appraisal and financing of complex projects, with the
commercial banks coming in afterwards on a cofinancing basis.
B. Interest Rates
3.04       In Cyprus the Government has a long-standing policy of strict
rnntrol of interest rates and determines interest rate ceilings on deposits
and loans which apply to all credit institutions (see Annex 21). The current
1/   Created in 1974 to assist in priority investments.



- 9) -
interest rate ceiling of 9% p.a. for all loans, including all charges, has
been fixedi at that level since 1974.  This rate was established as part of
the overaLl policy for reactivation of the economy, and in that respect it
has been reasonably successful.  Given the relative moderation of inflation,
it has also been sufficient to maintain a positive real int:erest rate since
the inflatiion rate has been 3.4% in 1976, 7.6% in 1977, and was estimated at
8.3% in 1978. At present the 9% interest rate reflects adequately the cost
of domestic resources which varies between 6-7% for time deposits maturing
over 12 months, and 5X5% for long term loans from the Government of Cyprus;
the Central Bank's discount rate being set at 6%. However, the 9% ceiling
tends to underestimate the cost of borrowing abroad, especially with the
exchange risk - borne by the Government - taken into account.
3.05      Partly as a result of the Bank's on-going dialogue with the Govern-
ment on its financial and economic policies, and the Finance Ministry's own
recognition of its need for greater flexibility in establishing the interest
rate ceilings so as to be more responsive to the country's changing priori-
ties, the Ministry has indicated that it is currently preparing legislation
which would provide the Ministry with the authority to set interest rates
without prior parliamentary approval. Once this legislation is passed, the
Finance Ministry has indicated that it would consider raising the interest
rate ceiling if economic conditions require it. In any case, over the commit-
ment life of the proposed Bank loan the interest rate, assumed to continue to
be 9%, will be positive when compared with the inflation rates projected at
8.0% for 1979, 7.0% for 1980 and 6.0% for 1981. In view of this no changes
in the rate structure are recommended at this time. However, the Bank intends
to review the issue with the Government from time to time as appropriate.
IV. THE CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK (CDB)
A. Background Information
4.01       The Cyprus Development Bank was established in 1963 to provide
medium- aLnd long-term financing for industry and tourism. Initially 60% of
the shares were held by the Government, and 40% by private investors. A first
Bank loar of $3.0 million was granted to CDB in 1972 (para. 5.13).
4.02       The hostilities in 1974 seriously affected the economic development
of Cyprus. A separate de facto Turkish-Cypriot administration took control of
the northern part of the island, which included rich agricultural areas as
well as the touristic resort areas of Kyrenia and Famagusta. About one-third
of both Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots were displaced and became refugees. Unem-
ployment in the Government controlled area reached 16% of the economically
active population in 1975.
4.03       The 1974 events were serious for CDB.  CDB's portfolio in the
northern area, amounting to half of its outstanding total loans and to one-
third of its total equity holdings at the end of 1975, was lost, and CDB
was subsequently saved from bankruptcy through Government intervention.



- 10 -
4.04       The Government, with the objective of making CDB the major instru-
ment of development assistance to industry and tourism, restructured and
refinanced CDB in 1976 with World Bank technical assistance. The Government
took over all of CDB's voting shares, and agreed to provide CDB with grants
and guarantees of payment to offset past and future non-payments of principal
and interest on the northern area portfolio; CDB also received compensation
for its small equity holding in the north.
4.05       Subsequently, and in conjunction with $4.0 million KfW financing,
IBRD granted CDB a second loan for US$6.0 million, which included an alloca-
tion of $0.75 for small scale industries (SSI).  This second loan was approved
by the Executive Directors on May 28, 1976 and is described in Appraisal
Report 1079a-CY of May 10, and in the President's Report P-1853-CY of May 11,
1976; these reports also contain a more detailed description of the Government
restructuring and refinancing scheme referred to in para 4.04.
B. Ownership
4.06       As of March 1, 1979, CDB's authorized share capital was CL 3 million,
of which CL 1 million was paid-in capital; this consists of 400,000 "A" shares
of CL 1 nominal value acquired by the Government from private investors in
1976, and 600,000 "B" shares of similar nominal value also held by the
Government. As compensation to the 960 private shareholders who gave up
their "A" shares, the Government has issued non-voting preference shares
carrying a dividend of 5% per annum, to be redeemed at par by the Government
in 1988.
C. Board of Directors
4.07       CDB has since 1976 a Board consisting of seven Directors, all
appointed by the Government through the Council of Ministers. Under the
provisions of the Loan Agreement 1278-CY for the second IBRD loan to
CDB, three of the Directors are to be appointed from among members of the
civil service and/or Government controlled corporations, while four of the
Directors posts must be filled by qualified and experienced members of the
business, industrial and professional communities in the private sector.  The
Chairman of the Board must be one of the four Directors from the private
sector. To be able to take binding decisions, at least two private sector and
one Government director must be present at a Board meeting. The composition
of the present Board is shown in Annex 2.
4.08       The composition of the Board, and its quorum system, provide reason-
able safeguards for an autonomous Board, which can ensure that CDB will con-
tinue to operate on the basis of sound financial and economic standards. The
Board has actively participated in, and contributed to the decision making
and planning process at CDB in the past, and is expected to continue to do so
in the future.



- 11 -
D.  Management and Staff
4.09      The CDB management team consist of the General Manager who is
directly responsible to the Board, an Assistant General Manager with specific
responsibilities for the technical and economic evaluation of projects and for
loan supervision work, and three Senior Managers respectively in charge of the
Economic, Technical and Financial Departments. Until mid-1979 an experienced
technical Foreign Adviser, provided by and paid for by the British Overseas
Development Ministry, will also be associated with CDB. A small section deals
exclusively with SSI operations, but can draw on other staff for assistance.
The CDB organization chart is shown in Annex 3. CDB engages auditors and
relies on outside legal assistance.
4.10      The CDB staff now totals 31, of which 18 are professionals; this
compares with a total of 16 in 1976, of which only 7 were professionals. The
staff and management is highly qualified, and experienced in development bank-
ing. Bank missions judge the staff and management very competent, responsive
to new ideas, and able to cope with the high workload imposed.
E. Policies
4.11      The Cyprus Development Bank is a multipurpose development finance
company which, though owned by the Government, is established and operates in
the private sector as an autonomous public company. In line with the Memo-
randum and Articles of Association, and the statement of Policies and Proce-
dures as amended on January 28, 1976, and approved by the Bank at that time,
the objectives of CDB are to develop, encourage and stimulate productive
enterprises in Cyprus whose projects it considers viable and from the economic
point of view desirable, with particular emphasis on, but not limited to, the
fields of manufacturing and industrial processing, small-scale industries,
tourism, agro-industries and mining.
4.12      CDB assists and promotes productive enterprises by providing medium-
and long-term loans, and equity financing. It is trying to develop an active
capital market in Cyprus, and has assisted in attracting foreign capital for
joint ventures. CDB also provides economic, technical and managerial advice
to Cypriot enterprises, and in particular to its client companies including
SSI. Total advances to a single enterprise are limited to 30% of CDB's net
worth. Equity participations in a single enterprise are limited to 10% of
CDB's net worth, and total equity investment must not exceed CDB's net worth.
CDB operates predominantly in the private sector, and loans for Government or
semi-Government projects, or projects of cooperative banks or societies, are
not allowed to total more than 25% of total outstanding CDB loans.



F. Procedures
4.13      Appraisal.  CDB's technical, financial and economic work has reached
high standards, and the quality of the appraisal reports received by the Bank
has been very satisfactory. A weakness in the appraisal work reported at
the time of the previous IBRD loan to CDB, namely the depth of the marketing
study for each project, has been corrected and such studies are expected to
become even more comprehensive following the recent addition of a market
analyst to CDB's permanent staff. Besides financial projections, and break-
even point calculations and sensitivity analysis where appropriate, CDB
routinely calculates economic rates of return for all projects involving more
than $200,000 of CDB financing and often for smaller projects, whether or not
these involve IBRD funds. The financial rate of return is calculated for
most projects, except SSI. For the numerous small SSI projects, financial
projections, and break-even point calculations and sensitivity analysis where
appropriate, are used for the internal review by CDB.
4.14      Supervision.  Project supervision has been strengthened by CDB,
following the hiring of additional staff and the Assistant General Manager
taking direct responsibility for this part of CDB's activities. Financial
supervision now includes frequent visits to borrowers, and as a result CDB has
been able to assist enterprises facing difficulties at an early stage. The
increased supervision and follow-up has contributed to the very low level of
serious arrears, 2% of total portfolio at end 1978, in spite of the rapid
increase in CDB's total loan portfolio (para 5.16). Technical supervision
continues to be satisfactory, with an average of four site visits by CDB
engineers to projects under construction. SSI projects are also adequately
supervised.
4.15      Procurement and Disbursement.  Procurement procedures are satisfac-
tory, considering that few projects financed by CDB, if any, are of sufficient
size to attract or warrant formal international competitive bidding according
to IBRD procedures. However, CDB requires borrowers to submit competitive
bids for all equipment and contracts, except for very small projects or in
special circumstances; a professional estimate for building costs is also
required. The cost figures are carefully reviewed by CDB engineers before
disbursement is authorized. Disbursements are closely monitored, and CDB
insists on prorata funding by the project's sponsor. Payments are generally
made directly to suppliers or contractors on submission of invoices, after the
review by the CDB engineers. The procedures used are considered satisfactory
and appropriate.
V. CDB PERFORMANCE
A. Normal Operations
5.01      Between 1963, when CDB started operations and 1975, total approvals
of loans and equity investments have amounted to CL 8 million. Between 1976
and 1978, they have totalled CL 9.3 million; for 1978 alone approvals amounted



- 13 -
to CL 4.5 million, of which 35% were approved during the last quarter. In
addition to the above, CL 0.6 million in loans was approved under the SSI
Scheme in 1977-1978 (see Section B). A summary of operations for the years
1975-1978 is given in Annex 4. The figures for 1975 are abnormally low
because the eighteen months from mid-1974 until end-1975 were essentially a
holding operation, pending a decision on the future of CDB by the Government.
However, CDB has actively assisted with investments to expedite the economic
recovery which started in 1976, with approval volume increasing at a compound
growth rate of 101% p.a. between 1975 and 1978.
5.02      The distribution of approvals by subsectors for the period 1975-1978
is summarized in Annex 7. Over those three years, 59% of total approvals went
for loans to industry, 29% for tourism, 9% for transport and 3% for agricul-
ture, which is about in line with the proportions observed before 1974.
5.03      Since 1977 the time-lag between approval and commitment has widened
significantly. Whereas commitments in 1976 represented 72% of approvals
in that year, the percentage dropped to 56% in 1977 and 1978. This is due to
sponsors tending to approach CDB at a very early stage of the project and
CDB approving the loan subject to conditions that have to be satisfied sub-
sequently. There is also a tendency for projects to get larger and more
complex, and thus for the technical specifications and the legal documentation
to become more complicated to prepare, therefore causing delay. Many projects
are cofinanced with other financial institutions (para 3.03), and the neces-
sary coordination is a further source of delay for commitment. However, this
is partly compensated by a reduction in the time-lag between commitment and
disbursement with the ratio of disbursements to commitments increasing from
78% in 1976 to 92% in 1978.
B. SSI Operations
5.04      The previous Bank loan in, 1976 to CDB (Loan 1278-CY) initiated
an SSI program to promote small industries providing employment at low cost.
The SSI program was aimed at reducing the 16% unemployment rate prevailing at
that time, and to assist with the establishment of new industries and the
development of entrepreneurial talent.  The Bank loan provided $0.75 million
which was matched by Government funds prorata. CDB administered the program,
but received administrative and technical assistance from the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry. Initial applications were collected by field officers
of the Ministry, suitable applications were forwarded to CDB for review, and
promising projects were subsequently approved by a committee composed of both
CDB and Government officials.
5.05      The parameters of the SSI to be supported were defined in 1976,
after a sector study by CDB, to cover an employment range of 4-19, a maximum
investment cost after project implementation of CL 20,000, a maximum CDB loan
of 75% cf project cost, maximum fixed assets limited to CL 20,000 after
project implementation, and a maximum cost per job created of CL 4,000. The
Government guaranteed 75% of the loan amount, and also agreed to pay CDB any
administrative costs in excess of gross income from the lending operations.



- 14 -
5.06      The actual SSI program start-up was delayed due to administrative
reasons, and the first SSI subloans were not approved until mid-1977. However,
the program has since proved successful, and the full amount allocated from
the bank loan and matching Government funds had been committed by the end of
1978, as originally planned. A total of 260 SSI loan applications had been
received by end 1978 by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, of which 169
had been passed on to CDB and of these 64 had been approved for financing.
The average loan amounted to CL 9,200; a total of 250 jobs have been or will
be created under the scheme, at an average cost of CL 2,300 per job. Not a
single borrower has defaulted on principal or interest payments. The admin-
istrative cost payments by the Government to CDB (para 5.05) amounted to CL
29,000 for the 18-month period ending December 31, 1978. The financial
statements relating to SSI operations are given in Annexes 23-26.
C. Economic Impact of CDB
5.07      Contribution to Investment.  Although annual disbursements by CDB
increased by 47% between 1976 and 1978, CDB's impact on the economy of Cyprus
remains modest as far as investment funding is concerned; however, its
participation in a growing number of projects, and the appraisal of these
projects, enables CDB to play a more important role than indicated by figures
alone. The table below shows the evolution of CDB's share in the industrial
and tourism sectors since 1972:

5.08      Promotion of Entrepreneurship.  While commercial banks are often
reluctant to finance projects whose sponsors do not have either a past record
as entrepreneurs or sufficient securities, 22 such projects (out of a total
of 67 loans approved) were financed by CDB in 1978 for a total of CL 2.4
million or 58% of CDB's total approvals. In addition, projects accounting for
CL 0.5 million were approved in 1978 for the expansion and creation of SSI
with fixed assets, excluding land and buildings, of less than CL 20,000.
5.09      Financial and Economic Profitability.  A sample of projects approved
by CDB over the period 1976-1978 shows internal financial rates of return
(FRR) ranging from 13% to 46%, and averaging about 25%. Larger projects
submitted to CDB's Board for which the internal economic rate of return (ERR)
has also been computed show an average ERR of 26%, which is satisfactory.
5.10      Size and Duration of Loans.  Smaller loans, between CL 10,000 and CL
50,000, represented 43% of the number of loans approved in 1976-1978; larger
loans, over CL 100,000, constituted 60% of CDB's anproval volume since 1976
(see Annex 7). Between 1976 and 1978, the average loan approved by CDB
increased slightly from CL 52,200 to CL 62,600. The average repayment period
of CDB's loans to industry is 6 years excluding the grace period, and 8 years
for tourism loans. For the 25 projects (excluding SSI) submitted to the Bank
for financing, the average repayment period is 7 years, including one year of
grace. Yet the analysis by maturity presented in Annex 7 shows that the
number of loans to be repayed in less than 5 years (excluding grace period)
has risen from 46% of the total in 1976 to 67% in 1978, which reflects a
reduction in the average loan duration.
5.11      Employment Creation.  Employment creation by CDB financed projects
was 1,510 in 1977 and 1,705 in 1978, while the average investment cost per job
increased from about CL 5,500 in 1977 to CL 9,800 ($27,500 equivalent) in
1978, excluding one capital intensive cement project. Nevertheless, while
costs per job have increased in manufacturing from CL 3,600 in 1977 to CL
6,500 in 1978, they decreased in tourism from CL 15,100 to CL 13,200.
Overall the increase in average cost per job reflects the shift toward capital-
intensive investments made necessary by the acute shortage of labor in Cyprus.
5.12      Promotion.  In addition to the promotional efforts through equity
participation described in paras 5.19-5.23, CDB has also been involved in the
promotion of some larger projects requiring more complex technical, economic
and financial appraisals; it has been active in searching for cofinancing
(including contacts with IFC.) The projects currently in CDB's pipeline (see
Annex 14) are a lime project, a plant to quarry and process gypsum, a plant
to manufacture ceramic tiles, a bentonite project, a salt processing project
and a ship repair yard. The processing of these projects has been slow due
to their size, complexity and economic risks involved, and the caution shown
by CDB is a satisfactory indication that CDB will adhere to its meticulous
appraisals when confronted with the new industrial strategy which has been
adopted by the Government for the development of Cyprus (para. 1.01).



D. First and Second IBRD Loan to CDB
5.13      First Loan.  The first 1972 IBRD loan (Loan 830-CY) of $3 million
was fully disbursed by January 1976. It was used to provide part of the
foreign exchange component of 17 projects, of which 8 are located in north
Cyprus. Of the 13 manufacturing projects financed, 4 were export-oriented and
4 were import-substitution oriented, while a further 4 served both objectives
and one project was in the service sector. The total cost of these projects
was $20.6 million 1/ and the IBRD loan provided CDB with 81% of the foreign
exchange required. These funds helped create 767 jobs, at an average cost
of $27,000 per job. An Audit Report from the Bank's Operations Evaluation
Department dated November 17, 1976, indicated that although the choice of
projects was satisfactory, the impact of the Bank on the institution building
aspects has been limited and was affected by the 1974 events. However, from
1975 onwards the Bank has been very active in supporting CDB; it assisted in
the restructuring of CDB in 1976, provided a second loan in that year, has
given wide-ranging technical assistance since that time, and recently helped
CDB to enhance its profitability.
5.14      Second Loan.  The second loan to CDB signed in 1976 (Loan 1278-CY)
was divided into two components: $750,000 for SSI, and $5.25 million for
normal operations. By the end of 1978, CDB had committed essentially all of
the $6 million, of which over $4.9 million had been disbursed by the end of
March 1979. The main component of the loan contributed to the financing of
34 projects, of which 26 were in manufacturing, 4 were hotels and 4 were in
transport and service. Of the 26 manufacturing projects, 4 were for exports
and 10 for import substitution, and a further 12 served both objectives. The
total investment cost of these projects was $20.8 million, of which the import
component represented 54%. The IBRD loan provided CDB with 48% of the foreign
exchange required. The projects for which Bank funds were provided through
CDB created at least 503 jobs, at an average cost of $28,700 per job. This
figure represents actually a substantial decline in real terms compared to
the average for the first IBRD Loan (para 5.13) considering the appreciation
of the Cyprus pound vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar (about 20% between 1974 and
1978) and increases in equipment cost due to inflation.
E. CDB's Portfolio
5.15      Loan Portfolio in Northern Cyprus.  CDB's loan portfolio in northern
Cyprus amounted at the end of 1978 to CL 2.5 million (of which CL 1.4 was
past-due maturities), but it represented only 29% of the total loan portfolio
outstanding compared to 47% at the end of 1975. Overdue interest amounted
to CL 1.2 million as of end-1978. All loans to subprojects in the north are
de facto delinquent since July 1974. As 49 out the 51 projects concerned were
owned by Greek-Cypriots who became refugees, the Government agreed to guaran-
tee CDB repayment of principal and payment of interest due on this portfolio
up to CL 3.5 million. This advance would have to be repaid to the Government
in case a financial settlement between the two communities takes place. This
explains, first, why these monies are accounted for as liabilities, but are
1/   At 1976 exchange rate.



- 17 -
considered neither as long-term debts nor as quasi-equity, and therefore are
excluded from the debt-equity ratio calculation and, second, why overdues in
principal and interest on the northern portfolio are still shown as assets in
CDB's balance-sheet. To CDB this part of its loan portfolio is riskless, and
therefore! CDB has made no provision for it. With CDB's help, 22 projects
formerly located in the north have been partly or totally reactivated in the
south and some repayments, though limited, of former loans have occurred.
5.16       Loan Portfolio in Southern Cyprus.  CDB's loan portfolio in southern
Cyprus at the end of 1978 amounted t-o CL 5.7 million, of which CL 5.3 million
were outstanding loans and the rest arrears. A detailed ainalysis of CDB's
loans in arrears of over three months is available in the Project File.
Arrears in principal beyond three months in the south have increased slightly
from 3.3%' of the loan portfolio 1/ as of end-1977 to 3.7% as of end-1978 which
can be considered satisfactory in view of the rapid portfolio growth of 36% in
1978. The proportion of portfolio affected by arrears of over three months
has increased from 10.9% to 12.8%, mainly because of one project with a large
outstanding balance accounting for :31% of the portfolio affected by arrears,
but not considered as serious by CDB. However, the proportion of portfolio
affected by arrears considered as serious by CDB in its year-end portfolio
review was only 2.0% as of December 31, 1978. Indeed, two-thirds of the
arrears in principal and just over one-third of those in interest are asso-
ciated with companies operating profitably.
5.17       In addition to the above arrears, about CL 0.3 million of overdue
maturities and interest are subject to rescheduling and hence not accounted
for as arrears. At the end of 1978, past due maturities rescheduled and out-
standing loan portfolio affected by rescheduling represent:ed respectively 4.2%
and 10.8% of total loan portfolio. Most of the 15 loans rescheduled consist
of firms with prospects good enough to warrant the clearing of arrears spread
over a slightly longer time. Of these, some cases affecting 7.5% of total
portfoliD and for which prospects are judged only fair, have been provisioned
against by CDB as a precaution.
5.18       Provisions for doubtful accounts amounted to CL 281,650 as of
December 31, 1978 or 4.8% of the loan portfolio. They are considered suffi-
cient by the auditors. All the arrears considered as serious or subjected
to legal constraints (judgement debtors) 2/ are provisioned against as well
as variable portions of loans rescheduled but still considered uncertain.
Overall it is CDB's policy to set aside each year as provisions 2% of its
disbursements, which is adequate to cover CDB's risk of losses.
1/   In this section all the percentages are computed in terms of total loan
portfolio (normal operations) in the south, including current and past
due msturities and judgement debtors.
2/   "Judgement debtors" are those debtors with which the loan agreement was
terminated and court judgement obtained for the full repayment of the
outstanding principal and interest. CDB has not proceeded with the exe-
cution (such as seizing of mortgaged assets) of any court judgements,
however, as subsequently arrangements could be made to secure repayments
in all cases.

F. Equity Portfolio
5.19       Project promotion through equity investments is an important objec-
tive for CDB and it has received special emphasis in the last three years.
A list of the equity portfolio is given in Annex 11. Excluding two invest-
ments located in the north inactive since the events of 1974, but compensated
under the Scheme of Guaranty (see para 5.15) as of end-1978, CDB had partici-
pations in nineteen Greek-Cypriot companies, totalling CL 529,184 at acqui-
sition cost, up from four companies and CL 122,200 at the end of 1975. Over
this three-year period, the proportion of equity investments in total portfolio
in the south has doubled to 8.6%. The cash dividends received by CDB have
more than doubled every year since 1975 to reach CL 15,200 in 1978, but the
yield on average portfolio 1/ is still low - 3.8% in 1978 compared to 1.6% in
1976; this in part reflects the fact that some of the companies in which CDB
took an equity position are still in the start-up phase. However, the number
of participations producing dividends has increased from one to six, and on
those the average yield was 10.2% in 1978.
5.20      Except for a shoe company in which CDB had to take a major equity
position when it was in difficulty, and excluding one company in liquidation
but fully provisioned, CDB does not own more than 30% of the capital of any
company, and more than half of its participations are below 10% of total
shares. CDB's Statement of Policies limits its equity exposure in any enter-
prise to 10% of its own equity. As of end 1978, this represented a ceiling of
CL 135,410, but only one investment reached CL 100,000 and the average partici-
pation was about CL 28,500 and the median only CL 15,000. The equity port-
folio was also well within the limit of 100% of CDB's net worth at 44%. It is
projected to increase up to 68% by end-1979 due to commitments carried over
from 1978, but it will go down afterwards to 40% in 1981 and 30% in 1983.
5.21       The majority of the equity participations held by CDB are in the
industry, but by the end of 1978 a quarter of them were in transportation,
tourism and banking whereas there were none in these sectors in 1975. In 1978
as well as in 1977 more than half of the equity investments of CDB (on a
commitment basis) were in newly created firms, which is consistent with its
development role.
5.22      There is no institutionalized stock market in Cyprus, but some
trade occurs through three "brokerage" firms, of which only one is really
active, and the commercial banks, and in June 1978 the first semi-official
stock exchange meeting was held under the auspices of Hellenic Bank Ltd. CDB
has also started the process of setting up a stock exchange by contacting
consulting firms for a feasibility study. Twenty-five securities are traded
actively with price-earnings ratios ranging up to 55:1, and averaging 16:1.
1/   Excluding participations in the north.



- 19 -
5.23       Eight of the nineteen Greek-Cypriot companies in which CDB holds
shares are traded, and they appreciated by 46% on average in 1978. In order
to improve CDB's profitability which was very low until the Government agreed
to guarantee it against exchange risk and against any borrowing costs above
6% (paras 5.28 and 5.31), CDB devoted 18% of its equity investments (on a
commitment basis) in 1978 to the purchase of shares with high capital gain
prospects, in particular banks. At the end of 1978, the market value of
CDB's equity investments was estimated at close to CL 1 million, thus implying
about CL 430,000 of hidden reserves. By comparison, the capital gains on
paper at the end of 1975 amounted to only CL 2,500. CDB has not sold any
participation so far, but it plans to do so starting in 1979 with about 5% of
its portfolio. By 1981, the sales of securities will finance half of the new
equity investments, and by 1983 they are expected to finance all of them.
G. Resource Position and Financial Performance
Resource Position
5.24       CDB's statement of resources as of December 31, 1978, is given in
Annex 8. At that date, CDB had mobilized CL 15.7 million, of which 62% was in
local currency 1/. CDB has not borrowed any long term resources since 1976,
when it obtained its second loans from the Bank and KfW. In January 1978, an
agreement providing matching funds ior the financing of SSI projects was
signed, but it was made in conjunction with the second Bank loan signed
in 1976 (see Guarantee Agreement 1278-CY, Section 202(ii)). As of end-1978,
CDB had CL 5.2 million of outstanding foreign borrowings, of which CL 2.1
million from KfW and CL 3.1 million from IBRD. Outstanding local debts
amounted to CL 3.2 million, of which 9% were of short term maturity.  At the
end of 1978, the balance of resources available for new approvals was nega-
tive by CL 2.2 million, and all foreign currency resources had been committed,
thus revealing an acute resource mobilization need (see para 5.39).
Profitability and Financial Position
5.25       CDB's summarized audited income statements and balance sheets for
the period 1976-1978 are given in Annexes 9 and 10 and the relevant perfor-
mance indlicators are presented in Annex 12.  The 1978 audit gave an unqualified
opinion on CDB's accounts. CDB's auditors are Metokas, Cthristofides, Loizides
and Co., a Cyprus auditing firm associated with Touche Ross and Co. Over the
past years, auditing standards applied by this firm have been satisfactory--
half of CDB's transactions are checked and all its clients, if public com-
panies, must submit audited accounts--and the audit reports on CDB's accounts
have always been ready and made available to the Bank on schedule.
1/   Equity CL 1.4 million; loans and advances from Government CL 5.4 million;
debentures CL 1.5 million; short term local funds CL 1.1 million; IBRD
CL 3.2 million; KfW CL 2.7 miLlion; UK export credit CL 0.1 million;
provisions CL 0.3 million.



- 20 -
5.26       CDB's profitability improved dramatically following the Government's
decision to cover CDB for the exchange risk on its foreign borrowings, and to
compensate it for all costs of borrowing above 6% retroactive to January 1,
1978 for all current foreign borrowings; a copy of the relevant letter from
the Minister of Finance to CDB is in the Project File. This arrangement brings
CDB's foreign exchange cost in line with that of the competing commercial
banks, who can freely convert deposit funds costing about 5% on average into
foreign exchange at the Central Bank to finance approved investment projects.
This arrangement is necessary in the short run to maintain CDB's competitive
position; in the long term arrangements distorting the true cost of foreign
exchange should be abolished as interest rates are freed; this objective will
be pursued during the regular exchange of views on these matters between the
Bank and the Government (para. 3.05). During negotiations, we received
indications that for future borrowings the interest rate guarantee will be
considered on a case by case basis. However, it is expected that it will
apply during the commitment period of the loan in the case of borrowings
linked to the LIBOR in view of the high interest cost of such borrowings at
present.
5.27      Net income in 1978 was close to CL 200,000 compared to a maximumm of
CL 65,500 in 1976. The return on average net worth went from 1.5% in 1977 to
15.0% in 1978, or to 12% excluding the one-time writing-back of accumulated
provisions for exchange risk. Based on the financial projections, CDB envis-
ages the continuation of such profitability levels. Interest income has
increased by 26% from 1976 to 1978. Dividends and other incomes, such as
interest on time deposits, debentures and guarantees, have increased faster
(by 137%) reflecting CDB's efforts to offset the impact on its net income
of the 9%-ceiling on lending rate. In spite of the guarantee of a three-
percentage points spread by the Government (para. 5.26), CDB intends to
increase this diversification of incomes in the future.
5.28      Although CDB's lending rate has been pegged to the maximum allowed
of 9% p.a. since mid-1974, one third of its loan portfolio as of end-1978
still bore interest rates between 5% and 8.75%. This explains why the income
from loans represented only 8.8% of average outstanding loans in 1978.
Financial charges on borrowings have increased by 38% from 1976 to 1978, but
by only 20% if the 6%-interest rate guarantee agreement (para 5.26) is taken
into account. Thus financial expenses as a percentage of total assets de-
creased sharply from 5.5% in 1975 to 3.9% in 1978. The average interest rate
actually paid by CDB on its borrowed funds was 6.5% in 1978, down from 7.3%
the previous year.  CDB's interest spread between its loans and borrowings was
2.3% in 1978, up from 1.1% in 1977, and was sufficient to generate adequate
profits. Administrative expenses decreased from 2.0% of total assets in 1976
to 1.3% in 1978, which represents a good performance.  Additional provisions
for doubtful loans are set at 2% of new disbursements, which is satisfactory
(see para. 5.18).
5.29       Total assets as of end-1978 amounted to CL 11.0 million compared to
CL 6.2 million as of end-1975. Part of the growth was due to the overdue
maturities on loans in the north which are accumulated in the balance-sheet



- I1 -
as current: assets and are compensated by advances from the Government under
the Scheme of Arrangement (see Guarantee Agreement 1278-CY, Section 2.2(i)).
For this reason, the current ratio rose from 3.1 in 1975 to 4.8 in 1978. CDB's
debt-equity ratio was 4.7:1 at the end of 1978, well within the agreed limit
of 5:1. Accumulated provisions for potential losses covered adequately the
arrears considered as serious. Overall, CDB as of end-1978 presented a
balanced and sound financial situation.
H. Exchange Risk
5.30      Although at the time of appraisal of the second Bank loan to CDB the
Government had agreed to bear the exchange risk of CDB's foreign borrowings,
it postponed doing so until February 1979, though with retroactive effect to
January 1, 1978. Therefore, until 1977, CDB had to undertake the foreign
exchange risk on its foreign currency borrowings. As a result, CDB suffered
exchange losses amounting to CL 34,911 in 1976 and CL 14,003 in 1977, and
had to make provisions amounting to CL 19,771 and CL 4,700 respectively,
thus costing CDB 4.7 percentage points in terms of return on average equity
in 1976 and 1.6 percentage point in 1977.
5.31      In order to remove this abnormal pressure on CDB's profitability
and to comply better with the financial covenant of Loan A,greement 1278-CY
(Section 4.07) which urges CDB to take steps satisfactory to the Bank to
protect itself against any exchange risk, the Government decided in February
1979 to compensate CDB for the exchange risk incurred since January 1, 1978
on existing borrowings and in May to cover it for the future. However,
it limits somewhat the exchange risk coverage on the first loan from KfW and
on the loan from Midland Bank, but because of the small outstanding balances
involved the impact on CDB has been estimated at only CL 900.
5.32      In view of the free convertibility of the Cyprus Pound, and of the
above policy decision by the Government covering CDB's foreign borrowings, a
recommendation that it passes the exchange risk on to the ultimate users of
foreign funds would not be appropriate.
I. E'rospects
Operational Projections
5.33      The operational projections for 1979-1983 are based on a pipeline
of projects for 1979, detailed in sanex 14, and on a set of assumptions
detailed in Annex 13 for the followiLng years. The projected normal



- 22 -
operations 1/ of CDB for the five years 1979 to 1983 are expected to result in
cumulative approvals of CL 21.6 million, commitments of CL 22.1 million and
disbursements of CL 20.5 million. As of end-1978, half of the projected
approval volume for 1979 had been identified as CDB's pipeline consisted of 24
applications for an estimated amount of approvals of CL 1.3 million and of
five projects promoted by CDB (para. 5.12) for CL 0.5 million. A growth rate
of 10% p.a. was assumed thereafter for loans to industry and a ceiling of CL 1
million p.a. for hotel loans. Overall the projected growth of approvals will
be much slower than the one experienced before (para. 5.01), and given the
inflation rate on capital goods it appears to be reflecting a levelling of
approval volume in real terms.
Financial Projections
5.34      CDB's projected Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Source and
Application of Funds for the years 1979-1983 are presented in Annexes 17-19.
Major indicators and ratios are summarized in Annex 20. Assumptions for
CDB's financial projections are detailed in Annex 16.
5.35      CDB's total assets would grow from CL 11.7 million at December
31, 1978 2/ to CL 28.3 million at the end of 1983. This increase is accounted
for mainly by the growth of CDB's portfolio in the south from CL 5.6 million
to CL 18.7 million over the same period. By 1982, the loans in the north will
no longer appear in the long term loan portfolio, but because of CDB's policy
of keeping the former in its books until a political settlement takes place
(see para. 5.15), current assets would grow from CL 3.9 million to CL 7.6
million between the end of 1978 and end of 1983.
5.36      With the sustained growth of its portfolio and the corresponding
borrowing needs, CDB's debt-equity ratio ceiling of 5:1 (set at the time
of the first Bank loan to CDB in 1972) would be reached in 1979. The low
proportion of arrears in CDB's portfolio (para. 5.16), the high quality of
its appraisal of subprojects, and the practically quasi-equity nature of
the Special Reserve provided by the Government to cover losses in the north
(para. 5.15) warrant a revision of the debt-equity ratio limit from 5:1 to
7.5:1. The actual debt-equity ratio, as defined in the Loan Agreement
(1278-CY), was well within the agreed limits with year-end levels of 3.5:1 in
1976, 4.1:1 in 1977, and 4.7:1 in 1978. However, financial projections showed
that such a limit would be reached by mid-1980. Therefore, in order to comply
with the proposed ceiling, a share capital increase would be necessary in
I/   This paragraph does not take into account the projections related to
SSI operations which are described in Chapter V.
2/   This is an unaudited figure because unaudited balance sheets used in
the projections follow a different format than audited ones in the
accounting of the portfolio in the north and of provisions. The same
remarks apply to Annex 18.

1980. Unclerstanding was reached in principle with the Government and CDB
during appraisal that CL 1 million of CDB's debt to the Loan Commissioners
will be converted into equity in 1980 and this was recorded in the Guarantee
Agreement. This share capital increase will entail a vote on a budgetary item
by the House of Representatives.
5.37      CDB's debt-service coverage is expected to follow a somewhat erratic
pattern, but with a decreasing trend although CDB does not foresee any liquid-
ity problem over the next five years.  In 1979 the debt-service coverage will
go down from a comfortable level of 1L.5:1 to 1.2:1 because of repayments of
all the short-term debts (CL 0.5 mil-Lion) contracted with commercial banks in
1977 and 1.978. It will then go down further to 0.9:1 in 1980 because of the
prepayment: of CL 1 million to the Loan Commissioners. But actually there will
be no cash outlay involved, and therefore no call on CDB's debt-service
capacity, since it will be merely a conversion of debt into equity financed by
the Government's budget.  In 1981, the debt-service coverage is expected to go
up to 1.7:1, but it will go back to close to 1.3:1 the following two years due
to the repayment of the first borrowing contracted on the international
financial market in 1979.
5.38      Due to a spread of almost 1:hree percentage points over the period
1979-1983. and by keeping administrative expenses as low as 1.1% of average
total assets, CDB's return on average net worth is expected to increase
from 10.6% in 1979 to 17.9% in 1983. This will help CDB in mobilizing re-
sources from foreign commercial lenders; an amount of $9-1CI million a year
(on a disbursement basis) is needed from 1980 onwards.
Resource Requirements
5.39      For the period 1979-1981, CDB's resource requirements would amount
to CL 13.7 million on a commitment basis (including SSI operations), of which
CL 3.2 miLlion in local currency and CL 10.7 million ($30 million) in foreign
exchange. The local currency resourc-es will come from the Loan Commissioners
and the Central Bank. To meet its foreign exchange commitments over the
period 1979-1981, CDB will rely on the proposed Bank loan ($5.0 million) and
will arrange for borrowing of about $25 million essentially from commercial
banks with a Government of Cyprus guarantee. In the course' of 1978, discus-
sions were beld with major U.S. and European banks for the mobilization by CDB
of foreign resources.  By the end of March 1979, preliminary negotiations had
been successfully conducted with two major commercial banks, one American, the
other British, for two separate $5 million Eurodollar loans at favorable terms
over LIBOR (less than 1%) for 8 years. In addition to this, CDB is considering
a set of buyer credit facilities from several countries. CDB applied and
received positive reactions for a reactivation of an Exim Bank facility
approved in 1972.  Lines of export credit with several British banks for an
aggregate amount up to UKL 9 million are contemplated.  Several of these banks
plus IFC have also suggested to CDB the possibility of financing subprojects
on an ad hoc basis. In sum, CDB should not have difficulty in meeting the
large resource gap it is faced with in the coming years.



-/ 24 -
5.40      For 1979 alone, foreign-currency resource requirements will amount,
on a commitment basis, to the equivalent of $10.9 million including the
resource gap created at the end of 1978 by large approvals made without the
available financing (para 5.24), and to $8.5 million on a disbursement basis.
Of the latter requirements, more acute given the time lag between commitments
and disbursements, only 56% had been identified (excluding the proposed Bank
loan) at the time of appraisal. $3.6 million are expected to come from the
second KfW loan and $1.2 million from the second Bank loan, both signed in
1976. The resulting resource gap for 1979 of $3.7 million could be covered in
part by a line of credit from the British Export Credit Guarantee Department
($0.8 million), for which contacts are at an advanced stage. CDB expects to
disburse $1.4 million out of the proposed Bank loan before the end of 1979
(see Annex 22). CDB would have to borrow the equivalent of at least $3.9
million during the second half of 1979 in order to finance the remaining $1.5
million of projected foreign exchange disbursements and the $2.4 million gap
between foreign-currency commitments and disbursements. Therefore, CDB is
required to have raised a minimum of $5.0 million of funds abroad before the
third Bank loan would be declared effective. This will be CDB's first opera-
tion in the international financial market. Preliminary contacts that CDB has
had with lenders in the Euro-currency market indicate that this objective is
realistic (para. 5.39).
5.41      In 1979, local currency requirements will amount to about CL 1.3
million both on a commitment and on a disbursement basis. Confirmation was
obtained during negotiations that CDB will issue debenture notes with Govern-
ment repayment guarantee and Central Bank marketability guarantee at 7.5% p.a.
and 12 years for an amount of at least CL 1.3 million to cover its local cur-
rency requirements for 1979 (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.02).
VI. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
6.01      The main objectives of the proposed third loan to CDB are:
(i) Increasing the foreign exchange earning capability of the manufac-
turing and tourism industry in Cyprus, thus assisting the Govern-
ment in its endeavor to reduce its current unfavorable balance of
trade. To achieve this the loan will:
(a) provide foreign exchange resources to finance CDB loans
and equity investments in efficient foreign exchange
earning industries, including service industries, and
(b) assist CDB with the continuation of the existing SSI
program, which will be reoriented towards expanding and
modernizing SSI to enable them to better compete in
world markets.



- 25 -
(ii) Support CDB's efforts to raise additional urgently needed
foreign exchange funds from commercial sources; the granting
of a loan at this time would indicate IBRD's confidence in
CDB, and the commercial banks are expected to base their lend-
ing in part on IBRD's appraisal of CDB.  The Bank loan,
because of its 15-year maturity, will also provide CDB with
a much needed blending with the 7-8 year funds CDB is likely
to obtain from commercial sources, thus assisting to reduce
the pressure that the shorter term borrowings will put on
CDB's debt service.
(iii)  Continue the Bank's technical assistance to CDB, which is
clearly valued by CDB's management. The assistance to CDB
involves operational and policy advice as requested during
supervision missions, comments on appraisal procedures through
the Bank's review of submitted projects, and exchange of infor-
mation.
B. Use of Loan Proceeds
6.02      An IBRD loan of $5.0 million is proposed, which would cover about
one-quarter of CDB total foreign exchange resource requirements over a two-year
period from mid-1979 to mid-1981 (para 5.39). Of this amount, US$1.0 million
(20%) will be allocated to the SSI scheme; with matching Government funds, the
US$1.0 million will approximately mLeet the full requirements of the SSI scheme
for the period mid-1979 to mid-1981.
C. MaLin Features
6.03      Foreign Exchange Earning Objective.  A careful review of CDB's
appraisal procedures, its criteria for loan approvals, and an analysis of the
performance of industries financed by CDB, all indicate that CDB has achieved
commendable results in financing industries with a high propensity to export.
Of 52 industrial enterprises financed by CDB in 1978, which had achieved or
were nearing full production, about one-third of sales were export sales.
6.04      In addition, foreign exchange savings accrue from import substitu-
tion, the magnitude of which could not be determined but is believed to be
substant:ial. The economic benefits, and associated foreign exchange earnings,
are illuLstrated for the larger enterprises by the average 26% ERR of these
projects (para 5.09). Similarly, in the tourism projects financed by CDB,
75% of all revenue generated is estimated to represent net foreign exchange
earnings.  The present policies and practices followed by CDB are adequate
safeguards that the IBRD loan will meet its objectives in respect of foreign
exchange earnings.



- 26 -
6.05      SSI.  The loan will permit a continuation of the SSI program ini-
tiated under the previous Bank loan to CDB as described in Appraisal Report
1079a-CY of May 10, 1976. This includes matching funds from the Government,
and technical assistance and initial application processing by the Ministry
of Commerce and Industry.  The scope of the SSI program will be widened to
reflect the changing economic conditions in Cyprus (para 1.06).
6.06       Both the Government and CDB wish to continue with a reoriented SSI
program, with emphasis on strengthening and modernizing existing SSI, includ-
ing mergers, to make SSI internationally competitive and promote exports;
however, this changed emphasis will not preclude support to selected new,
promising SSI. The present structure of Government support arranged under the
initial SSI program will be maintained, but in view of experience gained the
Government has decided to reduce its guarantee on new SSI loans from 75% to
50%, a reduction proposed by CDB.
6.07      As the new IBRD loan to CDB would not be effective until the late
summer of this year, and funds for the SSI program have been exhausted, CDB
has agreed to provide interim financing to keep the SSI program going and
the supporting staff operational in the meantime, with the Government guaran-
tee on CDB's exposure in SSI loans set at the new, lower limit of 50% of the
CDB SSI loan amount. In view of this, standard 90-day retroactive financing
for the SSI projects under the proposed Bank loan to CDB is recommended.
6.08      During negotiations, agreement was reached that 20% of the proposed
Bank loan, or $1.0 million, would be allocated to SSI, with the proceeds being
used for foreign exchange expenditures. To implement the changed emphasis,
and taking into account the increased cost of imported equipment costs (25%
over the period 1976/78) and the desirability of mergers of some of the exist-
ing SSI, it was also agreed to extend the new eligibility parameters of the
SSI progam to cover an employment range of 4-39, a maximum project cost of
CL 30,000, a maximum CDB loan of 75% of project cost (unchanged), maximum
fixed assets before project implementation of CL 20,000 but of CL 30,000
in case of mergers. The maximum cost per job would be abolished to permit
mergers and modernization; however, it should be noted that the other para-
meters still guarantee that the funds will be oriented towards small indus-
tries as the $84,000 ceiling on SSI project cost would ensure that capital
intensive investments such as in chemicals, cement, mining, etc., would be
excluded. CDB will increase its exposure in new SSI loans from 25% to 50%.
6.09      As industrial estates provide for larger units, and a scheme to
develop "nursery factories" for lease has not materialized, it is propose,d to
permit use of SSI loan funds for low cost industrial buildings in cases where
expansion or mergers of existing SSI are contemplated. To discourage specula-
tion in buildings by SSI, a prerequisite would be that such SSI had operated
profitably for at least two years preceding such a loan application, and would
give assurances satisfactory to CDB that they would occupy the buildings at
least two years after their completion.



- 27 -
6.10      The new arrangements as set out in paras 6.07 through 6.10 were
tentatively agreed upon with the Government and CDB, and were recorded in
an Aide Memoire dated January 30, 19S79, which is in Project Files. These
arrangements have been formalized in, the Loan Agreement.
6.11      Free Limits.  Review by the Bank of a reasonable number of subproj-
ects, supplemented by field supervision missions, assists in strengthening
the appraisal procedures of client development finance companies. However, a
review by the Bank of every project is not considered essential since CDB's
project appraisal is of a high standiard. In the previous loan to CDB projects
which required more than $200,000 (the "free limit") in Bank funds were sub-
mitted in detail for Bank approval, while smaller projects were submitted in
summary form.  Considering the inflation of equipment prices since 1976 of
about 25%, and the consistently goodl and improving quality of CDB's appraisal
reports, it is proposed to raise the free limit to US$350,000 for the new loan;
there would be no aggregate limit onI the total of subloans to be submitted
below the free limit. Based on CDB's project pipeline, it is expected that
the Bank would then be required to review about 6 projects in detail which is
considered adequate. 1/
6.12      Economic and Financial Justification.  For all projects except SSI,
CDB will calculate the financial rat:e of return, and determine the economic
rate of return for projects above the free limit.  The minimum acceptable
financial, and economic rates of return will both be 12% in line with CDB's
Policy Statement (however, the FRR averaged 25% and the ERR 26% under the
previous Bank loan; para 5.09).
6.13      Exposure Limits.  According to CDB's Memorandum and Articles of
Association, total advances to a single enterprise are limited  to 30% of
CDB's net: worth, or about $1,140,000 equivalent as of January 1, 1979. Equity
participations in a single enterprise are limited to 10% of CDB's net worth
(or about $380,000) and total CDB equity participations are limited to CDB's
own total equity. CDB's funding of Government, semi-Government or cooperative
projects is limited to 25% of total outstanding CDB loans (or about $4.0
million)., The safeguards will ensure that CDB spreads its resources and does
not invest heavily in the larger projects; at the same time, it permits CDB to
participate in a meaningful way in such projects and thus to use its appraisal
capabilit:y to ascertain the financial and economic viability of such projects.
6.14      Debt-Equity Ratio.  Reflecting the substantial reserves in the form
of quasi--equity , and the maturity and profitability of CDB, the debt-equity
ratio should be increased from 5:1 to 7.5:1 (para 5.36); this will be done on
the understanding, recorded in the (Guarantee Agreement, that there will be an
increase In CuB's equity capiLal of CL 1.0 million in 1980.
1/   SSI projects are only reviewed by the Bank in summary form, after approval
by CDB.



- 28 -
6.15       Co-Financing.  One of the objectives of the loan is to ensure that
CDB can attract additional foreign exchange from commercial sources to meet
its future requirements. To ensure that such financing is pursued, and that
funds will be available for the CDB 1980 lending program, CDB will be required
to have contracted or to show evidence satisfactory to the Bank of assurances
of forthcoming commercial loans at least equalling the Bank's loan, before the
Bank loan becomes effective (para 5.40).
6.16      Onlending Terms.  The proceeds of the loan will be onlent at 9%,
the current maximum permissible interest rate in Cyprus, or higher if there
is a lifting of the interest rate ceiling (para 3.05). In view of the free
convertibility of the Cyprus currency, and in line with official policy, the
Government will bear the exchange risk (para 5.31). Subloans, including SSI
subloans, may be made for a maximum period of 15 years from the date of
approval by the Bank including grace periods as deemed appropriate by CDB
up to a maximum of three years.
6.17      Procurement and Disbursements.  CDB requires its borrowers to
submit competitive tenders for machinery and equipment, except in very small
projects or in special circumstances, and requires an architects estimate of
building costs; all cost elements of a project are reviewed by CDB's engineers.
The procurement procedures are considered appropriate. The proceeds of the
proposed loan would finance:
(a)  100% of the CIF cost of directly imported equipment,
(b)  80% of the cost of imported equipment purchased in
Cyprus,
(c)  55% of the cost of civil works construction, which is
the estimated import component, and
(d)  50% of the amounts disbursed by CDB for SSI loans, with
total CDB disbursements not exceeding 75% of total SSI
project cost.
6.18      Amortization of the Bank Loan.  The amortization schedule for the
loan will be the composite of the amortization schedules of the individual
subloans, both for normal CDB operations and for SSI loans. For possible
subloans for CDB equity investments the maximum repayment period to the Bank
will be 10 years, including 4 years of grace, as such investments do not
normally yield dividends before then.
6.19      Time Limit for Loan.  The final date for submission of subprojects
will be December 31, 1981, and the last date for submitting disbursement
requests will be June 30, 1983.



- 29 -
D. Project Benefits and Risks
6.20      The loan will finance the development of export oriented private
sector manufacturing industries, as well as foreign exchange earning tourist
facilities. The development of these sectors is in line with Government
objectives, and will make a substantial contribution to reducing the balance
of trade gap which was equal to 53% of imports during the first half of 1978.
6.21      Based on a survey of industries already financed by CDB, these
industries export an average of one-third of their products abroad. Such
exports include also imported components or raw materials, the amount of which
could not be assessed due to a lack of data, but has been approximated by
using value added figures (para 1.16).
6.22      Based on the CDB survey and the data shown in Table 1, and assuming
that projects to be financed will continue past trends, each $1.0 million
invested by CDB in export-oriented industries over the period 1979-81 would
create acLditional annual exports also worth approximately $1.0 million per
year by 1.981. The net additional annual foreign exchange earnings from
exports, using the conservative value added figures, would amount to $0.4
million per year by 1981 for each $1.0 million of such CDB investments. This
excludes the additional foreign exchange savings due to import substitution,
the magnitude of which could not be estimated.
6.23      Similar rough estimates can be made for the tourism industry.
According to best estimates, about 75% of gross tourist receipts is net
foreign exchange earnings, with the remainder being used f-or imports to
satisfy the tourists' requirements. Based on projected increases in hotel
capacity and past tourist expenditures per available hotel bed, $1.0 million
invested by CDB in hotels over the period 1979-1981 would assist in creating
net additional foreign exchange earnings of approximately $1.5 million per
year by 1981.
6.24      The IBRD loan, together with a Government guarantee for CDB's
borrowings, will also assist CDB in attracting additional commercial foreign
exchange resources; CDB's requirements are estimated at $20.0 million addi-
tional foreign exchange during the 2-year commitment period of the Bank loan.
6.25      The loan will permit the continuation of the SSE program conceived
under the previous Bank loan. The SSI program is valuable as a breeding
ground for new industrial enterprises and entrepreneurs, much needed to
sustain the projected development of the Cyprus economy. It also provides
employment at very moderate cost.
6.26      Finally, the continued Bank support for CDB offers an opportunity to
pursue efforts to promote arrangements to enable CDB to finance sub-projects
in northern Cyprus, and thus use BaLnk funds for the benefit of both communi-
ties. Some preliminary discussions on this possibility have already taken
place. In view of the interest shown, despite the serious political and legal
obstacles which would have to be overcome to lead to workable arrangements,
the Bank intends to pursue a dialogue with both sides to see whether suitable
sub-projects in the north might be financed by CDB under this loan.
6.27      The risks, barring political upheavals on the island or a major
worldwicle recession, are small. CI)B is a mature institution with capable
management, and increasingly profitable while still following sound financial



- 30 -
and economic policies. It works in close cooperation with the Government, the
commercial banks and industry. The funds provided by the Bank are catalytic
in nature, and cover only a fraction of CDB's resource requirements based on
operational projections; there is little doubt that the Bank loan will be
committed on schedule.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the following agreements were reached with
CDB, and were recorded in the Loan Agreement:
(a) size of loan ($5.0 million) and SSI component ($1.0 million)
(para 6.02), and criteria for SSI lending (para 6.09);
(b)  increase in maximum debt-equity ratio (para 6.14);
(c)  free limit for subloans (para 6.11);
(d)  amortization rate for Bank-financed equity investments (10 years),
and amortization of main and SSI loan components (composite of
sub-loans) (para 6.18);
and in the Guarantee Agreement:
(e)  foreign exchange risk guarantee on future CDB borrowings (para
5.31);
(f)  agreement on domestic sources of funds (para 5.41).
(g)  Government commitment to provide matching funds and technical
assistance for the SSI program, in line with provisions under
the previous IBRD loan to CDB (para 6.06);
(h)  CDB capital increase (CL 1.0 million) by conversion of Loan
Commissioners' loans into equity no later than December 31,
1980 (para 6.14).
7.02      An agreement was recorded to exclude from the debt-equity ratio cal-
culation the special reserve provided by the Government to compensate for CDB's
portfolio frozen in the north (para 5.15).
7.03      Furthermore, the following understandings were reached with CDB
during negotiations:
(a) an agreement to calculate the FRR and the ERR for all the
projects above the free limit, and the FRR for all CDB
financed projects except SSI or projects of similar size;



- 31 -
(b)  limiting the conditions under which the SSI component of
the proposed loan could finance the cost of industrial
buildings; and
(c)  measures to ensure CDB a spread over its cost of foreign
exchange borrowing sufficient to enable CDB to attract
funds from abroad.
7.04       The raising by CDB of funds in the commercial market at least
matching the amount of the Bank loan, or proof satisfactory to the Bank that
arrangements to secure such a loan have been completed, wiLl be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan (para 6.15).
7.05       In view of the agreements on the above reached duaring negotiations,
it is recommended that a Bank loan of $5.0 million be made to CDB.
