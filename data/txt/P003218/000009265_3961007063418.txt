MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIIE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
1.     I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed Development Credit to the Republic of Zambia for SDR 41.2 million, the equivalent
of US$60.0 million, on standard IDA terms and with a maturity of 40 years to help finance
Zambia's Agricultural Sector Investment Program over the next four years. The Government and
the beneficiaries will provide US$140.0 million, and donors will provide US$150.0 million, of
which US$60.0 million will come from ongoing projects.
2.     Background. The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), which came to power
in November 1991, embarked upon an economic reform program whose objectives are to restore
internal and external economic stability, change the way the economy is managed, get the
Government and parastatals out of business activity, promote the private sector, and focus
Government's efforts on the creation of a positive enabling environment for private sector
business and the provision of the necessary infrastructure and social services. Since early 1992,
Zambia's overall policy performance has improved, and the implementation of the policy reform
agenda has remained on course. The direction of policy has remained clear, and the progress has
been steady. The pace of liberalization and decontrol has been good. In particular, Zambia's
macroeconomic performance in terms of fiscal balance and money supply growth has been strong.
As a result, inflation declined from an average annual rate of over 100 percent in the previous
four years to an annual rate of 22 percent in the last half of 1994. Interest rates have also
declined (from over 200 percent in April to about 25 percent in December), and this has
strengthened the Government's ability to maintain budget discipline and to control the deficit.
The Government has decontrolled prices of all agricultural products and inputs, eliminated
exchange rate restrictions, and liberalized export and import trade, and it completed several major
privatizations in 1994.
3.     Despite significant progress on the stabilization front, the Zambian economy is still in
a deep recession. Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have declined by 7.5 percent in
1994, partly because of a sharp drop in maize output, but also because of declines in copper
output and manufacturing. In part, this is an inevitable result of the tight monetary policies
required to fight inflation. In addition to these aggregate demand and financial sector problems,
individual real sectors have had difficulties. Agricultural growth has been impeded by poor rains.
Manufacturing still suffers from transitional tax and tariff anomalies, and copper mining output
has suffered from technical problems at the smelters. The Government needs to make greater
progress in policy reforms related to parastatals, the financial sector, the civil service, the land
market, and public sector investment. It also needs to accelerate the privatization program. The
1994-96 Policy Framework Paper (PFP), scheduled for Board consideration in April, spells out
the Government's policy reform agenda. To complement the PFP, specific agricultural sector
policy and institutional reforms that are required to further agricultural growth are contained in
the Government's letter of agricultural sector development policy. The main areas of reform
include additional market liberalization, privatization of agricultural parastatals, land use and
tenure, and elimination of agricultural credit subsidies.



- 2 -
4.      Continued strong fiscal performance and reduced inflationary expectations should permit
increased liquidity in the financial sector in 1995. With thlis, and the measures being taken to
address tax and tariff anomalies to phase out subsidies to attract private sector capital and
management into copper mining, and to strengthen financial institutions, private investment should
begin to recover in 1995, leading to a more vigorous supply response and economic growth. In
addition the proposed Agricultural Sector Investment Program (ASIP) Would have favorable
impact on the Government's fiscal position. The ASIP is expected to result in about 53 percent
aggregate savings which are mainly attributable to cost reduction from the elimination of
government subsidies for agricultural credit, and higher revenues from agricultural services
through improved cost recovery measures. Besides, the ASIP expenditures are a very small share
of total government spending and are not projected to exceed 4 percent of annual government
expenditures during the period 1995-99.
5.      Sector context and lessons from experience.  Agriculture figures prominently in
Zambia's economy and is expected to play a critical role in its growth and restructuring.
Although agriculture accounts for only 18 percent of GDP, this small share belies the extent to
which Zambia depends on the sector. About 60 percent of the population depends on agriculture
for its livelihood. Agriculture employs about 67 percent of the labor force and remains the main
source of income and employment for rural women and contributes to poverty reduction.
Furthermore, agriculture will continue to provide most new jobs for at least the next decade, even
with higher industrial growth rates, because of the country's small industrial base and declining
mineral resources. However, between 1965 and 1991 agricultural growth rates averaged 2.2.
percent a year, less than the population growth rate of 3.2 percent a year. This was largely
because of the inappropriate government policies of the past. The high inflation rates and the
associated interest rates discouraged investments in agriculture while price controls of agricultural
outputs resulted in adverse terms of trade. Agricultural issues have also figured prominently in
the country's fiscal problems: subsidies to the sector averaged about 3 percent of GDP during
1983-91. With improved agriculture sector policies, Zambia could greatly expand agricultural
production. Productivity in the smallholder subsector, which is considerably below the production
frontier and the genetic potential of the crop varieties, could be increased by 94 percent for maize
and 85 percent for soybean. Agriculture is expected to become an increasingly important source
of foreign exchange. In 1993 agriculture was the second major earner of foreign exchange for
Zambia's non-traditional exports with total foreign exchange earnings of US$33.7 million. The
proposed ASIP would further enhance the Government's efforts to improve the effectiveness and
sustainability of donor support and create the enabling environment for higher agricultural
productivity.
6.      The need for more sustainable means of using donor support is based on a number of
lessons of experience in implementing donor-financed projects in Zambia and elsewhere in Africa.
First, the proliferation of donor-assisted projects (prior to the preparation of ASIP, there were
about 180 donor-financed projects in agriculture alone) and over-reliance on foreign technical
assistance undermine public sector management capacity and government commitment to
implementing programs. Second, executing projects through over-centralized agencies does not
work, and public sector decentralization is essential. Third, creating separate, or parallel,
structures for implementing also is ineffective. Instead, the planning, disbursement, accounting,
procurement, and monitoring and evaluation functions of the government line ministries must be
upgraded, and donors must be encouraged to channel support through existing government
agencies rather than introducing their own procedures. Fourth, subsidized credit undermines the



viability of Zambia's rural financial institutions. And fifth, the rigid designs of earlier projects
prevented their adaptation to unforeseen changes during implementation. The ASIP is designed
to address the above concerns.
7.      Program concept and objectives. The ASIP has seven features that distinguish it from
traditional donor-supported projects. It covers the country's entire agricultural sector. It has been
prepared by an all-Zambian task force whose members were drawn from both the private and the
public sector. It would be implemented within the institutional framework of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (MAFF), and no separate project units would be established.
Donors' procedures for procurement, reporting, accounting, and auditing would be standardized
as much as possible. Use of long-term expatriate technical assistance would be kept to a
minimum. The flexibility of its design allows for annual reviews and adjustments through
systematic client and donor consultation. And it is embedded in public sector reforms in the
agricultural sector aimed at increasing decentralization and encouraging participation by the
beneficiaries. All the major donors involved in Zambia's agricultural sector support the proposed
approach and have pledged to channel their assistance to the sector through the ASIP framework.
8.      The ASIP is expected to be the first in a series of four-year programs supporting the
medium- and long-term goals outlined in the Government's Letter of Sectoral Development
Policy. The Government's main agricultural development objectives, as reflected in the program,
are to improve household food security, promote better use of natural resources, generate
employment and raise incomes, and increase export earnings and contribute to the balance of
payments.
9.      Program  description. The ASIP has four main components. The first, policy and
institutional improvements, would focus on outstanding policy reforms in key areas of marketing,
trade and pricing, food security, and land use and land tenure. It also would support institutional
restructuring and strengthening, with an emphasis on improving the capacity of sectoral agencies
to provide efficient services (in cases where the private sector cannot presently provide the
services) in priority areas of agricultural research, extension, livestock, and rural finance. The
second component, public investments, would complement and support the policy and institutional
improvements in the following priority areas: (i) agricultural research to provide appropriate
technologies for increased productivity; (ii) agricultural extension to accelerate dissemination of
technologies, increase productivity, and promote resource conservation; (iii) livestock production
and heaith to strengthen public support services to smallholders, improve disease prevention and
control, and increase productivity; (iv) fisheries development for smallholders, especially for
resource-poor lhouseholds; (v) rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation facilities for smallholders;
(vi) agricultural training to strengthen human resources; and (vii) farm power and mechanization
to help smallholder farmers increase production.   The third component, private sector
development, wouldl help create an enabling environment and incentives for the private sector and
support measuies that would improve services and stimulate growth. This component also would
support financial services for productive agricultural activities, seed multiplication and distribution
to provide improved seed and plant material to smallholders and new product development. The
fourth component. pilot investment schemes, would establish a rural investment fund to support
small-scale capital investments in rural communities on a matching grant basis, and the
privatization of government farms. It also would support the introduction of new technologies,
which would be broadly disseminated after a pilot and demonstration stage.



10.    Program fmnancing. The ASIP would provide an effective mechanism for collaborative
financing of agricultural activities by the Government and donors. It would provide a framework
that would enable donors to support specific components of the program while ensuring that their
assistance was coordinated and complementary. IDA would finance research, extension, training,
institutional support, and pilot schemes. The program, which would cost an estimated US$350.0
million over four years, would result in cost reductions of 53 percent relative to projected
expenditures (in nominal terms) without the program. It would achieve these savings mainly by
eliminating the Government's budgetary subsidies to agricultural credit. IDA would provide
US$60.0 million (about 17 percent of the total program cost). Other members of the donor
consortium would provide US$150.0 million (about 43 percent of the total program cost), mostly
through parallel financing; US$60.0 million of this amount would come from ongoing projects.
The Government and the program beneficiaries would finance the balance, US$140.0 million, or
40 percent of the total program cost. IDA would finance incremental recurrent costs on a
decreasing basis while the Government would finance a progressively larger share of the
incremental recurrent costs, increasing its contribution from 23 percent in year 1 to 45 percent
in year 4.  The costs and financing plan for the program  are provided in schedule A.
Procurement and disbursement details are provided in schedule B.  The timetable of key
processing events is provided in schedule C. And the status of Bank operations in Zambia and
the statement of IFC investments are provided in schedule D.
11.    Program implementation. The program would be implemented countrywide through
an organization broadly in line with the present structures of the MAFF and Ministry of Lands
(MOL), although each ministry would undergo minor organizational changes to accommodate the
program.  The ASIP would be undertaken within the MAFF structure in accordance with
guidelines agreed to at negotiations. The MAFF's Planning and Policy Division would be
responsible for monitoring implementation, and an independent Zambian institution would carry
out the systematic client consultation assessment and the annual sectoral performance review. In
line with the Government's policy of decentralization, many of the program's activities would be
managed at the district level. To strengthen the implementation capacity of line agencies, the
ASIP would include training and staff redeployment to improve the skills mix. The program also
would include annual reviews of its activities to identify necessary adjustments to the
implementation plan. The key performance indicators that would be periodically monitored are
contained in annex 1.
12.    Program  sustainability.  Several features of the program  would help ensure its
sustainability. The ASIP's design by Zambians and its use of existing government channels for
implementation would create a strong sense of national ownership. The Government's policy
reforms and the collaborative donor support would provide a sound foundation for the
development of agriculture and its capacity to contribute to the growth of incomes and generation
of employment. Finally, the ASIP would result in efficiency gains by eliminating wasteful public
expenditures in agriculture, including credit subsidies.
13.    Rationale for IDA involvement. Zambia's agricultural sector has great potential for
responding rapidly to the economic reform program supported by the Bank and the IMF.
Agriculture can play a vital role in economic adjustment by providing the initial supply response
needed to stimulate economic activity, and can support economic growth in the long-run by
providing sustainable export earnings. But if the expected growth is to materialize, the private
investments have to be promoted and public support must be made more efficient. In addition,
donor support should be better coordinated to ensure maximum impact. The Government and
donors would form a partnership for the formulation and implementation of agricultural sector



- 5 -
programs. The Government would be responsible for identifying and preparing' its priority
programs in agriculture and would then work with donors to improve the programs' efficiency,
capacity, and sustainability without, however, sacrificing ownership. The coordinated policy
reform and investment planning coupled with coordinated donor support would be much more
difficult without the leadership and involvement of IDA.
14.    The latest Country Assistance Strategy for Zambia was reviewed by the Board on March
10, 1994. The Agricultural Sector Investment Program forms a key component of the country
strategy. The country strategy proposes to assist Zambia in three main areas, all related to the
overall goal of poverty reduction: (i) stimulating growth by removing policy constraints and
improving the enabling environment, including fiscal management; (ii) promoting private sector
development and greater public sector efficiency; and (iii) supporting targeted interventions for
the poor and vulnerable groups. Improving household food security and income is critical to
meeting these objectives, and support for agriculture is thus a key element of the country strategy.
The reforms supported by this program would improve the management of fiscal resources,
substantially increase public sector efficiency, and provide the necessary incentives to stimulate
private investment in agriculture. In addition, the program would focus on smallholder farmers
and thus would especially benefit the poor, particularly women, by raising their incomes through
higher productivity and employment creation.
15.     Agreed actions. As conditions of Board presentation, the Government submitted to
IDA a Letter of Sector Development Policy, a program implementation plan, and evidence that
the financial management unit has been established in the MAFF and staffed. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations on an annual review of ASIP activities, the integration of ASIP
expenditures into the MAFF budget, the restructuring of existing projects to fit into the ASIP
framework, the preparation of an implementation plan for carrying out actions contained in the
Letter of Sector Development Policy, the elimination of a budgetary allocation for agricultural
credit by September 30, 1995, and the preparation of a timetable for privatizing state farms. The
establishment of program accounts by the Government is a condition of effectiveness. An
amendment to the land laws to facilitate the subdivision of land and implementation of policy
measures to provide for the subdivision and sale of state farms is a condition of disbursement for
the land subprogram.
16.    Poverty category. The ASIP would help alleviate rural poverty by boosting crop
production and increasing diversification. Women, who play a vital role in Zambia's agricultural
sector as farmers, managers, decision makers, and farm laborers, are expected to be major
beneficiaries of the ASIP. And because women are the main providers for their families, the
higher incomes for women that are expected to result from the ASIP should improve household
food security.
17.    Environmental aspects. The ASIP would support improved farming systems and
conservation practices.  Zambia, as a land-surplus country, has the scope for sustainable
expansion of cultivated areas. An important check on inappropriate expansion of cultivation will
be provided by a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) - to be implemented concurrently
with the ASIP - which restricts cultivation on environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, the
use of the proceeds of IDA Credit to purchase agricultural inputs that IDA deems environmentally
unacceptable will not be permitted. Because the ASIP has been classified as a category B
program, an environmental mitigation plan has been prepared.



- 6 -
18.    Programn objective category. This program would contribute to broad reduction of
poverty in the country by improving efficiency in aericultural production, increasing food
security, and improving nutrition. The research and extension sub-programs would focus on
developing and promoting affordable production technologies, particularly for improving the
incomes of women farmers.  In addition, the program  would support the privatization of
government-owned agricultural enterprises, increased commercialization of somne services
provided by the government, and the reallocation of budgetary resources to activities that are
considered essential for efficient delivery of agricultural services.
19.    Participatory approach. This program was prepared by a Zambian task force whose
members were drawn from  the Government, the private sector, and NGOs.  Program
development was initiated through a broad public discussion of the policy framework that
continued throughout the preparation of the program. Systematic client consultation and sector
performance analysis, carried out on a continual basis, would form integral parts of the
monitoring and evaluation system, and their results would be used to manage the program and
ensure improved delivery of services to beneficiaries. A rural investment fund would provide
resources directly to communities for locally initiated and implemented projects.
20.     Programn benefits. The ASIP would benefit the economy in several ways. It would
create an enabling economic environment by removing regulatory and statutory restraints on
competition, rationalizing the public sector's role to minimize the distortions created by
government interventions, investing more in the provision of essential agricultural services and
rural infrastructure, and reducing waste in public expenditures. Such an environment would
enable farmers to increase production, which would lead to higher incomes for them, lower prices
for consumers, and higher export earnings for the country. By focusing on smallholder farmers,
the ASIP would directly benefit a large number of the rural poor, particularly women, by raising
their incomes through higher productivity and employment creation. To ensure the economic
viability of the program, investments supported under the ASIP would be limited to those with
an economic rate of return of more than 10 percent. Furthermore, the process adopted for
preparing the program and the content of the resulting operation would have far-reaching benefits
for Zambia. And the program includes extensive systematic client consultations and the use of
beneficiary and stakeholder assessments to monitor implementation - both features that would
enhance participation by beneficiaries.
21.    Risks. The ASIP could face some challenges. These might include inadequate funding
of the Government's share of local costs, the failure of donors to dovetail their projects into the
ASIP framework, derailment of the macroeconomic reform program, and the adverse impact of
recurrent droughts. But these risks have been minimized by the program's design and by upfront
actions to ensure that the Government provides adequate counterpart funding and remains
committed to its reform agenda, which is supported by the IMF and IDA. In addition, all donors
have agreed to provide coordinated support to the agricultural sector and to restructure their
existing projects to fit into the ASIP approach. Moreover, donors are likely to continue to
provide drought relief, as they have in the past, as long as the Government maintains prudent
macroeconomic and sectoral policies. The research and extension sub-programs of ASIP will also
focus, among other things, on developing and disseminating drought resistant and early maturing
staple food crops. These are indications that ASIP can achieve its objectives.



22.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
