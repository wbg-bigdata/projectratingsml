PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
BRAZIL THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 813-BR) AND
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 854-BR)
Preface
This report presents a performance audit of the Brazil Third
Highway Project, for which Loan 813-BR for US$89 million was fully dis-
bursed in February 1978, and of the Fourth Highway Project, for which
Loan 854-BR for US$51 million was fully disbursed in January 1977. It
consists of a memorandum prepared by the Operations Evaluation Depart-
ment (OED) and a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the Bank's
Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office. The memorandum is based
on the PCR, the Government's Final Report of October 1977, discussions
with Bank staff, and a review of the project files and transcripts of the
Executive Directors' meetings which considered the projects. Comments
made by OED on an earlier version of the PCR have been reflected in the
present version.
OED staff visited Brazil in January 1979 to review the results
of the project with Government authorities. Particular points raised by
these authorities concerned: the project experiences show that sufficient
time and staff are essential for adequate detailed engineering and that
erosion control must be taken into account during the engineering prepa-
ration stage; the Bank's unduly conservative estimates of traffic poten-
tial on the project highways; the advantages of a new system of dynamic
weighing of trucks in motion; the continuing high share of maintenance
operations by contract; and the consolidation of the role of GEIPOT as
the Ministry of Transport's basic advisory body. A draft version of this
report was sent to the authorities for comment and their replies are at-
tached as Annex G. The points raised have been reflected in the audit
memorandum. The excellent assistance provided by the Government is grate-
fully acknowledged.
The audit memorandum reviews more critically than the PCR the
following major issues: the inadequate detailed engineering and the under-
estimation of traffic growth in connection with the project highway con-
struction; the lack of full enforcement of vehicle weight regulations;
the lack of quantitative targets for the delegation of highway maintenance
from federal to state highway departments; the delay in establishing a cost
accounting system for highway maintenance; and the insufficient emphasis
on achievement of overall transport objectives. It also reviews and com-
pares, in more detail than the PCR, the experiences of the present projects
with those of the first two projects previously evaluated by OED.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
BRAZIL THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 813-BR)
AND FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 854-BR)
Highlights
Loans 813-BR and 854-BR totalling US$140 million for the Brazil
Third and Fourth Highway Projects were to support the construction and
paving of highways (2,530 km) as well as consultants' services for con-
struction supervision, preinvestment studies (4,210 km), further improve-
ment of the construction supervision capability of the federal highway de-
partment, and personnel training (para. 8 and PCR, para. 2.02).
Aside from the training component which was not carried out by
consultants, both projects were implemented as appraised. The highways
constructed (2,549 km) have facilitated economic and social development,
made networks complete, and permitted access to the interior. Traffic
on the highways developed more rapidly than anticipated, leading to the
need for increased maintenance and possible early pavement strengthening.
The preinvestment studies (3,594 km) have served as the basis for detailed
engineering and construction under the subsequent project. Major strengthen-
ing of the supervision capability of the federal highway department has per-
mitted increased operating efficiency in the different regions of the country.
(See paras. 9-10, 20-30, and PCR, paras. 3.02-3.03, 3.05-3.09, 3.13-3.18,
5.07-7.03, and 7.06.)
Slow progress of the civil works caused 30-month and 20-month
delays, respectively, in completing the Third and the Fourth Projects
(paras. 11-13 and PCR, para. 3.11). The cost of the former project was
close to the estimate, while that of the latter was 23% more because of
higher construction cost (paras. 14-15, Annexes B-C, and PCR, paras. 3.04,
3.10, 3.12, and 7.04). The re-estimated economic rates of return for both
projects are higher than at appraisal--45% (against 25% estimated) in the
case of the Third Project and 29% (against 16%) for the Fourth Project.
The improved returns reflect the higher vehicle operating cost savings and
traffic volumes than anticipated on the project highways (para. 17 and PCR,
paras. 4.01-4.06 and 7.05).
The following points may be of particular interest:
- importance of allowing adequate time for detailed
engineering to avoid poor quantity estimates (paras.
20-24 and PCR, paras. 3.05-3.09);
- need for proper examination during detailed en-
gineering of the problem of erosion (paras. 25-26);



- ix -
-  importance of determining traffic forecasts on
the basis of preinvestment studies rather than
less reliable master plans to avoid underestima-
tion of traffic growth (paras. 27-29);
- minimal enforcement of vehicle weight regulations
during the project period because of insufficient
equipment and personnel (paras. 31-32);
- increased enforcement of vehicle weight regula-
tions expected through the technologically ad-
vanced system of dynamic weighing in motion now
being introduced (paras. 33-35 and 37-38);
- lack of quantitative targets against which to
measure the progress of delegating highway main-
tenance from federal to state levels (paras. 39-40);
- need for analysis of the cost and effectiveness of
contract versus delegated maintenance (para. 41);
- importance of strengthening state highway depart-
ments, through acquisition of workshop and field
equipment as well as training of personnel, before
maintenance of federal highways is delegated to
them (para. 42);
- importance of ensuring that federal highways are in
maintainable condition before delegation to the states
and of providing funds for rehabilitation before trans-
fer, where necessary (paras. 43-44);
- successful establishment of a cost accounting system
for highway maintenance (para. 45); and
- insufficient emphasis on achievement of overall trans-
port objectives (paras. 46-49).

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
BRAZIL THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 813-BR) AND
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 854-BR)
I. Background
General
1.        Brazil's transport infrastructure in 1975 consisted of about
1,417,585 km of highways, 39,000 km of railways, 40,000 km of navigable
rivers, 38 deepwater ports, numerous specialized bulk facility terminals,
and many airports. The main transport flows comprised industrial products
and iron ore within the Sao Paulo-Rio de Janeiro-Belo Horizonte triangle
and agricultural products in the southern and southeastern regions to
ports for export or to main consumption centers.
Highway Development
2.        Highways served about 70% of freight and 95% of passenger traffic
in 1975. The network then included 68,964 km of federal highways (5% of
the total),.!/ 158,034 km of state highways (11%),2/ and 1,190,587 km of
municipal highways (84%). The density of highways was high in all regions
of the country except the northern and centerwestern regions.
3.        Development of the network has been difficult due to the very
long distances to be covered and mountain ranges lacking easy natural passes
to the interior. Federal and state highways have been under construction
since 1946. The main expansion of federal highways took place in 1965-75,
when on average about 3,300 km were built and 2,800 km paved annually. From
the mid-1970s, increased emphasis was placed on strengthening, rehabilita-
tion, and maintenance of the existing highway network. The responsibility
for maintaining federal highways is gradually being delegated to the states
(paras. 39-44).
Bank Lending for Transport
4.        A US$12.5 million loan in 1952 to the Federal Government for rail-
way rehabilitation and a US$3 million loan in 1953 to the State of Rio de
Janeiro for highway maintenance were the Bank's initial involvements in
assisting transport development in Brazil. About 15 years elapsed before
further highway projects were prepared.
5.        The groundwork for twelve more Bank loans (six for highways, two
for feeder roads, three for railways, and one for ports) totalling US$996
million was laid by the National Transport Survey of 1965-70,3/ co-financed
1/ Of which about two-thirds were paved.
2/ Of which about one-quarter was paved.
3/ The Survey covered transport by highway, railway, and coastal shipping
as well as operations in the three main ports.



- 2 -
by the Bank, USAID, and UNDP (PCR, paras. 1.01-1.02). In addition to
these loans, six others for agricultural settlement and rural develop-
ment projects totalling US$156.6 million have supported design, construc-
tion, improvement, or betterment of about 3,400 km of low standard access
roads as well as purchases of highway maintenance equipment and spare
parts. About US$47.6 million has been allocated under the six loans for
the road work and equipment.
Audit Findings on the First and Second Highway Projects
6.        The First and Second Highway Projects (Loan 567-BR of October
1968 for US$26 million and Loan 676-BR of May 1970 for US$100 million,
respectively) have been evaluated by OEDI' and considered successful (see
Annex A for comparative statistical data). Implementation of Plans of
Action to achieve transport objectives and schedule actions for the highway,
railway, and port subsectors was initiated as part of these projects. The
PPAR of 1976 on Loan 567-BR2/ noted that the attempt to introduce institu-
tional changes into the Brazilian transport sector had resulted in signifi-
cant achievements and progress in reorganizing and improving the major
transport agencies. Planning also had improved and become institutionalized
through technical and economic feasibility studies before project implement-
ation. Achievements in transport coordination, pricing, and financing had,
however, been less impressive and personnel policies3J in the public sector
had constrained institutional advances.
7.        The PPAR of 1977 on Loan 676-BR4/ found that the time gained in
project preparation by dispensing with less than thorough detailed engineer-
ing had later resulted in a greater loss of time in project execution and
in cost overruns. Specifically, providing sufficient time for hydrological
and geological studies as well as adequate staff for supervision and control
of engineering consultants' work was considered to be essential in the
future. The PPAR noted that underestimation of traffic growth potential
had led to underdesigned pavements. The capacity of the federal highway
department (DNER) and of Brazilian consultants in planning, design, and
construction supervision had improved through implementation of the project.
However, less progress was made in transport planning, coordination, pricing,

2/ Project components included detailed engineering, construction and/or
paving, and construction supervision of 429 km of highways.
3/ Particularly the salary differential between the public and private sectors.
4/ Project components included construction or improvement and paving of
2,136 km of highways, preinvestment studies of 5,625 km, and consulting
services to strengthen the planning and supervisory capacity of the
federal highway department.

financing, and personnel policies. Finally, the PPAR noted a shift in
the Bank's focus from sectoral to project-specific issues and expressed
concern about over-concentration on specific project problems and a weaken-
ing awareness of the larger sectoral problems.
II. Objectives and Description of the Third and Fourth Highway Projects
8.        The Third and Fourth Highway Projects (Loan 813-BR of April 1972
for US$89 million and Loan 854-BR of August 1972 for US$51 million, respec-
tively) continued the Bank's support for highway development. The Third
Project included:
(a) construction and paving of 1,849 km of federal highways; and
(b) consulting services for:
(i) construction supervision,
(ii) detailed engineering of 1,626 km,
(iii) feasibility studies of 2,584 km,
(iv) further improvement of the federal highway department's
construction supervision capability, and
(v) trainingl/ at the federal highway department's training
center.
The Fourth Project comprised:
(a)  construction and paving of 681 km of federal and state
highways; and
(b) consulting services for construction supervision.
III. Project Results2/
Implementation
9.        Construction of 2,549 km of highways under both projects was carried
out successfully by Brazilian contractors and construction supervision was
provided satisfactorily by Brazilian consultants, with expatriate consultants
1/ According to the Appraisal Report, the main focus was to be on technolo-
gical innovations introduced in Brazil during and since the Transport
Survey. Training was to be in the fields of administration, planning,
project preparation, construction supervision, bridge design, maintenance,
programming and budgeting, and traffic engineering.
2/ See Annex A for comparative statistical data on the First through Fourth
Projects.

assisting the federal highway department in the overall coordination. The
highways, located in the southeastern, southern, northeastern, and center-
western regions, generally support agricultural, industrial, and socio-
economic development, fill network gaps, and provide access to the interior
(PCR, paras. 2.04 and 7.06). The Borrower considers that the performance
of the contractors and of the Brazilian consultants was somewhat better
than under the first two highway projects.
10.       The Third Project also enabled completion of detailed engineer-
ing (1,629 km) and feasibility studies (1,965 km) of federal and state high-
ways (PCR, paras. 3.13-3.15 and Tables 2 and 3). Some planned studies (about
616 km) were either carried out by the states or deferred. Methods and pro-
cedures for construction supervision by the federal highway department were
developed or improved to a satisfactory level, with the support of expatriate
consultants. The Borrower has pointed out that the department's capacity to
administer contracts in different regions was demonstrated in the course of
implementation of the projects under review. The intended training compo-
nent was deleted because the expertise thought to be required from external
sources proved to be available in the country.
Time
11.       Implementation of both projects was delayed.   The Third Project was
finished in June 1978, or 30 months after the original Project Completion Date
of December 1975,1/ while the Fourth Project was completed in April 1978,
or 22 months behind the June 1976 target.l/ Most of the delays was due to
the civil works. Of the average planned monthly output, only about 75% was
achieved for the Third Project and 50% for the Fourth Project (PCR, para.
3.11).
12.       The delays were mainly related to contract problems, detailed
engineering, and weather. Seven of the 47 original contracts for the Third
Project and three of the 22 contracts for the Fourth Project were cancelled
and rebid (PCR, Tables 5 and 6) because of poor management,2/ financial
problems, and shortages of raw materials. The inadequacy of the price esca-
lation indices3/ for materials, equipment, and fuel as a result of the
1973-74 oil crisis also adversely affected contract performance, especially
under the Fourth Project (PCR, Table 4). In addition, further time was
needed because of extra work quantities due to inadequate site investiga-
tions for detailed engineering. Moreover, exceptionally heavy rain had a
major detrimental effect on implementation of some contracts.

2/ Specifically, poor performance of some of the contractors.
3/ Drawn up by a foundation and not under the direct control of the federal

- 5 -
13.       Another less important factor contributing to the longer imple-
mentation period was delays in loan effectiveness, about five months for
the Third Project and three months for the Fourth Project, while the states
ratified subsidiary agreements with the federal highway department.
Costs
14.       A comparison of the overall actual and estimated costs of both
projects, not included in the PCR, is shown in Annexes B and C. The cost
of the Third Project (US$225.9 million) was close to the appraisal estimatel/
(US$221.4 million). Expenditure on construction was somewhat higher (5%),2/
while that on consultants' services was lower (the Borrower feels that
services rendered often were ineffective). The Fourth Project experienced
a 23% cost overrun (actual cost of US$157.5 million versus appraisal esti-
mate of US$128.2 million) because the expenditure on construction was much
higher (29%),3/ outweighing the lower expenditure on construction supervision.
Underestimation of physical quantities (paras. 20-23) and the sharp jump in
prices during 1973 and 1974 due to domestic and worldwide inflation and the
oil crisis were responsible for the higher expenditures.
15.       It is noted that for both projects the cost per kilometer in the
southern and southeastern regions (US$200,000-US$350,000) was considerably
above that in the centerwestern and northwestern regions (US$50,000-US$150,000).
This was due mainly to more difficult terrain and soil conditions as well as
heavier rainfall.
Disbursements
16.       For the Third Project, disbursements (PCR, Table 7) started in
FY73, one year later than expected, and were completed in FY78, two years
behind schedule. The largest drawings from the loan account were in FY74
(39%) and FY75 (31%). To allow the prolonged construction work to be
covered, the Closing Date was extended twice. Amounts and timing of dis-
bursements for the Fourth Project were very close to appraisal targets
(PCR, Table 8). The Basic Data Sheets show further details.
1/ However, it is noted that training (US$200,000) was deleted from the
project.
2/ Two highways (BR 158 and 386) were responsible for 30% of the US$41 million
increase over the contract amount (see PCR, Table 1).
3/ Two highways (BR 153 and 324) were responsible for 84% of the US$61
million increase over the contract amount (see PCR, Table 1). The
increase for BR 153 was the largest and resulted from modifications
in the engineering design to achieve better adaptation to local climatic
conditions. The new design was substantially more expensive than the
original one.



-6-
Economic Re-evaluation
17.       Economic rates of return were re-estimated in the PCR for both
projects, based essentially on appraisal assumptions (lower vehicle ope-
rating costs and travel distances as well as the difference in maintenance
costs between paved and gravel/earth roads). Account was taken of current
traffic and actual construction costs. The weighted re-estimated return
for the Third Project is 45% (versus the appraisal estimate of 25%) and
for the Fourth Project is 29% (versus 16%) (PCR, Table 9). Increased bene-
fits from higher than anticipated vehicle operating cost savings and traffic
volumes (paras. 27-29) moderated the effect of higher construction costs
and brought about the improved re-estimated returns.
Environmental Effects
18.       The Borrower considers that no serious environmental problems
were associated with the project highways because they did not traverse
new settlement areas. As discussed in paras. 25-26, there were, however,
some problems with erosion and washouts in wet, mountainous regions.
IV. Main Issues
19.       Particular issues which arose in connection with construction of
the project highways were the inadequate detailed engineering and the under-
estimation of traffic growth. Other important issues were: the lack of
full enforcement of vehicle weight regulations; the lack of quantitative
targets for delegation of highway maintenance from federal to state high-
way departments; the delay in establishing a cost accounting system for
highway maintenance operations; and the insufficient emphasis on achieve-
ment of overall transport objectives.
Inadequate Detailed Engineering
20.       Speedy execution of detailed engineering by Brazilian consultants
during the Second Project expedited preparation of the projects under review.
However, because of the limited time allocations poor quantity estimates
were made which delayed construction and produced quantity and cost increases
(PCR, paras. 3.05-3.09 and Table 12). The PCR suggests that the federal
highway department did not allow sufficient time for thorough site investi-
gations, including hydrological and geological studies (see para. 23). The
Borrower has stated that the large number of works contracted and the short
periods of their implementation made it impossible to more closely or care-
fully examine the adequacy and accuracy of the engineering. Similar insuffi-
cient time for site investigations was pointed out in the PPAR for the
Second Projecti/ (para. 7), although the PPAR for the First Project consi-
dered detailed engineering&2/ to be inadequate only in the case of certain
highways.

Project.

21.       Increases in quantities of earthworks, paving, miscellaneous
complementary works, drainage, and bridges for the projects under review
had cost increase implications shown in the following table (a comparison
with the Second Project based on PPAR data also is providedl/):

Total            100          100         100
Earthworks were responsible for the largest share of the construction cost
increase for these three projects and for the First Project (according to
its PPAR which did not indicate the proportion involved).
22.       Increases in the actual construction costs of the four projects
due to quantity increases as compared to the original contract prices were
significant, as shown in Annex D. Those of 21% (US$9.3 million) for the
First Project and 27% (US$41.3 million) for the Third Project were lower
than increases of 44% (US$68.8 million) for the Second Project and 68%
(US$60.6 million) for the Fourth Project. Of the 79 lots included in the
four projects, 46 (58%) had cost increases ranging from 20% to 146%.
23.       The Borrower has commented that appropriate measures were taken
during implementation of the projects under review to introduce modifications
and adaptations which, in some cases, brought about substantial improvements.
The improvements were considered to have resulted in the projects as executed
being upgraded in quality and the associated cost increases being justified.
It is recognized that some engineering modifications are normally required
during construction. However, the large cost variations of many lots in these
projects are exceptional and illustrate the need to allow enough time to
carry out in-depth site investigations for the detailed engineering.
24.       Enough time for engineering and staff for control purposes are now be-
ing allowed. Also material testing facilities are being provided at construction

sites by supervisory consultants to ensure independent quality control.
Furthermore, the Borrower has observed that projects are now being better
prepared in terms of detail and quality through: strengthened consultants'
services, added training, and increased experience of technical personnel;
standardization and systematization of contractual and project preparation
procedures; and more precise wording and formulation of terms of reference.
The PCR (para. 3.06) states that highway engineering in the ongoing Fifth
Project (Loan 1075-BR of January 1975 for US$110 million) was generally of
better quality than that under the previous projects.
25.       It is noted that the problem of erosion, which is quite common
in mountainous parts of Brazil due to the soil composition and heavy rain-
fall, was not properly examined during detailed engineering of some highways
under review.l/ This could have caused a detrimental effect on the environ-
ment. Fortunately, the potential problem was recognized and steps were taken
during construction to recover eroded areas, change the gradient of slopes,
increase areas planted with grass, and add complementary surface drainage
and protective structures. Nevertheless, two highways experienced severe
erosion problems. On two sections of BR 104, twenty-four embankments were
seriously damaged by heavy rainfall. BR 163 required 25% more earthworks
and almost 800% more planting of grass.
26.       The Borrower has advised that this experience has also been absorbed.
Erosion control has been taken into account at the engineering stage for
many years. Also, erosion and drainage problems are being studied more care-
fully and shrubs and grass are being planted as part of highway maintenance
operations.
Underestimation of Traffic Growth
27.       In the opening years, seven of the nine highway sections in the
Third Project2/ and five of the seven sections in the Fourth Project3/ carried
traffic volumes on average 60% and 42% higher, respectively, than estimated
at appraisal (PCR, Table 11). However, the highest traffic volume was only
2,100 vehicles per day on the former project highways and 3,400 vehicles
per day on the latter; this did not affect highway design standards although
increased maintenance and earlier pavement strengthening may be required.
A serious underestimation of traffic, as in these cases, could adversely
affect investment priorities. It is noted that there were average traffic
increases of 42% and 73% in the opening years for highways in the First and
Second Projects, respectively (see Annex E). Similarly, traffic volumes on
four of the six highway sections constructed under the Argentina Second High-
way Project4/ ranged from 16% to 83% above appraisal estimates.
1/ The Borrower has remarked that, because Brazilian soils are very subject

28.       The PCR states (para. 4.05) that it was difficult to foresee
future traffic development. The audit recognizes that absolute precision
in traffic forecasting is neither possible nor required. Notwithstanding,
there was a clear tendency to underestimate traffic at appraisal of these
four projects. The Borrower has pointed out that one reason for this under-
estimation was the basing of traffic forecasts on master plansl/ that are
less reliable than feasibility studies. This emphasizes the importance of
on-the-spot examinations of major traffic generating sources through fea-
sibility studies and of reassessment during detailed engineering. In re-
trospect, however, realistic forecasts would not have been possible because
the rapid economic expansion of the country in 1973-75, including the intro-
duction of new agricultural2/ and industrial activity which modified regional
economies and outdated bases previously adopted for traffic estimation, was
not foreseen.
29.       Another reason for the underestimation of traffic growth,
given by the Borrower, was the adoption by the Bank of conservative traffic
projection criteria. The Bank is said to have refused to accept the higher
growth rates forecast by the federal highway department and minimized the
expansion of production. Nevertheless, reliable traffic statistics on which
to base sounder projections are understood not to have been available.
30.       It is noted that traffic on several highways was composed of a
considerably higher number of heavy commercial vehicles than expected (PCR,
para. 4.03). This confirms that production and marketing activities expanded
more rapidly than assumed. Better data collection is expected to materialize
as a result of traffic counting procedures being implemented and equipment
being installed by the federal highway department.
Lack of Full Enforcement of Vehicle Weight Regulations
31.       The Loan Agreements for the projects under review, like those for
the two previous projects, specified that the Borrower would take appropriate
measures to enforce regulations on the weight of highway vehicles. The
1/   These plans analyzed regions on a broader scale than engineering
projects. Projections of traffic volumes were based on surveys of past
growth, as compared with other highways or regions of similar growth
potential, or obtained through traffic studies similar to simplified
feasibility studies.
2/   An illustration is the agricultural development in the influence area
of BR 158, which is part of the export corridor to Porto Alegre (the
capital and main port in the state of Rio Grande do Sul).- Traditionally,
wheat is the predominant crop grown in the area. However, to restore
soil fertility, soybeans were planted in rotation with wheat. After a
cutback in soybean exports by the United States, demand developed for
export of Brazilian soybeans. To satisfy this demand, soybeans were
double cropped with wheat. The additional transport of soybeans from
farm to export port was responsible for a large share of the increased
traffic on BR 158, which was 290% higher than expected in the opening
year (1975).

Government published regulations in 1966 (maximum allowable loads are 10
tons for single axles, 17 tons for tandem axles, and 25 tons for triple
axles). The PCR (para. 3.19) states that the regulations were enforced
to the extent possible with available means and equipment. In fact, en-
forcement generally was minimal because the availability of equipment and
personnel required was not adequate.l/
32.       In 1975, the Government made improved enforcement of weight
control regulations part of its highway policy, which was an indication
of its serious concern about the damage to federal highways from heavy
vehicle loads. However, by 1975 only 32 weighing stations (financed by
the Inter-American Development Bank) had been installed. The Borrower
has stated that these weighing stations were inadequate to meet traffic
requirements as they were static weighing systems on highways with high
traffic volumes. In practice, they were not usable because the vehicle
flow would have had to be interrupted or disturbed. Nevertheless, at the
time of the 1975 appraisal of the ongoing Fifth Project, the federal high-
way department estimated that a further 95 stations would be required to
cover the federal network. Procurement and installation of these stations
were included in the Fifth Project.
33.       During 1975-76, the federal highway department, with the assistance
of Brazilian consultants, undertook a comprehensive study to identify more
precisely weight control requirements and determine the most suitable loca-
tions and types of equipment for Brazilian conditions. This action delayed
the program under the Fifth Project for about three years. The consultants
recommended that a change from static weighing to dynamic weighing in
motion would be more appropriate for Brazil's heavily travelled federal
highways. They determined that 127 new stations would he needed to provide
basic coverage of the entire federal network. The recommended infrastructure
and weighing equipment was estimated to cost about ten times more than that
for the static weighing system.
34.       The Bank and the Borrower agreed to the more sophisticated sta-
tions, which Bank staff and the Government expect will comprise perhaps
the most technologically advanced system in the world when it becomes fully
operational (expected in 1980). The modified 95 stations included in the
Fifth Project are to be located in nine southern and central states. The
32 remaining stations for ten northern states are covered in the ongoing
Sixth Project (Loan 1557-BR of May 1978 for US$114 million). By May 1979,
contracts had been signed for 73 dynamic weighing stations.
35.       Sufficient police to enforce regulations are essential to the
successful implementation of the dynamic weighing system. The federal
highway department is presently recruiting and training additional police to
operate the stations involved.
1/ Some states also control truck loading on state highways with significant
heavy traffic.



- 11 -
36.       According to the Borrower, the reduction in operating oosts
associated with carrying a heavy load on a single tractor-trailer combina-
tion vehicle must be taken into account in considering the problem of
vehicle weight control. It is contended that a major consideration in
resolving this problem is the need to optimize the relationship between
the reduction in operating costs associated with heavier loads and the
correspondingly higher investments in highway construction and maintenance.
GEIPOT (see para. 47) and the federal highway department's Road Research
Institute are currently studying the parameters needed for highway engineer-
ing design and for adoption of the best and technologically most effective
norms and regulations to govern vehicle loads.
37.       Notwithstanding the preceding commentary, full implementation
of the countrywide weight control program should bring about a substantial
reduction in pavement damage from truck overloading. In particular, it can
be expected that the timing between pavement overlays for highways with
average daily traffic exceeding 1,000 vehicles would be extended. According
to the Appraisal Report on the ongoing Sixth Project, analysis of the
average distribution of truck traffic on Brazilian highways shows that 20%
carried loads from 10%-50% above the legal limits.1/ Under these conditions,
a 75 mm overlay would be needed every five years. Assuming the elimination
of loads 10% or more above the legal limits, the overlay cycle might be
extended from five to nine years (compared with the ten-year cycle normally
postulated for design purposes).
38.       Design norms for pavement overlays suitable to local conditions
have not yet been developed; methodologies for other countries have been
adapted for Brazil. The federal highway department recognizes that adequate
norms are essential to its program of rehabilitating and strengthening paved
highways (para. 3). The ongoing Sixth Project provides for the development
of criteria and norms for pavement evaluation and design under Brazilian
conditions and for the determination of the timing, structural types, and
thicknesses of asphalt pavement strengthening (para. 36). It also includes
extension of a UNDP-financed research study (supervised by the Bank's Central
Projects Staff) on the interrelationship between transport costs, highway
design, and maintenance standards.
Lack of Quantitative Targets for Delegation of Highway Maintenance from
Federal to State Highway Departments
39.       According to the Loan Agreements for the projects under review,
the Borrower undertook to maintain the highway network as well as to dele-
gate maintenance responsibility for federal highways to any capable state
and to make funds available for the work. Maintenance delegation was consid-
ered necessary to avoid the duplication of field organizations between federal
and state governments and the consequent high administrative costs. Moreover,
1/ The average distribution of truck traffic is: 38% light trucks up to
10 tons, 41% medium trucks 10 to 15 tons, 14% heavy trucks 15 to 22 tons,
and 7% very heavy trucks over 22 tons.

the federal highway department's field infrastructure was old and severely
strained by expansion of the federal network. Similar undertakings had
been obtained in 1968 and 1970 for the two previous projects. However,
all lacked quantitative targets against which to measure the progress of
delegation. Since 1971, pilot maintenance delegation programs have been
carried out in 10 of the 22 states. In the ongoing Fifth and Sixth
Projects, the highway departments of three states (Minas Gerais, Parana,
and Rio Grande do Sul) are being strengthened to take over maintenance of
the federal network within their boundaries.
40.       The amount of the federal highway network delegated to states has
remained about the same in proportion (20% average), but has increased
substantially in length (4,894 km) between 1971 and 1978 (Annex F). The
main reasons for this situation, previously identified in the PPAR for
the First Project, were:
(a) the limited field infrastructure and capability of
personnel in most state highway departments to take
on maintenance of more highways; and
(b) the poor condition of some federal highways already
delegated or to be delegated because of lack of funds
for rehabilitation.
These constraints do not seem to have been fully recognized when the dele-
gation program was formulated.
41.       It is noted that maintenance by contract rose sharply from 7% of
the federal network in 1971 to 30% in 1978. Authorities at the federal
highway department stressed that the largest share of maintenance operations
is currently carried out by contract.l/ They said that the work is performed
well. However, its annual cost of US$3,000-US$4,000 per km is high, even
allowing for minor improvement works usually included in the contracts.
Indications are that routine maintenance under the delegation program is
less costly,i/ and for this reason, delegation should be expedited. Never-
theless, the audit considers that a thorough analysis of the cost and
effectiveness of contract versus delegated maintenance should be considered.
42.       If delegated work is to be expedited, the capability of state
highway departments needs to be built up through acquisition of workshop
and field equipment and training of personnel. The ongoing Fifth and Sixth
Projects provide for strengthening of the highway departments of the states
1/  Contract work is not likely to be eliminated completely in the future.
Better quantity and cost controls have been established by the federal
highway department for new maintenance contracts.
2/  Precise cost data are not yet available, but are being determined under

of Minas Gerais, Parana, and Rio Grande do Sul as part of the maintenance
delegation program. The necessary equipment is being acquired and a
Bank training specialist has assisted in preparing training programs.
However, progress in training still is not as rapid as desirable.
43.       In addition, highways should be delegated only when they are
in maintainable condition. Many delegated highways, afflicted by obso-
lescence and pavement fatigue, require rehabilitation before being
delegated to state maintenance. A condition inventory before delegation
could have identified this problem and the need for a realistic and
orderly transfer program. In 1978, under the ongoing Fifth Project,
the federal highway department's field districts carried out such an
inventory, which found that 45% (3,300 km) of the paved federal highways
in Minas Gerais, 32% (1,430 km) in Rio Grande do Sul, and 61% (1,640 km)
in Parana need to be rehabilitated. The federal highway department now
is carrying out, through Brazilian consultants, a countrywide condition
inventory of paved federal highways.
44.       The federal highway department has reported that it does not
have sufficient funds to cover fully the work required on federal highways
before maintenance is handed over to the states or to pay the states to
carry out the necessary work. If the delegation program is to expand fur-
ther, some reliable and continous source of financing for rehabilitation
must be found.
Delay in Establishing a Cost Accounting System for Highway Maintenance
Operations
45.       Reasonably accurate estimates of the costs of maintenance are
necessary to ensure that adequate funds can be transferred from the federal
to state level. Undertakings in the Loan Agreements for the two projects
which preceded those now under review had required the Borrower to cause
data necessary to assess technical, economic, and financial aspects of the
highway system to be collected and recorded systematically.i/     However,
the federal highway department only developed a system of cost accounting,
programming, and budgeting for highway maintenance operations, for imple-
mentation from 1979, under the ongoing Fifth Project. Notwithstanding the
delay, the fact that a cost accounting system eventually has been established
is a noteworthy accomplishment.
Insufficient Emphasis on Achievement of Overall Transport Objectives
46.       The projects under review did not continue the emphasis on achieve-
ment of overall transport objectives, e.g., improved planning, coordination,
and pricing policies, initiated under the First and Second Projects (see
1/ Theoretical formulas more suitable for estimation of construction costs
were used to estimate maintenance costs. These formulas generally are
not believed to reflect adequately the real costs of maintenance or to
provide realistic estimates of sufficient funds for highway maintenance.
The states already have problems obtaining adequate funds for state
highway maintenance.



- 14 -
paras. 6 and 7). As a result, the momentum started by the earlier projects
slowed considerably during implementation of the present projects, notwith-
standing some improvements in pricing, financing, and personnel policies
for railways. It is not clear why transport objectives were not emphasized
in these projects.l/ The Borrower accepts that there is much to be done
to improve overall transport objectives and policies. However, such im-
provements are said to have been beyond the goals for these projects.
47.       The responsibility for transport coordination rests with the
Ministry of Transport. The PPAR on the Second Project reported that the
agency charged with transport coordination, GEIPOT, had failed to become
institutionalized and it tied GEIPOT's performance problems to the inability
to attract qualified personnel because salaries in the public sector were
not competitive with those of the private sector. To remedy the situation,
GEIPOT was separated from the Government structure in 1973 and made a state
enterprise. While this allowed the lifting of salary constraints and
facilitated the employment of suitably qualified personnel, it also caused
some loss in GEIPOT's formal capability to coordinate. This experience
illustrates that care must be taken to ensure that changes in organizational
status to remove civil service constraints do not lead to the loss of the
agency's intended capabilities.
48.       It is significant that the technical capability of GEIPOT has been
strengthened considerably in recent years. This has led the Ministry of
Transport to rely on the agency as its basic advisory body. GEIPOT just
prepared modal plans and studies which are to be the basis of a National
Transport Plan.2/ Thus, the agency has been able to consolidate its position.
49.       It is noted that the Bank has not sent a transport sector mission
to Brazil since 1974. Bank technical staff are currently reviewing the modal
plans and studies prepared by GEIPOT. The future approach of the Bank con-
cerning coordinated transport sector investment would be determined on the
basis of this review.
V. Conclusions
50.       The objectives of the Third and Fourth Highway Projects were
substantially achieved, albeit with lengthy overall time increases for both
and a significant cost overrun for the latter. The projects contributed
substantially to the successful involvement of the Bank in the development
of Brazil's transport system. The 2,549 km of highways constructed,
1/ The Borrower has suggested that the lack of emphasis may have been
because the main critical problems had been solved or because execution
of the subject projects might have been jeopardized by addressing broader
sector issues.
2/ The report "National Transport Plan" of January l979 considers an
integrated approach for the physical, operational, financial, adminis-
trative, and institutional aspects of Brazil's transport system.

improved, or paved support agricultural, industrial, and socioeconomic
development, fill network gaps, and provide access to the interior. Much
of the feasibility studies and detailed engineering was the basis for
detailed engineering and construction, respectively, under the ongoing
Fifth Project. Further, the federal highway department's capability for
supervising construction was improved considerably.
51.       Inadequate detailed engineering for these projects and their
predecessors led to substantial quantity (particularly for earthworks)
and cost increases. This emphasizes the need for adequate engineering
studies, with enough time provision. Underestimation of traffic develop-
ment on many highways was a significant shortcoming in these and the
earlier projects because of the use of basic data from master plans.
Better data collection is expected to result from the current effort to
implement new counting procedures and install new equipment. Aside from
this, traffic projections should be based on preinvestment studies and
also should more closely reflect economic development prospects than in
the past.
52.       Vehicle weight regulations have not been fully enforced,
despite standard undertakings in four Loan Agreements since 1968.    Heavy
vehicle loads in the 1970s have been contributing significantly to highway
deterioration.  A program of dynamic weighing of trucks in motion, which
was developed only in the last few years, now is being initiated.    Enough
weighing stations for basic coverage of the entire federal highway network
are expected to be installed under the program. Sufficient highway police
are essential for satisfactory enforcement.
53.       No quantitative targets were established under the first four
highway projects by which to measure delegation of maintenance of federal
highways to the states. The length of highways delegated has expanded
gradually between 1971 and 1978. Delegation could be expedited by a more
concerted effort to strengthen state highway departments and to rehabilitate
highways in poor condition before delegation, including the provision of
some reliable and continuous source of financing. The Borrower is fully
aware of this need. The past lack of an adequate costing system for
highway maintenance operations has been corrected through the ongoing
Fifth Project.
54.       The projects under review did not emphasize the achievement of
overall transport sector objectives. Transport coordination in the Ministry
of Transport could be better worked out. While it is recognized that
coordination involves a major effort in light of the size and complexity
of the country, it seems that the effort is worth thc cost to ensure that
many advances of the past in this direction are not lost. The Bank's
review of the modal plans and studies prepared by GEIPOT should serve as
the basis for determining its future approach toward coordinated transport
sector investment.

References to matters and comments pertaining to the area of the
Directorate of Maintenance.
1.     METHODOLOGY ADOPTED., NUMBI[R OF REFERENCES AND OTHER.
All references to topics, matters and ccmments pertaining to the
Directorate of Maintenance are indicated by titles, showing the pages on
which they appear in the subject report. The respective explanatory
comments follow.
A total of five items were identified for the above-mentioned procedure.
With regard to the area of activity of the Directorate of Maintenance,
the tone of the report closely reflects the actual situation as the Group
perceives it and is even quite favorable.
2.     ITEMIZATION
2.1    System of allocation of maintenance costs
2.1.1 Comments in report
.1 Lack of such a system: pages iii and 8
.2 Introduction of the GTPM system at the national level:
pages 16, 19 and 20.
.3 Formula for unit pricing: page 17, note 1.
2.1.2 GTPM remarks
It seems to be the opinion of Dr. Valad that a national cost alloca-
tion system is necessary.
Actually, it should be introduced in delegated and contract maintenance,
on the basis of a price formula and the use of data processing. However,



ANNEX G
Page 4
- 25 -
in force account mairenance the system should be similar to that used
in the demonstration areas.
2.2    Delays in the delegation of highway maintenance from Federal to state
departments.
2.2.1 Comments in report.
.1 Mention is made as an important problem: pages 8, 14 and 15.
.2 Reasons for the delay: pages 15 and 16.
2.2.2 GTPM remarks
The reasons stated in the report are the lack of infrastructure in the
state highways departments and the need for prior improvements and
rehabilitation. However, the Group believes that there are other factors
not mentioned such as the lack of priority in the program of delegation
for various reasons, including the absence of an up-to-date system for
the allocation of resources, which are not only scarce but insufficient.
2.3    Survey of rehabilitation requirements
2.3.1 Comments in report
Survey in the form of a table: page 16
2.3.2 GTPM comments
It appears that the survey was made in 1975 and that the distances
indicated were subsequently corrected.
2.4    Roads with delegated, contract and force account maintenance.
2.4.1 Comment in report: page 26.



ANNEX G

2.4.2  GTPM remarks
It would be advisable for the Surveys Office of the Maintenance
Division to update and analyze the table in question.
2.5    Strengthening of the infrastructure of the state highway departments.

MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT - NATIONAL HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT
The "Project Performance Audit Report" (Draft) of April 13, 1979
referring to Projects IBRD III (Loan 813-BR) and IBRD IV (Loan 854-BR),
submitted by the Directorate of Works to INGEROUTE for information and
observations, is divided into two main parts:
-      The first part is the report prepared by the Operations Evalua-
tion Department of IBRD after study of the results of Projects III and IV
during the visit by OED staff to Brazil in January 1979.
-      The second part is the report prepared by IBRD staff responsible
for DNER/IBRD projects in Brazil on the basis of their own observations and
the fisl report presented by DNER to the Bank after the completion of the
projects.
One of the tasks of INGEROUTE was specifically to draw up the final
report "Overall Evaluation of Projects III and IV," which deals with the
execution of the projects and problems arising therein.
Analysis of the "Project Performance Audit Report".
We have no specific comments to make on the analyses and conclusions
set forth in the two parts of the IBRD report, which reflect the similar
opinion of Bank missions on the execution of the two projects and the object-
ives; however, the part prepared by the OED staff seems to be more critical
than the other part.
In summary, we may note the following conclusions:
-      Despite cost increases ardthe extension of periods of exceu-
tion, the objectives were achieved.
-      The standard of performance of the construction companies and



ANNEX G
Page 7
- 28 -
the supervisory capacity of the local consultants were somewhat better in
relation to those of earlier projects.
-      Technical assistance from INGEROUTE to DNER in the coordina-
tion of the consultants' activities and in the preparation of technical
recommendations will have a positive impact on the execution of intensive
programs for the development and improvement of supervision methods.
-      Unfortunately, the brief period of preparation of the final
engineering designs, without sufficient studies of the hydrology and geology
of the regions, led to problems in implementation and sharp increases in
quantities and therefore in costs.
-      DNER's capacity to administer and supervise construction con-
tracts in different geographical, economic and geological regions was made
clear in the execution of the contracts.
DNER, aware of the errors in the final designs, took appropriate
measures during the execution stage to correct the deficiencies in the
projects and in some cases brought about a substantial improvement (illegible).
In addition to other factors already mentioned, (illegible) and the
impact of the 1973-74 oil crisis led to increases in the costs of construc-
tion and studies.
The projections of traffic increases were underestimated. This is
seen clearly from study of the results of the (illegible) IBRD projects. In
Project III the initial results indicate that on 7 of the 9 roads built
traffic was 60% greater than that envisaged; in Project IV, on 6 of the 7
roads, it was 42% higher than forecast. Also noted was a substantial increase
in heavy traffic.



ANNEX C
Page 8
- 29 -
There is need for a significant improvement in traffic studies.
-      The lack of control and policing of excess loads and a need
to implement a program of scales was pointed out as essential to achieve the
objectives.
The delegation of maintenance of Federal highways to the states has
been and continues to be very slow. The process of delegation should be
accelerated.
From the economic standpoint the results of the projects may be
regarded as a success in absolute and relative terms.
-      The two projects injected a new force into the development
of the rural areas which can be seen in the socioeconomic changes in
the communities.
Two examples of this are: Porangatu in Parana (BR-153) and Jatai and
Rio Verde in Goias (BR-060).

Mr. Shiv Kapur, Operations Evaluation Dept.
We refer to the following points of the PPAR:
Point 12: the Bank does not include among reasons for delay the termination
of contracts because of contractor (? faults); failings; Point 14: only two
highways IBRD III and 2 IBRD IV responsible for most most of cost increase;
Points 18, 24 and 25: no effect on the environment, erosion control is routine
but not 100% efficient; Points 20 - 23: faulty engineering due to lack of
detail and insufficient data. For a large number of designs better supervision
was not possible. Designs were improved during execution. Points 26 - 28:
traffic realistically projected because many forecasts (projetos) derived
from master plans and unforeseen regional economic growth. IBRD always
recommends conservative traffic estimates, often contrary to our opinion.
However, this error has made it possible for any cost increases not to affect
viability. Points 29 - 34: there is now a satisfactory plan for weighing
vehicles, but the problem not handled in the report is optimization between
heavy vehicles operating at low cost and highway investments. Points 35 - 39:
the Bank does not mention another factor that delayed delegation, namely the
lack of DNER funds to rehabilitate roads or pay the states. Points 41 - 43:
not pertinent to DNER's field of activity. Report follows, should reach the
Bank within about 10 days.
Regards.

DNER'S COMMENTS ON IBRD'S PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
RELATING TO LOANS 813-BR AND 854-BR
Paragraph 12 of the Report--Delays in the Work
The Bank correctly describes some of the causes of delays in
the work. It fails to mention an important factor: the cancellations
and transfers of contracts as a result of the poor performance of some
construction firms, making it necessary for DNER to intervene in these
contracts.
These cancellations were followed by new bidding competitions--a
process that both delays work and adds to its cost.
We do not believe that any manpower iortages were such as to
cause delays in the work. Also any deficiencies in bidding documents
had no bearing on work timetables.
Paragraph 14--Costs
We believe there must be some error in the wording of the
following sentence: "The construction cost was higher because of lover
expenditure on consultants...": perhaps it was intended to read "The
construction cost was not higher because..."
If the latter reading is in fact correct, we should like to
point out that the principal cost overruns occurred only in the case of
two IBRD highways--BR 158 and BR 386--which accounted for 30% of the total
increase in construction costs and in the case of BR 153, in IBRD IV,
which accounted for 60% of the total increase in costs and in BR 324,
where the amount was also significant.



ANNEX G
Page 23
- 44 -
The other roads for the most part showed minimal increases in
cost or were low-priced contracts, where variations had no significant
bearing on total project costs.
The case of BR 153, where the cost overrun is largest, was the
result of modifications in the engineering design to adapt it better
to local climatic conitions. The new design was substantially more
expensive than the original one.
This is, however, an isolated case.
Paragraphs 18, 24 and 25--Environmental Effects
We maintain our view that no serious environmental effects were
involved, other than those caused by the use of land by the activities
that follow the introduction of a highway.
So far as erosion control is concerned, this has been included
in our projects for many years.
As Brazilian soils are very subject to erosion, the structures
in our designs are unable to provide highly effedive forms of protection
against it. It is desirable that projects should include more effective
erosion-control procedures, although this would very substantially
increase the cost of roadbuilding.
We have already gone part of the way and recognize the need for
more effective erosion control.
Paragraphs 20, 21, 22 and 23--Shortcomings in our Engineering Projects
A number of shortcomings in our projects have in fact been identi-
fied: these have been largely the result of incomplete data, i.e., the
absence of in-depth detailed documentation.



ANNEX G
Page 24
- 45 -
Design errors are very rare.
On the other hand with the strengthening of consultant services,
the training and increased experience of technical personnel, the standard-
ization and systematization of contractual and project preparation
procedures and the more precise wording and formulation of terms of
reference, better prepared projects are now being obtained.
Projects are improving, both in terms of detail and quality.
It is acknowledged that the large number of projects contracted
out, together with the short periods in which they were implemented,
made it impossible to make a closer and more careful examination of
their adequacy and accuracy.
The need for modifications and adaptations in projects has been
the factor largely responsible for cost overruns, although this does not
in fact indicate that such cost increases were unjustified and even less
that project costs were underestimated.
The projects as executed were of better quality than those
submitted at the stage of competitive bidding, that is to say, in our
view, the improvements made justify the increases in cost.
Paragraphs 26, 27 and 28--Underestimation of Traffic Growth
It is a fact that, in the case of the majority of highway
sections built, traffic volumes in the opening year were higher than
those foreseen in the projects and that the proportion corresponding to
heavy commercial vehicles exceeded the estimates.
There are two reasons for this.



ANNEX G
Page 25
- 46 -
The first is that estimates of traffic volumes in some of the
projects were based on levels set in the Master Plans.
These plans analyzed regions on a broader scale than that of
the engineering projects End the projections of traffic volumes were
based on their surveys of past growth, as compared with other highways
or regions of similar growth potential, or obtained as a result of
traffic studies similar to simplified feasibility studies.
Frequently, however, unforeseen factors arose in the project
regions, such as the development of new forms of agricultural or
industrial activity, modifying regional economies and outdating the
bases previously adopted for estimates of traffic volumes.
The second reason is associated with the adoption by the World
Bank of very conservative criteria in its examination and discussion
of projects with the borrower.
The Bank refused to accept the growth rates proposed and
minimized the expansion of production.
It is true that there is a lack of reliable traffic statistics
on which sounder projections might be based but in any event traffic
volumes were underestimated.
To some extent this bears out the rationale for these invest-
ments, since evaluation reports have invariably shown higher rates of
return.
Paragraphs 29-34--Lack of Enforcement of Vehicle Weights
It is a well known fact that an excessive number of vehicles
are carrying axle loads exceeding the legal limits.



ANNEX C
Page 26
- 47 -
The lack of an adequate network of weighing stations has made
it impossible to enforce weight regulations more effectively.
In 1975 we had 32 weighing stations, which were inadequate to
meet traffic requirements as they were static weighing systems on
highways with high traffic volumes.
To use them it would have been necessary to interrupt or disturb
the vehicle flow. This made them unusable in practice.
It was necessary to prepare a new program based on different
technical approaches and employing more advanced technologies.
This program will become operational in 1980.
It should be noted, however, that an important factor must be
taken into account in considering the problem of vehicle weight control:
this is the reduction in operating costs associatd with carrying a
heavy load on a single tractor truck.
One of the major considerations in seeking to resolve this
problem is the need to optimize the relationship between the reduction
in operating costs associated with heavier loads and the correspondingly
higher investments in highway construction and maintenance.
The studies now being undertaken by GEIPOT and IPR will provide
the parameters needed for the formulation of an engineering project and
the adoption of the best and technically most effective norms and regula-
tions to govern loads.



ANNEX G
Page 27
- 48 -
Paragraphs 35-39--Slow Delegation of Highway Maintenance from Federal
to State Highway Departments
The Loan Agreement includes only one general provision stating
that the borrower will delegate an unspecified amount of the maintenance
of the Federal highway system to those states regarded by the borrower
as in the position to undertake it.
It is a fact that in the 1971-76 period little highway main-
tenance was delegated and the Bank's report correctly describes this
situation and the reasons for it.
We should like to add one further reason to those indicated
in paragraph 36: (c) DNER lacks the funds to rehabilitate roads prior
to handing them over to the states or to pay the states the necessary
sums to undertake rehabilitation work on roads for which they have been
made responsible.
Paragraph 40--Lack of a Cost Accounting System for Highway Maintenance
Operations
This is currently being developed.
Paragraphs 41-43--Absence of Emphasis on Achievement of Transport Objectives
The various comments made by the Bank relate to general trans-
portation policies and to other modal agencies for which the Ministry of
Transport is responsible: they are outside the responsibilities discharged
by DNER in the projects.
The "Conclusions" of the Bank (Chapter V) are merely a summary
of the comments made in the body of the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 813-BR) AND FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 854-BR)
T. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Except for an early highway maintenance loan to the State of Rio de
Janeiro in 1953 (Loan 75-BR, US$3 million), the Bank's continuous and active
interest in the Brazilian transport sector dates back to 1964 when an economic
mission recommended a comprehensive National Transport Survey. Since then,
the Bank has made loans totalling US$886 million for six highway projects, a
secondary and feeder roads project, a port project and three railway projects.
The Brazil Transport Survey was carried out in two phases over the period
1965 to 1970; Phase I was supported by a Bank grant of US$1.5 million and
covered highway transport in four states, railways, coastal shipping and
many ports. Phase II covered highway transport in 14 states; it was supported
by USAID (US$1 million) and UNDP (US$1.4 million) grants, with the Bank as
Executing Agency. The Survey laid out the basis for the rapid expansion of
the primary highway network and helped shape the institutions necessary to
support it.
1.02      Bank lending in the highway sector started in 1968; since then
seven loans totalling US$545 million have supported the construction and/or
improvement of about 5,700 km of federal and state highways, rehabilitation
of about 1,500 km, feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs for
more than 11,000 km, and a program to construct or improve secondary and
feeder roads. Four of the highway projects have been completed. All four
involved construction and improvement of priority highways included in the
Master Plan that evolved from the Transport Survey. Since 1970, the Bank has
also provided technical assistance to DNER in the areas of planning and con-
struction supervision and has helped to strengthen highway maintenance opera-
tions at federal and state levels.
1.03      In line with the changing priorities in the highways sector, the
focus of Bank projects, as reflected in the more recent Fifth and Sixth High-
way Projects, shifted toward road maintenance and rehabilitation. The Bank
is also Executing Agency for UNDP in a comprehensive research into the
relation between road design and condition, and vehicle operating costs,
which should set the basis for improved road design and maintenance.
Increased emphasis on direct support to rural development led to Bank involve-
ment in lower cost rural roads through a Feeder Road Project and through a
number of rural development projects.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION
2.01      The Third and Fourth Highway Projects formed an integral part of
the Government's program for the implementation of a coordinated transport
policy in effect since 1965. The projects consisted of: (i) construction
and paving of 2,530 km of highways, (ii) supervision of the construction,
(iii) consulting services for detailed engineering of 1,626 km and
feasibility studies for 2,584 km of highways, and (iv) international experts
to assist DNER in construction supervision and in the running of training
courses.  Originally the two Projects were appraised as a single project,
but for technical and financial reasons, its implementation was carried out
in two phases: the Third and Fourth Highway Projects under Loan
Agreements 813-BR and 854-BR respectively.



- 51 -
2.02      Loan 813-BR for the Third Highway Project was signed on April 11,
1972; the project consisted of:
(i)  Civil Works:
(a) construction, improvement and paving of 1,849 km of
federal highways;
(ii) Consulting Services:
(b) detailed engineering for 895 km of federal and 731 km
of state highways;
(c) feasibility studies for 2,276 km of federal and 308 km
of state highways;
(d)  supervision oE civil works; and
(iii) Technical Assistance:
(e) to the National Highways Department (DNER) to:
-    further improve methods and procedures for con-
struction supervision, and
-    strengthen the highway training center.
Loan 854-BR for the Fourth Highway Project was signed on August 14, 1972; this
project consisted of:
(i) Civil Works:
(a) construction, improvement and paving of 258 km of
federal and 423 km of state highways; and
(ii) Consulting Services:
(b) supervision of civil works.
The location of the various civil works components of both projects is shown
in Map IBRD 3583R.
2.03      The Bank's participation in both projects was 40%.    Civil works
contracts were let on the basis of international competitive bidding accord-
ing to Bank Guidelines. Invitations to tender were issued on a combined
basis for the two projects covering the services envisaged for both projects.
Firms which prepared the final highway designs were retained for supervision
of works while the overall supervision coordination was entrusted to INGEROUTE
(France). Proposals for detailed engineering and feasibility studies were
invited separately. The actual amount of work accomplished under both projects
was: (i) 2,548 km of highways constructed, improved and paved (Table 1);



- 52 -
(ii) 1,629 km of detailed engineering designs (Table 2); and (iii) 1,965 km
of road feasibility studies (Table 3).
2.04      About 75% of the roads, lengthwise, built under Loan 813-BR, were
located in two regions: (i) the poorer, densely populated northeastern region;
and (ii) the sparsely populated, rapidly developing centerwestern region. Out
of the 624 km of roads built under Loan 854-BR all but the 4.5 km of northern
access to Salvador, the capital of Bahia, were in the southern and southeastern
regions of Brazil. The southern region with about 7% of the country's land
and about a fifth of its population is a significant agricultural, livestock
and timber area with high transport demand. The southeastern region with -
about two-fifths of the country's population and only a tenth of its land, is
fast growing, industrially dynamic, well endowed with natural resources and
agriculturally productive. In the southeast, the project roads were mainly
trunk roads while in the southern region they filled gaps in the basic regional
network. In the underdeveloped northeast, the project roads served to
integrate the region, provided accessibility to the hinterland (BR-316/232/PE
is a section of the Trans-Amazon Highway) and improved access to agricultural
resources. In the centerwest, the project roads helped connect Brazilia with
regional development poles and the state capitals of Goiania (Goias) and
Cuiaba (Mato Grosso) and provided access to the Metropolis of Curitiba and the
seaport of Paranagua in Parana.
2.05      DNER was the executing agency for both loans.    Loan 854-BR contained
construction of 423 km of state highways, the execution of which were the
responsibility of the respective state DERs of Parana, Minas Gerais, Espirito
Santo and Rio Grande do Sul under Project Agreements with the Bank.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Loan 813-BR became effective on December. 4, 1972, followed by Loan
854-BR which became effective on-March 29, 1973. The delay in loan effective-
ness of both loans was due to the time taken by the states in ratifying
subsidiary agreements with DNER but did not affect either project adversely.
Eventually, the loan closing date had to be extended by twentY-one months
for the former, due to delavs in completion of the civil works. The civil
works are now completed and the loans fully disbursed.
Civil Works
3.02      One hundred and eighty-four Brazilian firms and joint ventures and
three foreign firms were prequalified for civil works covered in the two
projects. For the Third Highway Project, 149 firms presented 895 valid bids;
45 contracts were awarded by DNER, totalling US$154.6 million, about 26% less
than the appraisal estimates and 3% lower than the engineers' estimates.
Under the Fourth Project, 61 contractors presented 343 valid bids for 24
construction lots. DNER awarded contracts to 24 firms for works totalling
US$88.9 million, about 6% less than the appraisal estimate and about 10%



- 53 -
lower than the engineers' estimates. In awarding the contracts, DNER gener-
ally selected the lowest bidders. In the cases of contractors with lowest
bids on several lots, the award was made for the lot for which the difference
with the next lowest bid was more advantageous to DNER. Some bids were
rejected because of documentation irregularities, inadequate equipment
offered, or prices substantially below the engineers' estimates. Under both
loans, bids were evaluated in a fair and professional manner and contracts
were awarded after consultation with the Bank.
3.03      Supervision for civil works was carried out by Brazilian consultants
(paragraph 2.03). DNER negotiated 15 contracts to supervise works in the
Third Highway Project. The original contract for the supervision of BR-050/GO
was cancelled due to poor performance and the bond forfeited. (A new contract
was negotiated for the supervision.) To supervise works in the Fourth High-
way Project, six contracts were negotiated. Technical assistance was provided
by consultants (INGEROUTE France) who were retained to establish appropriate
supervision procedures within DNER and for consultants. In effect, these
services were a continuation of assistance provided under the Second Highway
Project (Loan 676-BR). Technical assistance to strengthen DNER's highway
training center was found not be necessary since independent steps had been
taken to that effect.
3.04      The final civil works cost of the Third Highway Project was almost
US$196 million: a relatively modest increase of 6% over the appraisal esti-
mates (including contingencies) but about 27% more than the original contract
amounts. The final cost of works for the Fourth Highway Project, however, was
nearly 29% above the appraisal estimates (including contingencies) and about
68% more than the original contract amounts. For both projects together, the
average increase in costs was 14%, which was higher than the cost increase
experienced under the Second Highway Project. In the Third Highway Project for
individual roads, the final costs on two contracts were below the appraisal
estimates; on six, less than 15% over the appraisal estimates; and on two,
between 20% to 25% more than the appraisal estimates. BR-158/386/SC/RS, which
passes through regions of rugged terrain, between Sarandi-Irai Cunhapora (Junc-
tion BR-282) had a final cost of over US$39 million representing about 22%
increase over the appraisal estimate of US$32.3 million while BR-158 between
Cruz Alta and Julio de Castilhos showed a cost overrun of nearly 25% over the
appraisal estimate of US$6.7 million. Other roads with large increases over the
appraisal amounts were: BR-316/232/PI/PE (11%), BR-050/GO (14%).
For the Fourth Highway Project, final cost variances of individual
roads from the appraisal estimates (ranging between 2% and 103%) and original
contract amounts (ranging between 4% and 146%) were much larger. More than
one-half of the total cost escalation experienced in this project was attri-
buted to a single road: BR-153/PR/SC/RS, which goes through mountainous
terrain, linking Uniao de Vitoria with Erechim. Increased costs for both pro-
jects were a result of a number of factors among which were: delays due to
exceptionally heavy rainfalls, lack of managerial know-how of some construc-
tion firms, changes in work quantities, availability of construction labor
(which was critically short in the case of BR-324/BA, the northern access
to Salvador) and shortage of suitable construction materials, deficiencies
in engineering designs, contract cancellations, (which led to higher unit
costs for new contracts) and high price escalations which affected many con-
tracts especially in the Fourth Highway Project.

3.05      Shortly after the civil works started, contractors, DNER and the
Bank began to realize that there was a general underestimation in the earth-
work quantities in the engineering.   The actual earthworks were about 46%
higher for the Third and 107% higher for the Fourth Highway Projects.   Over-
all, quantity overruns accounted for about one half of the total cost in-
creases in both projects.  Although, the earthwork underestimation apDlied
to all roads it was particularly severe for BR-050/GO, BR-316/232/PI/PE
in the Third, RS-19 and BR-153/PR/SC/RS in the Fourth Highway Project.
According to Ingeroute, these high earthwork overruns were mainly due to in-
correct classification of excavation materials and cut slopes designed too steep
for the terrain. As in the Second Highway Project, the geotechnical site invest-
igations carried out in the design phase were inadequate and often incorrect.
Quantity miscalculations were also made in shoulder widening for improvement works,
removal of unsuitable foundation soil, and inadequate embankment heights in
terrain subject to flooding.
3.06      A significant portion of these problems could have been remedied
if sufficient resources had been devoted to hydrological and geotechnical
investigations at the engineering stages. DNER was partly at fault in allow-
ing design consultants insufficient time to thoroughly investigate site con-
ditions. As a result, the thoroughness of detailed engineering was traded
off against speedy delivery of final engineering which contributed to cost
escalations through delays and quantity increases. DNER is now taking posi-
tive and practicable steps to curb the reoccurrence of similar problems. In
general, the engineering for civil works under the Fifth Highway Project has
been of much higher standard.
3.07      Pavement quantities accounted for about 25% of total cost increases
in both the Third and Fourth Highway Project. Considering the numerous design
changes found necessary during the execution of works, the increases in costs
are relatively modest and not unreasonable. The modifications in pavement
design included:
(i) changes in cement stabilized bases which were brought
about by shortages of cement, and
(ii) changes in the base and sub-base material specifications
because of poor quality of selected borrow materials.
3.08      Drainage and structure quantities accounted for 13% of the total
increase in the Third and 5% of the total in the Fourth Highway Project
(cf. 9% increase in the Second Highway Project). As works progressed, many
existing culverts were found to be inadequate and had to be replaced. Also,
shortages of corrugated steel culverts became a particularly acute problem
for both projects leading to substitution by concrete pipes at higher cost.
The engineering designs often underestimated the amount of protection works
such as rip-rap and masonry walls.



- 55 -
3.09      Complementary and miscellaneous works such as slope seeding and
planting, day works, etc., accounted for about 15% and 7% of the total cost
increases for the Third and Fourth Highway Projects respectively, and
finally, modifications to bridges and major structures contributed about
3% and 6% of the total increases respectively.
3.10      In retrospect, the Third Highway Project with a 27% cost increase
over the contracted amounts and about    6% over the appraisal estimates
(including contingencies) compares well with the Second Highway Project.
The cost increases for the Fourth Highway Project were higher (68% and 29%
respectively) but, as indicated previously, a number of unforeseen factors
especially inflation contributed toward this escalation. Table 4 shows the
impact of inflation on costs of civil works. When the fuel crisis hit the
economy in 1973 - 1974 civil works rose rapidly as shown in the fluctuation
of the price adjustment index in US$ terms. Inflation was growing much faster
than devaluation, giving rise to almost a twofold jump in the civil works cost
index which created considerable uncertainty in the construction industry.
New contracts negotiated to replace those cancelled for BR-324/BA, BR-153/SC
and RS-19 and extra works on other roads had significantly higher unit costs
which reflected the industry's doubts regarding cost trends. In conjunction
with the inflation, the abnormally high and out of season rains in 1974,
1975, and again in 1977 affected the progress of works particularly in the
Fourth Highway Project. Progress, for example, on the northern access to
Salvador in Bahia, BR-324/BR and ES-36/37, was severely retarded as a con-
sequence of inclement weather.
Civil Works Schedules
3.11      Tables 5 and 6 show a comparison of the schedule with the actual
contract completion periods for civil works. The schedule for each lot in
the Third Highway Project envisaged 20 months for construction and paving
and about 18 months for major structures. The average actual time was 31
and 24 months respectively. By June 1974, the original completion date for
all contracts, about one third of the civil works remained uncompleted. The
average monthly physical progress of work planned at over 2 km per lot was
matched by only one and a half km per lot in the field. Delays in completion
of works in the Fourth Highway Project were more extensive than in the Third
Highway Project. About 21 months planned for road works per lot and about
18 months for major structures did not prove feasible in the field where the
average was 36 months and 31 months respectively. By December 1974, the
original completion date for contracts, about one fourth of the works remained
uncompleted. The average monthly physical progress planned for about 2 km per
lot was actually about 1 km per lot.
3.12      Figure 1 shows the final cost of work per kilometer relative to
the average progress per month; lots with low monthly progress had invariably
higher per kilometer cost. Overall, the cost per kilometer was significantly
lower in the center western and northwestern regions (between US$50,000 to
US$150,000) than in the south of the country (between US$200,000 and
US$350,000). In terms of performance, the center western and northwestern
regions had a better record of adherence to schedules than the southern and
southwestern regions.   This is primarily due to easier terrain and lower rainfall.

Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering
3.13      Under the Third Highway Project, feasibility studies were done for
1,965 km of highways at a total cost of over US$3.5 million (Cr$21,697,000),
averaging around US$1,781 (Cr$l1,041) per km. Studies for two roads, SP8 and
SP89, although included in the Third Project, were later deleted so that the
feasibility ofMG58 could be studied. All but four feasibility studies were
carried out under the direct supervision of DNER. The feasibility studies
for MG4 and MG58 were accomplished under the direct responsibility of the
DER of Minas Gerais while the DAER of Rio Grande de Sul had direct responsi-
bility for the studies on RS19 and RS3. Besides feasibility studies, the
Third Project-also provided for detailed engineering of 1,626 kilometers of
federal and state highways. Actually, 1,629 km were engineered at a total
cost of about US$6.5 million (Cr$42,359,000), averaging about US$3,759
(Cr$24,500) per km. All told, DNER was directly responsible for engineering
of over 900 km of federal roads engineering while the DERs in Bahia, Parana,
Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais were responsible for the remaining 800 km.
3.14      All feasibility studies and detailed engineering were scheduled to
be completed by March 1974, with individual contracts being allotted between
eight and ten months for preparation. The preparation of feasibility studies
proceeded without major delays or cost overruns. (The delays encountered
were of the order of magnitude of about one to two months and the cost in-
crease was less than 3%). Comparatively more delays were experienced in the
preparation of detailed engineering; the Rio-Juiz de Fora highway engineering
was extended for almost a year. The costs also were higher: about 42% over
the original contract amounts. Combined together, the feasibility and engi-
neering studies, experienced a 26% cost increase (Cr$) over the contract
amounts. Considering the final cost per kilometer, market prices and infla-
tionary situation in Brazil, the cost of the studies was reasonable.
3.15      The contract extension of about one year for the detailed engineer-
ing of Rio-Juiz de Fora highway came about as a result of the decision to
change, after work was already initiated, the methodology for topographical
surveys from the traditional land based means. After lengthy discussions it
was decided to use photogrammetry and expand the scope of work to include the
Tres Rios, Paraibuna and Juiz de Fora alternatives, which required consider-
able extra time and cost for the work.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.16      Compared with earlier Bank projects, the performance of consultants
and contractors in the execution of the civil works showed significant
improvement. The performance of only 1 of the 15 consultants under the
Third Project was less than satisfactory while 3 did excellent work and the
remaining 11 performed satisfactorily. Among the six consultants for the
Fourth Project, one performed excellently and five satisfactorily. The
overall coordinating supervision entrusted to INGEROUTE was also good.
3.17      The original supervision cost of US$19.1 million for the Third and
US$12.2 million for the Fourth Highway Project in the end amounted tax US$18.4 and



- 57 -
US$8.0 million respectively. The original contract amounts were lower, but
increases were due to extensions needed for completion of the works. Supervision
costs averaged 9% and 7% for the Third and Fourth Highway Projects
respectively. They compare well with the Second Highway Project which
averaged 10% of civil work costs. There was no increase in the costs for the
services provided by INGEROUTE since the extension overlapped with the Fifth
Highway Project which also included funds for INGEROUTE's services.
3.18      The construction firms, 45 for the Third and 24 for the Fourth
Project, contracted for the civil works had good overall performance. Under
the Third Project, four contracts were cancelled and retendered, one sub-
rogated and two others were cancelled and subsequently awarded to the firm
with the next eligible bid. Four contracts under the Fourth Project were can-
celled and one was reduced. With the exception of the contract for lot 108.8
of BR-153 which was reduced for technical reasons (part of the lot had to be
redesigned), the financial problems of the firms, resulting in serious delays
in execution, were the cause of contract cancellations. Some firms demon-
strated poor managerial capacity and others had underestimated unit prices
in their bids leading to cash flow problems. With cancellations and transfers
notwithstanding, the overall performance of the construction firms was
satisfacto ry.
Special Loan Covenants
3.19      Both Loans had special covenants attached to them.    These dealt
mainly with (i) the establishment of Project Revolving Funds to be replenished
monthly by DNER and the executing agencies in the states; (ii) the enforcement
of size and weight limitations of vehicles as provided by Decreto-Lei No. 117;
(iii) the delegation of the maintenance of federal highways to the state
highway departments and the making available to them the funds required
for that purpose; and (iv) the continued provision of facilities to collect
and systematically record, information on the technical, economic and finan-
cial aspects of the highway system in Brazil. These covenants were generally
adhered to and enforced; the Revolving Fund was established and periodically
replenished, weight and size of vehicles were enforced to the extent possible
with the available means and equipment (the Fifth Highway Project is helping
remedy this situation by assisting in the financing of 95 weighing stations
throughout the country), on the basis of studies carried out during execution
of the project pilot programs for the delegation of the maintenance of federal
highways were set up in eight states, and the Planning Directorate of DNER
continued to collect information on the Brazilian highway system on the
basis of which an improved planning and programming system now exists in
DNER.
Disbursements
3.20     The estimated and actual Disbursement Schedules are given in Tables 7
and 8; disbursements usually:occurred four to six months after work was per-
formed. Due to cost increases of construction works, the Bank's participation
in the Fourth Highway Project was reduced on January 20, 1976 from the original
40% to 20% for Category I. This reduction was made when about 75% of the
works had been completed. Overall, no difficulties were experienced in this
area of loan management.

IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
4.01      The Third and the Fourth Highway Projects were justified on the
basis of quantifiable benefits accruing from road user savings stemming from
lower vehicle operating costs and reductions in the distance travelled. In
the case of BR-324, the northern access to Salvador in Bahia state which
has an urban character, benefits were also projected for user time savings
and reduced congestion. Additionally, benefits were assessed for the dif-
ference in maintenance costs of the new highways vis-a-vis the unpaved or
low standard paved roads which existed before the projects were undertaken.
During appraisal, the best estimates of the economic rates of return of the
projects ranged between 13% and 40% (Table 9). The weighted economic rates
of return for the Third and Fourth HighwayProjects were 25% and 16% respec-
tively. A sensitivity analysis of the rate of return was made, and upper
and lower limits for the rate were calculated, the lowest lower limit being
11% and the highest higher limit being 42%.
4.02    - On completion of the project, a comparison of the actual final
costs of each of the road sections under the two projects and the traffic
counts in the opening year of the new highways with those estimated during
appraisal (Tables 10 and 11) shows that: the best estimate of the rate of
return has been surpassed for all but one road section under the Third Highway
Project, BR-316/232, which has an ERR of 18% and two sections in the Fourth,
i.e. ES-36/37, which has a rate of return of 24% and BR-324 which has an ERR
of 26%.
4.03      Several reasons have caused the higher than expected rates of
return. Available traffic counts show that for most roads, actual traffic
has been significantly higher than that forecast during appraisal (Table 11).
On a number of roads a marked change in the composition of traffic has
occurred as for example on BR-104 between Campina Grande and the
junction with BR-316, which besides carrying substantially more traffic also
carries a higher number of heavy commercial vehicles (50% of total traffic)
than foreseen during appraisal (32%). The actual traffic counts on BR-050/60
and BR-316/232       show that about 85% of the total volume consists of
trucks and buses.  This change in the composition of traffic has led to higher
benefits than were anticipated during appraisal, and, partially explains
the higher than expected returns.   On BR-316/232      , which is a long
haul traffic road, DNER's counts show traffic in the opening year to be about
36% below that expected, but the rate of return is still about 18%.   The
explanation is that the lower traffic volume is largely accounted for by a
drop in the number of passenger cars (about 50%) counted in the opening year.
Heavy commercial vehicle traffic was largely the same as estimated. The
benefits to automobiles from improved roads being relatively modest (in the
order of magnitude of one quarter of the benefits to heavy commercial
vehicles), no significant changes occurred to the overall stream of benefits.
Moreover, recent data on vehicle operating costs used in the reevaluation
shows higher savings from paving unpaved roads than foreseen at appraisal,
thus compensating for the increased cost of civil works and the decline in the
numbers of passenger cars in the traffic volume counted.



- 59 -
4.04      The most recent data on Brazilian vehicle operating costs have been
documented in the Staff Appraisal Report for the Sixth Highway Project. The
relatively higher savings from this data are due to several factors among
which are:
(i) the large increase in the costs of vehicles between 1970
and 1976 which increases the fixed component of VOC, and
(ii) the world-wide increase in the cost of fuel and petroleum
products which increases the variable component of VOCs
(the cost of crude in the international market jumped
from about US$1.30 per barrel in 1970 to over US$11.50
per barrel in 1976).
The net effects of the more up-to-date user cost savings and significantly
higher than anticipated traffic volumes on the project roads has dampened
the effects of higher than expected costs for civil works.
4.05      The reliability of traffic data was already questioned in the com-
pletion report on the Second Highway Project (1977); caution in accepting
traffic data is still warranted because DNER's new traffic counting procedures
and equipment have not yet been fully implemented and installed. The available
data reflect the rapid growth of the Brazilian economy between 1972 and 1975,
and also the slower growth of it in 1976/77. Since traffic data for the
appraisal of both projects were taken from the Master Plans which were com-
pleted around 1970 (based on traffic growth between 1965 and 1969), the
appraisal mission could not foresee these developments. The adjustments that
would have been necessary to the design standards of the roads to take into
account the higher traffic volumes would have been minimal; despite the
somewhat higher costs for the pavements the rates of return for all the roads
would still have been more than adequate to justify the execution of the
projects.
4.06      Because the roads were designed for lower than actual traffic
volumes and loads, increased maintenance costs may be incurred and perhaps
earlier than anticipated pavement strengthening may be necessary. The recently
approved Sixth Highway Project is oriented to assist DNER in rehabilitating
federal highways and to set up and implement a pavement management system to
monitor pavement conditions and carry out timely strengthening.
V. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01      The implementation and control of the projects were extensively dis-
cussed and agreed upon during the preparation stages; DNER was the executing
agency for contracting and supervision of works on federal highways and the
state DERs were responsible for works on state highways. As mentioned earlier,
INGEROUTE assisted DNER in coordination of supervision activities. INGEROUTE's
advice and collaboration with DNER has had a positive impact on improving the
level of technical know-how of DNER staff and today DNER has sufficient depth
of expertise to manage extensive construction programs. INGEROUTE's ser-vices
are continuing on a reduced scale under the ongoing Fifth Highway Project.



- 60 -
5.02      Although the projects in themselves did not require institutional
changes, structural changes based on the recommendations of earlier studies
were implemented during the project period. Decrees dated September 24 and
March 23, 1971 (Nos. 74,606 and 68,423) which established the Directorate
of Operations were amended in 1974 to subsidivide it into more compact
directorates: traffic, transportation and maintenance. The explicit delinea-
tion of functions ameliorated some of the shortcomings described in detail in
the completion report of the Second Highway Project. That completion report
covered, inter alia, the institutional developments including the role of
DNER, the contracting and consulting services, delegation of maintenance of
federal highways to state DER and regulation of axle loads.
5.03      Based on the experience acquired during these projects, DNER has
required consultants to install field laboratories where the volume of work
justifies their installation so that proper work control can be exercised
in an expeditious manner. This is being carried out on all contracts under
the Fifth Highway Project.
VI. ROLE OF THE BANK
6.01      The Bank was constructively involved in the projects from their
inception as elements of the Transport Study. This involvement continued, as
with previous projects, through the reorganization and strengthening of the
highway sector administration to the encouragement and support of the federal
and state Governments and their executing agencies, DNER and the state DERs,
in the utilization of Brazilian consultants and construction contractors. The
Bank's representatives from both Programs and Projects Departments were able
to work effectively and productively with their Brazilian counterparts.
6.02      The Bank's acceptance of Brazil's demonstrated competence for the
administration, management and execution of large-scale and technically com-
plex highway projects in the diverse regions making up the country was the
key to the eventual success of the Third and Fourth Highway Projects.
The Bank's insistence on enforcement of modern engineering and construction is
looked upon as a landmark in Brazilian highway engineering development.
6.03      Experience gained through these and earlier projects has impressed
upon the Bank that high traffic growth rates are indeed a fact of life in
Brazil and that although some tapering off can be expected, the favorable
development prospects in the country indicate that traffic projections for
future projects should reflect the historic trends. All too often conserva-
tive traffic estimates have been responsible for underdesigning pavements,
the maintenance and rehabilitation implications of which have only been fully
realized recently. More realistic traffic estimates especially of the heavy
commercial vehicle growth are needed to alleviate the problems of maintaining
at great expense deteriorating roads which carry more traffic than allowed
for in the original designs. Heavy traffic on some sections of the project
roads have made strengthening necessary. The recently approved Sixth Highway



- 61 -
Project (Loan 1557) has brought into focus the maintenance and rehabilitation
needs of the federal and state networks as well as the updating of pavement
design criteria to reflect Brazilian conditions and to take into account
actual traffic loads and volumes.
6.04      The Bank's biggest contribution, as well as the most successful,
has been in the institution building for the execution of nearly all aspects
of highway design, construction, maintenance and administration.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The Third and Fourth Highway Projects no doubt can be considered
successful despite cost overruns. The comparatively lower weighted rate of
return of the Fourth project (29%) compared with the Third (45%) is largely
due to the cost increase on one highway, the engineering for which was less
than satisfactory and had to be revised in the context of field conditions
encountered during execution of the works and exceptionally hot weather.
7.02      Similarly, DNER's capability to administer and supervise large and
complex contracts located in diverse geologic, geographic and economic regions
of Brazil has been reaffirmed, as have improvements in the ability of state
DERs to undertake responsibility for significant civil works and technical
studies. Evidence of these is reflected in the professional performance
of DNER and the DERs in subsequent Bank-financed projects dealing not only
with civil works but also with highway maintenance and rehabilitation.
7.03      All feasibility and engineering studies included in the Third
Project were accomplished successfully; some were used in the Fifth Highway
Project.
7.04      Beside the reasons outlined previously, a significant factor
responsible for cost escalations was inflation and the impact of the 1973-74
petroleum crisis which led to higher costs of civil works and studies.
7.05      From an economic point of view, the projects appear successful in
absolute terms as well as relative terms vis-a-vis the appraisal. Conserva-
tive traffic projections and vehicle operating costs savings were used in
the appraisal, both of which were surpassed by actual traffic and road user
savings. It would appear that the timing for many of the project roads may
have been somewhat late; upgrading or improvements earlier may have been
economically justified but the results of the Survey were late in being
published and because of the level of aggregation used in the Survey, the
estimates of returns were conservative.
7.06      Finally, the planned improvements in rural transportation under
the two projects have injected new stimuli into the development of the regions
concerned; evidence of which can be seen in the socio-economic changes in
the lives of once isolated communities now experiencing the benefits, and



- 62 -
unfortunately some of the ills of modern technology and new ways of life. One
example of these dramatic changes is Porangatu which was just a dot on the map
of Parana not many years ago prior to the paving of BR-153/PR, a section of
which was included in the Third Highway Project. Its only link to the outside
world consisted of a dusty road connecting its potentially rich hinterland to
the distant farm colony in Ceres. Porangatu today has a sizeable urban and
"sub-urban" community, a hospital, a booming downtown full of new buildings
and a brand new airport. Jatai and Rio Verde, two little farming towns in the
state of Goias have been transformed into bustling cities with the construction
of BR-060. A flourishing tourist trade, new hotels, restaurants, repair shops
and farm equipment dealers to service the agricultural boom, influx of new
residents, a thriving construction industry which is unable to satisfy demand
for new and better housing, pressures on municipal services and the increasing
local costs of living all attest to a new dynamism and economic growth. Job
opportunities are growing. Business is expanding. Overall, a new prosperity
has arrived in the zones of influence of the roads.
