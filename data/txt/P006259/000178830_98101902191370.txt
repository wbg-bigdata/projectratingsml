INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION O THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO BRAZIL FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Brazil for the equivalent of US$51.0 million to help finance a project for
highway construction. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including four
years of grace, with interest at t percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Brazil" (WH-210a), dated November 30, 1971, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on December 2, 1971. The summary and conclusions of that report and
a country data sheet are attached as Annex II. The economic report describes
Brazil's remarkable economic growth over the past several years and the po-
licies which the Government has followed in achieving that performance.   The
net external capital inflow associated with the rapid growth was large, amount-
ing during 1968-70 to US$2.8 billion of which US$1.65 billion consisted of
financial credits with maturities of one to four years. The role of medium
and long-term finance was important; development agencies contributed US$690
million net (IDB, US$312 million; AID, US$278 million; and IBRD US$98 million),
while suppliers' credits, including loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank,
totalled about US$200 million. Direct investments amounted to US$270 million.
3.        The economic report points out that continuation of rapid growth in
the 1970's will require substantial increases in medium and long-term external
capital inflows. Growth in the 1968-70 period was facilitated by the existence
of considerable excess production capacity, now almost entirely in use. The
capital and intermediate goods imports associated with capacity expansion can
be expected to enlarge Brazil's external resource gap even if exports rise by
as much as 11 percent in real terms as projected in the economic report. At
the same time, there is good prospect that medium and long-term external
capital will be fotheoming in larger volumwe than in the recent past; private
equipment procurement provides external suppliers with a dynamic market and
the Government has made considerable progress in articulating its investment
needs in the form of projects suitable for external financing. However,
Brazil's gross external capital requirements are greater than the foreign
exchange component of such projects. While the capital investment needed to
support Brazil's economic growth targets is substantial, the import needs of
most public investment projects are relatively low, reflecting the ability of
Brazil's highly developed capital goods industry to compete successfully under
international competitive bidding. 'Hence, an apprecinble part of foreign
financing must be available to cover local expenditures.



-2-
4.        A new general economic mission will arrive in Brazil in mid-
August. In the meantime preliminary evaluation of events subsequent to
the latest economic report confirms the diagnosis contained in that report.
In 1971, real GDP grew by more than 11 percent, with both agriculture and
industry performing well. Brazil is experiencing a major up.sl'rge in invest-
ment, supported by both increased domestic savings and foreign capital
inflow. Imports increased by 29 percent with the increase concentrated
in intermediate and capital goods consumed by industry. Exports increased
by 5 percent in 1971, reflecting a fall in the share of traditional agri-
cultural products (coffee, cotton, cacao and sugar) but a major increase
(32 percent) in exports of manufactured goods. This represents a con-
tinuation of the rapid and successful process of diversification of
Brazil's exports. The pace of economic growth has continued in the first
few months of 1972, with over-all exports resuming a stronger upward trend.
5.        Brazil's external debt increased by US$1.4 billion during 1971 to
a year-end figure of US$6.6 billion, of which more than two-fifths consisted
of financial credits. However, toward the end of the year the Government
imposed comprehensive controls on resort to financial credit designed to
prevent short-term credits from being used as a substitute for long-term
capital. Thus far, in 1972 the rise in the total of such credits has been
matched by an increase in foreign reserves, which are now equivalent to about
US$2.5 billion or approximately six months' imports of goods and non-factor
services. Service of Brazil's external debt, exclusive of the financial
credits, amounted to about 13 percent of exchange earnings in 1971. Although
external debt management is one of the more critical issues confronting the
Government at high rates of growth, Brazil should be able to service the
increasing debt needed to support its growth targets as long as the present
high quality of economic management is sustained.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
6.        By June 30, 1972, Brazil had received 42 loans from the Bank
amounting to US$1,432.6 million (net of cancellations).   Since July 1, the
Bank has made an additional loan of US$6.7 million for the Alto Turi Land
Settlement project. Annex I gives a summary statement of loans and credits
as of June 30, 1972. Of the loans declared effective, 22 have not been fully
disbursed, and of those, disbursement of 12 was behind schedule at the end
of 1971. However, the pace of disbursements has accelerated. During FY65
to FY69 disbursements averaged only US$10 million per year, increasing to
US$66 million in FY70, US$75 million in FY71, and US$137 million in FY72.
The disbursement rate should continue to accelerate during the next few years.
Comments on the implementation of individual projects are in Annex I.
7.        Brazil is the country with the largest share of IFC's commitments.
Since 1957, IFC has made 18 commitments in Brazil, totalling US$89.4 million,
of which US$5.4 million has been repaid, US$30.1 million sold and US$1.5 million
cancelled. Of the balance of US$52.4 million, US$37.0 million represents loans
and US$15.4 million equity. A summary of IF`'s investments' is also given in
Annex I.



-3-
8.        Bank lending to Brazil was very active in FY72, as seven loans
totaling US$437 million were approved.  So far, in FY73 one loan amounting
to US$6.7 million, for agricultural settlement in Northeast Brazil, has
been approved. A loan for a credit program to assist construction of
grain stores should be ready for presentation to the Executive Directors
within a few weeks. Subject to satisfactory completion of the first
livestock project (Loan 516-BR, see Annex I), we also expect to present an
additional livestock project within the next several months. We are also
appraising the investment program of Light, S.A., the principal distributor
of electric power in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, with a view to a loan
that would assist the comparn to raise additional finance in the external
capital market.
9.        In lending to Brazil, the Bank is responding to Brazil's demon-
strated ability to use increasing amounts of external capital that enables
it to sustain a high rate of economic growth. In selecting sectors and
projects for lending, the Bank seeks to fill important development needs.
In the first place, the Bank can help Brazil to increase its foreign
capital inflow by providing Bank loans to sectors where bilateral financing
is not available or where the Bank's participation will help Brazil obtain
additional bilateral financing. The proposed loan for highways is an
example of the former, while the Bank's recent and projected lending for
both steel and electric energy projects is an example of the latter. In
the second place, the Bank is hoping to direct its lending towards areas
in which it can support the Government's efforts to strengthen institutions
and pursue sound economic policies. Such is the case with regard to
investment planning and finance in the power, water supply and transport
sectors, including the present case of highways. Thirdly, the Bank is
stressing the selection of projects which will help Brazil overcome the
most critical constraint on economic growth, namely the balance of payments.
This means support of export-oriented investments such as the MBR iron ore
project or of import. substituting industry where, as in the case of steel,
Brazil has a significant comparative advantage.  Fourthly, in selecting
projects for financing, a concerted effort is being made to identify projects
that will foster the growth of the less developed parts of Brazil, particular-
ly the Northeast, and reduce regional and other income disparities. The
recently approved Alto Turi Land Settlement project is an example of this.
10.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's fourth for highway construc-
tion in Brazil-. It would be the ninth loan for development of the transport
sector -- a loan for highway equipment was made in 1953, loans for railway
projects were made in 1952, 1953 and 1971 and a port loan was made in 1971.
The construction to be financed is part of the large volume of road invest-
ment, yielding a high economic return, which was identified in studies
under the 1965-70 Transport Survey and prepared as part of the Second High-
way project. In 1971 the Government approached the Bank to provide a Third
Highway Joan of US$140 million. The Brazilians were encouraged to explore
the interest of bilateral sources -- particularly Japan and Germany -- in



-4-
providing part of the external finance required for highway investment.
During March and May of this year the Finance Minister discussed the
matter with the Japanese and German authorities, In the meantime, the
Bank went ahead with the reduced Third Highway loan of US$89 million,
which was approved by the Executive Directors on March 14, 1972. However,
it has now become apparent that, while the Germans and Japanese are not
unsympathetic, and the door may have opened for s6me future non-tied
bilateral lending such as would be needed in highway financing in Brazil,
neither country is able to make such financing available this year.
Therefore, to avoid a delay in the project (which is ready to start),
the Brazilians requested that the Bank consider a Fourth Highway loan,
as now proposed.
11.       The project was appraised, together with the Third Highway
project, by Bank missions which visited Brazil in June/July 1971 and in
December 1971. Negotiations took place June 22-23, 1972. The Govern-
ment of Brazil was represented by a negotiating team headed by Mr. F.
Magalhaes, Director of Planning at the Departamento Nacional de Estradas
de Rodagem (DNER), the Federal Highway Department.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
12.       Brazil, with an area of 8.5 million km2, is the fifth largest
country in the world.  Population density is low, at about 11 per km2 
but varies greatly by region, from 3,000 per km2 in the coastal regions
of the States of Guanabara and Sao Paulo to less than one per km2 in the
Amazon region. Potential for agricultural and industrial growth is large
due to the country's vast natural resources. In pursuing the goal of
rapid economic growth the Government has emphasized the need for trans-
port development to support growth of the productive sectors. Efficient
transport is needed to open up new lands and to move agricultural products
from the interior to coastal consumption areas and ports of export as well
as to move capital goods and manufactures in the opposite direction.
Transport Policy
13.       Bank association with Brazil's transport sector broadened in
1965 when, through a technical assistance grant of US$1.5 million, it
helped finance and supervise the first phase of a nationwide Transport
Survey.  This phase covered the railroads, coastal shipping, the ports
of Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Recife and highways in four states. A
second phase of the Survey, partly financed by UNDP and AID, with the
Bank as executing agency, covered highways in the remaining principal
states and was completed in 1970.



-5-
14.      In connection with both phases of the Survey, the Government
entered into Memoranda of Understanding with the Bank, recording the
steps it proposed to take to improve transport services. Prior to
the First Highway loan in 1968, the Government adopted a plan of action
summarizing its transport objectives with schedules for action on high-
ways, railways and ports. Prior to the Second Highway loan in 1970,
the Government prepared another plan of action outlining measures to
achieve further improvements. Implementation of these plans has varied
from mode to mode. 'Progress has been particularly satisfactory in the
case of highways, where the DNER and a number of state highway depart-
ments (DERs) have been reorganized. Maintenance and construction are
being gradually delegated to the DERs, and DNER's plann'ring capacity
and contract supervision methods have been substantially improved.
15.       In the railways and'ports progress has been considerable, though
less satisfactory so far than'in the case'of highways. The Brazilian
railway network' is comprised of 30,000 route km, of which about
25,000 Ion are operated by a federal company, Rede Ferroviaria Federal
(RFFSA), and about 5,000 km by a Sao Paulo state company, Ferrovia Paulista
(FEPASA), which was created in 1971 as a merger of five independent rail-
ways into a more viable single unit. In addition, another line is owned
and operated by a Government mining company, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce
(CVRD), mainly for iron ore traffic. While passenger traffic has declined
substantially in the last decade, total railway freight traffic increased
from 13 billion ton/km in 1961 to about 32 billion ton/km in 1971 (nearly
half of the latter carried by CVRD), and freight traffic is expected to
grow by at least 50 percent in the next five years. Although RFFSA has
succeeded in reducing its operating ratio substantially between 1963 and
1971, and the separate railways in Sao Paulo have been merged into a single
Sao Paulo state enterprise, important issues remain. RFFSA was able to
reduce its annual deficit (in 1971 dollar equivalents) from about US$317
million in 1963 to about US$174 million in 1966, but has made little further
progress since then, and its financial situation remains one of the few weak
elements in federal government finances. Moreover, railway tariffs do not
reflect economic costs, and this may distort the distribution of traffic
between modes. Railway service is still inefficient. In the long run,
substantial economies could be obtained by merging the federal and Sao Paulo
systems. In general, costs could be reduced by rationalizing the route
system, by mechanizing track maintenance and freight handling, and by
centralized workshops. The railways are now preparing a revised simplified
tariff, designed to reflect costs. We expect to receive soon from RFFSA,
about a half year behind schedule, a new railway rehabilitation and invest-
ment program which the enterprise agreed to send to the Bank under the loan
made last year (Loanr 786-BR, MBR project). The ability of the Brazilian
authorities to formulate a realistic program will be important in
determining the magnitude of further financial support for the transport
sector.



-6-
16.       Coastal and river freight transport by public and private
carriers increased between 1961 and 1970, from about 15 to 22 billion
tbn/km, mostly due to increasing crude oil and petroleum products
traffic, although passenger traffic remained negligible. The share
of shipping in total freight movements decreased from 20 to 12 percent
between 1961 and 197G. Administration of ports within the Ministry of
Transport is the responsibility of the National Department of Ports
and WJaterways (DNPVN), which is over-centralized and lacks flexibility.
In conjunction with the investment program at Santos port which is being
assisted by the 1971 Bank Loan (756-BR), the Government has embarked on
a program to decentralize and reorganize the administration of the major
ports -- specifically, to improve management, accounting and planning.
Once improvements are effectively implemented at Santos, the new tech-
niques will be introduced in other Brazilian ports. We hope to be able
to give support to these reforms through a series of loans; the next
would assist improvement in the port of Recife.
17.       Air transport in Brazil has been characterized in recent years
by mergers and closures among Brazilian airlines. Many uneconomic
domestic feeder services have been cut back as the expanding road net-
work permitted cheaper vehicle travel. This and substantial fare increases
were responsible for the decline of total current domestic air travel to
a level lower than ten years ago.
18.       A Bank transport sector review mission recently visited Brazil
to analyze recent developments in the transport sector, with particular
reference to areas such as coastal shipping and the operation of the
road transport industry where our knowledge has been somewhat sparse in
the past. The mission paid special attention to transport coordination
and planning.
Transport Coordination
19.       An agency now known as Grupo de Estudos para Integracao da
Politica de Transportes (GEIPOT) was established in 1965 to coordinate
and supervise the Transport Survey, and in 1969 it was made a permanent
agency within the Ministry of Transport with responsibility for advising
on transport policy and coordination. Although GEIPOT subsequently
carried out or commissioned various studies, insufficient attention has
been paid so far to the crucial task of coordinating transport, especially
transport investments; this task is particularly important since cases
still occur in which funds are committed for investments in both road and
.rail, serving the same area, before the need for improvements.to both
modes has been demonstrated. Although in recent years projects have been
better prepared and planned by the modal agencies than formerly, there



-7-
has been a tendency to study proposed investments in one mode without
due regard to improvements proposed for other modes, and investment
criteria applied by different agencies are often incompatible.
20.       In January 1972, prior to the presentation of the Third High-
way project to the Executive Directors, the Minister of Transport wrote
to the Bank confirming his intention to use GEIPOT as the agency for
advising him on improved coQrdination of investments, pricing policies
and regulations for the various modes, with the broad objective of
minimizing the total cost of transport to the Brazilian economy. Since
then, several steps have been taken reflecting the Government's interest
in strengthening GEIPOT and improving transport coordination. A pro-
gramming and budgeting division has been created in GEIPOT to develop
competence in the review of the Ministry's annual and tri-annual invest-
ment plans. The division intends to initiate specific closely focused
studies of proposed investment where there are actual and potential
conflicts between modes, thus correcting a major deficiency in present
practice. In June 1972, the former head of the well-organized Planning
Division of DNER, became the new Superintendent of GEIPOT. The previous
GEIPOT Superintendent became President of RFFSA.
The Highway Sector
21.       Brazil has in all about a million kilometers of road.  The
federal and state systems total about 170,000 km., of which about 50,000
km are paved.
22.       Road freight traffic grew by about 11 percent per year during
the sixties and increased its share of total freight movement from about
62 percent in 1961 to 69 percent in 1970. For the same period, the road
share of passenger traffic rose from 74 percent to 91 percent. Rapid
growth of road traffic should continue for some time.
23.       The total vehicle fleet in 1970 was estimated at 3.5 million
with 83 percent cars and pickups, 2 percent buses and 15 percent trucks.
Growth of the vehicle fleet has average 13 percent per year. Domestic
production provides practically all vehicle needs and there is ample
productive capacity for future growth.
Highway Administration
2b.       The DNER, an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Transport,
administers the national highway network. Each of the 22 states has a
DER responsible for state highways.  The Plans of action submitted by
the Government prior to the First and Second Highway Construction loans
set forth objectives regarding rtorganization of highways administration.
Considerable progress has been achieved. DNER is introducing a new
administrative framework, a number of DERs have been and are being



-8-
reorganized and other DERs will follow. In order to avoid over-centrali-
zation and to permit DNER to concentrate on planning and overall supervision,
DNER's maintenance and construction responsibilities are gradually being
transferred to state DERs on the basis of pilot regions.
25.       DNER is establishing a training center for middle and upper
level highway personnel. While most of the training will be provided
by Brazilians, DNER will secure the assistance of international experts
in fields where Brazilian expertise is not yet adequate. Financing for
this assistance was included in the Third Highway loan (813-BR).
Highway Engineering
26.       Highway engineering practices have improved considerably during
the past few years. During the Transport Survey new standards and methods
were introduced and systematic economic evaluation of projects was started.
Brazilian consulting firms, using the new techniques, have now established
themselves in most major states. While the First Highway project was
designed and supervised by foreign consultants, nearly all engineering
for the Second and Third Highway projects was carried out by Brazilian
engineers. The experience with these firms has been generally satisfactory.
27.       Regulations governing motor vehicle weight and dimensions are
satisfactory, and enforcement is improving on federal roads but is still
unsatisfactory on state roads, except in Sao Paulo. The loan documents
provide that the Government will continue to enforce weight regulations
and the Government has presented a satisfactory program for the installa-
tion of new weighing stations.
Highway Construction and Maintenance
28.       Improvement of the quality of construction and supervision has
been an important problem. Poor construction supervision has in the
past resulted in poor quality work; long delayed payments to contractors
made it impossible for DNER to enforce work schedules. Such practices
still occasionally occur but DNER is now making good progress in enforcing
proper methods of construction on all its highways. Consultants -- nearly
all Brazilian - are now being employed for construction supervision, and
a special effort is being made to establish proper controls for construc-
tion programs.
29.       International competitive bidding under the past Bank loans has
demonstrated that the Brazilian construction industry is competitive.
Local firms are carrying out about US$600 million worth of highway construc-
tion per year. The highway programs presently being financed by the Bank,
including the program to be financed by the proposed fourth loan, would
at their peak add about 20 percent to this volume of work, an increase
which would be within the capacity of the Brazilian construction industry.



-9-
30.       DNER has overall responsibility for the federal network and
is gradually delegating maintenance of federal roads to those states
which show capability to maintain and police their networks. Maintenance
has improved considerably in recent years, partly as a result of the
acquisition by several states of new equipment financed by USAID. During
the Transport Survey, consultants carried out maintenance studies in 18
states and recommended improvements.
Employment
31.       Road construction and maintenance are large employers of labor.
A recent survey by the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Planning
(IPEA) showed that the mix of labor and capital in road work varies by region.
The most labor-intensive methods are found in the Northeast where labor is
relatively plentiful and cheap; the least labor-intensive methods are found
in the Southeast where labor is scarce and expensive due to alternative
employment opportunities. This survey showed that in 1969 half a million
workers were directly employed in road construction and maintenance, equiva-
lent to about 20 percent of total employment in manufacturing industries. In
addition, a large but undetermined number of jobs are generated as a result
of road construction, especially in newly opened up areas where the Govern-
ment has initiated colonization programs to ease the unemployment problems
of the drought-affected areas of the Northeast. It was estimated by the IPFEA
study that Bank-financed highway projects in Brazil would provide direct
employment for about 146,000 workers between 1970 and 1973.
Highway Financing and Planning
32.       There are two main road user taxes in Brazil: a tax on gasoline
(the IUCL) and an annual charge on the assessed value of vehicles (the
Uniform Road Tax). Eighty percent of the proceeds from the IUCL and all
of those from the Road Tax are earmarked for federal and state highway
maintenance and construction. These and other road user revenues cover about
70 percent of total expenditures on highways (including maintenance, admin-
istration and construction), and substantially exceed the costs of maintenance
and administration alone.
33.       The basis for all highway investments is the 25-year National
Transport Plan, originally published in 1964. This plan is updated
periodically. The highway part was most recently revised in 1969 at
which time the conclusions of the Transport Survey were incorporated in it.
During the last four years priority has been given to paving the existing
main network and to building low-standard roads to open new areas for
exploration and settlement, particularly in the Amazon region. In earlier
years special attention, both- ir Bank and non-Bank investment programs,
was paid to the upgrading of federal highways in the Northeast,



- 10 -
and more roads are under study in the Third Highway project which should
merit future Bank financing. In this project, however, relatively little
of the investment will be in the Northeast. An exception is the northern
access highway to the important city of Salvador (Bahia).
34.       ENER uses economic criteria to prepare its investment programs;
its planning division has been strengthened and includes the services of
experts financed under the Second and Third Highway projects. The Govern-
ment has given assurances that it will continue -to improve'datta collection
to assure reliable inputs for highway planning.
Progress Under the Previous Highway Loans
35.       Progress on the last three Bank highway projects is good. The
first (Loan 567-BR, October 1968, US$26 million) is virtually completed
and at costs slightly below estimates. The second (Loan 676-BR, May 1970,
US$100 million) was about 60 percent complete at April 30, 1972, and is
expected to be completed on schedule and within cost estimates. Construc-
tion contracts have been awarded for all 52 sections in the third project
(Loan 813-BR, April 1972, US$89 million); the total of these awards is
US$155 million equivalent, about the same as the appraisal estimate. All
contracts were awarded to Brazilian firms. Construction work on the
third project should begin, on schedule, in September 1972; arrangements
for the remainder of the project are underway -- consultants are being
selected for feasibility studies and the Highway Department's proposal
for the new Highway Training Center has been received and is being reviewed
in the Bank.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Third Highway Construction
Project, Brazil" (PTR-105a), dated February 29, 1972, was distributed in
connection with Loan 813-BR and is being redistributed. It appraises not
only the project financed under the Third Highway loan (Group A in the
Appraisal Report) but also the project now proposed for financing (Group B).
The proposed project consists of:
a) The construction and paving of a total of 681 km of national
and state highways in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais,
Espirito Santo, Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul
(the roads are described in greater detail in Annex III); and
b) Consulting services for supervision of this work.



Highway for Construction
37.       In terms of road length, about 52 percent of the roads included
in the project for construction or improvement are located in the Southeast
and 46 percent in the South, regions where growing agricultural production
is imposing heavy demands on the transport system. Two percent are located
in the Northeast.
Consulting Services
38.       Detailed engineering of the project roads was completed satis-
factorily under the Second Highway project. All engineering was by
Brazilian consultants except for the northern access to Salvador (Highway
BR-324) for which a Brazilian-German joint venture was employed. The
Government has agreed that the same consultants, who are competent for the
work, will supervise construction, and signature of their contracts will
be a condition for loan effectiveness.
Cost Estimates
39.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$128.1 million
equivalent, including allowances for quantity and price contingencies, and
is summarized as follows:
(US$ millions)
Local    Foreign     Total

40.       Local costs are estimated at about US$112.5 million equivalent
and foreign costs at about US$15.6 miUion or about 12 percent of the
total. The Federal and State Governments would provide US$77.1 million
equivalent (60 percent) of the financing for the project, and the Bank
US$51.0 million (40 percent). Thus, the loan would finance about US$35.4
million equivalent of local expenditures, which is justified in light of
Brazil's overall capital requirements (see paragraph 3). In other cases
involving local expenditure financing in Brazil, Bank loans have covered
about 40 percent of total project costs (e.g., livestock, land settlement
and recent highway projects, each of which had a foreign exchange component
of roughly 20 percent or less).
Execution
41.       The execution of the project will follow the pattern set in
previous highway projects. The DNER will be responsible for national
highways (except for BR-267 for which responsibility has been delegated
to the DER of the State of Minas Gerais) and various DERs for correspond-
ing state highways. Project agreements have been negotiated between the
Bank and the four states responsible for execution of project roads.
These agreements contain, among other points, undertakings by the states
relating to: a) the reorganization of the state highway departments,
b) the enforcement of weight regulations on state roads, and c) the main-
tenance of state and delegated national roads. Satisfactory conclusion
of subsidiary agreements between DNER and the DERs concerned will be a
condition of loan effectiveness.
42.       Contracts for construction will be let after international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. The
Government prequalified contractors for the Fourth Highway project at
the same time as for the Third Highway project (Loan 813-BR). Bids
were requested in April 1972 and received in June 1972; they are now
being evaluated, and awards are likely to be within or close to appraisal
estimates. Awards are expected to be made in August 1972. Construction
is expected to start before the end of 1972 and is planned to be completed
in 24 months.
43.       For contract purposes, construction works in the project have
been divided into 24 lots. Sizes of contracts for road works will range
from US$1.6 million to US$8.1 million, and individual bridge contracts from
US$0.4 million to US$0.7 million.  To take advantage of economies of scale
open to larger contractors and at the same time to allow smaller firms
to compete, construction lots were packaged, where possible, to enable
prequaliiied firms to bid on packages and/or on single lots. There are
six such packages ranging from US$7.5 million to US$15.9 million.
Disbursement
44.       DNER, on behalf of the Federal Government, will administer a
revolving fund, similar to that satisfactorily used in previous highway
projects for payments to contractors and consultants. The costs of the
project will be financed from that fund, and the states will reimburse



- 13 -
amounts related to expenditures on state highways. The revolving fund
will be replenished with withdrawals from the Bank loan account, the
state reimbursements, and the federal contributions. The Government
has agreed to make deposits into the revolving fund as required, so
that at the beginning of each calendar month the balance will cover
one month of forward project costs, in accordance with work schedules.
Establishment of the revolving fund with an initial deposit of about
US$1.2 million equivalent would be a condition for loan effectiveness.
Economic Evaluation
45.       The roads proposed for construction were selected from the
priority listings in the Master Plans prepared under the Transport
Survey. Consultants studied alternative alignments wherever warranted,
and final selection was based on economic considerations.
46.       The economic evaluation set forth in the Appraisal Report
(Table 21) has, in general, been confirmed by a recent mission.  The
benefits resulting from the proposed road works will give rates of
economic return ranging from 13 percent to 34 percent and for the
project as a whole the rate of economic return is 17 percent. Most
of the quantified benefits are derived from road user savings on nor-
mal and diverted traffic and from traffic generation. In the case of
sections with heavy traffic, benefits were also derived from reduction
in congestion as well as time savings reflected in the wages of drivers
of commercial vehicles and travellers on business trips. Other quanti-
fiable benefits accrue from savings in road maintenance costs.
47.       A number of benefits have not been included in the calculations
because they are difficult to quantify. These include reductions in non-
business travel time, lowering of inventory costs and less spoilage of
fresh fruits and vegetables.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Federative
Republic of Brazil, the draft Project Agreements between the Bank and
the four participating states, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section'4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The major features of these
agreements have already been described in this report.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.



- 14 -
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
There are now 22 effective Bank loans under disbursement and
these are proceeding without significant problems except for the following:
Loan No.
404     The Xavantes hydroelectric project was completed in early 1971,
(after a delay of about eighteen months) except for the instal-
lation of equipment for an associated transmission line. Order-
ing of this equipment was very delayed, and the loan is not now
expected to be fully disbursed until December 31, 1973, four
years after the initial closing date.
516     After initial delays due to marketing and organizational diffi-
culties, the livestock credit program has been proceeding at a
satisfactory rate. However, some problems-have recently arisen
with respect to the calculation of interest on'indexed principal
amounts during the grace period. Discussions are being held with
the Government with a view to agreeing upon a mutually satisfactory
system of indexing which would permit the disbursement of'this loan
to proceed.
656     The Banco do Nordeste has committed this loan more slowly than
originally expected, mainly because of the availability of sub-
sidized capital (the so-called 34/18 funds) from other sources
to industrial companies in the Northeast area of Brazil. Since
the Government has recently reallocated 50 percent of the 34/18
funds to investments in infrastructure and agriculture, demand
through BNB for the Bank loan may increase as alternative'-sources
of finance become scarcer.
677     The Marimbondo hydroelectric project was delayed by foundation
difficulties which required deeper powerhouse- excavations than
were originally planned. The,problem has been solved, -but the
project is now slightly behind schedule. The cost estimates for
the project have increased, and the method of financing the cost
overrun is being discussed with the borrower.
755     Part of the school construction project is likely to be delayed
as a result of a review by the Government of the architectural
features of several planned schools and of delays in engaging
.consulting architects. A new schedule is under discussion.
786     Delays of about 6 months have occurred in awarding the contracts
for constructing the new railway link for the ME iron ore mine,
due to engineering problems encountered and inadequate project
management by the Federal Railways. Work has now commenced on
site by 6 contractors, and some of the lost time is being regained.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS-
Output and Expenditure
1.        In 1970 the Brazilian economy is estimated to have grown by 9.5
percent, after having grown by 9.0 percent in 1969 and 9.3 percent in 1968.
These growth rates are reminiscent of the rapid pace of growth sustained by
Brazil in the 1950s. Entirely different, however, is the underlying
economic strategy pursued in recent years by the Brazilian Government.
Previous rapid growth rates were generated by import substituting industrial-
ization achieved within the confines of high tariff barriers. Needed infra-
structure and partial absorption of the labor surplus left by capital intensive
industrial development were financed largely by inflationary currency emission.
Accumulation of coffee surpluses was also a powerful inflation factor. Rapidly
accelerating inflation and deepening distortions in the relative prices of key
factirs -- such as foreign exchange, public utilities, basic intermediate goods
(e.g., steel), housing and credit -- yielded a succession of balance of pay-
ments crises in the early 1960s and brought economic growth to a near halt
in 1963 when output grew by 1.5 percent and per capita domestic product
declined by about 1.2 percent.
2.        By 1964, therefore, the Government was forced to confront the task
of reducing inflation to tolerable levels, correcting relative price distor-
tions and restoring order in Brazil's external accounts before economic
growth could be resumed. Thus, during the mid-1960s, government economic
policy concentrated on the following:
(a) eliminating excess demand through reduction of fiscal deficits,
deceleration of monetary expansion and subjection first of
wages and later of profits to direct control;
(b) adjusting upwards to equilibrium key factor prices which had
lagged behind inflation in the past;
(c) effecting a number of institutional reforms -- such as
creation of a Central Bank, rationalization of the tax
system, elimination of compulsory agricultural marketing
mechanisms and price maxima, and rehabilitation of internal
sources of investment finance -- necessary in order that
economic growth be resumed;
(d)  creating a number of automatic price adjustment mechanisms --
e.g., the flexible exchange rate policy, and monetary
correction of financial instruments and rentals -- designed
to forestall tLie reemergence of price distortions; and
(e)  encouraging reduction of coftee production capacity, largelv
by reducing producers' prices rapidly in real terms, and by
providing special financing for coffee tree uprooting and
diversification of coffee lands to other crops.

During most of this interim period economic activity remained relatively
stagnant in part, because of the regressive income redistribution implicit
in the Government's stabilization program and of the difficulties confront-
ing entrepreneurs in adjusting to the new price environment being created
by the Government.
3.        By 1968, however, the annual rate of inflation had been reduced
from about 90 percent to about 25 percent while reforms had made possible
efficient allocation of resources and more progressive incomes policy within
the context of the latter inflationary rate. The turn-around of the coffee
cycle, resulting partly from diversification policies, made it possible to
dispose of a large volume of coffee stocks, with beneficial effects on
monetary management and on the capacity to import. Also needed, however,
was a market emphasis which could substitute the stimulus previously provided
by import substitution, the possibilities for which by then were nearly ex-
hausted. Thus, the Government turned to export promotion and added a system
of fiscal, credit and procedural export incentives to the promotional effect
already being had by its flexible exchange rate and liberal agricultural
pricing policies,
4.        The national accounts mirror this economic policy evolution.
Between 1950 and 1962 Brazil's import coefficient dropped from 16.5 to 8.1
percent of GDP. Discouraged -- inter alia -- by increasing exchange rate
over valuation the export coefficient declined more precipitously, from
19.5 to 6.6 percent of GDP, such that an external resource gap emerged
despite Brazil's emphasis on import substitution. Stimulated by incentives
for import substitution and benefitting also from the compulsory savings
effect of inflation, domestic savings increased steadily throughout 1950-62.
During the 1963-67 period, reflecting first near hyperinflation and then
the Government's stabilization program, the import coefficient declined
further while domestic investment and savings dropped sharply not only in
relation to GDP but even in absolute terms. Exports, on the other hand,
began to turn upwards in the mid-1960s. Subsequent to 1967, domestic in-
vestment and savings increased very rapidly, at average annual rates of 16
and 15 percent, respectively. The export growth which had begun in the mid-
1960s accelerated, averaging 14.5 percent annually in the 1968-70 period.
Starting from a very low base and reflecting demand for both investment goods
and industrial intermediates, imports have grown even more rapidly than
exports over the last three years, However, import growth has not been
smooth; reflecting progress toward full capacity utilization and the resulting
upsurge in investment demand, imports increased by 27 percent in 1970.
5.        Agriculture.  Generally, Brazilian agricultural output has responded
adequately to the impact on internal demand of population and income growth
as well as to effective opportunities for exploiting external markets. Need-
ed increments in agricultural output have been accomplished predominantly by
increased cultivation of Brazil's vast land area; moreover, continued expansion
of extensive cultivation -- particularly in western and-northern Brazil --
can serve as the main engine of agricultural growth for many years to come.

However, within this overall framework there are institutional and infra-
structural defects which have resulted in specific product supply shortfalls,
in turn limiting export earnings and exerting upward pressure on the internal
price level, and in regressive distribution of agricultural incomes.
/
6.        For agriculture in general the Government had adopted as a major
promotional device a system of increasingly adequate support prices. The
system is made effective largely through the allocation of production credits
in amounts based on the support price permitting the producer to sell under
favorable circumstances. The system's major defect is that most smallholders
are not reached by it. Another problem is the lack of coordination of exten-
sion and credit facilities. The Government is attempting to improve agricul-
ture production credit distribution and also to make available to farmers --
especially in poorer regions such as the Northeast -- additional credit
facilities for financing the purchase of technical inputs which will improve
productivity.
7.        The present inadequacy of transport, storage and terminal marketing
infrastructure results in product wastage as well as in seasonal gluts and
shortages. The Government has allocated large sums for investment in agri-
cultural infrastructure which should substantially alleviate this inadequacy
by the mid-1970s.
8.        Land tenure has adversely affected productivity and income distribu-
tion in certain regions, especially the Northeast. Although in plentiful
supply nationwide, the land factor endowment of those regions where tenure is
a problem indicates the need for substantial inter-regional agrarian resettle-
ment. To date the Government has made remarkably little progress in agrarian
reform. Programs undertaken in 1970 and 1971, which will allocate large
amounts of resources to the opening and settlement of new agricultural
frontiers and to the redistribution of underutilized land in the Northeast
itself promise to effect progress in redistributing agricultural production
factors and alleviating agrarian underemployment.
9.        Beef and coffee pose special problems for Brazil's agricultural
development. Until recently a combination of price maxima, compulsory
internal marketing mechanisms and maximum export quotas tended to prevent
expansion of livestock production and even to cause herd depletion. Subse-
quently, however, the Government withdrew from direct intervention in the
livestock industry, largely in order to promote beef exports. In 1970
there was some regression from this approach when rising world beef prices
exposed the cost-of-living index to more upward pressure than the Government
was willing to tolerate. The maximum export quota imposed on beef late in
1970 has already been relaxed, however, such that continued development of
the industry is not likely to be obstructed by government policies. Live-
stock development is crucially important because of high internal income
elasticity of demand for beef and of the role of beef as a major export
commodity.

10.       As part of its former policy of maximizing coffee export earnings
by keeping supply restricted and prices high, and in order to avoid the
inflationary impact of coffee stockpiling, the Government encouraged coffee
tree eradication in the mid 1960s. The reduction in production capacity
which resulted was exacerbated by:
(a) a severe frost which reduced the 1970 crop to half Its "normal"
level;
(b) the failure of progress in eliminating the subsidization of
internal coffee consumption to dampen internal demand; and
(c)  the-appearance of a coffee tree blight ("coffee rust") which
tended to decrease the profitability of coffee production
vis-a-vis alternative crops.
These developments reduced Brazilian coffee stocks to an amount equal to
less than one year's demand by end-1970. The Government is now attempting
to promote some recuperation of coffee production capacity by increasing
producers' prices rapidly in real terms. To some extent, this is being
financed by gradual elimination of the internal coffee consumers subsidy.
Especially with the very recent declines in world prices, however, the bulk
of the resource transfer required by rapidly increasing producers' prices
has been financed by cutting back the coffee contribution quota. The
1971-72 Brazilian coffee crop is expected to be large enough to cover total
demand. This short-term outlook together with the longer run impact of
current policies indicate that Brazil will be able to maintain its share
of the world coffee market and meet internal demand over the foreseeable
future.
11.       Industry.  During 1968-70 Brazilian industrial output grew at an
average annual rate of 12.5 percent. Spectacular growth of manufactured
exports -- while accounting for a moderate part of absolute increments in
industrial output -- has contributed greatly to the evolution of the sector
in the sense of exposing entrepreneurs to international efficiency standards,
helping to prepare them for the increasingly exigent nature of internal
demand. There also has been some additional import substitution as certain
capital and intermediate goods imports were replaced by Brazilian-made
products. There are wide variations in efficiency; the production of capital
goods, electrodomestics, certain intermediates (e.g., steel) and some automo-
tive products now requiring relatively low levels of protection while certain
other intermediates (e.g., chemicals), passenger automobiles and most "tradi-
tional industry" (e.g., textile) products continue to.require high levels-of
protection. The expansion of.manufactured exports has depended on government
subsidies in the form of tax credits averaging in value some 15 percent
of respective export prices. For most manufactured exports, however, these
subsidies can be regarded as an offset to protection and possibly to exchange
rate over-valuation carried over from previous years rather than as a
manifestation of inefficiency in export production. Real wage rates for
skilled labor appear to have increased considerably, and so has direct taxa-
tion. Nevertheless, industrial profitability also appears to have improved,



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 17
largely because of increased capacity utilization which is asserted to have
risen from 60 percent of installed capacity in 1967 to 85 percent in 1970.
While the sector as a whole is experiencing a definite investment boom the
Government has acknowledged and is attempting to remedy the following impedi-
ments to its development:
(a) inefficiency in certain subsectors; the Government plans to
induce greater efficiency by exposing such subsectors to
increased external competition through selective tariff
reform and by financing needed reorganization and re-equipment,
particularly of the textile, shoe, food processing and chemical
industries;
(b) under-capacity in strategic subsectors; the Government is
setting in motion major expansion plans in the steel,
petroleum and petrochemical subsectors;
(c) shortage of skilled labor; programs to expand vocational train-
ing facilities may alleviate this problem but additional
efforts, such as subsidization of on-the-job training may be
required; and
(d) industrial financing; while much has been done to expand and
reasonably price internal sources of industrial finance,
additional improvement of facilities for underwriting share
and debenture emissions is urgently required.
12.       Population and Employment.   Preliminary 1970 census data indicate
that Brazil's population increased at a 2.88 percent annual pace during the
1960s as compared to 3.04 percent during the previous decade. As of September
1970 Brazil's population totalled 93.2 million persons. Urban population
growth is proceeding at a 4.4 percent annual rate. Annual labor force growth
can be estimated at 2.8 percent or approximately 840,000 persons per year.
13.       One of the most significant results of recent rapid economic growth
has been reduction of unemployment and underemployment. Compared to 588,000
in 1968 the number of jobs created in 1969 probably ranged between 840,000
and 990,000 and, in 1970, between 950,000 and 1,100,000, such that over the
last two years job creation appears to have been well in excess of labor force
growth. These employment creation estimates are supported by sample household
survey data covering most of the country which indicate a decline in the over
unemployment rate from 3.7 percent as of the first quarter 1968 to 2.4 percent
as of the first quarter 1970. In Brazil, however, underemployment is a far
more serious aspect of labor force utilization than unemployment. Thus, it
is especially significant that the household survey data also show the number
of employed persons working 40 hours per week or more to have risen from 74
to 79 percent of the total. Recently, employment creation has been concentrated
in the commercial and service sectors and, to a lesser extent, in agriculture
and civil construction. Industrial employment has increased very little since
1968, presently constituting 11 to 12 percent of the employed labor force.

14.       Prices and Stabilization Prospects.   In terms of average annual
price level changes, Brazilian inflation accelerated from 29.2 percent in
1960/59 to a peak level of 88.9 percent in 1964/63, was reduced rapidly to
28.4 percent in 1967/66 and then was very gradually dampened to 19.8 percent
in 1970/69. In 1967-68 the Government decided that the efficiency of
resource allocation permitted in a still inflationary environment by the
automatic price adjustment mechanisms it had created made unnecessary any
further sacrifice of economic growth for continued rapid deceleration of
the rate of inflation. The disposal of coffee surpluses was an important
factor enabling the transition to new policies. Thus, the Government
determined to permit credit to the productive sectors to expand at a pace
consistent with rapid economic growth and constraints on annual nominal
wage adjustments by which they had previously been held well below interven-
ing increases in the cost-of-living. At the same time, the Government under-
took to continue its efforts to alleviate cost push pressures such as those
exerted by agricultural supply bottlenecks and to forestall resurgence of
excess demand by further reduction of the fiscal deficit and refinement of
the monetary tools needed to adjust credit expansion to the real needs of
the economy. It was envisaged from the outset that this policy would not
decelerate the rate of inflation by more than a few percentage points
annually.
15.       During the 1968-70 period, therefore, inflation in Brazil has
consisted largely of:
(a) cost push phenomena such as additional corrective price
adjustments (e.g., coffee for internal consumption, steel,
energy), the inflationary impact of world price movements
(e.g., beef and crude petroleum), and shortages in internal
agricultural supply caused by climatic factors and distri-
butional bottlenecks; and
(b) the secondary impact (chain effect) of these phenomena as
they are translated via the adjustment mechanisms into
increases in wage rates, the exchange rate, rentals,
utility prices, the value of financial instruments, etc.
Early in 1971 it appeared that a slight acceleration of inflation might be
experienced during the year owing to climate-induced shortfalls of rice and
horticultural products as well as to world beef and petroleum price increases
and other factors. However, measures -- including the above mentioned export
quotas -- taken by the Government to stabilize internal beef prices, together
with a remarkable downturn in the rate at which industrial prices and con-
struction costs have been increasing now indicate that the overall rate of
price increase during 1971 will not exceed'and may even turn out to be one
or two points less than in 1970. Through the first nine months of 1971, the
General Price Index had registered a 15.8 percent increase compared to 15.4
percent last year.



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 17
16.       Incomes Policy.   In 1965 the Government limited the frequency of
private sector wage agreements to one per year and began promulgating wage
adjustment coefficients to be applied by the labor courts in adjudicating
wage disput6s. Through 1967 the wage adjustments authorized by the Govern-
ment in this fashion lagged well behind prevailing rates of inflation, tend-
ing to yield sharp reduction of real wage rates. During the same period,
annual legal minimum wage adjustments were also held well below prevailing
inflation rates so that the real value of the legal minimum wage dropped by
about 22 percent between 1964 and 1967. There is some evidence that lower
bracket incomes may not have declined to the extent indicated by the minimum
wage adjustment percentages; demand for wage goods was not depressed propor-
tionately with changes in legal minimum wage rates. Nevertheless, wage
policy durLng 1965-67 clearly was regressive from the point of view of
income distribution especially since it was unaccompanied until late 1967
by any direct control of profit from the production and distribution of manu-
factures and coincided with corrective adjustment of rentals and the prices
of other wage goods.
17.       Following the imposition late in 1967 of direct controls on unit
profits, however, the Government liberalized its wage policy.    The formula
for calculating the wage coefficients to be applied by the labor courts was
modified in such a way as to yield real increases in authorized wage rates
averaging slightly more than one percent annually over the 1968-70 period.
Annual minimum wage adjustment percentages have continued to lag behind
inflation since 1967, but the average annual decline in real minimum
wage values dropped from 7 percent in 1965-67 to one percent in 1968-70.
More importantly, owing to the short supply of skilled and semiskilled labor
and the rapid growth of industry real industrial wage rates for this labor
have been bid up at a far more rapid pace -- by almost 8 percent annually --
than government wage coefficients would imply. Although increased labor
productivity probably has financed the bulk of these increases, profit
controls, requiring that portion of any wage adjustment in excess of the
authorized percentage to be absorbed by the firm, at least mean that
increasing real wage costs by and large have not been passed on to the
consumer and that unit industrial profits may have declined. To complete
the picture the rapid pace of job creation during the last two years must be
taken into account. While no firm data are available it can be assumed
that, overall, wages probably have come close to remaining constant as a
percentage of rapidly increasing national product in the last three years
as opposed to declining as a percentage of relatively stagnant national
product during the 1964-67 period.
18.       Account must also be taken of the nonwage benefits accruing to
labor as the result of the Government's taxing and spending policies. For
example, payroll taxes imposed since 1967 to finance the housing program and
expansion of educational facilities increased unit labor costs by 10
percent, at least a portion of this increase having been passed on to the
consumer, however. More clearly related to business profits is the fact



ANNEX II
Page 9 of 17
that corporate income tax collections have increased at an average annual
rate of 18 percent in real terms since 1966 primarily as the result of
very successful efforts to reduce tax evasion. On the expendi'ture side,
the Government in 1970, in effect, set aside a large percentage of federal
and local tax revenues to be deposited in worker owned accounts constituting
the Social Integration Fund. Ihese deposits -- which may be drawn down
for social security related purposes -- will be employed in financing indus-
trial expansion, primarily through the underwriting of share and debenture
emissions. The resulting capital income will accrue to the workers.
19.       Perhaps the most significant of the Government's social programs
are those related to the alleviation of regional income disparities.
Federal tax sharing -- implemented on the basis of a formula involving, inter
alia, a reverse relationship with per capita income in local jurisdictions --
and other earmarking procedures, have funded a large part of public fixed
investment in the Northeast, such investment being much more highly concen-
trated in that region than in the country as a whole.  Moreover, corporate
income tax credit incentives both have set aside a large volume of federal
tax revenues -- originating primarily in the industrialized Center-South --
for financing the expansion of Northeast production capacity and have elicited
from private enterprise application in the same projects of a large volume
of counterpart resources.
20.       However, tax credit and counterpart resources accruing to the
Northeast have been concentrated in the expansion of industrial capacity
which, while accelerating the growth of output, has not directly alleviated
to any significant extent the region's principal social problem. agrarian
underemployment. Moreover, attempts which have been made to effect agrarian
reform in the Northeast have thus far had very little impact. In 1970 and
1971, therefore, the Government set in motion various new programs which
will preempt 50 percent of the tax credit resources, allocating them and
additional funds:
(a) to the opening of new agricultural frontiers in the Amazon
region and resettlement there of surplus Northeast agrarian
labor;
(b) to the expropriation and redistribution of underutilized
Northeast land;
'(c) to the reorganization and partial relocation of the inefficient
Northeast sugar industry; and
(d) to improvements in farm productivity through the financing --
at subsidized interest rates -- of pasture and soil improvement
and acquisition of machinery and other technical inputs.

Page l0 of 17
21.       An important element of economic management and of income re-
distribution is Brazil's system of interest rate subsidization. The
principal sources of credit made available at subsidized interest rates
are the Central Bank and the Bank of Brazil. Financing for interest rate
subsidization is provided -- in the most immediate sense -- by the non-
interest bearing deposits of public sector agencies and the commercial banks.
The principal beneficiaries of interest rate substitution are the agricul-
tural sector in general, relatively impoverished regions such as the North-
east, and certain dynamic subsectors such as manufactured export industries.
Bearers of the final burden of interest rate subsidization are taxpayers,
borrowers of nonsubsidized commercial bank credit and owners of noninterest
bearing commercial bank sight deposits, i.e. enterprises and persons concen-
trated in the industrialized Center-South. In nominal terms, the opportunity
cost of capital in Brazil probably approximates 30 percent, such that zero
depositor's interest is indeed a substantial burden. Subsidized interest
rates appear to average about 15 percent, although they dip as low as 7
percent in the case of certain Northeast agricultural credit lines. When
rates of inflation and the nominal opportunity cost of capital were much
higher than at present, official credit institutions less efficiently
administered and the public sector not in a position to forego interest on
its deposits, interest subsidization undoubtedly led to significant resource
misallocation. With the fiscal deficit very small and financed in non-
inflationary fashion and credit subsidization applied in pursuit of fairly
well-defined goals by competent monetary authority, however, the scope for
any resource misallocation resulting from interest rate subsidization has
been reduced. In the case of agricultural production credits, the system
may be considered to compensate for the tariff protection and other advan-
tages enjoyed by the economic agents who bear its burden; the elimination of
agricultural production credit subsidization probably would require major
changes in the structure of relative prices. Perhaps the chief defect of the
system as presently constituted, is the fact that its benefit have not
generally been made available to those most in need of them, i.e., small
agricultural producers. Also, to the extent that the system subsidizes
investment credit, it is conducive to distortion of the mix of production
factors. Finally, the impact of the system in terms of raising the cost of
nonsubsidized commercial bank credit constitutes one of the reasons for the
recent upsurge in private external financing of the Brazilian industrial
sector's Cruzeiro investment and working capital needs.
Public Finance
22.       The principal trends in Brazilian public sector finance have been:
(a) gradual elimination of deficit financing as a focal point of
excess demand;
(b) rapid increases in public sector savings generation; and
(c) creation of a national consensus as to the obligation to
pay taxes.



ANNEX II
Page l1 of 17
The best measure of the contribution to control of demand inflation made
by fiscal policy is the fact that the cash deficit of the Central Govern-
ment was reduced from the equivalent of 4.3 percent of GDP in 1963 to 0.4
percent in 1970 and promises to be reduced still further in 1971. One
good indicator of improvement in the equity of tax enforcement is the
above mentioned increase in corporate income tax collections; another is
the fact that personal income tax declarations increased in number from
slightly less than 0.6 million in 1968 to 7.0 million in 1970.
23.       Defined in the broadest sense -- that is, to include social
security taxes, the coffee contribution quota and other tax-type revenues
accruing directly to various autonomous agencies, as well as federal and
local government taxes -- Brazil's overall tax burden increased from the
equivalent of 28 percent of GDP in 1968 to 29 percent in 1970. Public
savings -- including not only savings from tax revenues but also the operat-
ing profits of the principal government and mixed enterprises -- increased
somewhat more rapidly than the tax burden, from the equivalent of slightly
less than 10 percent of GDP in 1968 to slightly more than 11 percent of GDP
in 1970. In addition to the bouyancy of the tax structure, the rapid savings
increase in recent years has been a function of public utility and commodity
pricing policies, improvements in public sector efficiency, especially on
the part of the Central Government and of formerly highly deficitary agencies
such as the Railway Network and of developments in the coffee sector leading
to stock depletion and low levels of production financing. Despite the fact
that -- unlike the recent past -- the coffee account cannot be expected to
generate large resource -surpluses available for application elsewhere in
the economy during the next several years, public sector savings are likely
to continue to increase more rapidly than GDP tending to assure Brazil's
ability to finance the investment needed at high rates of economic growth.
The effect of the taxing capacity and current expenditure restraint developed
by the public sector is well illustrated by the Social Integration and
Investment Tax Credit Programs which, in effect, set aside massive portions
of federal revenues for directly and indirectly administered investment.
24.       The Government presently is engaged in formulating its 1972-74
public sector investment program which, hopefully, will define the invest-
ments to be made during the period not only by directly investing agencies
but also by the financial intermediaries through which investment tax
credit, Social Integration Program and other indirectly administered resources
will be channelled. A survey of the existing plans of major investing
agencies indicates that direct public sector investment will increase at an
average annual rate of 9 to 10 percent over the next several years, with
increments in such investment being attributable primarily to the expansion
of transport, electric power, petroleum extraction and refining, iron
mining, steel production and agricultural resettlement and distribution.
Although the public sector will place heavy emphasis on education, such
em phasis will be reflected largely in increased teachers' salaries and
other current expenditures. Primarily because of the Social Integration
Program, public sector financial investment can be expected to increase
much more rapidly than direct investment.

Banking System and Capital Market
25.       Since 1967 monetary developments have revolved around the
Government's efforts to meet the credit needs of the productive sectors --
which have expanded more than proportionately with GDP -- without triggering
demand inflation or depleting external liquidity. Improvements in the
control exercised by the monetary authorities over the allocation andl pace
of Bank of Brazil lending, reduction of annual treasury deficits, progress
toward the development of open market operations in treasury instruments,
and an increased willingness on the part of the public to accumulate savings
in the banking system constitute the major recent achievements of monetary
management. It should be noted, however, that the task of the monetary
authorities was greatly facilitated in recent years by the coffee sector's
generation of large resource surpluses which were transferred to the rest
of the economy through the Bank of Brazil. Moreover, a considerable portion
of the credit needs of the economy were met during the 1968-70 period by
external sources through the mechanism of the so-called financial credits; i.e.,
hard currency loans made available to Brazilian enterprises by foreign banks
and parent firms for financing cruzeiro investments and working capital needs.
Thus, the authorities were able to reduce the annual pace of monetary expan-
sion (currency and demand deposits) from 44 percent in 1968 to 29 percent
in 1970 while increasing the stock of bank credit to the productive sectors
from 18 to 20 percent of GDP and rapidly increasing Brazil's net foreign
reserves.
26.       Future monetary management will be made more difficult by the
fact that the coffee sector can no longer be counted upon to generate
large resource surpluses; in fact, for 1971 the coffee sector is expected
to require a net transfer of resources from the rest of thie economy. The
more difficult aggregate demand situation being encountered by the authorities
in 1971 is reflected by the fact that, unlike immediately preceding years.,
the pace of foreign reserve accumulation has fallen significantly behind cltat
of financial credit accumulation. Also, monetary budgeting should take into
account a shift in the source distribution of internal credit in the direction
of the nonbank institutions making up Brazil's capital market. Provision for
the monetary correction of fixed income securities, relative price stability
and the compulsory savings mechanisms (e.g., the Tenure Guarantee or housing
Fund) emerging in recent years resulted in a seven-fold real expansion of
savings held by these agencies over the 1966-70 period; as indicated, con-
tinued rapid expansion is insured -- inter alia -- by the creation of the
Social Integration Fund. However, while intermediaries sucht as the lhousin-g
Bank efficiently apply a good part of these resources, institutional defects
presently impede the efficiency of allocation of much of the savings flowing
through the capital market.
27.       Savings are channelled through Brazil's stock exchanges both by
ilnstitutonnal Investors -- principally, Brazil's investment banks (whicli
ma i it-a in mutitt  I iinds) -- and<, directly by indivilduzl savers.  During tlht
1t16.J-/O pfr 1ld .d Lhrougnh the- first half of 1971, nominal share valtues

increased at annual rates well in excess of 100 percent. Underpricing of
nerw issues by the limited number of underwriters operating in the market,
disproportionate profit/capital ratios achieved by mixed enterprises exempt
from capital revaluation requirements, and a series of government incentives
including exemption from tax of either realized of unrealized capital
gains -- in part explain these rapid gains. On the other hand earnings
have been increasing and price/earnings ratios do not appear to have been
driven to alarming levels. Nevertheless, it is clear that the increased
volume cf savings now being attracted to the market is not being applied in
such a way as to yield proportionate increases in production capacity. One
measure contemplated by the Government to correct this disequilibrium is the
creation of a financing facility to promote fair pricing and management of
share and debenture issues by underwriters.
The Balance of Payments
28.       Led by manufactures and minerals, Brazil's commodity exports
increased at an 18 percent average annual pace over the 1968-70 period.
Starting from a very low base and spurred by the demand for investment goods
and industrial inputs created by a booming economy, commodity imports
grew even more rapidly -- at an annual rate of almost 21 percent. Although
surpluses on commodity account have been registered, Brazil's chronically
heavy service payments imbalance together with required amortization of
medium and long-term debt required.capital inflows averaging US$780
million annually over the 1968-70 period. About US$580 million annually
was made available -- in descending order of importance -- by suppliers,
official lending agencies and direct private investors.   In addition,
however, annual increases in outstanding financial credits averaged about
US$550 million during 1968-70. Against the US$1.7 billion in financial
credits accumulated during these years, Brazil increased its foreign
reserves by US$1.1 billion bringing them to an end-1970 total equal to
approximately 4.5 months' goods and nonfactor services imports at 1971
levels.
29.       Brazil's total external disbursed debt amounted to US$5.2 billion
as of end-1970; of the total financial credits accounted for US$2.2 billion.
As indicated, a large part of these credits constitute either a disguised
form of direct investment or working capital financing provided by foreign
parents and related banks. Motives for these arrangements include:
(a) limits on the access of foreign firms to Brazilian credit sources;
(b) differential tax treatment favoring interest as opposed to
profits remittances to foreign parents;
(c)  legislation restricting repatriation of equity capital to
20 percent of the total, annually;



ANNEX II
Page l-of 17
(d)  exchange rate policy whereby rate adjustment is proportionate
to internal minus external inflation, thereby making the
cruzeiro cost to Brazilian borrowers of these foreign financial
credits very competitive with the cost of internal credits; and
(e) imperfections in the internal credit mechanism making
industrial investment and working capital financing very
expensive except for the restricted number of firms having
access to official sources of credit.
Because they consist very largely of disguised direct investment and commer-
cial bank working capital credit lines, the financial credits probably are
not highly volatile despite the fact that US$900 million of the end-1970
total bore terms of one year or less while the terms of the remainder averaged
between two and three years. On the other hand, the Government has sought to
increase net foreign reserves along with increases in financial credits so as
to provide a guarantee of liquidity and maintain creditor confidence.
30.       Defined in accordance with the usual convention which excludes
nonguaranteed private debt, (thereby excluding the financial credits)
Brazil's debt service ratio amounted to 16.9 percent in 1970. Including
interest on and amortization of financial credits, as offset by interest
earned on foreign reserves, the ratio was 46.1 percent.
Development Prospects
31.       The Government believes that only at growth rates similar to those
of the last three years can Brazil provide the job opportunities and income
required for continued visible improvement in the purchasing power and well-
being of its family units. Analysis of alternative 7 to 8 and 8 to 9
percent growth paths indicates that both would require high marginal domestic
savings rates.  The latter would also put a heavy burden on Brazils
import and external debt management capacity. The very high elasticity
of import demand demonstrated by the Brazilian economy in recent years
indicates that increasing external resource gaps are likely to emerge if
growth in the 8 to 9 percent range is maintained. Relationships between
Brazil's foreign trade and its GDP, and the size of the Brazilian economy,
are such that the resulting net transfer of external resources would be
unlikely to finance more than 5 percent of required domestic investment over
the next five or six years. Nevertheless, owing to capital income payments,
and debt amortization, Brazil's external capital requirements would be high
enough at the 8 to 9 percent growth path to expose it to liquidity problems
unless the official external lenders were to provide liberal support.
32.       Domestic savings probably would have to increase at average annual
rates of 9.5 and 11.8 percent, respectively, in:support of growth rates in
the 7 to 8 and 8 to 9 percent ranges. However, not only would both these
rates of savings increase permit per capita consumption to grow more rapidly
than it has on average during the past decade, but the higher would be more
consistent than the lower with projected savings generation by the public

sector, which in any case, is likely to provide more than half of the total
domestic saving required by the economy. Moreover, there is every indication
that private sector savings propensity has been markedly increased by the
stability in relative prices and savings and investment incentives which
the Government has fostered.   Certainly, private entrepreneurs in the
industrial sector presently manifest great optimism and aggressiveness,
supporting to the fullest extent the Government's development goals.    In
the agricultural sector which, in any event, is likely to increase its
output at a 5 to 6 percent annual pace, price incentives are good, and
government programs increasingly effective in promoting better factor
utilization.  Perhaps the major internal constraint to sustaining rapid
growth is income distribution and its impact on the internal market for
the more dynamic products such as durable consumer goods. Although auto-
mobiles pose a special problem in this respect, increasing urban family
incomes appear to be expanding rapidly the market for many industrial
products. One implication of Brazil's strategy is that a mass market will
not develop unless the overall policy framework is such as to promote very
rapid growth.
"3.       Growth in the 7 to 8 percent range would riot be likely to encounter
external constraints if the present favorable export outlook materializes.
Internal supply prospects are such that Brazil is likely to be able to con-
tinue to expand very rapidly its exports of manufactures and minerals over
the next years provided world market conditions do not deteriorate signifi-
cantly. If the outlook for these dynamic elements is combined with rather
conservative assumptions regarding traditional agricultural exports (e.g.,
constant nominal coffee prices after 1971) an overall 10.8 percent real export
growth rate is projected. At growth in the 7 to 8 percent range, merchandise
imports are likely to increase at a 9.3 percent annual pace or somewhat less
rapidly than merchandise exports. Under these circumstances gross medium and
long-term loan capital inflows averaging US$1.1 billion annually over the
1971-77 period would be required. Assuming that official lending agency dis-
bursements average about US$600 million annually, an amount representing con-
tinuation of the current trend in agency support, and that Brazil secures
supplier finance for about one-third of its capital goods imports this re-
quirement could be covered without relying on any additional increase of
financial credits over and above net foreign reserves after 1971.
34.       At 8 to 9 percent growth, on the other hand, imports would be
likely to increase at an 11.6 percent annual pace in real terms, or somewhat
more rapidly than exports. Under these circumstances, gross medium and long-
term loan capital inflows would have to average about US$1.5 billion annually
over the 1971-77 period if Brazil were to avoid significant deterioration of
the relationship between financial credits and foreign reserves. Assuming
again, that suppliers' credits cover, on average, one-third or, in this case,
about US$700 million annually of Brazil's capital goods imports, official
agency disbursements would have to be increased from the US$600 million
average annual figure mentioned in the previous paragraph to between US$750
and US$800 million.



ANNEX II

35.       It should be made clear that, at least for the next few years,
financial credits may have to continue to expand fairly rapidly regardless
of the size of the external resource gap if high rates of economic growth
are to be sustained. Substantial additional improvement in the efficiency
of the commercial banking system and of the domestic share and debenture
market will have to be achieved before internal sources of financing may
substitute for the external financial credits. However, for purposes of
avoiding excessive aggregate demand and of maintaining external liquidity,
financial credits should not be relied upon to any significant extent to
finance Brazil's foreign exchange requirement; i.e., net foreign reserves
should be increased more or less proportionately with future increases in
net outstanding financial credits. The sharp annual increase of Brazil's
net foreign reserves which, therefore, is likely to take place especially
over the next few years, should not be misinterpreted as a sign that Brazil
does not need strong support from medium and long-term lenders. Moreover,
these same lenders should not be alarmed by continuation of the existing
high overall debt service ratio so long as the relationship between Brazil's
financial credit and net foreign reserve positions remains adequate.
36.       Although the volume of official agency and supplier financing
required by Brazil, especially at 8 to 9 percent growth, is very large in
absolute terms, the economy has a well developed capacity to projectize
these requirements. Volume IV of this report presents a list of projects
tentatively regarded as suitable for external financing which is more than
sufficient to account for all of the official loan commitments and much of
the suppliers' commitments required by Brazil during the 1972-74 period.
Although project type lending constitutes an appropriate respbnse to Brazil's
need for external capital, substantial local cost financing will be required.
This is attributable in large part to the size and diversity of Brazil's
capital goods industry which is providing much of the equipment required for
public sector investment projects under international competitive bidding.
It is estimated that a significant portion of external financing for public
sector projects will have to be directed to the coverage of local costs.
Moreover, the rate of economic growth which Brazil is pursuing merits strong
support from the official ending agencies. On the other hand, limitations
on the capacity of both official agencies and suppliers to mobilize resources
mean that Brazil could not tolerate indefinitely the divergent rates of improt
and export expansion implied for the medium term by the 8 to 9 percent growth
forecast.
37.       The Government is somewhat more optimistic than is this report
with repsect to Brazil's export prospects and the national income elasticity
of import demand. Regarding the former, it expects that not only manufactures
and minerals but also nontraditional agricultural exports such as soybean,
corn and beef can be made to increase very rapidly. Thus, its expectations
compare more closely to the "optimistic" export forecast sketched by this
report than to the "moderate" forecast whicth has been incorporated in this
report's estimate of Brazil's external resource gap (see. page 113). Regard-
ing import demand elasticity, the Government hopes that agricultural growth



ANNEX II
Page 17 of 17
can play a larger role in the overall development of the country than this
report estimates, thereby reducing the need for capital and industrial
intermeidate goods imports at any given overall rate of economic growth.
While expecting that any given external resource gap may turn out to be
compatible with a higher economic growth rate than this report has projected,
the Government concurs in the diagnosis that foreign exchange availability
is likely to be the dominant constraint on growth and taht fullest possible
support from external lenders will be needed to support its development
goals.
38.       The Government has not permitted its optimism to reduce its alert-
ness to the dangers of accelerating inflation and deteriorating external
liquidity. It has stressed its determination to manage aggregate demand so as
to avoid both of these contingencies. It has a remarkably complete range
of policy mechanisms at its disposal: e.g., the flexible exchange rate;
statutory authority to register and control the terms of all exterrnal
financial transactions, including fiancial credits; the full gamut of
anti-cyclical tax and expenditure devices; a rapidly improving battery of
monetary tools such as the open market mechanism, and Bank of Brazil credit
guidelines as well as the more traditional rediscount and reserve mechanisms;
and, finally, tight control of all types of income. Presently, the
Government is prepared to use these mechanisms to dampen aggregate demand
and growth should this be necessary to keep either inflation from accelerat-
ing or external liquidity from deteriorating. The inflation criterion is
straight forward; no significant acceleration. External liquidity is more
complicated; here the Government has indicated that it will not permit its
external debt service burden to rise above manageable levels nor will it rely
to any significant extent on financial credits to finance foreign exchange
requirements and that, in particular, it intends to maintain an appropriate
relationship between financial credits and reserves.
39.       Some analysts have asserted that the rapid economic growth recently
achieved by Brazil represents a cyclical upswing and is not susceptible to
being sustained even over the medium term. This issue cannot be resolved
at the present time. The judgement of this report is that the Brazilian
economy, one of the best endowed in the world, is capable of very rapid
sustained growth given proper economic managemert and a favorable external
environment. It is thus on the basis of the expectation that the quality
of economic management achieved during the past few years will not deteriorate
-- and, in particular, that the Goernment will continue to attune the pace of
growth to the savings which its own constituents and the rest of the world
are willing to make available -- that this report recommends strong support
by development lenders for Brazil's ambitious economic goals.
