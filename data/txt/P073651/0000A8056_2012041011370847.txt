                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To support the Government of India (GOI) to strengthen the integrated disease surveillance system for epidemic-prone diseases by (i) enhancing central level monitoring
                         and coordination functions, and (ii) improving state/district surveillance and response capacity with emphasis on selected (nine) states. Additionally, the project will
                         support GOI efforts to timely prepare for, detect and respond to influenza outbreaks in humans and animals.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) is completed after about eight years since its approval in 2004. The project was restructured in 2007 to
                         include a component to respond to the global avian influenza pandemic which affected India. In 2010, the project was restructured again revising its development objectives to reflect
                         a reduction of scope from a country-wide application to a focus on 9 states, and a refining of its emphasis on capacity building. The restructuring also included a cancellation of US$8

                         Although project implementation was slow during the initial years given the monumental task of setting up, institutionalizing, making operational the hitherto non-existent integrated
                         surveillance system in India since the restructuring of 2010, the human health component of the project has progressed very well and completed most planned activities. The

                         Development Objectives attributable to the human health part of the project are hence fully achieved. On the animal health side, significant progress was made to ensure effective
                         response capacity, albeit slow and partial. Overall, through the project, the country has established surveillance systems for epidemic prone human diseases including avian
                         influenza, which are functional and capable of adequately addressing its needs in the event of a pandemic.

                         In light of the progress made against the original and revised targets under the human health part and the partially achieved objectives under the animal health part of the project, on
                         balance, the overall achievement of Project Development Objectives is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
