F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To contribute to improved health outcomes by providing specific, timely information on
selected priority health conditions and risk factors in order to plan and manage programs
to prevent them.

Revised Project Development Objectives

At restructuring in 2007
To (i) improve the information available to the Borrower's health services and private
health care providers on a set of high priority diseases and risk factors, with a view to
enhance the mechanism for the on-the-ground responses to such diseases and risk factors,
and (ii) to minimize the threat posed to humans by AI infection and other zoonoses from
domestic poultry and prepare for the prevention, control and response to an influenza
pandemic in humans.

At restructuring in 2010
To support the Government of India (GoI) to strengthen the integrated disease
surveillance system for epidemic prone diseases by (i) enhancing central level monitoring
and coordination functions, and (ii) improving state/district surveillance and response
capacity with emphasis on selected (nine) states. Additionally, the project will support
GoI efforts to timely prepare for, detect and respond to influenza outbreaks in humans
and animals.

 (a) PDO Indicator(s)
The following indicators represent the final revised Results Framework (RF), as agreed during the
2010 restructuring. According to the final data on these indicators, 3 of the 4 PDO indicators
were fully achieved and 17 of the 19 Intermediate Outcome indicators were fully achieved.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Global context

Globalization of the world economy increases the reach and impact of pathogens.
Modern transportation means allow a person with early, minor, or misleading symptoms
of a dangerous, highly contagious infection to be exposed to hundreds of others in planes,
at airports around the world, and in every hotel visited or bus ridden. Businesses that
transcend political boundaries and rapid transportation allow food contaminated in one
country, to contaminate large quantities of other food in bulk processing plants in another
country, and be shipped to additional countries where illnesses result.

Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) can be devastating, as demonstrated by the
emergence of novel Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 in 1997,
Anthrax incident in USA in 2001 and the swift spread of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) globally in 2003. These diseases caused serious social instability, as
well as heavy economic and human losses.

Greater efficiency of surveillance systems is pivotal to disease prevention and timely
response to disease outbreaks. To overcome the disadvantages of the silos of individual
disease programs, the concept of integrated infectious disease surveillance emerged in
late 1990s and it was put into practice by a number of countries since then. In 2003, the
World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO)
developed a regional Integrated Disease Surveillance (IDS) strategic plan in promoting
an integrated approach to communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCD)
surveillance. After the plan was issued, SEARO supported a comprehensive assessment
of the national surveillance and response systems in a number of member countries in the
Region.

Country context

Government of India was committed to human development. In its Tenth Five Year
Plan covering 2002 to 2006, the ruling alliance asserted that it would retain the broadly
liberal economic policy thrust of the last decade, with a strengthened emphasis on the
social programs and benefits to low income groups, especially in rural areas. Delivery of
public services was one of the four reform priorities in the plan.

Health Sector Context

India was experiencing a dual epidemic of infectious diseases and NCDs. WHO
estimated that communicable diseases, maternal and prenatal conditions and nutritional
deficiencies accounted for 50.3 percent (down from 56 percent in 1990) of the disability
adjusted life years (DALY) lost and NCDs for the remaining 49.7 percent in India in



                                            1
1998. It was predicted that NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, as well as
injuries and mental illnesses would increase dramatically in the years to come.

India was not performing as favorably when compared with other countries at the
same level of income. Despite its increasing public spending on health since 1990,
reduction of IMR and MMR, India showed a clear sign of slowing down in achieving
MDGs in 1990s and the country witnessed worsening HIV/AIDS issues. In addition, the
disparity in health status between different states and different segments of the Indian
population was prominent.

The main health sector issues: The major sectoral issues articulated in the Bank’s India
Health Nutrition and Population Strategy of June 2001 included: (i) low health status of
the population, particularly the poor; (ii) inadequate institutional arrangements and weak
program management; (iii) low quality of HNP services in both the public and private
sectors; (iv) lack of proper targeting of the public funds to the poor; (v) inadequate
framework for engaging the private sector; and (vi) low efficiency and limited financial
resources. These problems existed within a general institutional environment of poor
oversight and inadequate measurement of health system inputs and outputs.

The Government strategy for improving health outcomes and health sector
development: the strategy involved: (i) increased community involvement; (ii) increased
investments in economic growth and human development; (iii) decentralized planning
and program implementation; (iv) integrating communicable, non-communicable and
nutrition-related health services; (v) convergence of service delivery at the community
level; and (vi) increased collaboration with the private sector and NGOs.

Development of integrated disease surveillance

The disease-specific surveillance systems introduced over time in India existed for
many years before the integrated disease surveillance was set up. Such an approach
suffered from a number of shortcomings: (i) a fragmentation of various disease
surveillance systems; (ii) limited roles of other players within the systems because
surveillance activities were centrally controlled; (iii) the number of diseases under
surveillance was too large while at the same time some important diseases were
neglected; (iv) inadequacy of laboratory support for disease surveillance; (v) deficient
data analysis and utilization; and (vi) failure in prompting effective and timely responses
to disease outbreaks.

GoI was committed to addressing the challenges associated with the disease specific
surveillance systems. A five year plan was developed to introduce an integrated disease
surveillance system across all districts in a phased manner. A central unit and a national
coordination committee were established for implementing this initiative. GoI intended to
standardize, consolidate and integrate different surveillance and control programs
covering communicable diseases, accidents, water quality, outdoor air quality,
surveillance of risk factors for NCDs, and state-specific priority diseases.

1.2 Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PDO was to improve the information available to the government health services and
private health care providers on a set of high-priority diseases and risk factors, with a
view to improving the on-the-ground responses to such diseases and risk factors.

The key outcome indicators included:
   •   Number and percentage of districts providing monthly surveillance reports on time - by
       state and overall;
   •   Number and percentage of responses to disease-specific triggers on time - by state and
       overall;
   •   Number and percentage of responses to disease-specific triggers assessed to be adequate -
       by state and overall;
   •   Number and percentage of laboratories providing adequate quality of information - by
       state and center;
   •   Number of districts in which private providers are contributing to disease information;
   •   Number of reports derived from private health care providers;
   •   Number of reports derived from private laboratories;
   •   Number and percentage of states in which surveillance information relating to various
       vertical disease control programs have been integrated under the Integrated Disease
       Surveillance Project (IDSP);
   •   Number and percentage of project districts and states publishing annual surveillance
       reports within three months of the end of the fiscal year;
   •   Publication by the Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) of a consolidated annual surveillance
       report (print, electronic, including posting on websites) within three months of the end of
       fiscal year.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The PDO and the key indicators were revised twice, both constituting level one
restructuring, approved by the Bank Board of Executive Directors, as follows:

(i) 2007 restructuring

Three major factors contributed to the first project restructuring. Firstly, HPAIV H5N1
outbreaks in 2006 in India revealed the suboptimal AI surveillance and the inadequate
capacity for laboratory investigation of AI at national and mainly regional levels.
Secondly, the revised International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) mandated member
states to strengthen their existing capacities for public health surveillance and response,
and report any event of potential international public health concern. Thirdly, the project
implementation had been slow and a number of bottleneck issues emerged which needed
to be overcome. The revisions in the PDO and the indicators reflected these changes.

The revised PDOs were to (i) improve the information available to the Borrower’s health
services and private health care providers on a set of high priority diseases and risk
factors, with a view to enhance the mechanism for the on-the-ground responses to such
diseases and risk factors; and (ii) to minimize the threat posed to humans by AI infection



                                               3
and other zoonoses from domestic poultry and prepare for the prevention, control and
response to an influenza pandemic in humans.

The key aspects of overall performance of the surveillance system would be assessed by
using the following indicators:
   •   Number and % of districts providing monthly surveillance reports on time;
   •   Number and % responses to disease-specific triggers on time;
   •   Number and % of laboratories providing adequate quality information;
   •   Number & % of districts in which private providers are contributing information;
   •   Number & % of states in which surveillance information of vertical diseases control
       programs have been integrated;
   •   Number & % of project districts states and CSU publishing annual surveillance reports
       within 3 months of the end of fiscal year and Publication of CSU consolidated report;
   •   Non communicable diseases information (life styles & behavior) collected through
       surveys done once in 3 years;
   •   Evidence of improved public awareness and widespread adoption of recommended
       practices for the prevention and control of HPAI by poultry producers, distributors, and
       retail vendors; medical practitioners and the general public.

(ii) 2010 restructuring

The reasons for the second restructuring were (i) slow implementation progress as a
result of serious human resource challenges - especially the lack of dedicated specialized
human resources like epidemiologists, and microbiologists – and a focus on a high
number of peripheral laboratories hampered implementation, and (ii) the pandemic
influenza caused by the novel H1N1 virus in 2009 yet again highlighted the importance
of surveillance and rapid response to infectious diseases. The restructuring aimed to
streamline the project design by focusing on 9 states rather than country-wide, and focus
on overcoming the human resource challenges within an extended project period.

The revised PDO was to support the GoI to strengthen the integrated disease surveillance
and response system for epidemic-prone diseases by (i) enhancing central level
monitoring and coordination functions, and (ii) improving state/district surveillance and
response capacity with emphasis on selected (nine) states. Additionally, the project was
to support GOI efforts to timely prepare for, detect and respond to influenza outbreaks in
humans and animals.

The streamlined set of key indicators included:
   •   Percentage of districts providing surveillance reports timely and consistently in 9 priority
       states;
   •   Percentage of responses to disease specific outbreaks assessed to be adequate as
       measured by 3 essential criteria in 9 priority states;
   •   Improved diagnostic capacity for H5N1 and H1N1, as measured by:
            o Number of functional diagnostic laboratories for human influenza established;
               and
            o Number of functional BSL3 laboratories for animal influenza established.




                                                4
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The beneficiaries were not explicitly specified in the PAD although it is clear that the
project was intended to benefit the general population with the reduced disease burden as
a result of timely identification, reporting and response. It had secondary beneficiaries in
the community-level workers, paramedics and health professionals, policy makers
working at different levels would benefit from training and technical assistance under the
project. Their capacity for identifying and responding to infectious diseases would be
improved with laboratory equipment and response kits supplied by the project.

The beneficiaries of the Tribal Development Action Plan (TDAP) were to consist of all
the tribal populations in the pilot blocks in the selected project states and districts.
Integration of the various disease surveillance programs were to provide complete and
coherent health information, better monitoring of disease burden and improve health
system response in the tribal areas. Community-based information would be a key input
to the District Surveillance Unit (DSU) to coordinate all the analysis, feedback of
information and response to diseases. All of these interventions were to have a positive
impact on the tribals and their health status.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Establishing and Operating a Central-level Disease Surveillance Unit
(US$2.02 million). Under this component, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(MOHFW) was to establish a new Disease Surveillance Unit at the central level to help
coordinate and decentralize disease surveillance activities. This new unit was to support
and complement the states’ disease surveillance efforts. The unit was to be staffed by
existing permanent staff reassigned from within the MOHFW. This component was to
address the constraints of lack of coordination despite central control of surveillance
activities and the need for changing the list of diseases included in the system. Effective
coordination (as compared to control) of disease surveillance activities depends on
establishing the appropriate processes and institutional arrangements at the central level.

Component 2: Integrating and strengthening disease surveillance at the state and
district levels (US$40.54 million). This component was to address the constraints
imposed by lack of coordination at the sub-national levels, the limited use of modern
technology and data management techniques, the inability of the system to act on
information and the need for inclusion of other stakeholders. It was to integrate and
strengthen disease surveillance at the state and district levels, and involve communities
and other stakeholders, in particular, the private sector.

Component 3: Improving laboratory support (US$22.67 million). This component
was to support: (i) upgrading laboratories at the state level, in order to improve laboratory
support for surveillance activities. Adequate laboratory support is essential for providing
on-time and reliable confirmation of suspected cases; monitoring drug resistance; and
monitoring changes in disease agents; (ii) the introduction of a quality assurance system
for assessing and improving the quality of laboratory data.



                                             5
Component 4: Training for disease surveillance and action (US$2.77 million). The
changes envisaged under the first three components required a large and coordinated
training effort to reorient health staff to an integrated surveillance system and provide the
new skills needed. Training programs under this component were to be targeted at
representatives from the private sector, NGOs and community groups.

1.6 Revised Components

An additional component was added to the Project during the 2007 restructuring, named
“Support to India’s Country Program for Preparedness, Control and Containment of
Avian Influenza?. It included three sub-components: (i) human health; (ii) animal health;
and (iii) public awareness and coordination support. The total cost of that component was
US$32.63 million of Bank financing. The allocation for the original component 2 and 3
was reduced to US$30.58 million.

The restructuring in 2010 regrouped the previous project design into three components,
as follows:

Component 1: Central Surveillance Monitoring and Oversight (US$6.01 million):
Strengthening disease surveillance capacity at the central level through, inter alia, the
financing of: (i) technical and managerial staff in the CSU; (ii) the information
technology network including the portal, the satellite network, the call center, the SMS
based reporting system, the strategic health operations center and maintenance of existing
hardware/software; and (iii) training activities.

Component 2: Improving State/District Surveillance and Response Capacity
(US$22.66 million). Strengthening disease surveillance capacity in selected states
through, inter alia, the financing of: (i) surveillance staff; (ii) operating costs for state
surveillance and outbreak investigations; (iii) training activities; (iv) priority public health
laboratories (including equipment and operating costs); and (v) the establishment of a
laboratory referral network (on a pilot basis) and its evaluation.

Component 3: Flu Surveillance and Response (US$30.53 million). This component
included two sub-components:
(a) Human Health: Strengthening preparedness, detection and response capacity to
    influenza outbreaks in humans through, inter alia, the financing of: (i) selected
    laboratories (including equipment and operating costs); (ii) specialized laboratory
    technicians; (iii) drugs, vaccines, kits to control and respond to influenza epidemics in
    humans; and (iv) training activities.

(b) Animal Health: Strengthening preparedness, detection and response capacity to
    influenza outbreaks in animals through, inter alia, the financing of: (i) selected
    laboratories (including works, equipment and operating costs); (ii) technical and
    managerial staff in the Bird Flu Cell (BFC); (iii) training activities; and (iv) necessary
    equipment to respond to outbreaks.




                                               6
Changed scope and scale:

Human health
  • Disease surveillance and response was focused only on infectious diseases with
     outbreak potential after 2010. NCD surveillance was dropped from the Project;
  • the number of project states was reduced to nine states from all thirty five states
     and territories.

Animal health
   • AI surveillance among wild birds (component B1.1), satellite mapping of bird
      sanctuaries, water bodies and wetlands (B1.3), development of GIS-based animal
      disease surveillance and information system (B1.4) were dropped from the Project
      because of procurement constraints.

Human and animal health
  • Establishment of a Bio-safety (BSL) Level IV laboratory was dropped because
     this high tech laboratory could not be designed and constructed within the project
     period. Priority was given only to strengthen laboratories for detection of
     outbreaks in humans and animals. A functional network of 12 regional
     laboratories for routine surveillance of H5N1 and H1N1 in humans was set up and
     functioning.

Other significant changes

Modified implementation arrangements and schedule: (i) for the animal health sub-
component, a fully staffed national bird flu cell (BFC) was expected to be established and
responsible for the coordination of implementation under the overall supervision of the
Department of Animal, Dairy and Fishery Joint Secretary; and (ii) for the human health
sub-component, staffing for the Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) would be further
strengthened and tasked with regular supervision of state level activities under
Component 2 and 3a, in addition to the implementation of activities under Component 1
and 3a.

Partial Cancellation of the Credit: The original Credit amount of SDR46.9 million
(US$68 million) was reduced to SDR24.61 million, of which SDR18.17 million was
disbursed at the end. There were three cancellations made, as follows: (i) US$8 million
was cancelled during the 2010 restructuring as a result of reduced project scope from 35
states and territories to 9 states, with the number of human health laboratories to be set up
at district level also significantly reduced; (ii) in 2011, a cancellation of US$15.95
million was made from Human Health Components to further reduce the original project
scope to make it as realistic as possible with estimated needs; and (iii) finally, US$10
million cancellation was made for the Animal Health sub-component under Component 3
of the project because it was impossible to spend the remaining allocation for the sub-
component by the project Closing Date of March 31, 2012.

The project Closing Date was extended twice. The original Closing Date of September
30, 2009 was extended to March 31, 2010 during the 2007 restructuring. In 2010, the
Closing Date was extended to March 31, 2012 in order to complete the restructured
activities. The Government requested a third extension of the Closing Date to complete
the Animal Health sub-component. Unfortunately, agreement on this extension could not
be reached with the Bank because conditions for readiness of the project sites were not
met according to the agreed plan (based on special Bank team site visits carried out in
March 2012). Indeed, the Bank estimated that the completion of this sub-component
would take a much longer time than the requested extension period, and against a
backdrop of previous implementation delays, the Bank decided that extension would not
be granted.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

A number of novel disease surveillance activities were under pilot by the time of
project preparation. National Surveillance Program for Communicable Disease, a
syndromic surveillance system focusing on diseases with outbreak potential, was piloted
in 100 districts under the leadership of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases
(NICD) with support from WHO; Pilots of integrated disease surveillance system in
selected districts in the states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra; and, a pilot scheme for
NCD surveillance under the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences was implemented.
These experiences and the lessons learnt informed the design of the Project.

The Project was well designed technically, informed by the existing experiences, with the
participation from WHO, a number of domestic institutions and academic networks as
well as the Bank team. Integration of disease surveillance and response represented the
updated understanding of public health surveillance and was promoted by WHO and
other international organizations. The potential spread of infectious diseases needed to
be curtailed. Hence, it was legitimate and imperative to develop a nation-wide disease
surveillance and response system. Also, in order to extend the reach of disease
surveillance, community participatory disease reporting, the tribal action plan, and the
involvement of private service providers were included in the design. The project was


                                             8
designed to harness the advances in information and communication technologies (ICT)
and geographic information system (GIS). Potential social and environmental issues were
adequately identified and the respective strategy or action plans were developed.

The preparation of the project reflected an urgent need to integrate disease
surveillance programs in India. This was in line with similar initiatives developed at
the same time around the world. Indeed, international technical agencies, such as WHO,
FAO, and International Office of Epizootics (OIE), had developed technical strategies
and guidelines for implementation of integrated disease surveillance response at regional
and country levels.

The GOI was committed to the development of the integrated disease surveillance
and response system. A national plan was developed and a central unit responsible for
promotion of the system was established within the MOHFW. The Central Government
assumed full responsibility for repayment. Hence the project proceeds would be allocated
to states as grants. Memoranda of Understanding were signed between the GoI and all the
states on their roles in implementation of the Project.

The added value of the Project: The project was positioned to build on and coordinate
across previous investments by the Bank and other donors in disease surveillance, as well
as to stimulate and accelerate the process of decentralization of disease control efforts to
the states. The project also meant to strengthen capacity to respond to emerging changes
in disease patterns and to strengthen overall capacity to manage public health programs.

While the project was technically well prepared and nine risks identified were relevant, at
least four risks were underrated. These four risks were all rated as Moderate. However,
as it turns out, these risks were indeed major impediments to smooth implementation and
therefore should have been rated higher, in retrospect. The four identified risks were as
follows: (i) the project would not expand at the rate proposed in the phased approach with
the result that the project will not be implemented on the scale intended; (ii) districts do
not have the skills, resources and authority to move to an action-oriented surveillance
system and are unwilling or unable to involve villages and the private sector; (iii) delayed
procurement; and (iv) delayed assignment of staff and consultants. Among these four
risks underrated, the real bottlenecks were delayed assignment of staff and consultants
and delayed procurement because of human resource challenges.

Also, it is important to note that the project took three years to prepare. This prolonged
period was due to the difficulty in identifying appropriate institutional niches for project
implementation. This was regrettable in view of the fact that similar projects supported
by the World Bank in Argentina and Brazil took shorter periods of time to prepare and
were able to yield benefits of the project much earlier.

2.2 Implementation

Initially, the project had a smooth start but very soon it entered into a prolonged period of
slow implementation. The project encountered a number of critical bottlenecks including



                                             9
(a) difficulty in hiring quality technical staff and project management staff; and (b) delays
in project procurement of goods and consultancies because both the GoI and the Bank
could not reach an agreement on the appropriate rules and procurement methods in a
timely manner. To overcome these challenges, the 2010 restructuring shifted and
narrowed down project support to a number of technical and geographic priorities: (a) the
diseases with outbreak potential; (b) the nine best performing states; and (c) a reduced
number of laboratories for both human and animal health sectors, significantly different
from those at the time when the project was started in 2004. The scaling back of project
size and foci turned out to be a pragmatic approach and far more realistic than the
originally planned activities and objectives. Such an approach was feasible as the GoI
opted to use its own budget to replace the originally planned project proceeds to
implement some of the planned procurement.

Factors and events that favorably contributed to the project implementation

   •   Supportive global and country specific political and economic environment:
       (i) the heightened global awareness and commitment to EIDs and NCDs
       exemplified by the declaration of commitment to the MDGs, the issuance of
       revised International Health Regulations (IHR) and the Asia Pacific Strategy for
       Emerging Diseases (APSED) and the UN summit on NCDs; (ii) continuous
       economic growth over the years led to the increased revenue for the government
       to use for the social development including better health for people.
   •   GoI demonstrated strong commitment to the establishment of IDSP in India.
       To address the human resources crisis faced by the Project, the National Rural
       Health Mission (NRHM) sanctioned all contractual positions of epidemiologists,
       microbiologists and entomologists needed for the functioning of the integrated
       disease surveillance system. The Government assumed a greater responsibility for
       funding the project after the Bank and Government decided to cancel part of the
       Bank’s credit and also for funding the IDSPs in the states that were dropped from
       the Project in order to make sure the IDSPs had the full coverage of all states and
       territories in India.
   •   Development of IT infrastructure: Proliferation of advanced ICT infrastructure
       helped tremendously to increase the coverage and quality of IDSP, even in remote
       areas. The creation of the IDSP portal made data entry, query, and analysis with
       graphs and report generation at district level possible. The Portal also served as a
       repository for on-line IT training modules and made other information resources
       related to disease surveillance available for all IDSP units. Broadband access
       allowed video conferencing (VC) and training. The improved quality and
       coverage of mobile phone and landline services in India made the functioning toll
       free Call Centers a reality.
   •   Fully-functional Central Surveillance Unit (CSU): In the early years of project
       implementation, there was limited supervision and technical assistance from the
       understaffed CSU. Inadequacies in arrangements for trouble shooting and
       technical support to states were frequently documented in the supervision Aide-
       Mémoire on account of the lack of sufficient manpower at the CSU. Remarkable



                                             10
    strengthening of CSU was observed after the 2010 restructuring, which correlated
    well with the expedited progress toward achieving the set targets.
•   Local champion: Local political and technical leadership was imperative for the
    success of IDSP at state level and below. For instance, in the State of Gujarat,
    where ICR mission field visits were undertaken, the state level policymakers were
    very forward-looking, and committed to the overall health development and the
    project. The state surveillance officer was extremely dedicated to the project. As a
    result, the IDSP implementation in Gujarat was impressive. Highlights of the
    achievements in the State included (i) sufficient staffing for the project at all
    district levels; (ii) a comparatively wider coverage of private health service
    providers and hospitals in the surveillance network; (iii) piloting TDAP; (iv)
    piloting data entry on IDSP portal at block level; (v) using GIS for data
    presentation and visualization; (vi) joint human health and animal health
    investigation and response to Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), and
    public health partnership with other sectors for acute diarrheal disease prevention
    and response.
•   International technical assistance: WHO played an important role in assuring
    the quality of the IDSP. SEARO developed the regional Integrated Disease
    Surveillance (IDS) strategic plan to guide member states in the region to set up
    the IDS systems. Issuance of revised IHR (2005) and APSED and their
    implementation provided the legal and technical framework for the project. The
    WHO Country Office provided dedicated staff including a full time
    microbiologist and 50% of staff time from two epidemiologists, one information
    technology specialist and one microbiologist. Support from United States Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention was also important for the improvement of
    quality through independent assessment, networking with the national center for
    disease control and other forms of technical assistance.
•   Training activities: At the central and state levels, a large number of orientation
    and refreshment training activities were implemented by a network of national
    and state institutes and universities contracted under the project. With the
    improvement in staff training, a steady improvement in technical performance in
    surveillance coverage, timeliness, consistency, and number of outbreaks detected
    and investigated was observed. Under the animal health component, ninety five
    percent of veterinary and para-veterinary staff were trained under the project, and
    overseas postgraduate training was organized for 25 veterinary staff, which
    significantly upgraded the capacity of the regional centers for veterinary services.
•   Flexibility in adapting to changing circumstances: The project responded
    swiftly and positively to the changed needs for disease prevention and control in
    the country. For instance, with the reported outbreaks of HPAIV (H5N1) in India,
    the Bank and the GoI quickly reached an agreement on the restructuring of the
    project to respond the perceived threat from HPAI H5N1 for both human and
    animal health sectors in 2007. Besides, after 2010, as the investment from the
    GoI increased for the national IDS program, the project proceeds were
    strategically shifted and focused on the aspects that could generate greater added
    values by focusing on improving technical oversight from the CSU as well as the
    selected technical and geographic priorities.

Factors and events which negatively impacted project achievements

      •    Chronic HR related issues: Lack of adequate and qualified human resources
           constantly plagued the project. As demonstrated in Table 2, even by the time of
           project completion, still a significant number of the needed staff posts remained
           unfilled or untrained. Besides, as frequently documented in the supervision Aide-
           Mémoires, the project suffered from high turnover of technical, financial
           management (FM) and procurement management (PM) staff because of (i) limited
           availability and uncompetitive salary structures; (ii) lack of job security; and (iii)
           unequal opportunities for training and promotion of the contracted staff working
           for IDSP in comparison with those of full-time government officials. In addition,
           centralized recruitment of the project staff in the early phase of the project also
           exacerbated the human resource challenges.

    Note: Data from Borrower’s Project Completion Report, March 31, 2012.

      •    Low capacity of project financial and procurement management: This was
           problematic at national and state levels, and contributed to serious delays in
           project implementation and dampened the enthusiasm of the participating districts
           and states. Mainly, key problematic issues included (i) poor quality of FM
           practices and delayed financial reports, and (ii) significant amount of ineligible
           expenditures. Also, the project was affected by the outcome of the Detailed
           Implementation Review (DIR). The DIR Action Plan 1 prohibited decentralized
           expenditures as a risk mitigation measure, but since the project was designed to
           finance such expenditures at local level, this new rule led to confusion about
           expenditure reporting as well as to frustration among the project states and
           districts. As a result, a substantial amount of time during Bank supervisions was
           devoted to procurement and expenditure eligibility issues.
      •    Safeguard compliance: As described below, in Section 2.4, there was significant
           delay in implementing the agreed safeguard actions and the actions were
           implemented partially.

 A Detailed Implementation Review (DIR) is an instrument used by the World Bank to help assess the risk
of fraud and or corruption. Based on the DIR findings in some health sector projects in India, a joint action
plan was developed in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), to address
and remedy issues raised by the DIR and address key aspects of systemic weaknesses in the health sector.


                                                     12
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design of the M&E system: The Results Framework (RF) was designed for gauging the
system’s performance in terms of coverage and consistency of disease/outbreak reporting,
timeliness of outbreak detection and response. The RF included a number of key
performance indicators, of which, most were sound. The PDO and intermediate outcome
indicators were systematically documented. The RF was revised twice during the project
implementation to reflect the changed PDO and the components.

While the RF (particularly following the 2010 restructuring) was adequate to measure the
PDO, it did have a number of deficiencies worthy of notice: (i) the framework did not
measure some critical technical performance indicators such as sensitivity 2 and
specificity 3 , both of which should typically be included as indicators for disease
surveillance systems; (ii) the indicator measuring timeliness of reporting failed to capture
the time interval between the date of disease suspected or diagnosed and the date of
reporting; (iii) it would have been better to measure the number of suspected HPAI H5N1
and novel pandemic H1N1 samples processed (output indicator reflecting functional
status) rather than the number of functional diagnostic laboratories for human influenza
established and number of functional Bio-Safety Level II/III laboratories for animal
influenza established; and (iv) it would also have been helpful if independent evaluation
activities such as under reporting investigation, cost effectiveness analysis, were planned
as part of the project design.

Implementation of M&E activities: Limited capacity for data analysis was prominent
and prevailing during the early phase of the project because there was no designated full
time staff working on M&E activities at central and local levels. As implementation
moved forward, this issue was progressively addressed. It gradually became a norm for
all states to systematically collect information on key project indicators, though the
quality varied.

Utilization of M&E information: Increasingly in the last two years before project
completion, it became evident that feedback to the states and districts was provided based
upon monitoring results for continuous quality assurance and improvement, and the M&E
information was used for the targeted supervision and technical assistance 4 . Besides,
weekly reports of a standardized list of infectious diseases were accessible to policy
makers as well as the general public. The disease surveillance information was made
available for development of different national programs such as for vaccine preventable
diseases, etc.


2
  Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual diseases or outbreaks which are correctly identified and
reported. A sensitive surveillance system will win time for disease response.
3
  Specificity measures the proportion of no disease or outbreak which are correctly identified. The higher
specificity of a surveillance system, the fewer false alarms, and less resources wasted.
4
  For instance, based upon monitoring information, visits made by senior officers of MOHFW and CSU
helped in improving IDSP implementation in the states of Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Gujarat,
Haryana, HP, and Rajasthan.


                                                   13
Sustainability of the M&E arrangements: Benefits of the M&E efforts have been fully
appreciated by the GoI. It intends to maintain the arrangements. However, unless there is
full time, well trained and designated staff working on M&E at different levels, the M&E
arrangements designed under the project are not likely to be further improved.

On balance, design, implementation and utilization of M&E are rated as Moderately
Satisfactory given steady progress over the project period.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Enforcement of safeguard policies was delayed, particularly in the early phase of the
project implementation when the project implementers were struggling for getting the
basics such as increased coverage, and improved consistency of reporting right.

Bio-waste Management Plan (BWMP): The potential environment impact of the
project was rated as B at appraisal. Out of the eight agreed actions to be taken, six of
them failed to be accomplished by the end of the first year as had been agreed.
Laboratory bio-safety guidelines were not developed and the supplies to district/sub-
district level for specimen collection and transport were not provided until 2009 (this
means four years’ delay). Efforts in implementation of the plan were only started in 2010.
One of the reasons for the delayed implementation was that many national programs had
implemented bio-waste management measures in the facilities covered by the project.
Although in the end, the BWMP was implemented, no project documentation was seen to
confirm that the required monitoring and reporting system for the bio waste management
program was established and integrated in the overall project monitoring.

Tribal Development Action Plan (TDAP): The TDAP was developed before the project
started. According to the plan, the tribal development action should have been
implemented in at least seven out of the nine project states after the 2010 restructuring.
However, translating the plan into action was delayed, and in a significantly reduced
scale and coverage. The project did not make any progress in implementing the plan until
late 2010 when the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka started the pilots of the
community based disease surveillance initiatives in the localities where tribal groups
concentrated. The hiring of a communication and documentation specialists and
preparation of IEC action plan was also delayed. As documented in the agreed TDAP,
compared to their majority peers, tribal groups suffered from more health problems and
greater difficulty in access to health services. The project could have used the opportunity
to potentially reduce the disparity in health status and access to health care services.
However, because of delay in the implementation of the TDAP, this did not occur.
Indeed, the project failed to report any disaggregated data to demonstrate whether the
tribal groups participated in and benefited from the project, as mandated in the TDAP.

The implementation of Biomedical Waste Management Plan (BWMP) and Tribal TDAP
is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.




                                            14
FM and procurement compliance: Before 2010, the project was frequently rated as
moderately unsatisfactory or unsatisfactory for financial and procurement management.
There were serious delays in implementing the project procurement plan and fulfilling the
requirements for financial audit. There were frequent occurrences of ineligible
expenditures involving a significant amount of the project proceeds.

Financial management of the project was improved significantly after 2010. The financial
management arrangements for the project were established at different levels. FM team at
central level became stable. The financial reporting requirements were streamlined. As a
result, the financial reports, in terms of quality, reliability and timeliness, improved.

Financial management compliance under the project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory
and procurement compliance under the project is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

IDSPs were operated in all states in India. The only difference was the sources of
funding. While the nine project states were funded by the Project, the rest were financed
by the GoI. The rest of discussion in this section applies to the IDSPs in all states.

The NCDC and the states have developed basic technical expertise in a functioning
integrated disease surveillance and response system. An echelon of technical
professionals including epidemiologist, microbiologist, entomologists, statisticians, data
managers, etc. were recruited and trained under the project. The networks of public health
and veterinary laboratories were established and are functioning. Viable modes of and
good practices in community-based surveillance, hospital-based surveillance, urban
surveillance schemes, rapid investigation and response, etc., were developed and can be
further scaled up.

Integration with the existing health programs: GoI has integrated the National Disease
Surveillance Project under the NRHM. All the posts working for IDSP in project and
non-project states have been continued by the Government with domestic funding
support. Development of regional CDCs and inclusion of disease surveillance as one of
its key responsibilities would further improve sustainability of the project achievements.
The laboratory network established under the animal health components has become an
integrated part of the regional disease diagnostic laboratories.

Secured Funding: For the human health components, after the project restructuring in
2010, MOHFW assumed all the funding responsibility for the integrated disease
surveillance in 26 states and union territories that were not included in the restructured
project. Funding beyond 2012 for the Project has been planned by GoI under the
budgetary provision in the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017). On the animal health sub-
component under the project, the budget line established for co-financing the project
activities has been continued after the project was completed.




                                           15
Consolidation of the achievements request additional efforts. GoI needs to further
expand the coverage and quality of the IDSP in the whole country. The key for achieving
this target lies in how to recruit, maintain and further strengthen the capacity of a stable
workforce for infectious disease surveillance and response. To establish a nation-wide
CDC system provides an opportunity for sustain this essential public health function.

The integrated disease surveillance system is highly likely to be sustained in India.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDO was and remains Highly Relevant to one of the CAS (2009-2012) pillars:
increasing the effectiveness of service delivery. Information generated from the IDSPs
is a public good that all Governments should be obliged to provide. Such information is
crucial for designing the overall health sector strategy, and specifically the appropriate
preventive and curative interventions to address the determinants of disease occurrence
and spread. It is also useful for improving the efficiency of public spending on health
with better targeting in terms of disease, geographic and temporal distribution, as well as
population. Since diseases do not spread evenly and the disadvantaged and the poor are
often at greater risk, an improved disease surveillance and response system will certainly
have positive implications on poverty alleviation.

The revised PDO in 2007 and 2010 were Highly Relevant by incorporating
surveillance and response the threat posed to humans by AI infection, the novel
H1N1 influenza and other zoonoses. New infectious diseases have kept on emerging
and infecting the human population. In the last 30 years, about 40 new infectious diseases
emerged on this planet and the world today is even more vulnerable to infectious diseases
than before because of (i) improved transportation and the resulting increase in human,
animal as well as pathogen mobility, (ii) urbanization and consequential high population
density. Besides, infectious disease in India still contributes to a significant portion of
disease burden.

The project design and implementation before 2010 was Moderately Relevant to the
original and the revised PDO in 2007. The technical design was sound, but the
implementation was faced serious challenges in terms of (i) inadequacy in capable human
resources; (ii) procurement issues; and (iii) ineligible expenditures.

The project design and implementation were Highly Relevant to the revised PDO in
2010. The project design was streamlined and focused more on performance and
outcomes. It highlighted the efforts needed for establishing monitoring and oversight
roles of the CSU. After the restructuring, the staff number in the CSU increased
significantly. The project became pragmatic and focused on a smaller number of states in
order to set up fully functional disease surveillance and response systems as a
demonstration to the rest of the country. It also recognized the urgent need to prepare for,
detect and respond to HPAI H5N1 outbreaks and the possible human influenza pandemic.



                                            16
Relevance of the PDOs, design and implementation is rated as High.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Three of the four PDO indicators and seventeen of the nineteen intermediate outcome
indicators were achieved (Table 3).

    Table 3: Progress Made for the Project PDO and Intermediate Outcome Indicators

 Indicator                 PDO Indicators (%)           Intermediate Outcome Indicators (%)
 Total Number                       4                                    19
 Achieved                        3 (75)                               17 (89)
 Partially achieved              1 (25)                                2 (11)

The number of infectious diseases and outbreaks that were reported, investigated and
confirmed increased over time (Figure 1 and Annex 3). A similar pattern was also
reported in China and other countries with newly established disease surveillance
programs as a result of reduced underreporting of diseases and outbreaks. Besides, the
quality of disease reporting measured by timeliness and consistency increased and the
coverage of reporting via internet improved over time. More importantly, measured by
these indicators, the project states out-performed the non-project states (Figure 2 and 3).

       Note: The portal was established in 2009. Sources: Central Surveillance Unit, NCDC, 2012.

The outcomes achieved corresponded well with the progress made in output
indicators/criteria such as (a) number of staff recruited and trained, (b) number of
supervision by CSUs to SSUs, (c) number of communication between human and animal
health sectors, and (d) improved IT infrastructure for disease surveillance and response,
as illustrated by the project result chain (Figure 4).




                                                  18
                             Figure 4: The Project Result Chain




The Project represented the only mainstream disease surveillance and response
initiative covering 24 diseases and conditions in the project states. The establishment
of CSU, SSUs and DSUs was solely funded by the Project (including the government
counterpart funds), and the same was the training of professionals working on the
integrated disease surveillance, and the necessary equipment provided to public health
and veterinary laboratories at state and district levels. Hence, the achievements in disease
surveillance and response in the project states and districts can be attributed to the project.

It should be emphasized that the project’s impacts went beyond the nine states because
(a) while the Project covered only nine states since the restructuring in 2010, GoI
continued the integrated disease surveillance and response systems in the remaining
states and territories by using the same technical approach; (b) even after the
restructuring in 2010, the Project continued to support capacity building for CSU so that
it could provide the necessary technical assistance and supervision to all states and
territories; (c) the established BSL3 laboratories under the animal health component
functioned as the regional reference laboratories serving not only the stationed states but
also the neighboring states.

The achievement of the PDO is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. This rating reflects
the favorable results made in achieving intended outcomes in nine states and the positive


                                             19
impact of the project on the integrated disease surveillance and response systems in other
states. However, it should be noted that the significantly reduced project scope, as
compared to the original intent, and the weighted ratings pre and post restructurings
pointed to a moderately unsatisfactory rating, as per calculations documented in Annex 9.
Therefore, given these calculations and the significant cancelations and changes, as well
as a prolonged and difficult implementation, on balance, the rating for the achievement of
the PDOs is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

The project adopted a low cost approach and improved efficiency, compared to the old
disease surveillance systems in India before the project for a number of reasons:

      •   The new system focusing on a manageable subset of twenty four priority
          diseases/conditions/factors represented a cost effective approach because (a)
          before the project, the number of conditions under disease reporting and
          surveillance was between 50 and 65 in most states. With the implementation of
          the project, the separate disease reporting systems were merged as a single one
          that saved redundancy in terms of human resources and running cost; (b) the
          diseases/conditions selected under the IDSP represented the major contributors to
          the country’s or states’ overall disease burden;
      •   The operating cost for such a project was low. Under different scenarios, the
          incremental cost per capita per annum for the project ranged from US$ 0.01 to
          0.02 (Annex 3). Another study also revealed that the annual incremental cost for
          operating a similar integrated surveillance and response system in a district with a
          population of 5 million in Tamil Nadu, south India was only US$ 0.01 per capita
          (John J. et al, 1998);
      •   In the project states, the project was mainly operated in rural areas rather than
          urban centers. Such targeting represented a greater efficiency in use of resources
          for surveillance since infectious disease dominated the morbidity pattern in rural
          areas than in urban areas in India (MOHFW, 2011);
      •   By the end of the project, ninety seven percent of districts started to report disease
          via portal instead of traditional ways of using telephone calls, faxes, and emails.
          IT infrastructure was used for training and feedback. This represented gains in
          efficiency in data collection and communication;
      •   Underreporting of infectious diseases were reduced (Annex 3) and the time
          between the date of outbreak and the data of notification of laboratory results was
          shortened from more than a week to two days. Nowadays, on an average, 20-30
          outbreaks are reported every week by the states. Earlier, only a few outbreaks
          were reported in the country by the States/UTs 5. This would result in a significant
          number of lives saved, and new infections averted;
      •   The project may demonstrate a higher efficiency than the rest of other non-project
          states. For instance, in terms of infectious disease outbreak reported, from 2008 to


5
    http://www.idsp.nic.in/


                                               20
        2011, the nine project states reported 72%, 63%, 63%, and 62% of the total
        number of outbreaks respectively, where the population of the nine project states
        account for only 44% of the total population in India. However, further analysis
        needed to be performed before confirming such a hypothesis;
    •   Economic analysis was done for prevention and control of HPAIV (H5N1) in
        India during the restructuring in 2007. It suggested that that with effective
        strategy under highly conservative assumptions, the cost saving could be as high
        as US$2 billion for the country.

Perhaps, greater efficiency gains could have been achieved. Clearly more attention
could have been given to the disease hot-spots such as tribal group concentrated areas so
as to achieve greater efficiency. Infectious diseases tend to concentrate among the
vulnerable or poor segments of the population in both rural and urban settings. The
project might also have been able to achieve its objectives sooner had it not taken three
years to prepare and eight years to implement. Despite the different country
environments, similar system in China took about five years to be set up to achieve a
national-wide coverage 6, while at least urban centers in India still awaited to be covered
by or integrated within the IDSPs. Other countries also significant improved their IDSP
systems within a shorter period of time. In Eritrea, the completeness of reporting case-
based data from the health care centers to the next high level increased from 50 percent to
93 percent between 2000 and 2003. In Burkina Faso, the timeliness of surveillance
reporting, especially data on epidemic-prone diseases, increased from 71% in 2000 to
99% by the end of 2004.

Overall, efficiency is rated as Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The project’s overall outcome rating is considered as Moderately Satisfactory. The
justifications include (i) the original and revised PDOs in 2007 and 2010 remained highly
relevant to the CASs; (ii) project development objectives were attained; and, (iii) the
project was implemented in a relatively efficient way.

The IDSP will be continued by the Government with its own budget. However, the
project’s experience indicated that technical and institutional arrangements were at least
equally important for a healthy and sustainable development of the project. The project

  In China, the web-based disease surveillance and response system cover all townships, and even more
than 80 percent of villages, identified notifiable diseases can be reported at village and township level on
the same day. Tally of daily occurrence of infectious diseases has been automated and the system can
generate outbreak alert automatically. The system is GIS-enhanced. The design and implementation of the
system was started in 2003 after the SARS outbreak, and was completed in 2008.




                                                    21
could have added value by helping the government to improve its action plan between
2012 and 2017.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The possible negative economic impacts of disease on health have been well documented.
Besides, diseases and ill health such as tuberculosis, dengue fever, viral hepatitis, etc. are
important contributors to poverty and tend to be concentrated among the poor. Hence,
timely disease/outbreak detection and response will mitigate disease spread and its
consequential health, human and economic loss, and also contribute to greater equity.
During the project implementation, there was an increased number of diseases reported,
outbreaks reported, investigated and responded. The project contributed to the reduced
overall negative health and economic impacts on individuals, particularly the
vulnerable and the poor.

The IDSP contributed to improvement in governance. Information on disease
occurrence and outbreaks was available to both government officials and the general
public. Through ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activist) and 24 X 7 call centers, the
general public participated in outbreak detection and health event reporting. Information
generated from the IDSP was not only be used for design of specific disease prevention
and control programs, but also for verifying their impacts. Availability of district and
state specific information on disease facilitated decentralized decision making and in turn
improved states’ ownership of the system. Compared to the pre-project era, clearly,
districts and states became more willing to report disease occurrence and outbreaks
during and after the project. In addition, the project became a training ground in public
health and epidemiology, and exported a number of capable staff to other important
positions in the Government.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The first large scale integrated disease surveillance and outbreak response system in
India. For the first time in the history of India, such a system was set up from central
level down to district level (Figure 5). An IDSP section was formally set up under the
NCDC. SSUs and DSUs were also institutionalized in the project states. The project also
established an echelon of trained surveillance officers, epidemiologists, microbiologists,
entomologists, as well as data management specialists to systematically generate, analyze
and disseminate critical information on diseases.

Note: SC stands for sub-clinics; CHC for community health centers; PVT for private service providers.

The project contributed to the establishment of a system for AI preparedness and
response. AI surveillance among domestic birds was institutionalized in India.
Functioning rapid response teams were established at central, state and district levels
under the project for investigation of and response to infectious disease outbreaks.
Appropriate stockpiles of personal protective equipment, vaccines were set up at state
and district levels. Regular communication between human health and animal health
sectors on AI and other zoonotic diseases have been institutionalized in all project states.

Establishment of new networks for public health: (i) three laboratory networks were
set up under the project. The human influenza laboratory network played a pivotal role in
the response to the influenza pandemic in 2009, seasonal influenza and human influenza.
The public health network comprising regional laboratories, one state reference
laboratory in each state and 50 district laboratories undoubtedly improved quality of
disease surveillance and outbreak confirmation and response. This public health
laboratory network was supported by a national expert panel, provided with laboratory
guidelines. EQAS was conducted for all the state reference laboratories. Lastly, the
veterinary laboratory network comprising of BSL-III and BSL-II labs was further
expanded and strengthened; (ii) a network for field epidemiology training programs was
established with the participation from nine national and regional institutions.




                                                   23
Innovations implemented under the project: These included (i) various models for
improving the system’s coverage. For instance, ASHAs were utilized for community-
based outbreak identification and reporting in a number of states such as Gujarat and
Punjab, etc.; (ii) Infectious disease hospital network was included in the IDSP; (iii)
disease reporting via portal was accessible to districts; (iv) Red/ Yellow/ Green Card
system was developed for water quality monitoring in one of the states; and (v) AI
surveillance among wild birds was initiated in India under the project. It was later on
continued with the government’s financial input. The critical information on HPAI
among bird migration was generated, which was an important contribution to the
complete mosaic of the global understanding of HPAI evolution and transmission.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Together with other disease prevention and control projects under the NRHM, the
project contributed to the revitalization of public health in India. The National
Institute for Communicable Disease was evolved into the National Center for Disease
Control (NCDC). A number of regional equivalent CDCs were also set up. A plan has
been developed by the Government to set up a dedicated vertical public health system
made up of CDCs at state, and regional levels in addition to the NCDC. Weekly reporting
on disease trends to state health secretaries and directors of health services and timely
disclosure of disease outbreak information helped to enhance the attention of the senior
government officials to public health as well as the IDSP. Vice versa, the heightened
attention from the government officials and the general public also helped to resolve
IDSP implementation bottlenecks.

The project also contributed to the partnership for addressing the determinants of
diseases. The ‘One health’ approach was implemented by both human and animal health
sectors in the country for addressing the threat from HPAI H5N1. Other examples of
public health partnerships included the multi-sectoral interventions against acute
diarrheal diseases (ADD) in a number of states, the enforcement of food safety in the
state of Maharashtra, and CCHF investigation and response in the state of Gujarat. In the
city of Ahmadabad, mapping of diarrhea incidence revealed the geographic concentration
of the ADD outbreaks, and further investigation pointed out the weakness in the city’s
water supply system. Eventually, urban development, water and health sectors were
brought together to design and implement interventions against drinking water
contamination.

IDSP serves as a platform: The project successfully facilitated the birth of the One
Health Project in the South Asia Region for the joint advanced training of public health
and veterinary specialists. The South Asia One Health Project was the first of this kind
funded by Avian and Human Influenza Facility. Besides, the IDSP has developed
surveillance units from central level down to district level, public health and veterinary
laboratory networks and rapid response teams. The systems set up under the both human
health and animal health components are well positioned to serve as a platform for adding
upon other public and veterinary functions/activities such as food borne pathogen




                                           24
surveillance, epidemiology intelligence training, water laboratories, and other zoonotic
diseases, etc.

The Project pointed out the future needs for some critical expertise to be developed.
On one hand, more professionals in epidemiology, microbiology and entomology need to
be recruited, trained and re-trained; on the other hand, expertise in health promotion and
communication, behavioral sciences, veterinary sciences, health economics, emergency
management as well as M&E need to be developed and recruited so that efficiency for
disease surveillance and response can be further improved.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A one day project completion workshop was held in NCDC on February 25, 2012 on
human health components. It was attended by NCDC, selected states, vendors for
provision of technical support and WHO. The summary of the workshop is in Annex 6.

The workshop was dedicated to the following topics such as (i) key outcomes against
PDO indicators; (ii) good practices for disease surveillance and response at states
(including WB supported and Non-World Bank supported project states); and (iii) key
challenges during the project implementation, as well as sustainability of the project.

Key findings from the workshop included: (i) achievements in the nine priority project
states were significant, particularly since 2010; (ii) local commitment to and ownership
of the project was the key for better project performance and outcomes as demonstrated
in the states of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh; (iii) key good practices
under the project were the utilization of ICT for disease surveillance development such as
reporting via portal, e-learning, mobile technology for disease reporting in remote areas,
development of influenza surveillance network in the country, hospital based disease
surveillance under performance based contracting, data analysis practices in West Bengal,
involvement of ASHAs in outbreak detection and reporting; (iv) key challenges included
lack of qualified human resources, absence of public health institutions to support the
project, complicated procurement and financial management regulations; and (v) actions
have been taken by the Government to sustain the integrated disease surveillance and
response system where IDSP will be adopted by the government and evolve into NDSP
under the NRHM.

To prepare the report, the ICR team visited the states of Punjab, Gujarat, West Bengal,
Karnataka and Delhi. At these sites, public health institutions and veterinary laboratories
were visited. Meetings with both human health and animal health professionals and
government officials were held to collect their comments on the project in terms of
achievements, challenges and lessons learned, and suggestions for future improvement.
The field visits also provided opportunities for the ICR team to verify some of the
project’s contributions. The findings from the field visits have been incorporated in this
report.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Moderately Satisfactory.

The Bank team worked closely with GoI and other stakeholders, including WHO, with
technical expertise in disease surveillance and response, to design the technically sound
project. The project was responsive to an urgent need for significantly improved disease
surveillance and response in India which was a global and local public good. The risk
assessment was comprehensive and the ratings on (i) strategic relevance and approach;
(ii) technical, financial, economic context; (iii) environmental and social safeguards
policies, and (iv) policy and institutional aspects were appropriate.

During preparation, workshops and focus groups discussions were held in selected
participating states with some major stakeholders such as (i) field workers such as the
Anganwadi Workers in villages and urban wards, teachers, local health committees,
elected representatives (Panchayat Raj Institutions - PRIs), self-help groups, youth groups
and NGOs.

For the triggered environment and social safeguard policies, to mitigate the negative
impacts on the project, a BWMP and a TDAP were developed, as required by Bank
policy. However, the deficit in implementation arrangements was underestimated, in
particular, in the aspects of constraints in hiring competent staff working on surveillance
and project management. As proven during the project implementation, human resource
policies plus unavailability of technically skilled staff in India presented a huge challenge
to the project, and were the one of major causes for the slow project implementation
progress.

Also, while the design of the result framework was on balance sound, it could have
included some additional critical indicators, as suggested above in Section 2.3.

(b) Quality of Supervision: Moderately Satisfactory.

The Bank maintained close supervision and provided intensive support and
oversight during project implementation. The supervision missions were critical for
problem identification and solving, hence facilitating project implementation, as
highlighted by the government counterparts during the ICR mission in July 2012. AMs
and Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) adequately and candidly documented project
implementation progress, key implementation issues and actions to be taken to resolve
them. Supervision involved WHO every time and other technical agencies -- such as the
US CDC, as much as possible. Progress in implementation and towards PDO was
thoroughly reviewed and the key indicators and assessment results systematically
documented.




                                             27
Project restructuring: the Bank was responsive to the changed country and global
context, particularly in 2007, responding to the threat of the HPAIV (H5N1). The revised
components were appropriately designed. Furthermore, in 2009, when it became evident
that project implementation progress was stagnating, the Bank was proactive in working
with the Government to reduce the number of states, and to focus on priority diseases
with outbreak potential (given the new H1N1 pandemic in 2009). The 2010 restructuring
was also used as an opportunity to see how much of the Credit would be needed to
implement the revised activities, which led to the first cancellation of funds.
Subsequently, additional cancellations of project activities had to be made given the
limited timetable for project implementation.

Bank’s financial management team was responsive to the project’s needs. Contrary
to the agreement between the GoI and the Bank that only central level expenditures
(80%) & limited decentralized expenditures (training) would be allowed to be financed
by the project under the animal health component, the DADF transferred funds to the
state and district agencies for training and other activities related to AI response. The
Bank FM team pragmatically agreed to reimburse such expenditures based on acceptable
audit reports from the selected states with large expenditures. In addition, to mitigate the
impact of DIR, FM team streamlined reporting requirements by allowing financial reports
instead of originally agreed SOEs.

Ensuring consistency and continuity of task management was challenging. During
the eight years of project implementation, the task leadership on the Bank side changed
six times. In 2010, in particular, the task team leadership was changed twice. While other
team members provided greater continuity than the individual TTLs, a high turnover was
also the case for procurement and financial management specialists and their successors
were not always adequately briefed on the project.

More importantly, starting in 2007 when the Avian Flu component was added, the Bank
team encountered additional challenges in terms of supervising a multi-sectoral operation,
requiring close collaboration between two sector units in the Bank. This was not always a
very effective relationship. It was common that separate missions and supervision AMs
were organized for human health and animal health components. As a matter of fact, only
one third of supervisions were jointly conducted. Smooth information sharing and
collaboration between the two sectors in the context of the project was never fully
established.

Technical oversight on AI surveillance: the selection of appropriate testing strategy and
method for AI surveillance should have been better informed by international best
practices with the involvement from international organizations like WHO and US CDC,
etc. Testing of AI antibody was used to verify the existence of HPAI outbreaks and for
HPAI surveillance among poultry birds. Such an approach was erroneous, particularly
among chicken. Existence of antibody only proves the historical exposure to H subtype
viruses (in case of true positive), and on the other hand, lack of antibody cannot rule out
infection during the outbreaks because development of antibody within birds takes time.
Meanwhile, new and more reliable and cost-effective technologies emerged. For instance,



                                            28
Polymerase Chain Reaction testing has been available at lower cost (in terms of unit cost
of per positive sample tested). It represents the mainstream technology for HPAIV
surveillance and virus detection. The above observations and recommendations were
reported to DADF, Ministry of Agriculture during the last ICR mission in July, 2012.
The mission was pleased to know that DADF has upgraded the national Action Plan
of Animal Husbandry for Preparedness, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza
in August 2012. The newly proposed surveillance strategy and methods are in line
with the international best practices.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The project was well
prepared, and adequately supervised. The Bank team was responsive to the changed
situation in terms of emerging diseases and the implementation challenges.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance is rated as Satisfactory.

The Government demonstrated strong commitment to and ownership of the Project. A
national plan for IDS had been developed and a unit for IDS set up at the central level
even before the project started. GoI assumed financing responsibility for the rest of 26
states for the project implementation when the Bank’s support was focusing on the nine
priority states. The arrangements for sustaining IDS were planned before the project
ended and the IDS would be fully integrated into NHRM. The issuance of Public health
Emergency Bill highlights the importance and the needs of disease surveillance. During
the project implementation, key stakeholders were adequately consulted and involved.

Collaboration was strengthened for HPAIV H5N1 surveillance and response among the
relevant ministries. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between MOA and
Ministry of Environment and Forest for AI surveillance among wild birds. Inter-sectoral
collaboration was also exemplified by the identification and response to ADD and CCHF,
etc.

To solve the bottleneck HR issues, Government decided to decentralize staff hiring
during the project implementation. To ensure stability of the workforce for IDS after the
Project, all the IDSP posts were sanctioned under the NRHM before the end of the
project.

(b) Implementing Agencies’ Performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Human Health

It was undeniable that the project implementing agencies’ capacity was improved
significantly. The surveillance units were established at central, state and district levels.
The roles of supervision and technical assistance were strengthened at central and state
levels, standardized operating protocols were developed and mainstreamed, and effective


                                             29
coordination between all of the relevant sectors was started to be built up. However, there
were a number of key roadblocks as follows:

   •   Staff recruitment was a chronic problem during project implementation.
       Even by the time of the project completion, not all the posts were filled and not all
       recruited staff trained.
   •   Deficiency in safeguards compliance (as discussed in Section 2.4).
   •   Supervision to the SSUs and DSUs. the CSU could further strengthened its
       supervision and feedback to the SSUs and DSUs.

Animal Health

The animal health component was well designed. However, many activities had to be
dropped from the project (refer to Section 1.6) due to a prolonged delay in planned
procurement, the project’s proceeds not being allowed to pay for activities to be
implemented by other ministries such as the Ministry of Environment and Forests and
low capacity of some project sites. By the end of the project, only three activities were
implemented under the component: (i) establishment of BSL-II, and BSL-III laboratories;
(ii) AI surveillance among domestic poultry; (iii) training activities.

Both Human and Animal Health

   •   Inadequate attention was given to FM and Procurement. Insufficient number
       and low capacity of FM staff was evident, as exemplified by the suboptimal
       quality and delays in submission of financial reports, and significant amount of
       ineligible expenditures. The project also suffered from inadequate capacity for
       procurement management and bureaucracy in securing internal clearance. These
       contributed to delays in implementation and cancellations of proceeds.
   •   M&E arrangements were inadequate. It was only the last two years when the
       M&E results were increasingly used for decision making of targeted supervisions
       and technical assistance from the central level.

The implementation agencies’ performance improved after 2010. Both MOHFW and
the DADF of the Ministry of Agriculture were committed to the PDO as were their
equivalents at state and district levels. Consultation with and involvement of
beneficiaries/stakeholders were adequate though delayed during the project
implementation. The IDSRS was established and the capacity at central, state and district
levels was improved. The safeguards compliance and financial management compliance
were improved somewhat as well. For instance, efforts were made to establish financial
management capacity at different levels, to streamline the financial reporting
requirements and training. By the end of the project, financial rules and regulations
confirming to the World Bank norms were at least established under human health
component.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

The overall Borrower Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Justifications
include (i) the improvement was made in project implementation in the last two years
before the project completion; (ii) GoI was proactive in paying for the activities that
could not funded by the project proceeds, and assuming the responsibility for funding the
IDSPs in other non-project states; (iii) GoI has committed to the national IDSPs and to
consolidation of the achievements under the animal health component.

6. Lessons Learned

Two categories of lessons learned for the project’s experience: technical and project
management fronts.

Technical Front

Improving efficiency and equity should be paramount concerns in a disease
surveillance project: The restructuring in 2010, prioritized 9 best performing states and
their selection was based on the ranking of their performance to date, based on a mix of
process indicators such as: (i) provision of trained staff dedicated to the IDSP, (ii)
establishment of surveillance mechanisms, (iii) reporting coverage and effective outbreak
response, and fulfillment of the Bank’s fiduciary requirements. However, while this was
a pragmatic decision, such prioritization came at a cost of important equity considerations
and risk based surveillance rationale since infectious diseases usually reside in the
lagging states that have lower capacity and which deserve more attention and help instead
of less. Also, “best performing? could and should be interpreted as the incremental
progress by comparing the measurements of performance and achievements between the
starting points and the end points, rather than end points only.

Critical importance of TDAP implementation to ensure risk-based disease
surveillance and response system: Diseases’ risks and occurrences exist unevenly
among different subgroups/communities and tend to impact more seriously on the
socially and economically vulnerable ones. Implementation of TDAP would not only
improve equity of the project but also efficiency. Unfortunately, the importance of TDAP
was undervalued and its implementation seriously delayed, which may potentially reduce
and delay benefit accruable to the tribal groups.

It is imperative to focus on the “preparedness? capacity for infectious disease
outbreaks: Improvements in detecting, reporting, investigating, and responding to
disease outbreaks were evident under the project. However, it was also clear that same
diseases reoccurred over the years and even in the same locations. This calls for a
mindset change from the current response to the future preparedness and prevention
among policy makers, health and veterinary professionals. Disease risk factors and
associated determinants need to be identified, mitigated or even eliminated so as to break
the causal chain between them and the disease occurrences.




                                            31
Importance of integrating NCD surveillance: NCDs was a major contributor to the
overall burden of diseases in India even at the time when the project was designed. It
should have been treated as a core and essential public health function/activity rather than
an undervalued, one-off research. However, NCD risk factor surveillance survey was
seriously delayed and was implemented only in several provinces rather than as a
nationally representative activity. NCD surveillance was eventually integrated inton the
National NCD Program and would be sustained.

Project Management Front

Project management should not be treated as an adjunct to other technical focus.
This means greater focus on the planning and investing in infrastructure and capacity
building for project management. For example, advances in ICT should be harnessed for
improving efficiency, quality and transparency of project management, as was the case
for the railway projects supported by the Bank. Also, learning from other projects’
experience need to be promoted. For instance, the streamlined review and clearance
process, greater degree of delegation of authority, as granted under the National AIDS
Program could have improve the efficiency of the project management.

At the design phase, delayed procurement and delayed assignment of staff and
consultants were under-rated hence no ex-ante alternative was designed on how to
overcome the two major challenges. In the project led by health professionals, it was
foreseeable that HR issues, procurement and financial management issues would be
overlooked and not prioritized until their negative impacts on project implementation
became evident.

Design and implementation tools need to be flexible to meet the needs of the clients:
(i) the design took more than three years. During this lengthy time of preparation, more
effort and foresight could have been used to design proper procurement arrangements to
allow more flexibility, particularly in view of the types of activities such as, IT
infrastructure for disease surveillance, etc. the project would support. Similarly, proper
arrangements, for instance, through revision of the legal documents, adoption of result
based financing, etc., should have been planned during the restructuring of the project in
2007 so that the project proceeds could be allowed to pay for the activities such as AI
surveillance among wild birds, IT infrastructure establishment and maintenance,
implemented by other sectors. This would have saved substantial amount of time and
effort during implementation and damage in the relationship with DADF. Besides, this
could have prevented the cancellations of large amounts of credit proceeds; (ii) Project
restructuring could have been done earlier. Many issues such as HR related issues and
fiduciary issues were identified in the early phase of the project implementation and
documented in the AMs. In case no action was taken on the government side, the Bank
team should have initiate discussion on project restructuring earlier on.

Greater care is needed to ensure effective cross-sectoral collaboration for avian
influenza and EID. While the Bank had been actively advocating the principle and
practice of “One health? for avian influenza and other EID surveillance, preparedness and



                                            32
response, the institutional arrangements and incentive mechanisms were not well aligned
to this principle under the project. Many activities such as AI surveillance among wild
birds, satellite mapping of wild bird sanctuaries, using of national information and
communication system for surveillance could not be reimbursed by the Bank because of
the conflict of interest clause, as defined by the Bank’s procurement guidelines. Perhaps
in the future, pay for performance, or result based financing can offer a solution. Also,
within the Bank, a much greater degree of collaboration between Sustainable
Development and the Human Development was possible so as to avoid separate
supervision missions and separate AMs. Seeking synergy between different sectors need
be the norm rather than an exception. By setting adequate mandates (e.g. setting as bank
wide priority, legitimated by country assistance/partnership strategies, etc.), incentive
mechanisms (streamlined review process, adequate resources), and user friendly tools to
guide staff at each step in the project cycle, the Bank could be much more effective in
cross-sectoral collaboration for “One Health?.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

A number of issues were brought up by the counterparts during the interviews on project
implementation. These included (i) outputs and outcome targets were not set realistically;
(ii) HR issues related to contracted staff: limited access to postgraduate training and
promotion opportunity compared to civil servants, less competitive salary scheme, etc. as
a result, there were insufficient professionals working for the project and a low sense of
professionalism among staff working on IDSP; (iii) procurement challenges; (iv)
inadequate supervision and feedbacks to states; (v) issues related to timing and pace of
incorporating other initiatives such as implementation of community-based surveillance,
tribal development strategy and action plan; (vi) lacking of ownership of the data and the
system at state and district levels; (vii) overseas study tours were not included in the
project design so opportunities for interacting and learning from other countries on
disease surveillance were missed; and (viii) inadequate inter-sectoral coordination in
disease surveillance and response and low priority set to public health and disease
surveillance by states.

Relating to the Bank’s performance, there was room for improving continuity and
consistency in technical inputs from the Bank. Besides, communication could be
improved, in case efforts could be spent on better understanding of the constraints faced
by each side, which would help in problem solving and reaching agreement on important
decision makings.

In terms of further improvement needed, the following points were mentioned by the
human health counterparts: (i) disease reporting via portal could be accessible to block
level and below; (ii) automated feedback/warning function to states and below needs to
be developed; (iii) the IDS needs to be enhanced by GIS functions; (iv) the system also
needs to improve the timeliness of response from within 48 hours to 24 hours; and (v)




                                           33
additional competences need to be developed in terms of epidemiology, statisticians,
veterinary medicine, health economics and behavior sciences.

The ICR team agrees to the all the issues identified and suggestions on the future
direction for disease surveillance and response development in India: Under the
project, lack of capacity in financial and procurement management rather than the Bank’s
fiduciary rules and regulations were held responsible for the significant delays and
cancellation of important procurements and activities. Cross-sectoral interaction in
disease surveillance on and response had been limited to information sharing and
response on HPAI, ADDs, pandemic influenza and CCHF in a small number of states,
and these need to be promoted systematically in all states for all diseases and to embrace
prevention of and preparedness for diseases; supervision and technical assistance to states
were still inadequate though significant progress was made in the last two years before
the project completion; feedback on the IDS performance and promotion of data
utilization could be done by the CSU in order to nurture the ownership of the system; in
case turnover of the Bank task team leaders is unavoidable, a period of overlapping
should be arranged to improve continuity and consistency in project management;
Overall, between the key project staff on both Government (on human health) and the
Bank sides, a genuinely respectful and effective working relationship was observed by
the ICR team. This had corresponded with the improved and expedited project
implementation in the last two years before it was completed. Such evidence verifies that
a respectful working relationship between the Bank team and the counterparts is a key for
the project’s success. Perhaps from the Bank side, some of the team members could have
been more helpful in case the approach of problem solving or even pre-empting
foreseeable problems could be adopted. The suggestions on the future directions are
congruent to the most updated understanding of disease surveillance and response.

(b) Cofinanciers

There was no co-financier.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Two outstanding issues were raised by WHO representatives. These included (i) a
disproportionate amount of time (70%) during supervision was spent on the issues related
to financial and procurement management and only remaining 30 percent on technical
issues; and (ii) the Bank team should have relied more on country-based WHO expertise,
rather than on technical assistance from outside.

For the future of IDSPs in the country, WHO colleagues suggested that (i) the national
expert panel should be expanded to include experts on epidemiology and veterinary
medicine; and (ii) portal based data entry should be available at point of services.

The above-mentioned issues raised by WHO are highly relevant. Although it is important
to spend sufficient attention and time on fiduciary issues that constrained the project
implementation, perhaps discussions on the fiduciary issues could be arranged in parallel


                                            34
to the sessions on technical issues in order to improve efficiency for discussions on both.
More important, it would be much more constructive and beneficial if the Bank team
could follow up problem identification with problem solving, and provide support to
clients whenever they needed, not only when supervision took place.

The ICR team agrees to the suggestion for tapping more the existing country-based
WHO’s technical assistance while relying on outsiders for technical assistance on
independent assessments or on those areas where country based WHO lacked technical
strength. The ICR team also concurs with the two forward-looking suggestions on the
future direction of the IDS in the Country.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Project outputs by component by 2007

Component 1: Establishing and Operating a Central-level Disease Surveillance Unit.

The CSU was integrated with the NICD divisions. For strengthening the management
functions of CSU, the focal points, with clear TORs were identified and assigned to each
of the fourteen states for oversight and trouble-shooting; a standardized checklist for
monitoring state performance was developed. Weekly progress reviews, feedback and
trouble shooting by the CSU were institutionalized, though sometimes delays were
experienced in fulfilling this role. A call center was established and functioning at the
NICD with a toll free telephone number (1075) to report any unusual event by health
staff. Collaboration with National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP), the National Vector
Borne Diseases was explored.

Component 2: Integrating and strengthening disease surveillance at the state and district
levels.

A notable improvement in disease reporting, in terms of coverage and quality, among the
fourteen project states: fifty percent of the states were rated as satisfactory by system
performance standards. Eighty four percent of districts in the fourteen states were
reporting disease regularly. In addition to disease reporting at primary health care centers,
twenty-three percent of districts in the project states launched disease surveillance among
private health service providers. After the prolonged delay, surveillance on NCD risk
factors was started and data collection was completed.

Component 3: Improving laboratory support.

A needs assessment on laboratory development was conducted in twenty randomly
selected district laboratories. The External Quality Assurance System was established and
assessment was completed for the Level 3 laboratories in 12 project states. A training
manual for peripheral lab technicians was developed and printed. In addition, a total of
58 district surveillance officers were trained in a two week field epidemiology course.

Component 4: Training for disease surveillance and action.

Training for state and district surveillance officers was largely completed in all Phase I
and II states. Induction training among medical officer’s and health workers made steady
progress. Overall, 2,071 district and state surveillance officers/members of rapid
response teams, 22,087 medical Officers, 133,821 Health workers and 6,176 laboratory
technicians were trained in basic IDSP protocols.

Component 1: Establishing and Operating a Central-level Disease Surveillance Unit.

The capacity of CSU was improved and could provide strategic technical and managerial
leadership for IDSP, oversight, coordination and technical assistance to states. Weekly
outbreak reports prepared by the CSU were regularly shared with all key stakeholders
including the Prime Minister’s Office. A tool to monitor the quality of outbreak
investigations was introduced.

Note: VCF stands for videoconferencing facility; TFA stands for toll free access.

Component 2: Integrating and strengthening disease surveillance at the state and district
levels.

The surveillance infrastructure was established in all 35 states. The nation-wide IT
network was functional in over 700 sites and video-conferencing facilities covered 351
sites. An operational project portal was developed for on-line data entry, analysis and e-
learning, a national toll-free call center for SOS reporting. Recruitment for 766 positions
(646 epidemiologists, 85 microbiologists, 35 entomologists) was ongoing and 239
epidemiologists, 30 microbiologists and 10 entomologists were in position. A number of
states started weekly disease outbreak alerts and sharing the information with NRHM and
other departments. Efforts to generate similar reports at the district level were initiated.

Consistent improvements in data reporting, analysis and use at the national level and in
some states were evident. In 2009, 799 outbreaks were reported as compared to 553
outbreaks reported in 2008. Over 500 outbreaks were investigated with laboratory
confirmation and locally responded. Media scanning was initiated in some states. The
IDSP system was employed for contact tracing, sample collection and ensuring supplies
of pharmaceuticals during the H1N1 human influenza pandemic in 2009. The population-
based NCD surveillance survey in seven states was completed.

Component 3: Improving laboratory support.

Laboratory equipment was provided to all Phase I states. Four out of nine priority states
have now finalized a laboratory referral network plan. Thirty five percent of the 85
microbiologists were employed for the development of the public health network.

Guidelines for adequate specimen transportation and collection were finalized.
Supervision by CSU to district public health labs was initiated.

Component 4: Training for disease surveillance and action.

The project trained 2035 trainers for surveillance, who in turn trained 26,065 medical
officers, 138,772 health workers and 8,315 laboratory technicians. Different models for
epidemiological capacity building were initiated: two weeks FETP; and a set of self-
learning CDs for FETP. Training materials, covering internal quality assurance and
biomedical waste management issues, was developed and the first training session
finished.

Component 5: Support to India’s Country Program for Preparedness, Control and
Containment of Avian Influenza.

Animal Health: The project improved national diagnostic capability through
establishment of BSL laboratory facilities. Strategic reserves of equipment and PPEs was
set up for dealing with future outbreaks. Many workshops and training programs for vets,
para-vets, Rapid Response Teams (RRTs), villagers and field staff were conducted.

Human Health: a network of ten regional labs was set up. Two rounds of training were
held for the nodal officers and the lab technicians from the network with the second
training covering the H1N1 identification using real time PCR. Surveillance of
Influenza-like illness (ILI) was started at two sites. The network contributed to swift
laboratory diagnosis and contact tracing for novel H1N1 infections in 2009.

Component 1: Central Surveillance Monitoring and Oversight.

Good progress was made on the training program for the trainers as well as the two week
Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) for state epidemiologists. Over the life of
the project 1033 trainers were trained against a load of 921 and a total of 222
epidemiologists availed the FETP training as against the planned 219. A total number of
188,030 health professionals including medical officers and hospital doctors, lab
technicians, pharmacists/nurses and health workers were trained in disease surveillance
and appropriate response. Besides, monitoring and supervision role of the CSU improved
as reflected in the number of visits to states, interaction with states via quarterly meetings
and videoconferences.

Component 2: Improving State/District Surveillance and Response Capacity.

An average of 97% of the districts of the nine priority states reported on both ‘P’ and ‘L’
forms. Quality of reporting by private health care providers and hospitals (both public
and privates) was improved considerably. Improvement in quality of laboratory
investigation of district public laboratories was confirmed by the EQAS. Pilots on
community based surveillance (CBS) started in the selected blocks in the states of
Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra. The number of reported outbreaks and the number
of outbreaks confirmed by laboratory evidence increased. Information generated from the
IDS systems were increasingly disseminated to policy makers and the public, and used
for informing the design of public health programs.

Component 3: Flu Surveillance and Response.

Human Health: a network of 12 public health laboratory network was established for
human influenza surveillance, of which, 11 are fully functional. Thirty six percent of
sentinel hospitals started ILI reporting. Three of six BSL level 3 laboratories were set up
and functioning.

Animal health: 28 BSL-II laboratories were setup at regional level. 3 BSL-III laboratories
were set up and functional. PPE and other materials for rapid response were stockpiled.
The following planned activities were cancelled: (i) AI surveillance among commercial
poultry farm flocks; (ii) surveillance for migratory birds and backyard poultry around
wetlands and along flyways; satellite mapping of bird sanctuaries, water bodies and
wetlands; (iii) development of GIS based animal disease surveillance and information
system.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

It is a challenging task to quantify economic benefits of surveillance system
development because of the long chain of links from setting up and operating a new
system for disease surveillance to the actual economic benefits eventually resulting from
it. Conducting economic analysis, which if not built-into a project from the start, often
runs into difficulties as changes in disease morbidity and mortality could be due to a
number of factors that make it difficult to measure the effects of the surveillance and
response activities on disease morbidity and mortality.

The Project represented a low cost approach. The author calculated the last two years’
spending (Figure 5) and concluded that the annual per capita operating cost for the project were
from 0.01 to 0.02 US dollars, which was extremely of low cost. Such a low operating cost was
also documented for Burkina Faso (US$ 0.04, from 2002 to 2005), Eritrea (US$ 0.16, from 2002
to 2005), Mali (US$ 0.12, from 2002 to 2005), Tamil Nadu (US$ 0.01, 1998) 7.

The project achieved better outcomes compared to the rest of non-WB project states.
Despite of the similar income levels, similar level of urbanization compared to the non-
project states, and similar geographic locations, the nine states accounted for an average
of 67.3 percent of phone calls to the 24 X 7 call centers, and 64 percent of outbreaks
reported during 2008 to 2011, with a share of 48.6 percent of the national population
(Figure 2, 3, 6). The coverage of internet based disease reporting was also higher in the
project states than in non-project states (Figure 6).

The project achieved a higher efficiency over the years. With the improved coverage
of the project and quality of report, the reported number of diseases increased over the
years (Figure 7, 8). Similar trends were also observed in other non-project states and in
other countries like China during the process of established integrated disease
surveillance systems. In India, for an example, the increased reported number of dengue
cases corresponded well with the implementation of the integrated disease surveillance
project. Between 2001 and 2011, the total number of reported dengue cases per year
increased at a rate of 170 percent. In the same period, the reported number of deaths
caused by dengue increased at a rate of 74 percent. Such an increase could not been fully
explained by increased urbanization, and population growth. The real increase happened
after 2007, and particularly 2009 (Table 6). One possible explanation is that more mild
cases of dengue were increasingly identified and reported by the system.

The project was cost-effective, suggested by the following evidence:
   • The new system focusing on a manageable subset of twenty four priority
      diseases/conditions/factors represented a cost effective approach because (a)
      before the project, the number of conditions under disease reporting and
      surveillance was between 50 and 65 in most states. With the implementation of
      the project, the separated disease reporting systems were merged as a single one
      that saved redundancy in terms of human resources and running cost; (b) the
      diseases/conditions selected under the IDSP represented the major contributors to
      the country’s or states’ overall disease burden;



                                                                                                  44
    •   In the project states, the project was mainly operated in rural areas rather than
        urban centers. Such targeting represented a greater efficiency in use of resources
        for surveillance since infectious disease dominated the morbidity pattern in rural
        areas than in urban areas in India (MOHFW, 2011);
    •   The time between the date of outbreak and the data of notification of laboratory
        results was shortened from more than a week to two days;
    •   Economic analysis was done for prevention and control of HPAIV (H5N1) in
        India during the restructuring in 2007. It suggested that that with effective
        strategy under highly conservative assumptions, the cost saving could be as high
        as US$2 billion for the country;
    •   A modeling of the similar project in Burkina Faso showed that IDSP project was
        cost effective or even cost saving. The cost effectiveness was $23 per meningitis
        case averted (25th: US$ 30, 75th: cost saving) and $98 per death averted (25th: US$
        140, 75th: cost saving) (Z. Somda, 2010).

Greater efficiency gains could have been achieved. Clearly more attention could have
been given to the disease hot-spots such as tribal group concentrated areas so as to
achieve greater efficiency. Infectious diseases tend to concentrate among the vulnerable
or poor segments of the population in both rural and urban settings. The project might
also have been able to achieve its objectives sooner had it not taken three years to prepare
and eight years for implementation. Despite of different country environments, similar
system in China took about five years to be set up to achieve a national-wide coverage 8,
while at least urban centers in India still awaited to be covered by or integrated within the
IDSP systems. Other countries also significant improved their IDSP systems within a
shorter period of time. In Eritrea, the completeness of reporting case-based data from the
health care centers to the next high level increased from 50 percent to 93 percent between
2000 and 2003. In Burkina Faso, the timeliness of surveillance reporting, especially data
on epidemic-prone diseases, increased from 71% in 2000 to 99% by the end of 2004.

  In China, the web-based disease surveillance and response system cover all townships, and even more
than 80 percent of villages, identified notifiable diseases can be reported at village and township level on
the same day. Tally of daily occurrence of infectious diseases has been automated and the system can
generate outbreak alert automatically. The system is GIS-enhanced. The design and implementation of the
system was started in 2003 after the SARS outbreak, and was completed in 2008.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

The workshop was initiated with the inaugural address of Dr L. S. Chauhan, Project
Director, IDSP who first welcomed all delegates and participants. He informed the
participants that the objective of IDSP is to identify disease outbreaks and initiate
appropriate and adequate response in time. Identifying and adding necessary skills to
those already available within the project and their strengthening, for meeting this
objective, is an important priority. Success stories and experiences must be shared for the
larger benefit of learning and understanding issues, gaps or challenges. Information
Technology is one of the most important components of IDSP. The project builds on
cooperation from various teams so that issues can be resolved. The 12th five year plan,
envisages a greater involvement of medical colleges and private sector in the IDSP.

Participant introductions were called for.

Dr Chauhan highlighted two weaknesses of the IDSP which required participant
deliberation. Firstly, strengthening the public health laboratories and the scope of work of
the microbiologists posted at these laboratories—specifically is the microbiologist
expected to make visits to the field including PHCs, CHC and other centers of care, as
samples for outbreak investigation may have to be sourced from the field at times? The
second issue pertained to authority and operational mobility of the District Surveillance
Officer (DSO) in the field, which currently is very low in the program. By enhancing
presence of DSOs, epidemiologists and the date manager in the field, data collection,
reporting and data quality is bound to improve. Similar arrangements could be replicated
at higher levels of hierarchies, in addition to the mandatory capacity building and training.

Dr. Shiyong Wang, Senior Health Specialist, spoke on Disease Surveillance in the
context of South Asia, and shared his understanding of global systems of disease
surveillance and those in some Indian states. He highlighted the relevance of – context,
globalization and IT. Since, many diseases have their genesis in animals; the approach
should also consider transmission of diseases in animals and ecological transmission
through infected animals, which will give a better picture of risks and determinants. In
view of the alerts for terrorist attacks of biological nature, the international framework
developed in 2005 expects member states to improve capacity. One of the components of
capacity building is surveillance. The disease specific traditional surveillance system
underwent a structural change to become a multi-component based generic model,
increasing the coverage of the surveillance using IT. Real time data gathering and
analysis is a possibility for the future compared to the present periodic reporting trend.
Information flow, from vertical approach must evolve into a horizontal flow. Partnerships
with other sectors must be explored. Automation on surveillance is now modeled to
capture change in travel patterns, thus leading to higher prediction of diseases.
Community based participatory disease surveillance system in India, done by ASHAs is a
strategy quite popular and innovative. Sub-typing with ways to trace back to the source of
the disease is also being explored. Thus, the range of surveillance systems varies from a
broad based approach to pin-pointed mechanisms. As the diseases may not spread
uniformly across populations, the goal is to identify high risk areas, which makes it a risk



                                             50
based surveillance system, which also is a cost effective method. Both concentration of
the epidemic and the evidence of its repetition must be measured for effective solutions—
this is the building block of epidemiological intelligence. Key messages being
communicated are: include using disease surveillance not only for detection of the
disease but also for prevention and control; improve not only the coverage but also the
depth of surveillance program; link information to action towards response &
preparation; and build public health partnerships that improve health in general. Having a
national public health human resources development plan, including developing state
level and sub state level public health cadre, will strengthen initiatives at the grassroots
level. India’s joining the Global Disease Surveillance network is certainly most
recommended. Using technologies like rapid testing methods, PCR; assuring quality
assurance in the routine; ensuring bio-safety standards; and project sustainability, are
other areas that can be addressed.

Dr Sampath Krishnan from WHO, appreciated World Bank’s support to IDSP for the
capacity development of professionals in disease surveillance. He highlighted the
importance of being a part of the global disease network, especially the establishment of
World Health Hubs-- a platform for integration of IDSP with the work done on zoonotic
disease, which the project supported. Citing the 1994 outbreak, he informed that global
case definitions essential for comparability and harmonization were not even followed.
He insisted that risk factor determinants are also important for further development of
IDSP.

Dr Kiran, the SSO from Uttarakhand presented on human resources in IDSP in
Uttarakhand. She mentioned that there were two specific challenges:–qualified human
resources for IDSP and their remuneration from existing health care resources, and
absence of public health institutes to support the program, Uttarakhand being a relatively
new state. Solutions included engaging professionals on contractual basis on vacant posts
and approval from the executive committee for relaxation of the minimum qualification
criteria for appointment to IDSP. She counted training and report submission to
appropriate officials, development of field visit checklists for epidemiologists, tasking
and making pharmacists accountable for collection of OPD surveillance reports which is
shared widely on her team’s achievements. Comments from participants included taking
government into confidence, initiating a positive drive to retain various cadres of human
resources in IDSP, parity in pay scales across programs, and inter program cooperation,
for e.g.: between IDSP and the national vector borne disease control program (NVBDCP)
to maximize program benefits.

Ms. Pandita from National Informatics Center apprised the participants of the IT skeleton
of IDSP and NIC’s contribution to maintaining the IDSP portal as well as installation of
Local Area Network (LAN) and computers at 800 sites. Future plans included integrating
a Geographic Information System (GIS) layer in the portal, use of mobile technology,
complementary email interface, upgrading of existing lease lines, strengthening of e-
learning services, training of end users, and maintenance of servers and software.
Comments from participants included need for identifying a nodal person at state
level/sub-state level to provide support to the IT system of IDSP. The solution as



                                            51
recommended was disclosing contact information of state coordinator and district
information officer on the IDSP site. The road ahead included strengthening of band-
width at the district level through a phase wise, cost-effective upgrading. Linking of state
information management system to IDSP, data sharing and exploring ways to help
private medical practitioners report were important goals identified for pursuing.

A representative from the Andhra State Surveillance Unit explained use of mobile
technology in IDSP. He highlighted the fact that mobile telephony is a low investment,
high reach and easy operability option. SMSs can be sent even at 20% signal strength;
mobiles are a sound option in hilly areas; and have a low energy requirement-- making
them a solution of choice. Mobile usage calls for only a 30 minute training of users. SMS
based reporting of disease surveillance data is currently decentralized up to the district
level. Data flows directly from the point of generation to the central server. The
peripheral units could concentrate on prevention and response and less on consolidation
and entry of data. This model was piloted in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh in
August 2008, demonstrated to World Bank support mission and later evaluated by PHFI
and based on positive findings expanded. The challenges faced were timeliness and
completeness of data; limited resources available to address delays in reporting from the
peripheries; irregular feedback from all levels --SMS information not reaching the DSU
level, unit wise; and inability to upload this information into the IDSP portal at the DSU
level as SMS data is stored in the server at state level. Future areas worth exploring are
feasibility of transmitting data directly from field, and extending remuneration to the
persons reporting IDSP data. NIC officials mentioned that with the installation of the
SMS Gateway servers, SMSs to IDSP are free of cost to sender.

Dr. H. K. Chaturvedi, National Institute of Medical Statisticsprovided updates on
NCD surveillance. He informed that considering the growing emphasis on NCDs in the
last decade, a study had been undertaken in seven states of India with the support of the
World Bank, National Institute of Medical Statistics, and regional resources centers to
assess the prevalence of risk factors in different age groups, across genders and
geographical habitation. 50 PSUs from rural and 50 from urban areas were covered under
the study, including 50 households from each of the PSUs, thereby, making it a study
across 5000 households. Quality was ensured with homogenous training, uniform
monitoring and consistent data collection mechanisms. Regional resource centers
checked data quality at 10% of the PSUs as part of the quality assurance protocol.

Key findings from the study were that tobacco as a risk factor was prevalent or rather
confined amongst the male respondents. Mean age of initiation of smoking was 19-20
years in almost all the states. Mean age of cessation of smoking was 29-34 years.
Smokeless tobacco responsible for many oral cancers has a high prevalence. Alcohol, as
a contributing risk factor, has a higher pattern of use in males. There is high variation
between states for the quantity of alcohol consumed weekly and the mean age of starting
to consume alcohol is around 23-25 years. Fruits and vegetables consumption is low in
rural areas. 2-3 days is the number of days fruits are consumed per week, however
vegetables intake is higher than that of fruits. Both in rural as well as in urban areas, risk
of NCDs increases with reduction in intake of fruits and vegetables. Physical activity



                                             52
remains low in urban areas compared to rural areas. 40-50% of the population remains in
pre-hypertensive range, while 15-20% come in the bracket of hypertension combining
stage I & II. Surprisingly, in some states, prevalence of hypertension in rural areas is
more than in urban areas. Overweight is more an issue in south Indian states. It was also
emphasized that periodicity of conducting such surveys should be planned and is vital.

Dr Kamala Singh briefed the participants on the evolution of disease surveillance and
initiation of case based root cause analysis. The link between operationalization of a
rapid response teams (RRTs) and reduction in outbreak cases where these were deployed
was clearly noted. RRTs have also supported mapping of diseases. Effort was made to
capture the validity of cases in a given time period. The age wise prevalence was color
coded. Measurement of underreporting and efforts to limit the spread of certain diseases
like Hepatitis C was made in identified districts. In 2011, of the 36 outbreaks reported, 13
were assessed to be water borne, 11 air-borne and remaining were virus transmitted.
Appropriate response and control was initiated, for instance replacement of leaking water
pipes in line with the recommendations of the study. The functional surveillance system
was responsible for such policy level decisions.

Dr Khare from NCDC stated that under the aegis of the World Bank project,
strengthening of an influenza laboratory network was a key activity. Influenza as a
disease was quite neglected until the recent avian influenza outbreak. It was felt that
having a strong laboratory support across the country is vital for outbreak management
and development of a preparedness action plan. World Bank support through IDSP was
extended for both the human as well as animal influenza outbreaks. The support was
finalized on 6th Dec, 2006 and approval came by the end of 2007. Planning and
coordination, strengthening of public health surveillance including laboratories and
epidemic response, improving access to emergency medical care were the main areas of
World Bank support under the human health component. IDSP initiated the survey on
avian influenza, which included clinical and laboratory surveillance. Human health
surveillance was found linked to animal health surveillance. A multi-site biological
surveillance network of 10 laboratories and 2 reference/national laboratories was
established. This equipped the country to measure prevalence of H1N1 influenza by
geographical regions and also in the analysis of avian influenza strains. Successful efforts
were made to attach laboratories of various states with the national laboratories, with the
exception of Orissa. Currently, there exist 12 laboratories in this network. Two reference
laboratories have been added to the list while the laboratory at ICMR is excluded since
they use own funding for operations.

As per guidelines, MoUs were signed by the laboratories. Major equipment including real
time PCR was installed. Quality was assured; reagents supplied centrally by NCDC such
that tests for pandemic as well as seasonal influenza could be performed. The functional
elements envisaged earlier under this program such as development and implementation
of specimen transport policy with a lead time of 4-6 hours from the time of collection of
sample to drop at the laboratory was achieved. The communication system among the
laboratories under the IDSP network was strengthened and mechanisms for information
sharing established at all levels. Lab surveillance database including anti-viral database



                                            53
was established and is available for public health decision making. All labs have been
functional since 2009 and helped address the pandemics of 2010. Although funds are
provided by the disease surveillance program, in case of a shortfall, the project was used
to bridge gaps. At present, 11 of the 12 identified laboratories are engaged in avian
influenza surveillance and are regularly reporting on performance. Though every year
new epicenters of avian influenza are coming up, adequate mechanisms under NCDC are
in place. Outbreak of H5N1 in crows, however, is at present not under the purview of any
specialized agency.

NCDC itself has initiated influenza surveillance at two sites to confirm swine flu and
influenza ‘B’. Various large medical institutions like PGI-Chandigarh, JIPMER,
Pondicherry, have been submitting the reports of surveillance activities to NCDC. A
challenge experienced by laboratories is that of procurement of reagents. Participants
inquired of the roll out of the annual influenza surveillance plan, which mandates a
practice of collecting five samples per site from three sites per week. Participants were
informed that the influenza surveillance plan is retained in the 12th five year plan, and
hence practices mandated will continue.

A representative from a private corporate hospital, which has been collaborating with
IDSP since 2009 mentioned that their association with the program began during the
2009 influenza outbreak and has continued since then. Their three hubs for data
generation are- Laboratory, OPD records and inpatient clinical records. Since information
is captured using Health Management Information Systems (HMIS), it is easy to pull out
required data. Data is sent to IDSP in the prescribed format, along with the positive
samples, although the reporting from the OPDs is clinician dependent and may not cover
100% of the cases. Challenges highlighted included reluctance of private hospitals to
collaborate with IDSP which was hypothesized to be due to limited approachability of the
national nodal agencies managing disease surveillance.

The representative from the department of Preventive and Social Medicine (PSM),
Medical College, Nagpur, mentioned that their unit is involved in laboratory surveillance.
In addition, their department has executed six training programs on surveillance and
participated in the NCD risk factor surveillance initiative. Trainings included
sensitization programs for local, block, district level health bodies and health workers.
The trainees were categorized into eight groups based on their jurisdiction and scope of
work. Trainers were also categorized into three groups based on the targeted level of
training–- state, district or sub-district level. Quality assurance in the training program
was ensured with senior faculty members acting as trainers in a pre-determined
faculty/trainer ratio of 1:4. The training curriculum covered a wide range of topics–from
introduction to surveillance to epidemiology, reporting, specimen collection and other
relevant components of IDSP. Training modules included outbreak case studies and field
assignments as well. The need for hands on field based training was emphasized.
Clarifications regarding data capture, feedback, quality of surveillance and training were
sought by participants and discussed. It was agreed that knowledge and motivation are
key drivers for the trainings. It was also put forth that the training institutions should
demonstrate their practical competence towards surveillance activities, first at their own



                                            54
institutes before taking on the role of trainers. Establishing linkages with neighboring
states, especially those working on outbreak management was a strategy that was also
proposed.

The representative from the West Bengal SSU shared case studies that they had dealt
with. This included problems of data reporting/data identification, communication and
such. Corrective strategies adopted included segregation of data using codes based on
various stages of reporting (like new, follow-up, and final) and methods to improve
clarity in response and communication. It was demonstrated that incorporation of
appropriate data filters and sorting methods made analyses more meaningful and less
cumbersome. Innovative successful practical experiences like that of “pulse-cleaning of
water bodies? (weekly cleaning of all house-hold water storing sources was highlighted.
Regular involvement of ASHAs was key to successful outbreak surveillance. The state
recommended that IDSP format for data labeling be used by all states for capturing data
as this would enhance both accuracy and specificity. It was also clarified that in their
IDSP reports, the date of onset of symptoms is being reported. Speaking on the laboratory
network and experiences from Tamil Nadu, the SSU from Tamil Nadu informed that
initially the reporting system comprised L-1 (block), L-2 (District) and L-3(state) level
reporting. The district level laboratories were the backbone of the laboratory network in
Tamil Nadu. In 2008, the L1-L2-L3 system was changed and with the support of NCDC,
a new approach was introduced. This included – involvement of medical colleges, disease
surveillance and inclusion of district laboratories. The reporting form was modified to
carry information like – where to send the samples, contact addresses and contact
numbers. A reimbursement mechanism was introduced for medical colleges- the actual
test cost for investigation of samples was reimbursed to them. The district priority
laboratories are mandated to conduct field visits, as well as pick up samples from the
diarrhea wards of the district hospitals. This improved the utilization of the priority
laboratories and reduced the probability of large scale outbreaks. The possibility of
requesting financial assistance from NRHM to meet the costs of integrated Medical
Colleges, should IDSP not be able to meet all costs, was also discussed.

Dr Somil Nagpal, Task Team Leader for the IDSP from the World Bank explained the
information requirements from SSUs with respect to financial management and financial
reporting mandated by the World Bank.

Dr Sukumaran shared the Kerala experience and explained how local government bodies
were involved in disease surveillance in Kerala. He informed that involving Panchayati
Raj institutions is a corollary to the strategy of decentralized administration. Transfer of
funds, functions and functionaries to the local government including those at village,
block and district levels, is an important component of this strategy. These bodies are
closely associated with the local public health system. Projects on communicable disease
surveillance and control amongst others, have since 1997 been envisaged as a “people’s
planning campaign?. These are evaluated by the district expert committee, ratified by the
state committee, which results in the release of funds for the approved projects. Other
projects include a five year comprehensive health plan for NCDs & Communicable
Diseases (CDs), Samagra (involvement of PRIs in prevention of CDs), establishment of a

State Disease Control and Monitoring Cell (SDCMC) wherein experts from medical
colleges are engaged in communicable disease response and preparedness, and a month
long Road Show to sensitize community on vector control and water borne disease
control. The participants agreed that strategies and institutions have to be built to bring
the community closer to the realization of health.

HUMAN HEALTH COMPONENT

Introduction

Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) was launched by the Minister of Health &
Family Welfare in November 2004 for a period up to March 2010. The project was
restructured and extended up to March 2012. From April 2010 to March 2012, World
Bank provided funds for Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) and 9 States (Andhra Pradesh,
Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and West
Bengal). Domestic funding was available for the rest of 26 remaining states in the Country.
The project is expected to be continued in the 12th Plan with domestic budget as IDSP
under NRHM (National Rural Health Mission) with an outlay of Rs. 851 Crore. Annual
outlay for 2012-2013: Rs. 63 Crore (Domestic Rs. 60 crore, EAC Rs. 3 Crore) has been
approved.

Major Achievements

1. Surveillance units have been established at all States and District Headquarters (SSUs,
   DSUs). Central surveillance Unit (CSU) is established and integrated in the National
   Centre for Disease Control;
2. Training of State/ District Surveillance teams (Training of Trainers) has been
   completed for all 35 States /UTs;
3. IT network has been established by connecting 776 sites at all States /Districts HQ and
   premier institutes in the country for data entry training, video conferencing and
   outbreak discussion;
4. A portal under IDSP has been established for data entry and analysis, to report
   outbreaks and to download reports, training modules and other material related to
   disease surveillance (www.idsp.nic.in). Presently, more than 90% districts in the
   country report weekly surveillance data through portal. The weekly data gives
   information on the disease trends and seasonality of diseases. Whenever there is rising
   trend of illness in any area, it is investigated by Rapid Response Team to diagnose and
   control the outbreak. Data analysis and actions are being undertaken by respective
   States/District Surveillance Units;
5. On an average 30 outbreaks are reported every week by the States to CSU. A total of
   553 outbreaks were reported and responded to by the States in 2008, 799 outbreaks in
   2009, 990 outbreaks in 2010, 1675 outbreaks in 2011 and 335 outbreaks in 2012 (up to
   March). Earlier only few outbreaks were reported in the country by the State/UTs.
   This is an important public health achievement;
6. Media scanning and verification cell was established under IDSP in July 2008. It
   detects and shares media alert with concerned State /Districts for verification and
   response. A total of 1758 media alerts were reported from July 2008 to 31st March
   2012. Majority of the alerts were related to diarrheal diseases and vector borne
   diseases;




                                           57
7. A 24×7 call center was established in February 2008 to receive disease alerts all across
    the country on a toll free telephone number (1075). The information received is
    provided to the States/ Districts surveillance units through email and telephone for
    investigation and response. The call center was extensively used during 2009 H1N1
    influenza pandemic and dengue outbreak in Delhi in 2010. About 2.7 lakh calls have
    been received from beginning till March, 2012, out of which more than thirty five
    thousand calls were related to Influenza A H1N1;
8. Fifty priority district laboratories are being strengthened in the country for diagnosis of
    epidemic prone diseases. These labs are also being supported by a contractual
    microbiologist to manage the lab and an annual grant of Rs 2 lakh per annum per lab
    for the reagents and consumables. By the end of the Project, 35 labs in 24 States have
    been equipped;
9. In the nine priority states supported by the Project, a referral lab network has been
    established by utilizing the existing 65 functional labs in the medical colleges and
    other institutes and linking them with adjoining districts for providing diagnostic
    services for epidemic prone diseases during outbreaks. Informed by the project’s
    practice, the plan has been developed and will be implemented in the remaining 26
    States/ UTs;
10. Eleven laboratories have been strengthened and made functional under IDSP for
    Avian/ H1N1 influenza surveillance; Recruitment of contractual manpower under
    IDSP has been decentralized in May 2010, so that the State Health Societies recruit
    them at the earliest. About 301 Epidemiologists, 60 Microbiologists and 23
    Entomologists have joined in States/ Districts by March 2012. States have been
    requested to expedite filling up the remaining contractual positions.

Lessons Learnt

   •   States giving high priority to public health and with strong leadership from the
       local Governments have implemented IDSP better. The State Health Secretary/MD,
       NRHM/DHS etc should monitor the IDSP frequently and regularly;
   •   Most of the State/District Surveillance Officers for IDSP have many additional
       responsibilities which negatively affected the project implementation and
       sometimes delays project activities. States should to make sure full time and
       dedicated SSOs/DSOs;
   •   Steps need to be taken for increasing coordination between Department of Health
       Services (DHS) and Department of Medical Education (DME);
   •   There is a need for full participation of Medical Colleges in the implementation of
       activities such as:
           o Data collection, analysis and reporting
           o Training
           o Lab support – utilization of labs for diagnosis during outbreaks
           o Members in rapid response teams
   •   There has been short supply of key human resources (epidemiologists,
       entomologists, microbiologists) at district levels;




                                             58
   •   Currently weekly disease surveillance data are collected from primary health care
       units and inpatient wards of secondary and tertiary care facilities. Information from
       OPD will now be a priority for future surveillance system development;
   •   The capacity of public health laboratories in most states/districts is weak. About
       350 district public health labs need to be strengthened and also linked to about 190
       medical colleges/referral labs under the 12th Five year Plan. In addition to a
       microbiologist, further provision of laboratory staff (1 senior laboratory technician,
       1 junior laboratory technician, 1 laboratory assist cum DEO and 1 laboratory
       attendant) is proposed to be stationed at each District Public Health Laboratory.

Best Practices

   •   Compilation of disease outbreaks/alerts is done on weekly basis and the weekly
       outbreak report generated by the CSU is shared with all key stakeholders every
       week including the Prime Minister’s Office;
   •   Epidemiologists monitor the status of receipt of weekly surveillance data, analyze
       data on a sample basis, and share the analysis with state surveillance units to
       promote similar analysis at the state and district levels;
   •   Regular video conferencing sessions are organized to monitor project
       implementation status, discuss reporting issues and seek clarifications on
       discrepancies in data such as sudden increase in the number of reported cases and
       outbreak investigations, including actions taken;
   •   Extensive training material has been developed and many apex institutions have
       been trained as trainers, forming a large pool of trainers;
   •   Establishment of 24 X 7 call center and scanning of media for unusual health
       events has proved to be an effective supplementary tool in the early detection of
       public health threats;
   •   Frequent monitoring of the implementation of IDSP by the World Bank, NRHM
       Common Review Mission and internally by the Ministry/NCDC;
   •   Financial rules and regulations confirming to the World Bank norms have been
       established and followed rigorously.

Proposal for 2012-2017

All activities being undertaken presently under IDSP are proposed to continue as
Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) run by NCDC under National Rural
Health Mission (NRHM) in the 12th Five-Year Plan.

Objectives

   • To strengthen/maintain a decentralized laboratory based IT-enabled disease
   surveillance system for epidemic prone diseases to monitor disease trends and to detect
   and respond to outbreaks in early rising phase through trained Rapid Response Teams.

   • To establish a functional mechanism for inter-sectoral co-ordination to tackle the
   zoonotic diseases.


                                            59
  Proposal in brief:

        • All support to states/districts health societies including additional contractual staff
        given under IDSP will continue in the 12th Plan.
        • The Program will be totally funded through domestic budget;
        • Roles and responsibilities of state/district surveillance officers will be further
        defined so that they own the programme;
        • OPD data will be collected from major hospitals including medical college
        hospitals;
        • All data to be reported and managed through portal only (currently, they use e-mail
        as well as portal for this purpose);
        • “P? form will be revised to collect data on morbidity as well as mortality;
        • The call centre will be popularized among the community, especially among local
        leaders, to get early information about potential outbreaks;
        • Absence of public health laboratories continues to be the weakest link. About 350
        district public health labs will be strengthened and also linked to about 190 medical
        colleges/referral labs under the 12th Five year Plan. This will help in improving the
        quality of data and outbreak investigations;
        • Case based surveillance is proposed to be started in 30 sentinel centres for vaccine
        preventable childhood illnesses;
        • Recruitment of a veterinary (consultant) at each state surveillance unit to
        strengthen coordination between animal and human health sectors to control zoonotic
        diseases;
        • In addition to a microbiologist provision of lab staff (1 senior r laboratory
        technician, 1 junior laboratory technician, 1 laboratory assistant cum DEO and 1
        laboratory attendant) at each District Public Health Lab.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

WHO country office involved with disease surveillance in the country even before the
IDSP project was launched. In fact, WHO along with INCLEN were involved in
designing the project, assisting the states in development of state PIPs, development of
training strategies, development of the operations manual and other preparatory activities
including various operations research projects for the implementation of IDSP in the
country. WHO had continuing physical presence at NCDC and carried out field visits to
states for hand holding during the roll out of the project. WHO has been a partner in the
joint review missions of the World Bank. This project was the priority project of the
Communicable Disease Support team of WHO country office for Health Systems
strengthening.

A few WHO perspectives on the IDSP project including future plans are outlined below:

1.       The project has firmly established a very well defined structure for reporting and
feedback for priority infectious diseases and outbreaks in the country right up to the
village level. This is an important prerequisite of the International Health Regulations
2005 implementation. All SSOs and DSOs are the focal points for the IHR at state and
district levels respectively;

2.     Significant improvement in capacity building at all levels of health functionaries
from sub-centers upwards have been achieved;

3.       An impressive IT infrastructure including an online portal is available from
district upward for uploading of data and would be expanded to the block and PHC level
in the future. Those data are on the public domain of the IDSP website. The system also
has video conferencing facilities for live discussions and trainings of health functionaries;

4.     Improvement in laboratory capacity has been slow. The public health laboratory
networking is likely to meet the requirement of quality outbreak detection and laboratory
confirmation;

5.    The system has demonstrated its effectiveness and robustness during the response
to human influenza pandemic in 2009 in meeting the emergency needs during the crisis;

6.     IDSP generated data has been regularly informing the Prime Minister’s Office on
disease outbreaks in the country through the e-newsletter;

7.      The IDSP has highlighted the future needs for epidemiologists, microbiologists
and entomologists at district level. Integration of IDSP into the NRHM II will sustain and
strengthen the system, especially for manpower and funding availability;

8.      The information from IDSP has been used by policy makers for policy and
strategic planning for the 12th Health Development plan;




                                             62
9.      The future integration with National Polio Surveillance Project, the surveillance
component of National Health Programs, establishment of NCDC branches at State level
(presently 8 likely to increase to 20), creation of Regional Offices of Health and Family
Welfare (presently 18, may be increased to all states), involvement of all medical
colleges and EIS training would enhance the surveillance system capacity and strengthen
overall health systems in the country.
