PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARGENTINA
OIL AND GAS ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 3880-AR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Oil and Gas
Engineering Project in Argentina, for which Loan 1880-AR in the amount of
US$27.0 million was approved on  June  24,  1980.    The loan was closed on
June 30, 1986, three years behind schedule. It was 93? disbursed and about
US$2.0 million was cancelled. The last disbursement was made on August 31,
1985.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Division of
Country Department IV of the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office (Preface,  Evaluation  Summary,  Parts  I  and  III).   The Borrower
provided a Project Completion Report, under the previous guidelines, which
gave some basic information on  the  project.        Part II was not prepared,
however.
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the President's
Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARGENTINA
OIL AND GAS ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 1880-AR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.          The project was the first operation in Argentina's hydrocarbon
sector. It was identified during a visit of a Bank petroleum sector mission to
Argentina in August 1979 and was appraised in November 1979. Negotiations were
held in May 1980. The project was approved applying standard Bank terms rather
than the then different engineering loan terms because the project consisted of
studies of seismic surveys prior to exploration; that is, this project did not
have a definite follow-up project with which engineering loans would normally
be refinanced (para. 8).
Obiectives
2.          The project was aimed at- strengthening the productive capacity of
the oil and gas sector in order to support the government's efforts for achieving
energy self-sufficiency.    The project's main objectives were  to  improve
information on countrywide oil and gas reserves as basis for a rational program
of field development, to assist the borrower. Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
(YPF), in locating favorable geological structures in the Northwestern Basin and
to assist the government to study the optimum development and utilization of the
country's abundant natural resources (para. 6).
Imolementation Experience and Results
3.          The overall objectives of the project were essentially accomplished
and all the components were  successfully completed.    Since this was an
engineering project, no formal economic and financial appraisal was made.
Therefore, no ex-post evaluation is performed.
4.          Two  of  the  three  components  (Auditing  of  Reserves  and  Gas
Optimization Study) suffered significant delays during implementation, mainly
due to cumbersome local procedures and to financial difficulties suffered by the
country and by the borrower.  However. the quality of the data, the software
developed, and the general results obtained in all components were satisfactory
to YPF and to the Bank (paras. 9-17).
5.          Conclusions and recommendations from the studies were considered
appropriate and potentially helpful for further development of oil and gas
resources.  As a result of the studies, much more substantial information was
made available about hydrocarbon development possibilities, thus strengthening
the productive capacity of the sector (para. 25).

Findings and Lessons
6.          Although significant hydrocarbon potential exists to increase oil
production and additional volumes of low-cost natural gas. fulfillment of this
potential had been frustrated by the lack of adequate financial resources, low
natural gas prices, distortion in the regulatory framework that prevented less
than optimum private sector investment, and compounded inefficiencies in the
state enterprises. The present Government has concluded that a comprehensive
deregulation of the hydrocarbon sector is needed to mobilize the large amounts
of investment required and to ensure their efficient allocation as an essential
condition for reversing the decline in hydrocarbon production and reserves. To
this end, the reserve and production data resulting from this project should
assist the current efforts of the Government to deregulate the sector and
encourage more private sector investment (paras. 24-25).
7.          To obtain maximum benefit from high technology projects such as
those under this loan, more local staff involvement with external consultants
should be ensured in order to increase an effective technology transfer and,
consequently to facilitate successful implementation of recommendations made by
consultants (para. 31).

Loan No.          1880-AR
RVP Unit         Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office
Country          Argentina
Sector        : Energy
Subsector        Oil and Gas
Background
1.    Argentina's energy resources are substantial and diverse.  They include
crude oil, natural gas, and hydropower, as well as coal and uranium. Since 1984,
over three-fourths of the energy produced was from hydrocarbons; the remainder
was provided by hydropower, nuclear biomass, coal, and other sources.  These
resources have been developed primarily by the state.
Z.    The Borrower, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) is a state-owned
petroleum company organized under the Secretariat of Energy within the Ministry
of Public Works.   It was established in 1922 as a Government Department (a
predecessor organization had begun operations in 1907). In 1977 it was separated
from the Ministry and converted into a state corporation.  It is the largest
enterprise in Argentina and one of the largest oil companies in Latin America.
3.    The main issues affecting the sector, when this project was prepared
(FY80), were: (i) the increasing hydrocarbon import bill, local pricing of crude
oil,  natural  gas  and petroleum   products;  and    (ii)  overall  planning,
particularly of natural gas development. Argentina's crude oil and natural gas
sector ranking was third in output and fourth in refining capacity in Latin
America. The producing fields, scattered widely in six sedimentary basins, were
posing difficult logistic problems because of their remoteness from the main
refining and consumption centers.   Output of crude and condensate in 1979
approached 173 million barrels, and that of natural gas had increased to 436
billion cubic feet per year.   The oil and gas sector,  including refining,
contributed about 22 to GDP. Argentina had attained a high-degree of hydrocarbon
self-sufficiency, as imports in 1979 accounted for just 12.72 of domestic
petroleum demand and 202 of natural gas demand. However, while import volumes
of crude oil and natural gas subsequently continued to decline, import volumes
of petroleum products increased considerably.   Because of substantial price
increases, the import bill for hydrocarbons reached the equivalent of 182 of
merchandise imports that year.
4.    Natural gas had become increasingly important for meeting Argentina's
energy requirements. However, given that oil and gas are 'associated* products
in Argentina, some 30? of output, net of reinjection, was being flared, and it
was urgent to improve natural gas utilization to reduce this waste.   The



inefficiency in the use of natural gas was based on: First, an overall shortage
of infrastructure because producers had been discouraged by low prices to supply
large amounts of natural gas to Gas del Estado (GdE), and had been reluctant to
invest  in  natural  gas  gathering  and  transport  facilities.    Second,  the
substitution of natural gas for fuel oil was made difficult in some local markets
where fuel oil was in excess supply and priced nationally about 102 below the
price of natural gas. Therefore, there was the need for studies to determine
the extent and location of investment for natural gas recycling and transport
infrastructure, on a regional as well as a national basis.
5.    This project was the first for the Bank in Argentina's hydrocarbon sector.
Previous energy-related lending by the Bank to Argentina had been entirely for
electricity development. The project was a response to a Government request to
the Bank for financial and institutional assistance in the oil and natural gas
sector development.   The project was designed to support the Government's
principal development objectives for the oil and gas sector:   (a) achieving
petroleum self-sufficiency through the 1980's by accelerating exploration and
production and by helping in the strengthening of YPF's exploration and
production departments; (b) enhancing sector efficiency by helping increase
private sector investment and further rationalizing measures on the part of YPF
and GdE including, through the reserves audit component, the provision of a
better basis for bidding exploration and production areas by private companies;
and (c) laying the basis for attaining more efficient fuel utilization and
overall resource allocation by studying the markets for expanded natural gas
use, identifying the needed investments in transport infrastructure, natural gas
recycling and storage, and recommending pricing policies Eor liquid fuels and
natural gas, including specific pricing actions to be implemented during 1980.
Proiect Obiectives and Description
6.    The objectives of the project were  (a) to improve information on country-
wide crude oil and natural gas reserves as the basis for a rational program of
field development; (b) to assist YPF in locating favorable geological structures
in the Northwestern Basin (Porcelana-Rio Seco area); and (c) to study the optimum
development and utilization of natural gas, primarily to avoid waste and to
determine related investment requirements.
7.    The project consisted of the following components:
(a)   Auditina of Reserves -  The component consisted of detailed reservoir
engineering studies, covering 44 major reservoirs which, together with
additional reservoirs currently being audited in the Neuquen basin,
comprise 90? of the country's known reserves. The component required field
work, gathering of data and work in the consultants' home office over a
period of about two years, as follows:
(i)   Determine proven secondary recovery oil reserves in about nine
reservoirs located in several basins through: (a) reservoir
engineering studies for implementing enhanced recovery methods in
oil fields operated by YPF;  (b) studies for water flooding- (c)
forecast of water injection and oil production rates; (d) studies



of optimum recoveries with various flood patterns and injection
rates; (e) studies to determine requirements for surface facilities;
(f) economic review of the projects: (g) estimates of capital
requirements for injection maintenance and workover expenditures:
and (h) additional studies, as required, to optimize natural gas and
crude oil recoveries;
(ii)  Determine proven reserves for the five newly discovered crude oil
and natural gas reservoirs located in the Northwestern basin.
including an evaluation of probable and possible reserves to be
performed by statistical methods;
(iii) Revise and adjust calculations for a total of thirty crude oil,
natural gas, and condensate reservoirs, mainly in the Southern basin,
and in all other major reservoirs not included in parts i. and iii.
above.
(b)   Seismic Survevs   - Previous drilling in the Northwestern basin had
demonstrated that important additional hydrocarbon accumulations could be
found in an area along the subsurface structural alignment of the Devonian
rocks, which follow the sub-Andean folded belt.   However, the area of
greatest interest, located immediately south of the early discoveries and
aligned with the Bolivian fields, did not show a surface expression of
the folded belt. For this reason it was necessary to conduct a seismic
survey over this area that permitted accurate determination of the
subsurface alignment of the Devonian rock, where hydrocarbons have been
found in the vicinity.
Financing by the Bank of this seismic survey was justified: (i) by the good
hydrocarbon potential of the area under consideration; 'ii) the prospective
contribution to strengthening YPF's exploration department; and (iii). the
attraction of private sector investment in exploration. The survey would
consist of some 1,000 km of seismic lines, with stakes placed 25 to 50
meters apart, for a subsurface coverage of 2400 to 4800Z, with 20 to 40
holes per position drilled at a depth of 1 to 3 meters, and using 96
channels for recording.  These stringent field parameters were dictated
by the complicated geology, the ruggedness of the terrain, the dense
vegatation and the thickness of the weathering zone. Light equipment was
to be used and transportation of equipment and supplies done by
helicopters.   The rate of progress was expected to be 50 km per crew-
month.
(c)   StudY to Optimize the Use of Natural Gas - Some 30Z of the actual output
of natural gas in Argentina was being flared, resulting in a significant
waste of energy resources, while over 25Z of consumption was met through
imports.   With the aim of increasing efficiency of energy use and
accelerating the attainment of self-sufficiency in energy, the Energy
Secretariat would undertaki a study on optimization of natural gas use.
This study would be carried out by consultants and was expected to require
about 160 man-months over a period of two years.  The study would analyze
inter alia: ti) levels and structure of pricing of liquid fuels and of
natural gas; (ii) demand for natural gas and competing fuels; (iii) options



- 4 -
for disposition of fuel oil surpluses either through exports or secondary
processing into lighter products;  (iv) optimization of future refining
expansion and related investment requirements, (v) transport and storage
requirements for natural gas; and (vi) the scope for natural gas recycling
and reinjection and the optimum development of the gas fields.
8.    The project was approved applying standard Bank terms rather than the then
prevailing engineering loan terms, because the project consisted of studies of
seismic surveys prior to exploration; that is, this project did not have a
definite follow-up project in sight with which engineering loans would normally
be refinanced.
Project Design, Organization and Implementation
9.    Auditi%g  of  Reserves:    The  program  experienced  some  delays  at
implementation resulting from contracting procedures. Existing Argentine laws
limited contracting of consulting services by State corporations to those with
at least one Argentine partner. Since there were no local consulting firms with
sufficient experience and know-how in reservoir engineering and r'serve auditing
studies at implementation. some delays occurred while awaiting approval from the
Government to allow YPF to hire foreign consulting firms directly. Once approval
was obtained, YPF signed contracts with British, Canadian and American firms for
the execution of the following auditing of reserves studies:
(i)   Reservoir and  Secondary Recovery  Feasibility  Studies  of Water
Injection in -he fields of Cadadon Leon, Pico Truncado, and El
Tordillo.
(ii)  Reservoir  and  Secondary  Recovery Feasibility  Studies  of Water
Injection in the fields of Cafadon Alfa, and Cafadon Piedras.
(ii)  Enhanced Oil Recovery and Reservoir Studies ia the Vizcacheras field
(the largest field in Argentina, that accounted for 25Z of domestic
production)
(iv)  Secondary Recovery Feasibility Studies  for Water Flooding,  and
reserve determination in the Medanito and Rio Neuquen fields.
(v)   Reservoir Studies to determine the proved, probable and possible
natural gas and condensate reserves in the Lomas de la Lata field
in the Neuquen basin, the most important natural gas reservoir in
Argentina.   The consultants were asked by YPF to perform gas
deliverability tests and to recommend an overall production and
development plan for the field, including the options of having this
field   and the neighboring areas being operated by the private
sector.
10.   The above studies were finished and the final reports were delivered to
YPF with a copy to the Bank. The technical approach utilized by the consultants,
the treatment of the data and the conclusions and recommendations were considered
appropriate and potentially helpful to YPF in determining the remaining reserves



- 5 -
in these fields as well as the most adequate methods that should he followed in
the future. However, it is YPF's opinion that a two-way benefit was foregone
by not having YPF staff more involved in the development of the s:udies by the
consultant. YPF staff, it was felt, could have contributed with their knowledge
of particular characteristics of the basins, and at the same time, benefited from
effective technology transfer.
11.   Seismic Surveys:  The Bank approved retroactive financing of this sub-
component. The seismic surveys to be financed by the Bank consisted in large
part of survevs already being carried out by an American contractor, which had
been working in the Northwestern basin urxder a contract signed with YPF in May
1978, The Bank reviewed carefully the limited international tendering procedure
involving five of the largest contractors from three countries, which was used
by YPF at that time, and determined that it was consistent with the procedures
that the Bank would have accepted, had it been involved in the procurement
process. This contract covered 550 line-kilometers of seismic work out of the
total 1,000 line-kilometers included in the project.
12.   The same contractor was again selected in 1980, after YPF invited bids from
nine well-knomn geophysical firms from four countries. The new contract covered
the aditional 450 line-kilometers included in the project and introduced a 15z
reduction in net costs.
13.   The survey advanced fairly well, with monthly progress slightly above the
estimated average of 50 km per crew-month.  A total of 1,265.2 kilometers of
seismic lines were recorded in the field, of which 1,05X.7 kilometers were shot
as reflection lines and 211.5 kilometers as refraction lines.
14.   The quality of the subsurface data obtained varied between fair and good.
Unfortunately about 20Z was poor quality and became impossible to improve or
enhance through any sophisticated processing methods.  Most of the processing
(abut 50 percent of all the data acquired) was done by the consultant in its
processing center located in Buenos Aires.  About 20 percent of the processing
and the quality control was done by another American firm on YPF's behalf, and
the remaining 30 percent of the field data was processed by YPF in their
processing centers of Salta and Buenos Aires.
15.   Gas Optimization Study:  Commissioning of the study was very slow, mainly
because of cumbersome administrative handling.   The problems were finally
overcome with the contracting of suitable consultants and the ratification by
YPF of the contract.
16.   The Gas Optimization Study was focused on all energy applications in the
country from production to end-use. The study was performed using the resource
allocation model developed under the project.   The model is known as MOARE
(Modelo Operativo de Asignacion de Recursos Energeticos). It calculates optimal
resource allocation within the entire Argentine energy sector under a given set
of conditions.   The study therefore produced a national and regional fuels
allocation model that was installed in the Energy Secretariat. Among the results
obtained by the study was the input given by MOARE of the estimation of the 1986-
1990 investment program and of the capital available to the crude oil and natural
gas sub-sectors. Beyond this, however, the MOARE model has not been used. It



- 6 -
was considered by sector professionals in Argentina to be too complicated and
therefore of little operational use.   In retrospect, it may have been more
successfully integrated into sector plannng if its deveiop.ment had been managed
by Gas del Estado, rather than by a committee of experts from interested
Government agencies who ultimately felt little ownership' of the results.
17.   As approximately USS 2 million of the original loan amount had remained
unutilized atter satisfactorily completing the project objectives, YPF informed
the Bank of its intention to call for bids for the preparation of audits of
proven, probable and possible hydrocarbon reserves, tentatively in the north of
the country. The Bank at the request of the Argentine authorities, agreed to
extend the closing date of the loan from December 31, 1983 to December 31, 1984,
then to December 31, 1985, and subsequently to June 30, 1986 to allow for the
use of the undisbursed loan balance for the studies. Since the funds were not
committed prior to the latest approved closing date, it was decided that the
amount would be cancelled.
Proiect Results
18.   The overall objectives of the project were essentially accomplished and
all the components were successfully completed. Since this was an engineering
project, no formal economic and financial appraisal was made. Therefore, no ex-
post evaluation is performed.
19.   The main benefit to Argentina arising from this project was the improved
knowledge of the country's hydrocarbon reserves. The information gathered by
this engineering project helped provide the basis of YPF's current exploration
strategy, and for continuing Bank support to the energy sector, particularly
concerning energy sector planning; petroleum pricing issues: natural gas
utilization; and encouragement of the private sector contribution to oil and gas
development.
20.   Self-sufficiency has been a long-term major Government objective, and one
that motivated this project, but this goal has not been already achieved. While
production of electricity and natural gas has steadily increased, crude oil
production has fallen steadily since 1981. Further, crude oil production rates
in recent years have exceeded the new additions to the resource base, with
consequent depletion of this most essential resource to a critical level.
21.     A reassessment of the proven crude oil and natural gas reserves was made
under the ongoing Gas Utilization and Technical Assistance Project, GUTA (Loan
2592-AR). As of January 1, 1989 crude oil reserves were estimated to be 273
million m3 (1.32 billion barrels) which at the current production rate of 70,000
m3/day, needed to meet present consumption requirements, puts the proved
reserve/production ratio for crude oil equal to eight years of supply. Thus,
projected future demand for liquid hydrocarbons will be increasingly more
difficult to be supplied from known sources.
22.   Similarly, realistic proved natural gas reserves as of January 1, 1989,
are now estimated to be 593.3 million m3 (18.9 trillion cubic feet), which at
the current production rates puts the current reservelproduction ratio for
natural gas equal to 20 years of supply. Potential coal reserves are very large,



estimated at 220 MMTOE. but the low quality of the deposits, as well as their
distance from consumption centers, make their commercial exploitation doubtful.
Uranium proven reserves are estimated at 400 MKTOE -- or equivalent to the
consumption of about 8,000 MW of nuclear installed capacity for 30 years.
Hydropower potential is estimated at 44,000 MW, equivalent to about 44 MMTOE p.a.
-- or 2,200 MMTOE over 50 years.
23.   Additional investments in crude oil and natural gas exploration are
urgently needed to maintain and, if possible, expand production to avoid costly
crude oil imports and natural gas shortages in the mid-1990s.   Significant
potential exists to increase crude oil production and find additional volumes
of low-cost natural gas; however, fulfillment of this potential is frustrated
by low natural gas prices, lack of adequate financial resources, distortions in
the regulatory framework that prevent less than optimum private sector
investment, and compounded inefficiencies in the state enterprises. Fortunately,
the present Government has concluded that a comprehensive deregulation of the
hydrocarbon sector is needed to mobilize the large amounts of investment required
and to ensure their efficient allocation as an essential condition for reversing
the decline in hydrocarbon production and reserves. For this purpose, it has
adopted a four-pronged strategys (a) liberalization of all hydrocarbon prices;
(b) deregulation of crude oil purchases and sales, including imports and exports;
(c) enhanced opportunities for private sector operation in production areas held
by YPF; and (dt restructuring of YPF and GdE to become commercially oriented
enterprises. The end of 1990 has been set as the deadline for completing the
deregulation process. During this period YPF is charged with renegotiating the
existing exploitation contracts, offering in international tender joint venture
participation in its main producing areas for enhanced recovery and selling its
marginal areas.
24.   A positive contribution of the project was the improved knowledge of the
crude oil and natural gas reserves and production.   This has assisted the
Government in its current effort to deregulate and to offer new areas for private
sector sxploitation.   Another positive  result  from this project was  the
identification of new projects, for further involvement of the Bank in the
natural  gas  sub-sector.    Specifically  the Gas Utilization  and Technical
Assistance Loan (2592-AR) arose mainly from the conclusions and recommendations
presented by the consultants that participated in the engineering project under
this loan.
Bank and Borrower Performance
25.   The Bank contributed significantly during project  identification and
preparation by interpreting the Borrower's priorities based on an analysis of
the needs, costs, and possibilities of the crude oil and natural gas subsector
in Argentina. The project was timely and well selected, since it represented
a high priority concern of the Government at the time.
26. - During project implementation the Bank offered valuable technical and
financial advice, and the response to YPF's requests, as demanded by the
development of the studies and contracts was always prompt.



-8-
Financial Performance
27.   The Bank reviewed the Government's policy of raising prices by about 1.52
to Z per month in real terms and was satisfied that this would substantially
improve the financial position of the two public sector entities, YPF and GdE,
and considered  it unnecessary  to  include  a price  covenant.    The Energy
Secretariat issued monthly price adjustment resolutions, covering all hydrocarbon
products, natural gas, coal, and some petrochemical products.   However, from
1982, due to large and abrupt devaluations of the Argentine currency, the real
prices of petroleum products and natural gas started to decrease significantly
and the financial position of the two institutions deteriorated.
Consulting Services
28.   The operational methodology used by the firms participating in the Auditing
of Reserves component which included information collection, report writing in
the country of origin and presentation of final results to YPF, consistently
isolated local professional staff who could have benefited from th.eir direct
involvement with the consultants.
29.   During the Gas Optimizaticn Study, the Energy Secretariat raised several
complaints about the quality of progress reports, and about poor local staff
involvement.  However, after the consultant noted the requests, satisfactory
improvement occurred.
Lessons to be learned
30.   In oil and gas engineering projects, high technology contracts are carried
out by external consultants.   For maximum benefit to the country from the
information being collected and processed, more local staff involvement should
be encouraged in order to increase technology transfer effectiveness and
consequent implementation of results and recommendations made by the consultants.
31.   The new data about oil and gas reserves delivered by the project can be
very useful to the extent that investments in exploration are carried out.
Partly because of the ongoing scarcity of public funds in Argentina, mo.re private
investment is needed and petroleum policies should be oriented to attract as much
private investment as possible, in a competitive environment of reformed prices
and regulations.
32.   The current efforts of the Government to deregulate  the sector and
encourage more private sector involvement should be enhanced by the hydrocarbon
reserve and production data which were supported by this loan.



PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Given the time elapsed since the loan final closing date, and the fact that
most YPF staff involved in project management have retired, YPF has only been
able to provide some basi_ information on this project, which has been included
under Part I of this report. It is therefore recommended that Part II of the
Project Completion Report not be prepared for this project.
