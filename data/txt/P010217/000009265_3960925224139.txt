PETROLEUM RESOURCES JOINT VENTURE PROJECI
(LOAN 2553-PAk)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Petroleum Resources
Joint Venture Project in Pakistan, for which Loan 2553-PAK in the amount of
US$55.0 million was approved on May 23, 1985. The loan was closed on June 30,
1989, as originally scheduled.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Energy Operations Division of
the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the President's
Report, the Loan and Guarantee Agreements, supervision reports, project progress
reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank
memoranda.

(LOAN 2553-PAK)
,Intr2duction
1.       This was the fourth petroleum project in Pakistan supported by the
Bank, the first being an IDA credit in 1978.  For this fourth operation, the
first joint venture type project, a Bank loan of $55.0 million was provided to
the Government of Pakistan (GOP) in two components: $20.0 million to finance
GOP's share in existing joint venture development agreements and $35.0 million
to be on-lent to the Oil and Gas Development Corporation (OGDC), under a
subsidiary loan agreement between GOP and OGDC and covered by a Project Agreement
between the Bank and OGDC, for OGDC participation in new joint venture
exploration and development programs.
Objectives
2.       The Bank's main objective was to support GOP strategy of increasing
private sector investment for the development of the petroleum sector.   The
project was designed to stimulate private sector participation through joint
venture exploration and development programs with OGDC and GOP (PCR, Part I,
para. 3.01).
Implementation Experience
3.       GOP and OGDC actively promoted joint venture concession agreements and
were successful in concluding twenty-three such agreements through November
1990.    In  the majority  of  the joint venture  exploration programs,  the
international oil companies were the "Operator", thus bringing a high level of
technical competence, efficiency and experience to Pakistan's petroleum industry
(PCR, Part I, paras. 4.02 and 4.03).
4.       In order to provide additional incentive to the private sector oil
companies for exploration in Pakistan, GOP, in 1985, restructured its gas
producer price policy by creating a direct link between the border price of fuel
oil and the wellhead price for gas, net of discount for geological conditions
of the concession. This movement towards "market" pricing had a direct effect
in increasing private sector confidence and involvement thus contributing to the
overall project's success (PCR, Part I, para. 5.02).



ii
5.       Whereas there were two Joint venture agreements in place at project
inception, nine new exploration/devolopment agreements were concluded prior to
project completion, six additional agreements were signed prior to loan closing,
and eight joint ventures have been formed since loan closing for a total of
twenty-three new joint venture agreements from project inception in 1985 through
November 1990 (PC'R, Part I, para. 5.01).
6.       New discoveries of oil and gas reserves were added to Pakistan's
domestic energy resource base (PCR, Part I, para. 5.03 and PCR, Part III, Varas.
4a and 4b). Theoe new discoveries totalled in excess of 30 mmbbl of oil in
Potwar concession; 13 mmbbl of oil in Badin concession; and 25 mubbl of oil and
more than 2 tef of gas from new joint ventures-
7.       An intangible result is the technical and operational experience gained
by OGDC through active participation with the international oil industry in joint
venture exploration programs (PCR, Part I, para. 5.05).
Sustainabilltv
8.       As long as GOP cc.tinues its policy of "market" pricing of resource
commodities, namely, oil and gas, the international oil industry should be
attracted to participate in the development of Pakistan's petroleum industry
(PCR, Part I, para. 5.04). The experience in resource development gained by OGDC
should translate into more effective implementation of those exploration and
development programs with the private sector where OGDC is a participant (PCR,
Part I, para. 5.05).
Findings and Lessons
9.       The  project experience highlights  the  importance  of structuring
government policy, with regard to pricing and contractual agreements, to be
compatible with the practices of the international industry, in this case the
petroleum industry, in order to ensure that government is successful in
attracting private sector (international and domestic companies) participation
in the development of the domestic industry (PCR, Part I, paras. 4.02, 5.02,
and 5.04).
10.      In every project, time or schedule delay is important and impacts upon
the economic and financial results of the project. This is especially true with
exploration and development programs.   Care must be taken to ensure that
procurement procedures are compatible with both industry standards and Bank
guidelines. In this project, the Bank's first joint venture exploration and
development program, greater care should have been taken (at project inception)
to facilitate the use of LIB procedure which is an industry standard and also
appropriate in the Bank's Petroleum Lending Guidelines (PCR, Part I, paras. 6.02,
6.03, and 6.04). In retrospect, an in-country seminar on procurement procedures,
at the outset of project implementation, would have identified a potential
problem and resulted in a more expeditious resolution (PCR, Part I, paras. 6.03
anl 6.04).

2.  Backgroun d
2.01     In the decade preceding project appraisal in 1985, Pakistan had been
actively developing its indigenous energy resources, in particular natural gas,
oil and hydro electricity, with the stated goal of limiting oil Imports.
However, despite the efforts to implement this strategy, the country remained
heavily dependent on imported oil to meet its primary energy needs., Over 901
of the oLl demand was met through imports which totalled US$1.5 billion in FY84,
equivalent to 23X of total imports.
2a.f     Although Pakistan's strategy of developing indigenous energy resources
reo.%,  the share of oil in the total energy supply from 451 to 361 in 1980-
82, the ratio rose to 391 in 1983-84.  During this same period, oil imports
increased by more than 331. This increase reflected the significant growth in
total energy demand, in comparison to the modest domestic oil reserves and
corresponding low rate of production.   Studies had shown that without major
policy initiatives, net oil imports would double by FY89 and quadruple by FY93.
This would impose pressure  on the balance of payments that could seriously
impair the country'^ prospects for continued economic growth.
2.03     In its dialogue with the Government of Pakistan (GOP),  the Bank
constantly stressed the critical importance of accelerating the exploration and
development of doraestic energy resources to substitute for imported oil, and the
need to encourage greater private sector participation in the implementation and
financing of energy investments. With the emergence of gas shortages and higher
imported oil costs, GOP recognized the urgency of these measures and instituted
a range of policy reforms which were expected to result in a considerable
improvement in the energy situation in the medium term.
2.04     To achieve a better balance in the energy demand-supply relationship,
GOP identified the following key measures:
(a) energy management and conservation programs to limit the growth
in demand through price and non-price policy instruments;
(b) accelerated development of proven oil and gas fields and
intensified exploration for additional domestic energy reserves
including oil, gas, and coal; and
(c) increased participation of private companies in the financing and
implementation of energy investments.



2.05     To accomplish the last two measurAs, the need for an oil and gas project
was  identified in 1980.   As preparation work proceeded,  the project was
subsequently split into two operations: the Second Toot Oil and Gas Development
Project, Loan 2374-PAK, approved in January 1984; and the Petroleum Exploration
Project, Loan 2351-PAK, approved in October 1983.   These projects have been
successfully  completed,  and  the  PCR's have been prepared.    The  results
accomplished on these two related projects provided some of the foundation for
the Petroleum Resources Joint Venture Project, which was appraised in February
1985
2.06     As part of its strategy to encourage private sector participation in
the energy sector, G0P was pursuirng a number of joint ve' .t re programs in several
concession areas.    GOP and the government-owned 0iii and Gas Development
Corporation (OGDC) had financial obligations from these joint venture programs,
but only limited resources were available. The government and the international
oil companies active in Pakistan indicated strong interest in Bank involvement
in the financing of joint ventures to complement Government resources.
2.07     The Petroleum Resources Joint Venture Project evolved from a series of
discussions between GOP, OGDC, international oil companies engaged in oil and
gas operations in Pakistan, and the Bank. Preparation was done by OGDC and the
Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions, Ministty of Petroleum and Natural
Reso'arces, with assistance from the three petroleum concession holders, Bank
st-.t, and consultants.
3. Pr.oect Obilectives and Descrintion
3.01     The main objective of the project was to support GOP's strategy for
accelerated development of the petroleum sector by stimulating private sector
participation and by concentrating OGDC's responsibilities on the implementation
of priority investments in the subsector, particularly the development of already
discovered oil and gas fields.    Specifically,  the project would provide
assistance in:
(a)  ensuring the timely implementation of the essential exploration/
appraisal programs in three joint-venture exploration licenses;
(b)  accelerating the full utilization of the oil and gas production
potential from these three joint-ventures through the construction
and rehabilitation of the required infrastructure facilities;
(c)  attracting private sector investment in exploration/appraisal
programs in new joint venture concession areas; and
(d)  improving the technical and administrative capabilities of three
general directorates of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural
Resources which are responsible for implementing GOP's subsector
development strategy.



-3-
3.02     The project had four components:
(a)  Exploration/Appraisal in the North Potwar block;
(b)  Exploration/Appraisal in the Badin block;
(c)  Exploration/Appraisal in new joint ventures to be entered into Tay
GOP/OGDC;
(d)  Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural
Resources xl(PNR).
3.03     Estimated cost of the project was $282.3 million, of which $206.2
million was foreign exchange costs. The Bank loan of $55 million was to finance
27% of the fcreign exchange requirements, with the private sector participants
providing 57% of the foreign exchange. GOP was to onlend $35 million to OGDC
to finance OGDC's participation in the project; $20 million was to be retained
by GOP to finance its share in existing joint venture development agreements.
4. Project Organization and Imnlementation
4.01     OGDC  was  established  in  1961  as  the  government-owned  statutory
corporation responsible for engaging in and promoting petroleum exploration and
development.   OGDC was to represent GOP's interest, and/or to take a direct
interest itself, in joint venture operations with international oil companies.
4.02     Implementation of the joint venture components of the project were the
responsibility of the "Operators" for individual joint venture areas.   In
accordance with the Joint Operating Agreements among partners, the "Operator"
was obligated to submit all key project decisions for approval to the other
partners, usually through the formal Operating Committee. WitMln the approved
program and budget, the "Operator" vas given a free hand in running the project.
However, all members of a joint verture were kept informed on a regular basis
of the progress of operations, the results of well tests, procurement activities,
and disbursements.
4.03     Of the twenty-three new joint ventures formed through November 1990
(eight joint ventures signed since loan closing), OGDC was designated the
"Operator"  for two programs.    International oil companies served as the
"Operator" for the remaining joint venture agreements.
4.05     Under the related Petroleum Exploration Project, Lo-n 2351-PAK, the Bank
financed a consultant's study to review the technical and administrative
capabilities of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions (DGPC), one of
the four Directorate Generals within MPNR. The report identified the needs of
DGPC, and MPNR planned to use the recommendations as a model ..:,r upgrading the
capabilities of the Directorate Generals of Gas (DGG) and |1  (DGO).   GOP
authorized the directorauos, in particular DGPC, to seek bi-lateral funds to
facilitate the implementation of the consultant's recommendations.  However,
there was a delay in obtaining bi-lateral funds and hence the recommandations



-4-
were not implemented under this Loan. Subsequently, DGPC obtained grant fund
from USAID to implement the improvement program identified by the consultants.
This program is currently ongoing. With regard to the upgrading of the technical
and administ: -tive capabilities of MPNR th:s is being addressed under the
currently proposed Domestic Energy Resources Development Project, and the TOR
for an organizational review of MPNR has been prepared by the Bank.
5. Pro1ect Results and Sustainabilitv
5.01     At project inception, OGDC was involved in two joint venture exploration
programs with Occidental in the Potwar Basin and with Union Texas Petroleum in
the Badin area. As of November 1990 twenty-three new joint venture agreements
have been signed: nine prior to project completion; six during thle period from
project completion to loan closing; and eight subsequent to loan closing.
5.02     The success of the project, as measured by the level of interest from
the international petroleum industry and the number of joint venture agreements
executed, is a direct result of GOP's efforts to restructure its gas producer
price policy by creating a direct link between the border price of fuel oil and
the wellhead price for gas, net of discount for geological conditions of the
concession. Under the Energy Sector Loan I (2552-PAK), the gas price was set
at 66Z of fuel oil parity for new concessions with possible application to old
concessions. Under Energy Sector Loan II (3107-PAK), the producer price of gas
for offshore concessions was moved to full parity with border price of fuel oil.
This policy change has been well received by the exploration companies as it
closely reflects the practice of the international petroleum industry and
provides the necessary incentives for private oil companies to undertake the
technical and financial risks associated with explo)6ation and development
programs.
5.03     The following major oil and gas discoveries were made Curing the life
of the project: seven new oil flelds in the Badin Block by Union Texas Pakistan;
an oil field in the Potwar Block by Occidental; gas field at Qadirpur by
OGDC/Premier; and gas field at Kandanwari by Lasmo/OGDC. Estimated additions
to reserves were: more than 30 mmbbl of oil in Potwar; 13 mmbbl of oil in Badin;
and 25 mmbbl of oil ana more than 2 tcf of gas from new joint ventures.
5.04     If GOP continues its efforts to achieve "market" pricing of resource
commodities, such as gas and oil, it is likely that the international petroleum
industry will continue to be a willing participant in Pakistan's program to
develop its indigenous resource base.
5.05     The experience gained through its participation in 3oint venta4re
exploration programs with international oil companies has enabled OGDC to
effectively act as a catalyst in promoting exploration ventures with the
international petroleum companies and on limited basis to perform as a competent
"Operator" where designated under a joint venture concession agreement. OGDC's
continued objective should be to act as a catalyst in attracting private sector
investments while at the same time reduce its own exploration commitments.



6. PXrforance of the Bank and tho Borrower
6.01     The performance of the Bank from project identification through project
completion was. apart from the handling of certain procurement procedures (PCR,
Part I. para. 6.04). generally satisfactory. Supervision missions were frequent
and were always adequately staffed with technical specialists who could provide
souwd professional advice to OGDC and GOP.
6.02     In an  exp.vration project,  it is  important  that  administrative
procedures not impact field activities.  The procuremer't procedures for the
project did not coni:ain the standard larguage of most oil and gas projec,t legal
documentation, which is recognized as appropriate in the Petroleum Lending
Guidelines (OMS 3.82). Specifically, provisions allowing for (1) post review of
small value tenders and (2) use of LIB procedures for specialized well services
and goods up to a certain limit were omitted.
6.03     In addition to being recognized as appropriate by the Bank, these
procedures are also standard practice in the international petroleum industry.
As a result, the international oil companies, as "Operators" of the joint venture
programs, followed their own LIB procurement practices which put them in conflict
with the project legal documents. This problem surfaced during a November 1986
Supervision Mission.
6.04     Resolution was ef.  _ad in two ways: (1) de facto approval was given for
a number of contracts and (2) the project legal documents were amended in May
1987. The Bank can be considered remiss on two counts, namely, to adequately
review at project inception the procurement procedures for appropriateness to
project requirements and to expedite the necessary amendments once the problem
and solution had been identified. Procurement agreed in December 1986 that LIB
was appropriate for the ptoject, was in accordance with Bank guidelines, and that
amendments to the project legal documents shouald be processed. However, five
months elapsed before the amendments were transmitted to the Borrower.
6.05     The performance of GOP and OGDC in promoting joint venture exploration
programs was satisfactory. To conclude twenty-three joint venture agreements
during a period of worldwide reduction in exploration activities is a significant
accomplisbment.
7. Consulting Services
7.01     It was anticipated that bi-lateral credits would be available on time
to finance the Technical Assistance component of the project (para. 4.05). This
was not the case as there was a delay of bi-lateral resources, and implementation
of this component had to be deferred to the proposed Domestic Energy Resources
Development Project.

"OGDC should act as a catalyst to attract the Private Seccor

with International oil companies for concession rights."
Unquo te
The OGOC beiag a nacional oll company cannot per se reduce its

1/ Breakdown of costs and financing based on GOP and OGDC working interest In: 1) post-discovery phase for
North Potwar and Beadin concessions; 2) pre-dfscovery phase of New Joint Ventures; and 3) post-discovery
phase for Chakwal concession (new JV). The overalt differences in the actual project cost as coamred to
apprasat ost1mate are due to: (a) higher costs in North Potwar concession resutting from accelerated
f mpLmentat10n of water injection schec. (secondory recovery); (b) reduced expenditures in Badin eoncession
attributed to lack of potential reserves and inadequate field structures resulting in fewer step-out and
appraisal welts; and tc) reduced costs for New Joint Ventures due to detays by GOP fn approving Joint
Venture proposals in addition to diminished interest in new ventures because of the international oil price
etwirorment. Revised allocation of loan proceeds in January 1987 reftected these changes in the project
conditions.

6. Project Results
A. Direct Benefits
6.01     There has been a significant increase in private investment in the
petroleum industry. Twenty-three new joint venture agreements for exploration
and development were executed through November 1990. Eight of these agreements
were signed after the loan was closed.
6.02     Commercial diccoveries of oil, condensate, or gas were made. During the
period 1986-1990, production from the North Potwar and Badin Concessions and from
the New Joint Venture fields totaled 66 mmbbl of oil, 127 bcf of gas and 234 m
tons of condensate.
6.03     Progress has been made in the policy area with the movement toward a
more "market" oriented gas pricing formula tied to the international price of
fuel oil.
6.04     The operations and management skills of OGDC have improved through
OGDC's participation in joint venture programs with international oil companies.
B.  Financial Performance/Impact
6.05     OGDC's income statements, balance sheets and sources and applications
of funds statements, comparing the SAR forecasts with actual results for the
period 1986-89, are presented in Annex 1. A summary of OGDC's operating results
for the same period, 1986-89, is presented in the following table.

6.06     OGDC's financial performance during the project implementation period
was satisfactory, despite adverse conditions that prevented it from achieving
the level of sales projected in the SAR. Actual crude oil sales increased from
3.6 million barrels in 1986 to 4.8 million barrels in 1989, an average annual
increase of 7.71 compared to the SAR forecast of 7.11.   Natural gas sales
increased from 27.2 bcf in 1986 to 53.5 bcf in 1989, an average annual increase
of 18.52 compared to the SAR forecast of 21.6X. Although the rate of increase
approximated the rate estimated in the SAR, the actual sales volume in 1986 was
only half the estimate. As a result, sales of crude oil and natural gas were,
on average for the 1986-1989 period, only 51.6X and 45.31, respectively, of the
SAR projections. Three factors were at play: overly optimistic sales estimates
for the initial years; diversion of scarce OGDC resources into exploration; and
delay in putting fields into production.
6.07     Although sales volumes were approximately 501 lower than the SAR
projections, production expenses were only 131 lower. General and administration
expenses more than doubled during the period and were, on average, 351 higher
than the forecast.   Interest expense, as expected, was only 61 below the
projection.  Because of the high production costs per unit of sales and the
growing administration costs, the operating ratio deteriorated slightly over the
period, compared to the SAR estimate.
