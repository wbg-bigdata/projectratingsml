CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower                : Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
Beneficiaries           : Eligible Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) includ-
ing public and private sector comercial banks and
development financing institutions. These would include:
Bank of Ceylon (BOC', Commercial Bank of Ceylon (CBOC),
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC), Hatton
National Bank (HNB), National Development Bank (NDB), the
Peoples Bank (PB), and Sampath Bank (SB). Technical
assistance would be provided to the PCIs, the Presiden-
tial Tariff Commission (PTC), Export Development Board
(EDB), the Ministry of Industries and Scientific Affairs
(4ISA), and the National Telecommunications Commission
(NTC).
Credit Amount           : SDRs 31.7 million (US$43.8 million equivalent)
Terms                   :  Standard, with 40 years maturity.
Co-Financing            : The Asian Development Bank (ADB) proposes to provide
US$40.5 million, inclusive of technical assistance of
US$1.0 million, for project financing through a parallel
line of credit on terms and conditions similar to those
cf the proposed Project.
Onlending Terms         : The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) would relend the
credit proceeds to eligible PCIs for 18 years including a
three year grace period, at a variable rate aligned with
the average of the Average Weighted Prime Rate (AWPR) for
overdraft facilities prevailing over the previous six
month period, less a spread of 4X. Given the absence of
facilities in Sri Lanka for hedging long-team foreign
exchange risk, GOSL would bear the foreign exchange risk
on repayments to IDA. The implicit compensation to GOSL
for taking the foreign exchange risk would be variable
and set by the market as the difference between the
GOSL's onlending rate to the PCIs and the international
cost of foreign funds to Sri Lanka. The use of a market
determined variable AWPR as a reference point for deter-
mins!g GOSL's onlending rate, together with GOSL's
fleribible exchange rate management, will ensure that
borrowing costs reflect foreign exchange risk on a con-
tinuous basis. Based on current interest rates present
GOSL compensation would be 3Z. The PCIs would onlend the
proceeds to sub-borrowers at market determined rates. On
the basis of the present AUPR and spread requirements,
the relending rate would be between 13Z-162 p.a. Inter-
est rates, foreign exchange compensation rates and
spreads would be reviewed semi annually on or about
January 1 and July 1 with appropriate adjustment of the

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO SRI LANKA
FOR A THIPD INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to Sri Lanka for SDR 31.7 million (US$43.8 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and help finance an industrial development project.
The project would be confinanced by AD8 for SDR 29.0 million (US$ 40.5 mil-
lion equivalent).
2.      Background.  Over the last decade GOSL has made significant progress
in liberalizing its exchange rate regime and trade, finance and industrial
policies by removing import restrictions, simplifying the investment approval
process, rationalizing the export incentive structure, curtailing budgetary
support to public manufacturing enterprises (PMEs) and reducing trade
weighted average nominal tariffs to 15%. As a result, the share of the
previously dominant public manufacturing sector of total manufacturing output
has been reduced from 60% to 40%, and a more efficient and dynamic private
sector has developed, achieving a robust growth performance of about 132 p.a.
during 1983-87. The policy focus and technical assistance programs under
IDA's small and medium scale industry (tMI) and industrial development
projects (IDP) have strengthened financial intermediaries' capabilities to
make industrial term loans, contributed significantly toward the successful
liberalization of trade and industrial policy, and provided considerable
support for the development of private sector industrial enterprises. In its
Industrial Policy Statement (IPS) published in March 1987, GOSL attached
continued high priority to the development of private sector industry as a
means to diversify the country's economic base and generate enough employment
opportunities to reduce the high level of unemployment. However, although
significant progress has been made in achieving economic liberalization, GOSL
still requires considerable support to expand and reform the industrial
finance system and to continue to implement agreed reform programs to address
a number of structural weaknesses, such as public industrial sector inef-
ficiencies, poor adoption of appropriate technology, absence of a developed
capital market, and shortages of critical human skills.
3.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  As noted above IDA has worked closely
with GOSL since 1977 to develop and implement a broad based program of trade,
industry and financial policy reforms which would create a suitable environ-
ment for the increased participation of the private sector in an area once
dominated by public manufacturing enterprises; the broad objectives of this
approach were initiated under the ongoing First and Second Industrial
Development Projects--Cr.1401-CE and Cr.1692-CE--and are now spelt out in
GOSL's IPS. The credit component under the ongoing IDP projects has also
progressed satisfactorily with commitment and disbursement ahead of schedule;
performance of subprojects with ex-post economic rates of return ranging from
15X-40% and average collection performance (80%) have also been satisfactory.
The proposed project forms an integral part of IDA's sectoral development
strategy and is closely related to the ongoing IDP projects and a proposed
Public Enterprise Restructuring Project now under preparation which would



-2-
focus on the role, structure and efficiency of a number of public enterprises
in major subsectors including cement, textiles, and telecommunications. The
thrust of the proposed project reflects a continuation of an incremental,
broad-based operational strategy to achieve a well-balanced, synergic policy
and structural framework conducive to industrial development. This approach
recognizes that the project's efforts in supporting industrial financial
institutions and private sector enterprises Are likely to succeed only if
conceived in the context of the overall industrial/trade/financial sector
framework and supported by necessary policy and institutional reforms. To
make this approach viable in the context of an investment project the
proposed project is designed to support continued implementation of the
reform programs already agreed with GOSL under IDP-I and IDP-II and would
also provide support for the implementation of GOSL's IPS and an IMF's Struc-
tural Adjustment Facility (SAF).
4.      Project Objectives.  The overall objectives of the proposed project
are to channel funds to private industries, strengthen the credit delivery
system and address issues which constrain development of a more efficient
private manufacturing sector. More specific project objectives are to (a)
ensure a stable, more competitive flow of term finance to private industry by
widening participation to include commercial banks and increasing the range
of services offered by them; (b) continue institution building programs for
DFCC and NDB, including implementation of strategy/corpotate planning recom-
mendations aimed inter alia at service diversification and enhanced human
resource development program; (c) assist in developing a more efficient
capital market to increase the sources of equity finance for industry; (d)
strengthen industrial technology development by assisting in formulation of a
detailed technology development program; (e) assist GOSL to prepare and
implement its Second Export Development Plan (FY88-FY92); (f) assist GOSL to
implement the next agreed phase of tariff reform; (g) provide training for
GOSL/PCI staff to implement environmental impact assessment guidelines; and
(h) assist GOSL to prepare the regulatory framework to establish an independ-
ent commercial telecommunication authority.
5.      Project Description.  The total cost of the project, including tech-
nical assistance TA , is estimated at US$124.3 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$84.3 million (68Z). IDA would provide a
credit component of US$36.0 million equivalent for term lending through
eligible PCIs to medium/large scale private and mixed public manufacturing
enterprises and a TA comeonent of US$7.8 million equivalent. ADB would
provide US$40.5 million (inclusive of US$1.0 million for TA) through a paral-
lel line of credit. Subprojects eligible for financing would involve new
investment and the balancing, modernizing and rehabilitation (BMR) of private
enterprises in the industrial, agro-industry and industrial services sectors.
A limited number of public enterprises with private sector shareholdings or
operating under private sector management service contracts would be eligible
for BHIR on a case by case basis. All subprojects would need to be finan-
cially viable, and an environmental impact assessment in accordance with
GOSL's environmental impact guidelines would be carried out for all subloans
above US$500,000. The PCIs would calculate ERRs on all subloans above
US$250,000 or subprojects producing products with a nominal tariff protection
of 50% or more; the ERR threshold would be 15%. Subject to meeting agreed



-3-
eligibility conditions, two development financing institutions and five
commercidl banks would participate in the project. Eligibility conditions
for commercial bank participation would include appropriate staff levels,
maximum risk asset/equity ratios and minimum annual profitability, provisions
for bad debt and collection ratios. Project funds are expected to be fully
utilized within seven years. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disburse-
ments, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Sri
Lanka are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7230-CE dated June 28, 1988 is being dis-
tributed separately.
Agreed Actions.  As conditions for credit effectiveness it has been
agreed that (i) GOSL should present to Cabinet and IDA proposals incorporat-
ing appropriate legal and administrative measures to achieve substantial
improvements to the existing debt recovery framework; and (ii) at least two
PCIs which have fulfilled all other relevant conditions of participation
should have signed a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with GOSL. Agreement has also
been reached with GOSL on (a) PCI strategies, operating policies, training
programs, portfolio monitoring criteria, financial ratios, subproject
reviews, lending terms and conditions, and reporting requirements; (b) the
use of the Average Weighted Prime Rate (AWPR) as the market reference rate
for setting term lending rates and on semi-annual reviews of the mechanism
for determining interest rates and spreads and appropriate adjustments as
necessary to reflect movement in the market reference rate and remain posi-
tive in real terms vis-a-vis inflation rates; (c) an implementation program
to revise the tariff structure as agreed under the IMF SAP; (d) an action
program to prepare proposals to reduce undue legal and administrative delays
in recovery of debt; (e) the timetable for a core action program for
implementing the Second Export Development Plan (PY88-PY92); (f) a timetable
for the review of the regulatory and tax environment for capital market
transactions; (g) an action program to dev-lop a policy framework and
institutional support for industrial technology development; (h) an action
program to strengthen operations of the DFCC and NDB; and (i) joint IDA/ADB
performance review criteria for monitoring of the reform process.
7.      Benefits.  Direct benefits of the lending component would include
about US$110.0 million of additional fixed and permanent working capital
investment, with about $70 million in incremental annual output once projects
have become ,ully operational. The expected direct creation of 8,500 jobs
and its multiplier effects is particularly important in the light of rising
unemployment; in addition the productivity of workers in existing enterprises
would be increased through BMR. Export volumes would depend on the composi-
tion of subprojects presented by the PCIs. Subproject performance is
expected to be strong, with economic and financial rates of return in excess
of 15Z. Through the TA component, the project is also expected to yield
direct benefits in improving manufacturers' access to debt/equity financing
by strengthening the capital market and to appropriate technology needed to
improve competitiveness. It would also ensure a stable, more competitive
flow of term finance to private industry by widening participation of credit



-4-
ingtitutiong to iazlude commercial banks and increasing Lh range of serv-
ices. Technical assistance to upgrade the PCIs' operations and to improve
their suboactor analysis and promotion efforts are expected to result in an
increased proportion of term landing to subsectors with stronger forward and
backward linkages (e.g. agro industries, rubber products, chemical and
engineering industries). Improvements in tsriff structure and export incen-
tivea would encourage increased investment in efficient industrial
enterprises based on Sri Lanka's comparative advantages.
8.      Risks.  The success of the lending component would depend on tlhe
effective operation of the PCIs.  The risk is expected to be manageable since
satisfactory policies, procedures and standards to appraise the economic and
financial viability of projects and to supervise implementations are in
place. As an additional safeguard, participation oi the two government PCIs
(the BOC and PB) would only be considered after completion of the comprehen-
sive operating reviews being carried out under the Third SMI Project
(Cr.1860-CE), to be followed by initial implementation. Another risk of the
lending component is that an adequate number of eligible subprojects might
not materialize due to the continuing ethnic conflict. However, since the
actual pipeline and loan projections for the PCIs indicate credit demand well
in excess of the amounts to be provided under the project and no other lines
of credit are presently available, full commitment of the IDA credit is
expected to be achieved within four years. Moreover, most of the industrial
activity and subprojects are concentrated in areas not directly affected by
the conflict. Since the proposed project supports the implementation of
previously agreed trade and industrial policy reform proposals, there should
be few political or institutional objections to the project. As the project
also provides support for implementation of GOSL's Industrial Policy State-
ment and the recently agreed SAP, it will help ensure that the risk involved
in implementing a fairly comprehensive policy reform program is minimized.
9.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approved the proposed credit.

a/  The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report on all
B ank/IDA-financed projects in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulated
to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
b/  As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment IV), undisbured SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar
and the SDt. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursei boalance indicates a dollar
amount greater than the original principal credit amount 4xpressed in dollars.
