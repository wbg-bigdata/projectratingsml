SECOND HIGHNWAY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(LOAN 2297-CH;
PREFACE
This is the P,.oject Completior Report  (PCR)  for the Second Highway
Reconstruction Project in Chile, for which Loan 2297-CH in the amount of US$128
million was approved on May 31, 1983.  The loan was closed and fully disbursed
on June 30, 1990, which is two yearn later than originally expected.  This was
mainly due to expansion of the project scope to meet flood and earthquake-related
emergencies in roads and other transport subsectors.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations Division
of the Latin American and the Caribbean Regional office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III). Part II of the PCR is the translation of the comments
sent by the Borrower with letter dated April 12, 1991.
Preparation of this PCR was based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan
Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower,
internal memoranda, and experience of the authors gained during project
supervision.

(L0AN 2297-CH)
EVALWUATION SUMARY
QJectives
1.    The Second Highway Reconstruction Project shared with the preceding First
Highway Reconstruction Project (Loan 1927-CH) the same sector development
objectives of assisting in the profound reorganiaLtion of the transport sub-
sector that the Government had initiated in 1975, and of strengthening the
physical and institutional capacity in the road transport aector within a broad
plan of fostering economic growth (para. 2.01).  In particular, the project
objectives were to: (a) arrest serious deterioration of some sections of the
Basic Network; (b) impLement a planning and management system for road and bridge
rehabilitation and maintenance; (c) assist i1 the preparation of a multiyear road
program, including satisfactory maintenance programs; and (d) assist in the
analysis of transport sector issues (para. 3.01).
ImDle.nentation Experience
2.    Project  implementation  started  in  a timely  and  efficient  manner.
Devaluation of the Chilean peso with respect to the US dollar, efficient
procurement and keen competition in the construction industry resulted in lower
costs than those estimated at appraisal. This allowed expansion of the project
scope to include: (a) a slight expansion of the road reconstruction program and
financing of emergency repair of damages produced by heavy floods (1984); (b)
financing of emergency repair of damages to roads, ports and railways caused by
an earthquake (1985); and (c) an increase in the overall disbursement rate for
civil works from 45% to 50% and in disbursements for ports and railroads
emergency works to 60%.  Despite efficient exeeution of the civil works for
roads, the expansion of the project scope and the slow execution of the port
emergency works required extension of the closing date from June 30, 1988 to June
30, 1990 (paras. 5.01 through 5.05).
Reults
3.    The project met fully its original objectives as well as the additional
objectives for repair of flood and earthquake dwaage. The general condition of
the Basic Road Network was improved to a high standard and at a lower cost than
estimated at appraisal.   Under the project the Borrower's Road Directorate
(Vialidad) strengthened considerably its road maintenance capacity, started
implementation of a road maintenance management system, and established a more
balanced, rolling four-year road program which increased maintenance expenditures
from 26% of total road expenditures for the period 1982-85 to 55% for the period



- iii -
1986-89.   Through the implementation of three transport studies the project
assisted in:  (a)  analysis of intermodal transport between Santiago and the
ports of San Antonio and Valparaiso; (b) analysis of the efficiency of Chile's
Transport System; and (c) feasibility and preliminary engineering studies for
reconstruction of the two above mentioned ports.    Tmplementation of the
recommendations of the first two studies was postponed as a result of earthquake
damage to the ports and need for further clarification of government policies.
All works for emergency repair of flood and earthquake damages to the road,
railroad, and port systems were carried out efficiently and at low cost (para.
6.01).
4.    The economic rates of return of a sample of 14 rehabilitated road F. tionb
(totalling 578 Km) were ex-DOst estimated to vary between 15% and 57%, with a
mean value of 34%, which was the same as estimated at appraisal. The economic
rates of return of seven road sections including major bridges varied from 35%
to above 100%, with a mean value of 71% compared to 32% estimated at appraisal
(para. 6.02). The project had a positive impact on strengthening the capacity
of the Borrower's Ministry of Public Works (MOP) to program and carry out a well-
balanced multiyear road program, and to upgrade the national road system and
improve its maintenance (para. 6.03).
5.    The sustainability of the results achieved under the project is ensured by:
(a) the excellent quality of works execution; (b) the substantial strengthening
of MOP's capacity in all aspects of road management; (c) the continued dialogue
between MOP and the Bank for the preparation and execution of the two succeeding
Road Sector Loans; and (d) the strengthening of other transport subsectors
through subsequent Bank loans (paras. 7.01 and 7.02).
Findinas and Lessons Learned
6.    Detailed preparation of the project  and careful  assessment  of the
Borrower's needs ensured satisfactory design and execution of the project (para.
8.01).   The noteworthy continuity of Government and Bank staff involved in
project preparation through to its conclusion elicited constructive dialogue and
facilitated timely and high-quality decision-making (para. 8.02).
7.    MOP's remarkable capability in road management was further enhanced through
its interaction with Bank staff, as well as through: continuity, competence and
high motivation of its own staff at all levels, extensive staff training,
establishment of long-term planning, strengthening of road maintenance,
streamlining of administrative procedures, responsible fiscal management, and
effective supervision of works (paras. 9.01 athrough 9.05). The lesson learned
from this project is that the above achievements, coupled with satisfactory
interministerial project relationships and responsive behavior of consultants and
contractors, are the key elements to ensure successful implementation of any
infrastructure project.

2. Backaround
2. 01 The Second Highway Reconstruction Project shared with the preceding First
Highway Reconstruction Project (Loan 1927-CH) the same sector development
Uljc,tives to assist in the profound reorganization of the transport subsector
that the Government initiated in 1975, and to strengthen the physical and
institutional capacity in the road transport sector within a broad plan of
fostering economic growth and development.
2.02 The policy context of this project was to strengthen the capacity of the
Ministry of Public Works (MOP), to upgrade the national road system and improve
its maintenance, and to assist the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications
(MTT) in tackling overall sector and intermodal transport issues. This was in
line with the macro-policy objectives of fostering economic development and the
export capacity of the country.
3. Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.01 Proiect Obiectives. The objectives of the project were to: (a) assist in
financing high priority works to arrest serious deterioration of some sections
of the Basic Network; (b) implement a planning and management system for road and
bridge rehabilitation and maintenance; (c) assist in the formulation of design
and selection criteria for road strengthening and reconstruction; (d) establish
a multiyear roads program with proper balance between various categories of
expenditures; (e) assist in the definition of a satisfactory program for the



-2-
maintenance of local roads; and (f) assist in the analysis of transport sector
policies and issues. In the wake of fLood and earthquake damage, the project
objectives were expanded to assist in repairing the roads, ports, and rail
systems.
3.02 Project Description. The project originally consisted of:
(a) reconstruction and widening of about 580 km of main roads; (b) periodic
maintenance of about 1,400 km of main roads; (c) construction of 35 bridges and
rehabilitation of some 50 bridges and 60 km of access roads (d) procurement of
road maintenance, pavement evaluation, and laboratory equipment, and spare parts;
(e) consulting services for project coordination and supervision, preinvestment,
pavement evaluation and transport sector studies; and (f) trainirng through trips
and scholarships abroad. The following components were added later:
(g) emergency reconstruction of flood-and earthquake damaged roads; (h) civil
works and studies for repair and reconstruction of earthquake-damaged ports; and
(i) emergency repair of diesel locomotives in private workshops after earthquake
damage to a public railroad workshop.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01 Conceptual Foundation. The project was designed as an infrastructure and
institutional strengthening projecL to be cacried out by MOP from mid-1983 to
December 31, 1987. It was to continue arresting serious deterioration of the
Borrower's Basic Network because of increased and heavier traffic and deficient
maintenance, particularly in the 1976-30 period when MOP concentrated its
financial resources on the construction of the Santiago Subway (Metro).  The
project was specifically designed to strengthen MOP's road maintenance capability
and MTT's capacity  to analyze  transport  sector  issues.    This  conceptual
foundation was developed jointly by MOP, MTT, the Ministry of Finance, and the
Bank and was clearly understood by all relevant parties.
4.02  Innovative Aspects.   This project prepared a trend to move away from
lending for tight and clearly defined projects to a sectoral approach tackling
sectoral and institutional issues. An innovative aspect of this project was the
Bank's decision to front-end load disbursements. The Bank agreed to disburse 601
of expenditures on civil works incurred before December 31, 1985 and 30%
thereafter. The foreign exchange component of the project had been estimated at
47Z of project cost.
4.03 During preparation of the project, the Bank agreed to the use in
International and Local Competitive Bidding of an experimental bidding procedure
for civil works that MOP had introduced in 1900. The revised procedure provided
that: (a) the contractor should prepare the final engineering and work quantity
estimates and bid in terms of final cost for completed stages of the works; (b)
the final cost should include physical contingencies but could be adjusted for
inflation; and (c) the selected contractor would be paid after completion of
specific stages of works (para. 9.03).
4.04 Preparation of the Project. Preparation of the project took place during
implementation of the MOP program to reconstruct 1,200 km of the Longitudinal
Highway (410 km under own finanzing, 540 km under financing of the Inter American
Deve!' oment Bank (IDB) and 250 km financed under Loan 1927-CH). During execution



-3-
of that program, othLr road sections deteriorated to conditions not compatible
with traffic demand. The Borrower realized the need for adequate analysis of
road transport sector lssues and for preparation and execution of satisfactory
road maintenance programs. Dialogue with the Bank on these issues led to timely
and appropriate preparation of the project, including adequate dimensioning of
scope and ucale of wcrks, careful preparation of studies, bidding procedures and
implementation programs, and satisfactory provision of financial resources on an
incremental basis to reduce the shortfall of maintenance.
4.05 On the other hand, the fixed rate of the Chilean peso against the US dollar
during project preparation and evaluation, and later devaluation during project
impolementation resulted in high project cost estimates, and produced a surplus
in the financing capacity of the loan.
4.06  Role  and  Responsibilities.    The  fundamental  role  of  MOP  and  the
complementary roles of MTT and the Ministry of Finance in project implementation,
as well as the responsibilities of each department within MOP's Roads Directorate
(Vialidad) were well defined and clearly understood.
4.07 Contribution to Success. The clear understanding by all relevant parties
of the conceptual foundation of the project and their respective roles and
responsibilities in its implementation, the careful preparation of a well
balanced program, and the disciplined execution by Vialidad contributed
substantially to the success of the project.
5. Proiect Implementation
5.01 Variances in Imolementation. Project implementation started in a timely
and efficient manner. Project costs in US dollars declined significantly when
the Chilean peso was devalued with respect to the US dollar, and efficient
procurement and keen competition in the construction industry further resulted
in lower project costs than those estimated at appraisal. However, the foreign
exchange costs as a percentage of the total cost increased from 47% at appraisal
to 53.3% by the end of 1984. (Average 51.4% over the life of the project, Part
III, Section 5.) The resulting surplus financial capacity of the loan allowed
the Bank to assist Chile in two successive emergencies: heavy floods that
affected northern and central Chile in July 1984 and an earthquake that struck
the central part of the country on March 5, 1985. The first two amendments to
the loan agreemeant (dated February 15 and April 5, 1985) provided for: (a)
increasing the .uthorized allocation in the Special Account from US$5 million to
US$9 million; ,b) increasing the length of transversal roads to be reconstructed
from 140 to 400 km; (c) increasing the number of bridges to be reconstructed or
rehabilitated rfom 35 to 40 ak. from 50 to 60, respectively; (d) repairing storm
damage to about 800 !m of roads, including their river training structures and
a 300 m tunnel; (e) 60% financing during 1985 of the cost of repairs to
earthquake damaged roads, estimated at US$13 million; and (f) easing of
contracting procedures for emergency works to cost less than US$500,000, for a
total not to exceed US$8.0 million.
5.02 On November 13, 1985, the Bank informed the Borrower that its Board had
approved a third amendment to the loan agreement providing about US$9.0 million
of loan funds for financing of:  (a) studies and civil works for repair and



- 4 -
reconstruction of the earthqvake- damaiged ports of San Antonio and Valparaiso;
(b)  "epair of selected port equipmer';  (c) emergency repair of 10 diesel
locomotives in private workshops aft . earthquake damage to public railroad
workshopst (d) 60% disbursement for ports and railroads emergency works
throughout project implementation; and (e) widen'ng of t'.e amount of eased
emergency procurement procedure  total (from US$8 million to USS12 million).
5.03 In view of further increases of the foreign exchange costs as a percentage
of total project cost, on February 18, 1986, the Bank authorized an increase in
the overall disbursement rate for civil works from 45% to 50% and the maintenance
of the 60% rate of disbursement untll December 31, 1986. By this date 69* of the
loan funds had been disbursed and the Bank agreed to sit the diqbursement rate
for civil works, excluding emergency %. '-a,  A 40% in order not to exceed the
ovezall 50% financing for civil works.    om Ja,,uary 1, 1988 on, this rate of
disbursement was further reduced to 37%.  The w- Aening of the project scope and
the slow execution of the port emergency worku required two extensions of the
closing date. (June 30, 1988 to June 30, 1989, and June 30, 1989 to June 30,
1990).
5.04 Possible Avoidance of Variances and Rigks. At the time of appraisal and
negotiation of the loan, it could not be foreseen that later economic policies
would allow severe devaluation of the Chilean peso, which would result in lower
project costs in dollar terms and in a higher foreign exchange component.
However, in the long run, this variance provided additional funding capacity,
which allowed the Bank to assist Chile promptly and efficier.tly in overcoming the
disastrous consequences of abnormal floods and a devastating earthquake.
5.05 Actions Affecting lmglementation. The continuous and fruitful dialogue
between MOP and the Bank and the timeliness of actions taken to correct and
improve project axecution had a positive effect on project implementation.
6.    Proiect Results
6.01 Proiect Obiectives. The project fully met its original objectives, as well
as the additional objectives for repair of flood and earthquake damages:
(a)  The general condition of the Basic Road Network was improved beyond
targets set at appraisal, the road reconstruction and widening
program targeted at 586 km achieved 840 km, at a total cost 43%
lower than originally estimated (US$80 million instead of US$140
million). This effort contributed to a substantial strengthening of
MOP's capacity to contract and execute this type of civil works.
(b)   Under the project, Vialidad strengthened considerably the capacity
of its maintenance department and started implementation of a
maintenance management system by: (i) participation of 70
maintenance engineers in the First Lati American Road Mrintenance
Seminar organized jointly in August 1983 by MOP, the United Nations
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and
the Bank; (ii) participation of Vialidad's top management and
maintenance planning staff at several international conferences on
road maintenance and pavement management combined with visits to



-5-
road maintunance or,anizations of the host countries;
(iii) organization of biannual me-in6r of all rood maintenance
engineers to share the international and local experiences and
discuss requirements for strengthening the road maintenan^e system;
(iv) strengthening the structure of its maintenance department; (v)
application of Bank's Highway Design and M&intenance Standards Model
(HDM) in the planning of road maintenance; (vi) modernization and
atreamlining of its maintenance equipment fleet; (v'ii) acquisition
of pavement research and laboratory equipment and launching of a
comprehensive, long term resaarch program on the behavior of
flexible an* rigid pavements, and (viii) familiarization of its
staff with the use of the third generation of the HDM Model and
preparation of a comprehensive, four-year 1986-89 Road Maintenance
Program So be financed under t:he subsequent Road Sector Project,
Loan 2589-CH.
(c)   The familiarization with the use of the HDM model provided V.alidad
with an effective system to program road maintenance and
reconstruction works. The pavement research program was geared to
improve design of these works.
(d)   During project preparation Vialidad established a rolling four- year
road program, which is updated every year, and succeeded in
incrcoasing maintenance expenditures from 26% of total road
expenditures for the period 1982-85 to 55% for the period 1986-89.
(e)   Early during project implementation, Vialidad carried out a detailed
inventory of the National Road Network dividing it into the Basic
Network and Local Network with clear definition of surface types and
condition of roads. The Basic Network included national, principal
regional and secondary regional roads (23,000 km) and the Local
Network, principal and secondary local roads (56,000 1km).
Subsequently, 't prepared a program to expand gradually road
maintenance from the Basic Network to the Local Network, the
maintenance of whitch had been entrusted in 1976 to the
municipalities. Implementation of this project was started under
the follow-up Road Sector Project, Loan 2589-CH.
(g)   The Study of Intermodal Needs in the Santiago-Fifth Region Corridor
was approved by the Government and the Bank; however, implementation
of its recommendations had to be postponed because of tha earthquake
of March 1985 that resulted in the need to reconstruct the ports
themselves.   This study will be used for further action after
definitive reconstruction of ports is underway.   The Efficiency
Study was also pushed to the background and later completed by MTT
and ECLAC.   It is being reevaluated by the new Government.   The
Ports of the Fifth Region Study, following the rejection of
conclusions of the Japanese port study, became the basis for port
investments under the proposed First Infrastructure Sector Project.



-6-
(h)   The project also fulfilled completely the additional objectives oft
(i) repair or reconstruction of all roads damaged by the July 1984
flood; (ii) repair of all roads and bridges damaged by the March
1985 earthquake; (iii) execution of emergency repair works of the
San Antonio and Valparaiso ports and studies for reconstruction of
both ports, and (iv) repair of diesel locomotives for the State
Railway and for the San Antonio port.
6.02 Eco,nomic Results. As explained in Section 6 B of Part III of this report,
the econ)mic analysis to confirm economic rate of return (ERR) results of the
ippraisal team was carried out on a representative sample of 10 longitudinal and
4 traversal rehabilitated road sections, totalling 578 km, and 7 road sections,
totalling 320 km, in which major bridges were reconstructed or rehabilitated.
The ERR of the 14 road sections varies between 15% and 57%, with a mean value of
34%, w:..ich is the same as forecasted for the same group of sections at appraisal.
The ERR of the seven roau sections including major bridge works varies from 35Z
to above 100%, with a mean value of 71% compared to 32% estimated at appraisal.
Because of the high economic benefits produced by periodic maintenance works,
no particular effort was made at appraisal to establish for this component a
specific economic rate of return. It was estimated at above 50%, in line with
Bank experience in similar projects. Given the increased priority attached by
MOP during project implementation to road maintenance activities in general, and
the reduced costs of all periodic maintenance works carried out under the
project, it can be safely assumed that the actual ERR of the maintenance
component was higher than the one estimated at appraisal. No economic analysis
was carried out for emergency road and port works, since they were designed only
to reestablish previously existing facilities with high rates of return.
6.03  Project Impact.  This project had a positive impact on strengthening MOP's
capacity to program and carry out well-balanced multi)ear road programs, and to
upgrade the national road system and improve its maintenance. The project also
assisted MTT in improving road transportation and in tackling intermodal
transport issues.   Both impacts have been further consolidated under the two
succeeding Road Sector Projects  (Loans 2589-CH and 3120-CH).   Through the
improvement of the basic network and the repair of the two earthquake-damaged
ports, the project fostered economic development of the country and the growth
of its export capacity. These achievements also had beneficial effect on the
physical, technological and social environment.
7.          Project Sustainability
7.01 The excellent quality of the road widening, rehabilitation, and maintenance
works executed under the project, coupled with the substantial strengthening of
Vialidad's capacity for planning, managing, executing, and maintaining annual
road programs and Individual road works, strengthen the sustainability of the
positive results achieved under the project.   This sustainability is further
enhanced by the continued dialogue between MOP and the Bank in the preparation
and execution of the two srucceeding Road Sector Loans, which further strengthened
Vialidad's managerial capability.



- 7 -
7.02 Sustainability of the advance- achieved in transport sector policies is
boing strengthened by actions taken under the two Road Sector Project and the
ongoing Urban Streets and Transport Project (Loan 3028-CH) and will continue to
be fully addressed under a proposed Infrastructure Project.
8.    Bank Performance
8. 01  Preparation and Aopraioal. During project identification, preparation and
appraisal, the Bank carefully assessed the Borrower's need to strengthen MOP
administration and some aspects of its sectoral policies, and successfully
recommended and monitored all actions needed to put together a promising project.
The overvaluation of project cost at appraisal could only have been avoided by
a different forecast at the country economic team level of the sustainability of
the fixed exchange rate. However, the resulting coat underruns allowed the Bank
later to enact timely and effective measures to assist Chile in two successive
emergencies.
8.02 Sujerfi2on. The remarkable continuity of Bank staff involved in project
preparation, appraisal, and supervision elicited constructive dialogue and
support between Bank and MOP staff. Project implementation was monitored closely
by the Bank, drawing attention to potential difficulties in a timely fashion and
replying promptly to emergency assistance requests from the Borrower. It should
be noted that, given the size of the loan (US$128 million), total staff input
from identification to completion (140 staff-weeks) was very low, particularly
considering that about 20% of that input was devoted to preparing and suparvising
the relatively minor ports and railroad emergency components.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.01 Strenath and Weaknesses. As expected at appraisal, the performance of
Vialidad in project execution was of a high standard, mainly due to the
stability, continuity and competence of high, medium, and lower-level staff.
Overall, Vialidad's capability was further improved through close interaction
with Bank staff during project implementation, as well as through: (a) well
planned and broad participation of selected Vialidad staff in international and
local technical meetings; (b) establishment of long-term financial and
operational planning; (c) strengthening of its road maintenance department; (d)
use of the HDN model for maintenance planning, and (e) fine-tuning of its bidding
procedures.
9.02 Payment to consultants and contractors were done promptly (on average five
days after presentation of bills). Disbursement applications to the Bank were
well prepared and forwarded promptly.  Favorable audit reports by the State
Central Administrative Control Office (ContralorLa) were submitted in due time
to the Bank. MOP complied satisfactorily with all loan covenants (Parts III,
Table 7).
9.03 NTT's performance ln the implementation of the studies and works components
under its responsibility was also satisfactory, although it did not have the same
budgetary and staffing possibilities as MOP.  The Railroad Company's (EFE)
performance in contracting the repair of locomotives was satisfactory, but
suffered from limited participation, resulting in relatively high costs.



9.04 Lessons and Ex2eriences. The experimental bidding procedures for civil
works introduced by MOP in 1980 and accepted b' the Bank for use under the
project (para. 4.01) were later modified to permit: (a) two or more contractors
to prepare a joint engineering study as long as each one presented separate bid.
for execution of works; and (b) greater flexibility in monthly advances on the
payments scheduled after completion of specific stages of work.  The system
essentially eliminated claims, and, together with NOPIs swift payment procedures,
resulted in timely and cost-effective execution of works. However, the system
was strongly criticized by the contractor's association. Towards the end of the
project implementation period, MOP reverted to separate prior contracting of the
engineering, with civil works bidding done on the basis of unit prices for
specific work quantities.   It maintained the procedure of paying against
completion of specific stages of works with partial monthly advances. This new
system has proven more effective and has been used successfully under subsequent
Bank-assisted road projects.
9.05    The extraordinary success of this project proves that stability and
competence of staff, careful preparation and planning, sound engineering,
streamlining of administrative procedures, responsible fiscal management, and
effective supervision of works are key elements to warrant project success.
10.     Proiect Relationship
10.01   Bank-Borrower Relations.  The Bank's relationship with MOP, MTT a d the
Ministry of Finance was extremely close and flexible, and facilitated fruitful
interaction and timely decision-making.
10.02   Internal Relations of the Borrower.  The executing ministries, MOP and
MTT, had fluid and flexible relations with the Ministry of Finance, ensuring
timely availability of funding despite general budgetary constraints. The close
working relationship with the GovernmentIs Central Control Office (Contraloria),
which has permanent offices in MOP, allowed the timely preparation of
satisfactory annual auditing reports. The working relation between MOP and MTT,
which initially was somehow strained, improved satisfactorily during project
implementation, except for minor discrepancies on application of training funds.
Further strengthening of the interaction between both ministries will be
necessary to increase effectiveness of transport sector policies.
10.03   Internal relations within MOP, between the minister and the director of
roads, between the director of roads and the chiefs of Vialidad's departments and
regions, as well as among Vialidad's departments and regions were very close and
effective all of which contributed substantially to the project's success.
10.04   Internal relations between MTT and its executing agencies (EMPORCHI for
ports and EFE for railroads) were also quite satisfactory, however, long-term
institutional issues remain to be addressed under the proposed port
(Infrastructure I) and possible railway projects.
11.     Consultina Services/Procurement of Goods and Works
11.01   The transport sector study of intermodal transport between Santiago and
its main ports and the feasibility and preliminary engineering study of the ports



- 9 -
of San Antonio and VL Faraiso were carried out by a joint venture of foreign and
local consultants.  The study of the efficiency of the Chile Transport System was
carried out by local consultants under the transport unit of the Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) as executing agency. The
former studies were completed satisfactorily; however, the intermodal study was
then pushed to the background by the need for reconstruction of the ports
themselves due to an earthquake and by of the Government's disinteres in pursuing
intermodal investments. The study of efficiency of the Chilean Transport System
was only partially completed by the consultant and later completed by MTT and
ECLAC.
11.02   A great number of local consulting firms performed cost effectively and
efficiently in: (a) project coordination (six contracts to two local firms, one
of them formed by an American consultant who has participated continuously and
effectively in Bank-financed projects since 1970); (b) engineering studies (20
contracts to 8 firms) and (c) supervision of works (53 contracts to 14 firms).
The only firm that did not perform satisfactorily was the Chilean branch of a
foreign firm, which was subsequently denied further participation.
11.03   The research programs on rigid (cement concrete) and flexible (asphalt)
pavements were successfully carried out by the Chilean State University and the
Catholic University respectively, under the coordination of an expatriate Chilean
consultant, and continued under subsequent loans.
11.04 Procurement of goods was carried out expditiously and cost effectively.
Vialidad was able to procure 250 equipment units for road maintenance, 4 major
equipment units for road surface condition measurements and for materials
testing, and a great number of smaller laboratory equipment at a cost 10% less
than forecast at appriasal.
11.05   Although international competitive bidding procedures were used to bid
for all civil works costing US$2 million or more, and about 10 foreign firms
expressed interest in participating, none of them were able to bid successfully
against local competition. Eighty-two contracts for road rehabilit"tion and
major maintenance works (costing on average US$2.4 million equivalent) were
awarded to 32 firms and 88 contracts for emergency road works (costing on average
US$150,000), were awarded to 37 firms. Of the total 170 contracts, only 4 were
not completed by the original contractor and had to be recontracted. All works
were successfully completed.
12.     Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01   The Staff Appraisal Report and the legal agreements were well prepared
and provided a useful framework for project implementation.   During project
execution every three months MOP provided comprehensive and clear progress
reports on project status.  Data needed for the preparation of the PCR were
readily available in Bank files. The supervision reports and the Aide Memoire
agreed after each mission were particularly helpful in the preparation of this
report.

PART II:  PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Confirmation of factual information in P'rt III of the PCR
1.01 Specialized MOP and MTT staff have reviewed and approved the statistical
information and the results presented in Part III of the report.
2.    Comment on analysis contained in Part I of the PCR I/
2.01 The following comments are made with reference to the analysis contained
in Part I of the report.
(a)   In the second paragraph of the Evaluation Summary and in paragraphs
5.01 and 5.02 of the report it should be stated that the 60%
disbursement rate on the cost of emergency repairs applied only for
ports and railroads, and not to roads, for which the normal
disbursement rate was used.
(b)   In paragraphs 6g and 11.01 of the report is should be stated that
the efficiency study in the transport sector that was not completed
by the consultants, was later completed by MTT and ECLAC.
(c)   With regard to paragraph 10.02 of the report it should be stated
that relations between MOP and MTT were satisfactory, except for
minor discrepancies on application of training funds.
3.    Evaluation of Bank's Performance
3.01 The great flexibility, good criteria, and excellent predisposition showed
by the Bank during project preparation and implementation, allowed MOP to achieve
expeditiously the agreed targets, confront successfully critical emergency
situations, and obtain unsurpassable outputs from the human and financial
resources available. Special mention should be made of the Bank's willingness
to introduce in October 1984 the use of Statements of Expenditures in the
preparation   of   disbursement   applications,   which   eased   substantially
administrative procedures and preparation of disbursements. It should also be
indicated that in eight cases of civil works bids (out of a total of 170), in
which the lowest evaluated bid exceeded the cost estimates by a substantial
amount, the Bank allowed negotiations with the lowest evaluated bidder. These
negotiations were carried out successfully in all cases, permitting substantial
cost and time savings and satisfactory completion of the works.
3.02 On the other side, it should be stated that the Bank did not send detailed
comments on the audit reports, which could have been conducive to improving
information, accounting, and auditing procedures.  Relations with the Bank's
'/ These comments have been taken into account introducing minor changes
in the wording of the corresponding paragraphs of Part I of the report.

Disbursement department were always harmonious, despite substantial delays in the
remittance of disbursement confirmation notices by this Department at the
beginning of the project implementation period. The situation improved somehow
with the remittance of monthly statements, but these continued to be received
with some delays. Both above mentioned aspects should be reviewed, considering
that, although they do not cause major disruptions in the implementation of the
project, they cause uncertainties and hamper satisfactory control.
4.    Evaluation of the Borrower's Performance
4.01  The project had a substantial impact on MOP's institutional strengthening,
mainly through: (a) introduction of the HDM model in the preparation and
evaluation of projects and in economic planning; (b) the strengthening of the
Maintenance Department and of the technical information system; (c) program of
technical visits abroad; and (d) the pavement research program.
4.02 Through the project, MTT was able tot (a) improve its knowledge about the
different means of transport; (b) define existing problems and defic.encies; (c)
perceive the need to develop information systems; and (d) carry out the swift
reconstruction of the San Antonio and Valparaiso ports after the earthquake.
5.    Assessment of Relations between the Borrower and the Bank
5.01 Relations between the Bank and the MOP and MTT were close and fluent.
Special mention should be made of the technical support received from Bank
missions for the successful implementation and conclusion of the project.

6.     Project Results
A. Direct Benefits
No direct benefits indicators were established at appraisal
B. Economic Impact
1.       At appraisal the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the three main
components of the project was calculated : (a) road reconstructlion and widening
(51% of total project cost); (b) periodic road maintenance (30?); and (c) bridge
construction and rehabilitation (8?). Discrete sections of roads and clusters
of bridges or individual bridges were subject to an independent analysis.
2.      The road sections to'be rehabilitated were analyzed using the Bank's
Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model, Version II (HDM II) computing
vehicle operating costs and time savings as well as road maintenance savings.
Fourteen sections of roads and seven clusters of bridges were subject to economic
reanalysis using the improved HDM III version of the model.   (Three volumes
containing the reanalysis appear in the Project File.)  The comparative results
of both analyses are presented in the table on the next page.  The substantial
decrease in cost of the works (43?) was offset by the considerable decrease of
traffic flow in 1982 and 1983, by changes in the forecast traffic composition and
rate of traffic increases, and by the more conservative parameters of the HDM III
model. As shown in part A of the table, the ERR established at confirmation
varied from 15? to 57Z with a mean value of 34?, the same as the rates obtained
at appraisal.
3.     The road sections including major bridge works were analyzed comparing
each one of them with the best alternative road.  As shown in part B of the
Table, the EPR established at confirmation varied from 35? to above 100?, with
a mean value of some 71Z, which compares favorably with the mean value of 32?
forecast at appraisal.
4.     Because of the high economic benefits rendered by periodic maintenance
works, no particular effort was made at appraisal to establish  a specific
economic rate of return for this component. It was estimated at above 50?, in
line with Bank experience in similar projects.  Given the increased priority
attached by MOP during project implementation to road maintenance activities in
general, and the reduced costs of all periodic maintenance works carried out
under the project, it can be safely assumed that the actual ERR of the
maintenance component was higher than 50?.
C. Financial Impact
1.    Since the project did not involve a revenue producing agency, no financial
evaluation was carried out.

D. Studies
(1)    Intermodal Transport Study of Corridor Santiago-Ports of the Fifth Region
(a)   Purpose as defined at appraisals Study of expected future roles of
the ports of San Antonio and Valparaiso for container traffic to
Santiago, and subsequently of ways to adapt facilities, including
improvement of road and rail access to ports and possible intermodal
container terminal in Santiago.
(b)     Status:  Completed in June 1986.
(c)   Imoact of Study: The study was approved by Government and the Bank;
however, its implementation had to be postponed because of need to
reconstruct ports themselves after earthquake of March 1985 and
reluctance of Government to invest in intermodal facilities. Will
be used as basis for further action after reconstruction of ports is
underway.
(2)     Economic and Institutional Efficiency of Chilean Transoort System
(a)   Puroose as defined at Aopraisal:  This study was rAquested by the
Government at negotiations and its scope and content were to be
defined later.
(b)     Status:  Terminated by the end of 1985 at request of Government.
(c)   Imoact of Study:  As study was interrupted before full completion,
impact was less than expected, although not entirely negligible.
Land transport disequilibrium was explained and concerns about
prolonged oversupply of trucks resided. Expected production of data
was not realized. Identified needs for institutional arrangements
still require further studies, which are being implemented by new
Government.
(3)    Port Development Plan for the Fifth Region and Feasibility of First Phase
(a)   Puroose as defined at ADoraisal:  This study only became necessary
and was defined after the conclusions of a Japanese study, executed
after the earthquake of March 1985, were found unacceptable as basis
for reconstructicn.
(b)     Status:  Completed June 1988.
(c)   Imiact of Study:  Study is basis for port investments under proposed
First Infrastructure Sector Project.
