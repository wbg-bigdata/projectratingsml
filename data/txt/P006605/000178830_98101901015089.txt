II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.   Statement of Objectives
2.01      The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) assist in the financing of high priority works to arrest serious
deterioration of some sections of the Longitudinal Highway and of
the main transversal roads;
(b) assist in the definition of a satisfactory program for the
maintenance of local roads;
(c) implement a planning and management system for road and bridge
rehabilitation and maintenance;
(d) establish a pluriannual highway program with proper balance between
various categories of expenditures; and
(e) assist in the formulation of design and selection criteria for road
strengthening and reconstruction.
B.   Key Indicators
2.02      The project's progress toward the objectives would be measured
using the following key indicators, discussed in paragraph 4.27:
(a) physical progress of Bank-financed civil works;
(b) progress of disbursements;
(c) progress made in procurement of goods;
(d) scope and funding of annual maintenance programs for the basic
network;
(e) progress of key studies; and
(f) number of participants successfully completing the training
programs.
C.   Agreements and Recommendation
2.03      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a) preparing and informing the Bank of an acceptable maintenance plan
for local roads before June 30, 1984 (para 3.22);
(b) detailed studies for the widening of an 11-km section of the
Santiago-Valparaiso road to be submitted to the Bank before call
for bids (para 4.03);



- 3-
(c)  a supplemental letter in which the Government commits itself to
finance the Planned Expenditures for the Basic Highway Network,
1983-1989 (Table 9), to be modified from time to time, in agreement
with the Bank, to take account of changed circumstances
(para 4.10);
(d)  tender packaging and schedule (para 4.21);
(e)  bidding and contracting procedures (para 4.23);
(f)  terms of reference for project coordination and supervision
(para 4.26);
(g)  the purpose of project indicators and the scope of related report-
ing requirements (para 4.27); and
(h)  the requirement for an independent auditor (pa-;a 4.29).  In a
supplemental letter, the Bank will accept Contraloria General de la
Republica as independent auditor subject to agreement on format and
content of audit reports (para 2.04).
2.04      Terms of reference for the national bridge construction,
reconstruction and rehabilitation needs study; for the pavement research
studies and for the preparation of transport sector studies (para 4.26) will
have to be agreed upon before calling for bids, and agreement concerning the
format and content of audit reports (para 4.29) will have to be reached with
the Contraloria General de la Republica during the next supervision mission.
2.05      Subject to the above, the project constitutes a suitable basis for
a Bank loan of US$128 million equivalent. The terms of the loan would be 15
years, including a three-year grace period.
III. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
3.01     Road transport carries about 68% of domestic freight, the railways
carry about 21%, coastal shipping about 7%, and oil pipelines about 4%.  Air
transport handles less than 1%. International goods traffic is more than 90%
by ship (exports about 98%).
3.02      Chile's ports and airports, apart from local traffic, tend to be
final destinations of ships and planes, and, even in inland traffic, north-
bound traffic has trouble finding return loads. As a result, transportation
costs are rather high.
B. Institutional Framework
3.03      Transport policy making in Chile is mainly shared by two
ministries, the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications (MTT), which
is in charge of all modes, and the Ministry of Public Works (MOP), which
is in charge of all transport infrastructure works, but also does highway
planning and is responsible for collection of tolls and the implementation of
the vehicle weighing program; the latter two activities obtain assistance
from the Police Force or "Carabineros." The Planning Office (ODEPLAN)



published a broad, non-quantitative Socio-Economic Program for 1981-1989 and
checks whether proposed investments are justified economically according to
its prescriptions for analysis and whether they fit into the broad program.
C.   Sectoral Strategy
3.04      There have been a number of sector policy changes in Chile since
the middle of the 1970s as the Government is actively introducing measures to
implement its proclaimed market-oriented transport strategies. Most of the
activity occurred in the ports and railway subsectors, but substantive
changes also took place in the Government's relations with the air, maritime
and public road transport subsectors; more market-oriented measures are under
study in the road subsector, mainly related to road user charges and the road
transport industry.
3.05      Ever since it took power in 1973, the Government has pursued the
following strategy:
- eliminate all transport sector subsidies;
- charge air, land and maritime transport for the use of public
infrastructure;
- give freedom to each transport mode to fix its own tariffs,
to design its own services, and to define its own personnel
policies; and
- treat all modes equally in terms of taxes, social services, etc.
3.06      The Government has had a certain amount of success with the
implementation of this strategy, but is not fully satisfied with the working
of the competitive system. It is, therefore, asking the United Nations
Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) and the Bank for assistance in
determining the major obstacles in the way of a better functioning transport
market in Chile. The details of this study would be worked out during
forthcoming supervision missions (para 4.08).
3.07      The Bank has been involved with highway development in Chile since
1961, through four loans and a credit, totaling about US$91 million. The
Bank operations were for the construction, upgrading or rehabilitation of
about 2,500 km of roads; the preparation of feasibility and final engineering
studies for more than 1,500 km; and the building of highway maintenance
capacity through technical assistance and procurement of maintenance equip-
ment.
3.08      The First Highway Construction and Maintenance Project was financed
by Credit 4-CH for US$19 million and Loan 287-CH for US$6 million, both in
June 1961. The Second Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 558-CH for US$13.2
million in September 1968) and the Third Highway Project (Loan 668-CH for
US$10.8 million in June 1970) are the first two projects for which Project
Completion and Project Performance Audit Reports were issued, in 1979 and
1980 respectively. These two projects' objectives were not fully realized
because of the effects of drastic changes in the economic, political and
social structure of the country, insufficiency of funds for recurrent road



expenditures and rampant inflation. The latest PPAR drew attention to the
need for selective organization strengthening. This need is recognized by
the Borrower and the Bank, and efforts to fulfill this need are part of the
First and the proposed Second Highway Reconstruction Projects.
3.09      With the First Highway Reconstruction Project (Loan 1927-CH for
US$42 million in April 1978), a new era in Bank relations with Chile
started. Execution of civil works under this loan is progressing well, and
disbursements (US$32.7 million as of April 30, 1983) are about 20% ahead of
schedule. Preinvestment studies are also proceeding well, and compliance
with the major loan covenants concerning implementation of axle load limit
regulations and improvement of road maintenance is promising. Ten vehicle
weighing stations are presently in operation. A Road Maintenance Council has
prepared a satisfactory six-year maintenance program for the basic network,
and maintenance of local roads is being studied by an Interministerial
Commission (paras 3.21, 3.22 and 4.04).
D. The Transport Subsectors
(i) Railways
3.10     In the early 1970s, the Chilean railways - overdesigned, over-
staffed, unable to eliminate uneconomic lines or to set adequate rates - were
covering, in some years, less than half of their total expenditures. Govern-
ment contributions were well over USSIOO million per year.  As a result of
the new strategy (para 3.05), the railways have, since 1973, taken a set of
measures to improve their efficiency and to eliminate the deficit. These
measures include:
-    phasing out of uneconomic services, resulting in a substantial
decrease in traffic;
-    reduction and rationalization of the use of the labor force
(more than 27,000 people in 1973 and less than 10,000 in
1982);
-    partial maintenance of the network and some equipment by
private contractors, resulting in reduced maintenance costs;
-    creation of three separate, to some extent competing, 1/
companies: Northern, Southern and Arica-La Paz railways;
-    technological improvements, mainly elimination of steam
locomotion; and
-    tariff increases more than doubling rates between 1971 and
1980 as well as abandonment of non-productive services.
1/   The Valparaiso-Santiago railway, a potential competitor for the San
Antonio-Santiago railway, was recently transferred from the Southern
to the Northern Railway Company.



- 6 -
3.11      As a result, the financial situation of the railways has improved
to such an extent that Government financial assistance steadily decreased
after 1976 and has been unnecessary since 1980. Although the long-term role
of the railways has not been clearly defined, it is clear that the process of
trimming out non-productive lines is not yet completed. The Southern Railway
will undergo the least further trimming. The Government has asked the Bank
if it would look into the possibility of helping in the modernization process
of its much improved railways either under a possible Intermodal Project
(para 4.08(d)) or under a possible separate railway project.
(ii) Ports
3.12      Chilean ports policy is aimed at encouragement of port efficiency
through competition between public and private ports and within ports between
terminal operators. Port policy was recently defined by three major laws:
-     Law 18036 of September 1981 establishing norms for port
workers, abolishing the protected port workers register and
introducing three daily shifts of seven hours instead of the
previous two eight-hour shifts;
-    Law 18042 of October 1981 establishing the National Ports
Corporation (CNP) whose purpose it is to transform the ten
existing EMPORCHI Ports / into individual public companies
(Sociedades Anonimas) which are expressly forbidden to carry
out handling, transport and storage of goods; and
-    Law 18040 of December 1981 modifying the Customs Ordinance to
simplify procedures.
3.13      The implementation of these laws is either completed or in pro-
gress. Immediately visible results include disappearance of port congestion
(very few ports are utilizing more than 50% of capacity and none more than
60%) and substantially reduced port operating costs.  Investments in Chilean
ports in the future will mainly be for changeover to new methods of goods
handling such as containerization, which is proceeding at a rapid rate, and
for efficiency improvements such as better access to the ports and to the
final destination of the imported goods. The Government and the Bank are
cooperating to define a possible project to help attain this goal
(para 4.08).
(iii) State-Owned Maritime and Air Transport Companies
3.14      EMPREMAR, the state shipping company, and LANCHILE, the state-owned
airline, will not be privatized (for strategic reasons) but will also no
longer receive Government subsidies. They have been exposed completely to
local competition in national transport and to foreign competition in
international transport since the Chilean Government gives all foreign and
local companies access to Chilean international ports and airports.

ports until the creation of CNP.



-7-
(iv) Airports
3.15      The authorities have expansion plans for the Santiage airport.  The
major issue is if the existing runway, which needs repairs, should be
repaired while the taxiway is temporarily used as runway with additional new
investments for visual aids to increase landing frequency, or if a second
runway should be built. The Government is looking for financing for this
project, which, however, because of the difficult economic situation, may
have lost some of its economic priority.
(v)   Pipelines
3.16        Chile has a 622-km network of pipelines that extends from
Concepcion in the south (Eighth Region) to Concon in the center (Fifth
Region). The pipelines belong to the Sociedad Nacional de Oleoductos
(SONACOL), which is owned partly by private interests and partly by the
Empresa Nacional de Petroleo (ENAP), a state-owned petrJleum company.
SONACOL employs about 100 people. The pipelines transport mainly gasoline,
diesel and liquified petroleum gas (LPG), but also many other petroleum
products in lesser quantities, some 300,000 cubic meters per month in total.
(vi) Roads and Road Transport Industry
3.17      The road network totals about 76,264 km, of which some 12%
(9,468 km) are paved either with cement concrete or with asphalt (Table 1).
Because of the country's long and narrow shape, the network is dominated by
the more than 3,500 km long North-South road, commonly referred to as the
Longitudinal Road or Road No. 5. The longitudinal and the major transversal
roads make up Chile's National Roads or "A" roads (5,622 km) which, together
with the so-called Regional Roads or "B" and "C" roads, constitute the Basic
Network of 22,524 km (Table la).
3.18      The Basic Network is completely the responsibility of the Central
Government's Highway Authority, or Vialidad, in MOP. The country has also
some 53,740 km of local roads or "D" roads (Caminos Comunales) which the
Government, as part of a major decentralization effort, intended to turn over
to the local administrations (comunas) for construction and maintenance
(Table la). It is not clear, however, how the latter will be able to finance
such a major effort (para 3.22).
3.19      Many National Roads are toll roads, most with annual average daily
traffic levels (AADT) of between 2,000 and 8,500 vehicles at the toll sta-
tions (Table 2). AADT decreased by between 1.3 and 19.4% per annum in the
period 1972-1975 (10% on the average per year) and grew between 3.2 and 21.4%
between 1976 and 1981 (11.5% per year). AADT, in 1982, declined by only 5.4%
in spite of a decline in gross domestic product in that year of some 14%.
3.20      Another interesting feature of the Chilean road traffic is the
changing composition of vehicles in the makeup of traffic and the vehicle
fleet.  The share of passenger cars in traffic registered at the toll sta-
tions increased from 60% in 1976 to 70% in 1982. The share of two-axle
trucks diminished from 22% in 1972/73 to only 10% in 1982, whereas the share
of trucks with three or more axles increased from 5% to 10% in the same



- 8 -
period (Table 2).  Consistent with the toll traffic statistics, the regis-
tered highway passenger vehicle fleet increased very rapidly in 1980 and 1981
(17 and 27% respectively) compared with a decrease in the registered truck
fleet in these years and a much slower increase in the overall vehicle fleet
(12% in 1980 and 23% in 1981). The vehicle fleet reached almost 856,000
vehicles in 1981, or about 77 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, versus less
than half as many in 1975 (Table 3).
3.21      Substantial investments for reconstruction of main highways and
for major bridge rehabilitation and construction are expected to continue
through 1985 and 1989 respectively. A special MOP task force has looked into
the question of upgrading the maintenance of the Basic Network and has made
acceptable recommendations (para 4.04).
3.22      The Government also agreed that the intended delegation of mainte-
nance responsibilities for all roads not included in the Basic Network (about
55,000 km of local roads) to the local governments does not guarantee effec-
tive maintenance of these roads. To look into this problem, the Government
set up, in December 1982, during post-appraisal, a four-man commission
consisting of a representative of the Ministry of the Interior and one of MOP
and two representatives of the Ministry of Finance (the National Budget
Office and the Internal Revenue Service) to prepare a plan of action and to
find adequate financing for maintenance of these roads. Additionally, MOP is
preparing a pilot project for maintenance of local roads in three provinces
of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Regions. The Bank would continue to support
these efforts through the ongoing and the proposed loans and, if necessary,
allocate some of the funds for the proposed study for this purpose. The
Government has agreed to inform the Bank of the proposals of the commission
and to work out a local road maintenance plan before the end of June 1984.
The Bank has indicated to the Government that it may be interested in helping
to implement the plan.
3.23      The road transport industry has been relieved of all remnants of
regulation.  Both goods and passenger traffic are completely free as far as
entering into the profession and setting of tariffs are concerned. The
trucking industry is suffering from substantial oversupply of capacity which,
combined with short term marginal cost pricing of railway services, makes
reaching an equilibrium even more difficult than it would otherwise have
been. The Chilean authorities, at first reluctant to accept the argument
that market forces work properly only when the situation oscillates around
the equilibrium point, have now come to realize that some help may be
necessary to avoid violent pendulum swings when the starting point is
absolute disequilibrium and distorting regulation, as was the case in Chile
(para 4.08 (d)).
3.24      Since 1972 and particularly since 1975, when road user charges were
six times road maintenance and investment expenditures, the Government of
Chile has recovered more than 100% of road expenditures from road users
(Table 4). Recently, the expenditures have become an increasing part of
revenues (one-third in 1981), and projected further substantial increases in
expenditures through 1985 may need matching increases in revenues (paras 4.04
and 4.05 and Table 9).
3.25       Vehicle fuel consumption in Chile, in spite of an increase in the
vehicle fleet by more than 20% per year in 1980-1981, increased by less than



- 9 -
2% in that period.  On the other hand, diesel consumption is increasing more
rapidly than gasoline consumption (Table 5). Retail prices of automotive
fuels cover, with a considerable margin, the corresponding opportunity
costs. As of July 1982, in the Santiago region, retail prices for regular
and premium gasoline were some 38% above the ex-refinery prices plus
distribution charges and retailers' margins, while diesel-oil was retailing
at some 20% above the estimated opportunity cost (Table 5a). Ex-refinery
prices, in turn, were in line with international prices of petroleum pro-
ducts, c.i.f. at Valparaiso. Gasoline is currently 3| retailing at values
between Ch$ 31.52 and Ch$ 33.10 per liter, depending on octane number, while
the retail price for diesel-oil is Ch$ 28.23 per liter. These values reflect
mainly the recent sharp devaluation of the national currency and movements in
the international market of crude petroleum and petroleum products. The
difference between the retail price of gasoline and diesel oil is basically
the outcome of the considerably lower tax element incorporated in the price
structure of diesel-oil. This is due to an ad valorem tax of 22% levied only
on gasoline, in addition to the value added tax (20%) levied on all automo-
tive fuels. The Government's present automotive fuel pricing policy may lead
to distortions, especially since taxes raised on fuels are a convenient way
to recover variable costs of use of road infrastructure. Since costs
incurred to repair the damage caused to highways by diesel-powered trucks and
buses are not being recovered from truck and bus owners, some degree of
cross-subsidization exists between gasoline-powered cars and heavy diesel-
powered trucks and buses. This leads to inefficiencies in modal traffic
allocation, in particular as far as road-rail competition is concerned. The
Government is aware of the problem and is planning to progressively implement
corrective measures, following the recommendations of a recent study on cost
recovery from road users, commissioned to consultants by the National Energy
Commission. These recommendations, which constitute a good basis for a more
equitable policy of cost recovery from road users, point toward an overall
increase of the taxation level for heavy vehicles, including, inter alia, the
levying of an additional tax on diesel-oil which would raise the retail price
by some 15%.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Background, Preparation and Detailed Description
4.01      The more-than-3,500-km Longitudinal Highway and many main transver-
sal roads which were built 20 to 40 years ago have seriously deteriorated
because of increased and heavier traffic and deficient maintenance.  In 1977,
with the assistance of local consultants and a German firm (Dorsch Consult),
MOP selected 805 km of the Longitudinal Highway for urgent reconstruction,
comprising rehabilitation of drainage, reconstruction of pavement and widen-
ing of shoulders,  By the time of negotiations of the First Highway Recon-
struction Project, Loan 1927-CH, April 1981, MOP had completed, with own
financing, a first tranche totaling 240 km. According to sections 4.05 (a)
and (b) of the Loan Agreement, MOP was to execute the second tranche (170 km)
not later than June 30, 1983, the third tranche (250 km financed under Loan
3/   Santiago region, as of February 20, 1983 (Official exchange rate:
US$1=Ch$ 75.77).



- 10 -
1927-CH) by June 30, 1984, and a fourth tranche (145 km) not later than
December 31, 1985. In fact, MOP has been able to carry out this program at a
much faster pace and has expanded it (Map IBRD 17011). The second tranche
was completed with own funding in 1981, 18 months ahead of schedule;
execution of the third tranche is 40% ahead of schedule, with 199 km
completed by early 1983 and the balance by early 1984; and the fourth
tranche, expanded to about 540 km by the inclusion of 270 km of the
Longitudinal Highway studied under the ongoing Highway Reconstruction
Project, is being carried out with IDB financing (Loans 78-IC-CH and
79-IC-CH, for US$126 and US$35 million respectively, both signed in October
1981). Work started in November 1981 and is progressing on schedule. About
340 km are under construction; the total program is expected to be completed
by December 31, 1985.
4.02      In the meantime, other road sections have deteriorated to condi-
tions not compatible with today's traffic demand. In 1982, MOP contracted
with local consultants, under the same terms of reference as those for the
studies under Loan 1927-CH, for feasibility and engineering studies for about
500 km of the Longitudinal Highway north of Santiago, and for about 250 km of
main transversal roads both north and south of Santiago. These studies were
used to select the roads included in this proposed Second Highway Reconstruc-
tion Project. The design standards are given in Table 6.
(A)  Civil Works
a.   Reconstruction and Widening of Highways
4.03      The reconstruction and widening component of the project includes:
(i)  reconstruction of about 435 km of the Longitudinal Highway north
of Santiago;
(ii)  reconstruction of about 140 km of main transversal roads; and
(iii) widening from two to four lanes of an 11-km section of the
Santiago-Valparaiso road (Table 7).
Adequate feasibility and engineering studies for parts (i) and (ii) of this
project component have already been prepared. Detailed studies for part
(iii) would be submitted to the Bank for approval before call for bids.
b. Periodic Maintenance
4.04      To comply with covenants under Section 3.06 (a) and (b) of Loan
1927-CH, MOP created, on May 25, 1982, a Road Maintenance Council, chaired by
the Deputy Director of Highways, and a Maintenance Planning Sub-Department.
As a result of the work of these two bodies and a 1979 Road Maintenance Study
by a local consultant, MOP was able to submit to the Bank, in September 1982,
a satisfactory multi-annual program for routine and periodic maintenance of
the Basic Network. This program requires about US$36 million in expenditures
in 1983 (Table 8) and average annual expenditures of about Ch$ 2.3 billion
(about US$34 million) in constant November 30, 1982 prices for the years 1983
to 1985. It would be expanded starting in 1986 to average Ch$ 3.9 billion
(US$58 million) in 1988 and 1989 (Table 9). MOP is trying to refine the



- 11 -
program to include maintenance strategies for asphalt, gravel and earth roads
through use of the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Model (1DM) with the
assistance of the ECLA office in Santiago. If it is determined that MOP would
need further assistance for the installation of the model and the training of
its staff, this assistance would be provided under the ongoing or the
proposed loan.
4.05      Besides the roads to be reconstructed, the proposed loan would
include a periodic maintenance program, providing for surface dressing
(800 km) or overlays (some 600 km), including shoulder reconstruction, of
about 1,400 km of main roads. The program is designed to reduce the periodic
maintenance backlog accumulated during the last 15 years and to bring some
sections of the Longitudinal Highway and of selected transversal highways to
standards suitable for normal preventive maintenance (Table 10).  It is also
part of an effort by the Government to stress labor-intensive activities in a
time of high unemployment. Preparation of the engineering would be handled
by MOP staff and consultants, with execution by privatc contractors. The
program would be reviewed by supervision missions from time to time.
c. Bridge Construction and Rehabilitation
4.06      Many of the approximately 10,000 bridges included in the road net-
work were built to very low standards; some are over 50 years old and are
becoming unsafe. Many bridges present serious constraints to the traffic
flow, particularly on secondary roads. A preliminary survey of bridge
construction and rehabilitation needs in the country, undertaken by MOP,
indicated that highest priority should be given to bridges in the South,
mainly in the Seventh and Eighth Regions. Attaching highest priority to
those bridges or groups of bridges that cause severest capacity constraints
on selected links of highly trafficked secondary roads, MOP selected 34
bridges totaling 906 linear meters (Table 11) to be constructed under the
first phase of a planned bridge construction or reconstruction program.
Engineering and pre-feasibility studies for the bridges were completed by
December 20, 1982. Additionally, MOP selected about 19 bridges (712 linear
meters) on the same links and 28 bridges (2,416 linear meters) on various
other high priority roads throughout the country which are urgently in need
of rehabilitation (Table Ila). MOP also established the need to improve a
total of some 60 km of approach roads to many of the bridges to be
reconstructed or rehabilitated (Table 11).
(B) Procurement of Goods
4.07      An analysis of equipment needs for the maintenance program of the
Basic Network, considering equipment now available, partial transfer of
equipment to the local road networks, programed scrapping of equipment and
planned contracting, resulted in a tentative equipment procurement list
totaling about US$9,300,000, including US$2.3 million in taxes and import
duties (Table 12). Additionally, MOP would purchase pavement research and
laboratory equipment for about US$2,200,000, including US$500,000 in taxes
and import duties (Table 13).



- 12 -
(C) Consulting Services and Training Abroad
4.08      Consulting services would mainly include:
(a)  US$7.2 million for project coordination and supervision of civil
works (para 4.12 and Table 14);
(b)  studies of bridges and highways, including a survey of bridge
construction and rehabilitation needs in the whole country (US$1.9
million);
(c)  assistance for the development of pavement and maintenance manage-
ment systems (US$1.7 million), including:
(i)   research on behavior of the concrete roads under traffic
for improvement of pavement and maintenance management
systems;
(ii)   research on behavior of asphalt roads in the dry desert
region in the north to define appropriate low cost design
standards and adequate construction and maintenance tech-
niques; and
(iii)   training Vialidad personnel for pavement and maintenance
management, for the use of highway design and maintenance
models such as the Bank's HDM model and for execution of
pavement and maintenance works, through lectures offered in
Chile by outstanding specialists in specific fields;
(d)  preparation of transport sector studies including a study of
a possible Intermodal Transport Project and a study of the Economic
Efficiency of Chile's Transport System; the first study would look
into the expected future role of the ports of Valparaiso and San
Antonio for container traffic to Santiago and, subsequently, into
the ways to adapt one or more of the ports serving Santiago for
rapidly increasing container traffic (Valparaiso 87,000 tons in
1978 and 479,000 tons in 1981 and San Antonio 3,800 tons in 1978
and 79,400 tons in 1981), including possible improvement of road
and rail access to the port and the container storage areas, and
planning and construction of an intermodal container terminal in
Santiago; the second study was recently proposed by the Chilean
authorities and would have to be defined in more detail during
forthcoming supervision missions (about US$1 million in total for
both studies).
4.09      Training and scholarships abroad for personnel of Vialidad would
also be included in further support of the implementation of a planning and
management system for road maintenance and rehabilitation. The program would
consist of a combination of shorter trips for high level personnel to confer-
ences and, combined with these conferences, visits to other relevant highway
departments, research organizations and, eventually, suppliers of equipment
and materials, as well as longer term study for promising middle-level
personnel (US$400,000).

B.   Cost Estimates, Financing and Disbursement
4.10      As shown on the following page, the project cost, including custom
duties (10%), sales taxes on imported goods (20%), and a 67% tax on foreign
expenditures for consultant services 4/ is estimated at about US$273.6 mil-
lion, with a foreign exchange component (FEC) of US$128.0 million (47%) to be
financed by the proposed Bank loan. The Government would finance the
balance, amounting to US$145.6 million (53%). Agreement was reached during
negotiations on a supplemental letter in which the Government would commit
itself to finance the Planned Expenditures for the Basic Highway Network,
1983-1989 (Table 9) as modified from time to time, in agreement with the
Bank, to take account of changed circumstances. It would most probably be
necessary to increase road user charges for that purpose (para 4.43).
4.11      The cost estimates for road and bridge construction and reconstruc-
tion were prepared by local consultants and reviewed by MOP. They are based
on quantity estimates and current unit prices for similar works, and are
reasonable given the standards proposed (Table 6) and the expected traffic,
The cost estimates for periodic maintenance works were prepared by MOP and
are based on current costs for similar works. Cost estimates for maintenance
equipment and vehicles and for research and laboratory equipment have been
prepared by MOP based on manufacturers' quotations and custom duties and
taxes to be paid by MOP. The cost for consulting services has been estimated
as shown in Table 14 assuming: (a) about 174 man/months of foreign consul-
tants (including nine man/months for lecturers) at an average cost of
US$11,000 per man/month for salary and benefits, overhead, airfares and local
living allowance; and (b) about 2,182 man/months of local consultants at an
average cost of US$4,000 per man/month, including supply of support personnel
and equipment. The cost of training abroad for professional staff corres-
ponds to about 68 fellowships at a cost of US$6,000 each.
4.12      Retroactive financing of up to US$1.8 million is proposed for
expenditures made after May 1, 1983 related to the initiation of some studies
and execution of works before the date of signing of the loan.
4.13      The FEC of civil works and consultant services has been estimated
at 45%, assuming that contracts for civil works would normally be awarded to
local firms and that the consulting services would entail a limited partici-
pation of foreign consultants. Based on the CIF prices at the port of entry
into Chile and payment by MOP of 10% import duties and 20% sales tax on
imported goods (totaling 32%), the FEC of those goods has been estimated at
75% of total cost.
4.14      Ten percent physical contingencies have been added to the base cost
of civil works and project coordination and supervision.  About 23% of
project base cost and of physical contingencies have been allowed for price
variations assuming inflation indicated at the bottom of the cost table,
4/   Paid by MOP as local cost.

4.15      To help the Government overcome foreign exchange problems in the
first years of the project, disbursements would be front-loaded 60% in
1983-1985 and about 34% thereafter. As a result, for the purpose of
Schedule I of the Loan Agreement, disbursements would be as follows:
(a) 60% of total expenditures for civil works for expenditures incurred
before December 31, 1985 and 30% thereafter;
(b) 100% of "foreign expenditures" 5/ for directly imported goods and
70% of total expenditures for locally procured items for the
duration of the project;
(c) 100% of "foreign expenditures" and 45% of total expenditures for
locally procured consulting services and training for the duration
of the project; and
(d) 100% of total expenditures for training and sc& larships abroad for
the duration of the project.
4.16      Disbursements of the loan would be made against usual documentation
except in the case of minor bridge rehabilitation or periodic maintenance
works (not more than US$2 million), where they could be made against state-
ments of expenditures supported by monthly certificates of work performed,
approved by supervising consultants. Documentation for these expenditures
would not be sent to the Bank but would be retained by MOP for review by Bank
supervision missions. The estimated disbursement schedule can be found in
Table 15.
4.17      To facilitate rapid disbursement, a special account would be opened
in the Central Bank of Chile on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank. Withdrawals from this account would be made exclusively for the execu-
tion of the project. The initial deposit would be US$5 million, and the
account would be replenished every time withdrawal requests are processed
with amounts equal to the legitimate amounts of the withdrawal requests made
by the Borrower.
C.   Execution, Procurement, Monitoring and Auditing
4.18      Execution of the project would be the responsibility of MOP except
for the transport sector studies, for which MITT would be responsible. MOP
has several directorates. Vialidad is the highway directorate that would be
directly in charge of implementing the project. The departments of Vialidad
that would be involved in executing parts of the project or in ensuring that
the loan covenants are met are the Construction Department, the Bridge
Department, the Maintenance Department, the Studies Department, the Weights
and Measures Department, the Equipment Department, and the Public Works
Laboratory.
5/   "Foreign expenditures" for the purpose of Schedule I means expenditures
in the currency of any country other than that of the Borrower for goods
and services supplied from the territory of any country other than that
of the Borrower.



- 16 -
4.19      Vialidad has a central and regional staff of about 4,000, of which
some 150 are engineers and a further 50 are other categories of profes-
sionals. It is a policy of the Government and of Vialidad to keep the
staff as small as possible, to execute as much work as possible by contract,
and to hire consultants or temporary contract workers to handle overflow of
work. The reconstruction, widening, and rehabilitation elements of the
proposed project would be supervised by consultants (mainly local) under the
supervision of the Construction Department.
4.20      Procurement under the project would be in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (July 1980). The new civil works tendering
and contracting system adopted by MOP in early 1980 originally implied
several departures from Bank Guidelines, which were reviewed and discussed by
successive Bank missions. MOP has modified the system progressively and
agreement has been reached to bring it into accordance with Bank Guidelines.
The modified tendering and contracting system to be applied under the loan is
described in Annex 1.
4.21      Contracts for civil works estimated to cost US$2 million or more
would be procured through international competitive bidding; those estimated
to cost less than US$2 million for a total of not more than US$30 million
could be procured following MOP local competitive bidding procedures which
are acceptable to the Bank. The major highway construction and reconstruc-
tion program included in the project would be divided into several subsec-
tions with estimated costs ranging from US$0.7 million to US$6.3 million, and
would, whenever possible, be grouped into bidding packages ranging from
US$4 million to US$23 million. The packages would be tendered in accordance
with the schedule of Table 16, agreec upon during negotiations.
4.22      Contracts would be awarded to prequalified contractors on the basis
of the lower of (a) the lowest evaluated bid for the entire work or (b) the
lowest evaluated combination of bids. MOP would have the option of awarding,
to one contractor, contracts for all subsections (one entire package) or, to
different contractors, contracts for one or more subsections. Given their
size, the subsections and the bidding packages are expected to attract
large-to-medium-size local firms or joint ventures of such firms, as well as
foreign firms, mostly in association with local firms. It is to be noted
that, with similar arrangements under the ongoing project, several foreign
firms prequalified, either separately or in joint venture with local firms,
but only one presented a successful bid and was awarded a contract.
4.23      In order to obtain the most economic solution in all the cases
where traffic is high enough to allow portland cement concrete a competitive
chance against bituminous surfacing, bid proposals would be invited for the
two surfacing alternatives. Minor contracts for periodic maintenance and
bridge construction and rehabilitation works, with estimated costs ranging
from US$100,000 to US$2 million, would be grouped, whenever possible, into
"bidding packages" according to geographical regions ranging from US$400,000
to US$10 million, to make them more attractive for medium- and large-size
contractors. Bids would be invited through ICB whenever the estimated cost
of such packages exceeded US$2 million in accordance with schedules outlined
in Tables 17 and 18. Agreements reached on bidding and contracting
procedures were confirmed during negotiations.

4.24      The procurement program for maintenance equipment and vehicles and
for research and laboratory equipment, indicating lot size, estimated cost
and proposed exception to ICB mentioned below, would be subject to prior
approval by the Bank. Similar items would be grouped to the extent possible
for bidding purposes. All contracts with estimated costs over US$50,000
would be subject to ICB. Contracts up to US$50,000 and within an overall
ceiling of US$500,000 would be procured in accordance with relevant MOP
regulations, which are satisfactory. Bidding documents and model contracts
for procurement of goods would be approved by the Bank.
4.25      Bidding for civil works estimated to cost US$2 million equivalent
or more, and bidding for goods estimated to cost over US$250,000 equivalent,
would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation,
resulting in a coverage of about 66% of the total estimated value of works
contracts (33 contracts representing about 37% of the total number of
contracts), and about 80% of total estimated value of goods contracts, The
balance of contracts would be subject to random review by the Bank after
contract award. The above threshold for civil works is satisfactory
considering the similarity of the contracts involved and MOP's satisfactory
record in procurement procedures.
4.26      Terms of reference for the preparation of feasibility studies and
for supervision of civil works would be similar to those used under Loan
1927-CH. Terms of reference for project coordination and supervision were
agreed upon during negotiations. Terms of reference for the national bridge
construction, reconstruction and rehabilitation needs study; for the pavement
research studies; and for the preparation of transport sector studies would
be agreed upon before calling for bids.
4.27      The progress of the project toward its objectives would be
monitored against the following key indicators;
(a)  progress of procurement of goods against agreed schedule
(Tables 12 and 13);
(b)  progress of the withdrawal of the proceeds of the loan against
agreed disbursement schedule (Table 15);
(c)  physical progress of Bank-financed civil works subprojects against
agreed implementation schedule (Tables 16, 17 and 18);
(d)  scope and funding of annual maintenance programs for the basic
network (Tables 8 and 9);
(e)  progress of the following studies compared to agreed schedules;
(i)   highway preinvestment studies;
(ii)   bridge construction and rehabilitation studies;
(iii)   asphalt and concrete pavement behavior studies;
(iv)   intermodal transport study;



- 18 -
(v)   study of economic efficiency of the Chilean transport system;
and
(vi)   local roads maintenance program by end of December 1983.
(f) number of participants in the pavement and maintenance management
training programs against agreed targets (Table 19).
The purpose of project indicators and the scope of related reporting require-
ments were agreed upon during negotiations.
4.28      The implementation period of the project would be about four and a
half years (June 1983 to December 1987) (Table 15). In order to start recon-
struction works as soon as practicable, MOP is updating the prequalification
of firms that already prequalified for execution of works under the ongoing
loan (15 local firms, three joint ventures of local firms, five foreign
firms, and one foreign-local joint venture). The updating would provide for
prequalification of new firms or joint ventures.  The disbursement schedule
is in line with current experience in Chile, where project implementation is
usually among the most rapid in the LAC region.
4.29      The Government's Contraloria General de la Republica and, specifi-
cally, MOP's internal accounting system have been reviewed and found adequate
for the identification and certification of Bank-project-related financial
transactions. Internal audit of MOP's accounts is carried out by a separate
internal audit unit. The capacity and capability of the Contraloria to audit
the project-related financial transactions have been reviewed, and it has
been determined that the Departamento de Auditoria could conduct a satisfac-
tory audit within four months after the end of each fiscal year. The
requirement for an independent auditor was agreed upon during negotiations.
The Bank will sign a supplemental letter accepting Contraloria General de la
Republica de Chile as independent auditor. The format and content of audit
reports would be agreed upon during a forthcoming supervision mission.
D.   Economic Justification
(i) General
4.30      For purposes of economic analysis, the proposed project has been
divided into three components, accounting for about 90% of total project
costs, including physical contingencies, but excluding price contingencies:
(a) a reconstruction and widening component;
(b) a periodic maintenance component; and
(c) a bridge construction and rehabilitation component.
4.31      Discrete sections of roads and clusters of bridges or individual
bridges have been subject to an independent analysis. The Economic Rate of
Return (ERR) and other investment efficiency indicators were calculated for
individual subprojects or groups of subprojects within each component.



- 19 -
4.32      The pre-investment studies were carried out by Vialidad or by
consultants under the supervision of Vialidad, which is adequately staffed
for this supervisory role. The studies were reviewed in detail during
project appraisal and final results have taken the appraisal mission's
comments into account. The overall methodology of analysis is in line with
ODEPLAN's general guidelines for public sector investment and with Vialidad's
new Highway Evaluation Manual, which was developed and reviewed during
project preparation, and which is adequate for Bank Group economic evaluation
standards. Whenever applicable, the engineering economics framework of the
Bank's HDM has been followed. The ERR for the proposed project is expected
to be above 40%. The high return obtained reflects the priority for the
economy of the proposed investments arnd results mainly from the considerable
deferred maintenance element incorporated into the project. Basic
assumptions for economic analysis are presented in Annex 2.
4.33      Since most of the traffic is made up of commercial vehicles,
accounting for as much as 72% of total vehicle-km in tile longitudinal and
transversal roads, most of the project benefits would be directly realized
by truck and bus owners. These benefits, mainly in the form of vehicle
operating costs savings resulting from improving road condition, would most
likely be passed over to the productive sectors of the economy and to the
low-income bus users through lower tariffs, since the road transport industry
is highly competitive in Chile (para 3.23). The proposed project would have
a significant and immediate direct employment impact, which is estimated at a
yearly average of 1,600 additional jobs, during the project implementation
period.
(ii) Road Reconstruction and Widening Component
4.34      The road reconstruction and widening component consists mainly of
three subcomponents:
(a) a Longitudinal Highway reconstruction subcomponent;
(b) a transversal roads reconstruction subcomponent; and
(c) a road widening subcomponent.
These subcomponents, excluding contingencies, amount to 25%, 11% and 2%
respectively of total project costs.
4.35      Direct economic benefits to be derived by highway users were esti-
mated in the form of vehicle operating costs and time savings, resulting from
the improved condition of road surface and capacity expansion, whenever
applicable. Road degradation is modeled following the American Association
of State Highways and Transport Officials (AASHTO) theory and the levels of
the Pavement Serviceability Index (PSI) related to roughness. Vehicle
operating costs, in turn, are assumed, inter alia, as a function of roughness
following, in general, the HDM vehicle operating costs submodel. Benefits to
be derived from potential improvements in road safety conditions were dis-
regarded because of lack of empirical evidence relating pavement condition to
level of accidents. Road maintenance savings, arising from the implementa-
tion of the proposed subprojects, were also quantified. These savings are



- 20 -
the outcome of expenditures which would have to be incurred to avoid degrada-
tion of road condition below a given level of service, in the "without-
project" alternative.  In such circumstances, the maintenance of that level
of service would have been justified on economic grounds, when compared with
the "do-nothing" case. In addition, the corresponding maintenance standards
would be consistent with the financial resources allocated to maintenance in
Vialidad's program (Table 9). Overall, in the first years of full benefits,
consolidated benefits arising from vehicle operating costs and maintenance
savings are expected to be above US$40,000 per km.
4.36      On the cost side, economic investment and maintenance costs to
build and operate the proposed facilities during the design life were
considered. The ERR of this component is estimated at about 32%, reflecting
an economic choice of the technical solutions, at the design stage, and the
desirable investment timing.
4.37      The ERRs for the 19 subprojects included in this component are
presented in Table 20. Detailed benefit and cost streams for each of the
subprojects, disaggregated by type of benefit and in foreign and domestic
components, are available in the project file (Annex 3). More detailed
economic studies of the reconstruction and widening subcomponent (19 km) will
be prepared by Vialidad and submitted for Bank approval before execution of
the works.  The estimated ERRs are in line with Bank experience in similar
projects; they reflect adequately the traffic volumes and composition, and
the investment required to bring the level of service in line with demand. A
sensitivity analysis has been carried out for a 20% decrease in benefits and
a 20% increase in costs. The resulting values for the ERR indicate that the
return on individual subprojects is basically equally influenced by varia-
tions in costs and in benefits. In any case, under the sensitivity tests,
the ERR remains above 25%. A similar conclusion was reached when the value
of intangibles was not included in the benefit stream. Even under the
extreme assumption of no growth in benefits during project life, the economic
return is still attractive and above 15%.
(iii) Periodic Maintenance Component
4.38      The periodic maintenance component consists basically of surface
dressing and overlays of about 1,400 km of main roads. This component
constitutes a key element of Vialidad's highway program (Table 8), targeted
at preserving the capital stock by preventing further depletion of the net-
work. In the selected subprojects, pavement condition is such that, under
the forecast level of traffic and prevailing environmental conditions, it
would experience a cumulative process of degradation.  Considerable present
cost savings can thus be expected by investing now, at levels of about
US$42,000 per km, rather than at a later stage. As past experience in Chile
and elsewhere shows, to delay investments in periodic maintenance leads to
much higher expenditures later, in the form of very costly rehabilitation or
full reconstruction works (US$200,000 to US$300,000 per km). Additionally,
high direct benefits would be derived, in the meantime, from vehicle opera-
ting costs savings, resulting from improving pavement condition. The
periodic maintenance component would therefore contribute to an optimal
policy of minimizing total highway present costs and, as such, would have a
high economic return, estimated at above 50%, in line with Bank experience in
similar projects. That policy has not always been followed in the past
because of financial constraints and the high priority which was attached to



- 21 -
the Santiago Metro and reconstruction of the Longitudinal Highway. Bank
participation, under the proposed project, would ensure the required foreign
exchange for the execution of the works and would assist Government efforts
in achieving a greater balance between maintenance and reconstruction
expenditures.
(iv) Bridge Construction and Rehabilitation Component
4.39      This component has been identified and prepared by Vialidad on the
basis of a preliminary bridge survey (para 4.06). The results of this survey
led to the identification of a set of highly trafficked links in the network
(circuits), where bridge capacity and condition constitute a major bottleneck
for existing level and composition of traffic, and where no economically
attractive alternative route exists.  In the last few years, the truck fleet
composition in Chile has undergone a major structural change. In the period
1972-1982, the number of two-axle trucks counted in the toll stations
decreased at an average annual rate of 6%, while, in the same period, the
number of three and more axle trucks increased at a rate of about 9% p.a.
(Table 2). This trend toward the use of bigger and heavier trucks has also
been registered countrywide, through Vialidad's periodic traffic countings
and the records of weight control stations. However, an extensive use of the
relatively more efficient heavy truck fleet has been hampered so far because
of low standards of existing bridges (para 4.06).
4.40      The proposed project would finance the construction and rehabilita-
tion of bridges and access improvements on 11 of these circuits. In addi-
tion, financing would be provided for high priority rehabilitation works of
28 other bridges in order to prevent further depletion and to increase the
corresponding useful life. The economic return of this component is expected
to be above 40%, which is in line with Bank experience in similar projects.
4.41      The selected bridge links amount to about 82% of the total costs of
this project component. Vialidad conducted an independent analysis for each
of them (Table 21).  The details of this analysis are available in the
project file (Annex 3). Based on the analysis, a consolidated economic
return of about 30% has been estimated. The only quantified benefits are
derived from variable cost savings, resulting from the use of heavier and
more efficient trucks. The realization of such benefits would become
possible, given the current and prospective structure of the fleet (para
4.39) and the higher bearing capacity of the new bridges.
4.42      Vehicle operating cost estimates are consistent with the metho-
dology used in the road construction and reconstruction component
(para 4.35). The cost stream basically includes investments in bridge
construction and rehabilitation and in accesses improvement. As such, the
values estimated by Vialidad for the ERR are on the conservative side,
basically since direct benefits derived from vehicles other than trucks were
not considered and potential maintenance savings resulting from the substitu-
tion of new steel/concrete structures for the old structures were not quanti-
fied. A sensitivity analysis for a 20% increase in costs has also been
carried out by Vialidad. The resulting values (Table 21) suggest that the
economic return would decrease by no more than 7%. In addition, and with
quantified benefits on the conservative side, the ERR for the different
circuits would still be above 19%.



- 22 -
E.   Project Risks
4.43      There are no major risks affecting the proposed project.  Vialidad
has, so far, a high performance record in project implementation. Disburse-
ments under the ongoing highway reconstruction project (Loan 1927-CH) are 36%
ahead of schedule. However, there would be some potential uncertainty in the
timely availability of counterpart funds, given the country's present finan-
cial constraints. Nevertheless, the Government has attached high priority to
the implementation of the project, partly in the context of a broader
strategy of employment generation, which constitutes a proclaimed objective
of present economic policy. The Government also intends to raise additional
fiscal revenues, possibly through a fuel tax increase, to ensure the budget
allocations for project execution. The Government has agreed to provide
budget allocations to Vialidad over the period 1983-1989 sufficient to
execute the program prepared for the Basic Highway Network and presented in
Table 9 or as modified in agreement with the Bank from time to time
(para 4.10).
4.44      The outcome and impact of the studies and research subcomponents
are, as usual, associated with a considerable uncertainty. Study execution,
both in MOP and MTT, is under the direction of competent and motivated
teams. In addition, financing for foreign consultants and for scholarships
abroad would be provided under the proposed project. The assessment of
specific foreign expertise as related to the development of the studies, and
its coordination with the scholarship program, would deserve careful
supervision during project implementation.

SECOND HIGHWAY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
The New MOP Civil Works Tendering and Contracting System
1.        The Ministry of Public Works (MOP) adopted, in March 1981, a new
system for tendering and contracting civil works, geared to shifting most of
the responsibility to the contractor. In its original form, this system can
be summarized as follows:
(a) MOP prepares preliminary engineering (at a level which, for many
Bank-financed projects, is equivalent to final e.:gineering), feasi-
bility studies, traffic projections, general design standards and
specifications, terms of reference describing the works and bidding
documents.
(b) MOP requests prequalified bidders to review all these documents
carefully and to submit their bids based on their own final
engineering, for which they assume full responsibility. The system
distinguishes between two types of bids: (i) those for civil works
expected to cost less than US$2.0 million equivalent and of a
repetitive technical nature (like overlays); and (ii) those for
civil works expected to cost US$2.0 million equivalent or more or
for technically complex works of lower value. In bids of type (i),
the bidder is requested only to review (and modify, if deemed
necessary) the work quantities; in type two, the bidder may present
engineering alternatives. The bids include work quantities, unit
prices, partial and total costs and proposed schedule for execution
of works. For bids of type (ii), the bidder is requested also to
present partial costs for specific stages of works, based on the
corresponding quantities and unit prices. There is no provision
for physical contingencies, and contract cost can be adjusted only
for inflation.
(c) MOP evaluates the proposals in two steps. The first step eval-
uates: (i) the bidders' organization, experience and past perform-
ance; (ii) the technical quality of the proposal (unsound proposals
may be rejected); and (iii) the proposed execution period, affect-
ing the bid cost by coefficients reflecting the merits or defects
of the bid. The combined effect of these evaluation coefficients
is called "percentual discounts" and modifies the original bid
price within a range of 20%. The second step comprises the eval-
uation of the proposals, for which an official cost estimate is
established by multiplying the work quantities by unit prices pre-
viously estimated by MOP and deposited in a sealed envelope. The
work quantities used for this purpose are those of the proposal



- 48 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 3
which has the percentual discount closer to the arithmetic mean of
the percentual discount of all valid proposals. MOP automatically
discards all bids more than 20% above or below that official cost
estimate. The remaining bids are evaluated by applying the
corresponding percentual discounts to the cost of each remaining
proposal. Award goes to the lowest evaluated bid.
(d) Payment to contractors is made, in type (i) bids, against comple-
tion of works and, in type (ii) bids, against delivery of completed
specific stages of works.  MOP ensures strong quality control in
line with specified performance requirements through supervision by
consultants.
2.        The new system has so far been used successfully in awarding
about 30 contracts for more than US$150 million, ranging from US$0.25 to
US$20.0 million. Of this total, 12 contracts totaling more than US$100
million are financed under IDB Loans 78-IC-CH and 79-IC-CH for US$126 and
US$35 million respectively, both signed on October 15, 1981. Participation
of foreign firms in the prequalification and bidding processes has been quite
active, both independently and through joint ventures with local firms, and
in two cases, contracts have been awarded to joint ventures. Time elapsed
between bid opening and legalization of contract award has been less than 90
days in all cases. Contract costs have been, so far, an average of 2% above
costs estimated by MOP in the feasibility studies. In all cases, work
execution started immediately and is proceeding, on average, 20% ahead of
schedule. Quality of works is highly satisfactory. MOP claims that this
tendering system has strengthened remarkably the technical capability and
responsibility of the contracting industry.
3.        During successive tendering processes for projects with IDB financ-
ing, M4OP has modified the bidding documents progressively, in particular the
regulations of the system, bringing them much closer to Bank Guidelines.
Each successive modified bidding document has been legalized within the
respective bidding process. The last version of these documents was dis-
cussed with the appraisal mission, and additional modifications were agreed,
thus overcoming all remaining discrepancies to Bank Guidelines as follows:
(a) preliminary engineering will be carried out for all types of work
at a level that reduces the field and design work to be undertaken
additionally by contractors to a minimum;
(b) the clause requiring selected bidders eventually to accept design
modifications was limited in its scope and has been made subject to
a negotiated agreement;

ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 3
(c) advance payment of 20% has been considered; in addition, MOP has
modified temporarily the payment system providing for monthly
advances toward payments against completion of works or against
reception of work stages;
(d)  MOP's and the contractors' responsibilities for acquisition of the
construction sites have been defined satisfactorily; and
(e) automatic rejection of all bids falling below 80% of the official
cost estimate will be eliminated for bidding under Bank financing
and replaced by an extended evaluation procedure by a special
commission composed of the Minister of Public Works or his
representative, the Director General of Public Works and the
Director of Highways. If this commission concludes that these
proposals reduce costs by considering acceptable alternatives or
other pertinent factors, they will be accepted and considered for
contract award. If the Bank does not agree with the findings of
this commission, the Bank would have the right to declare
misprocurement and to cancel the respective amount of the loan as
per the standard language included in Schedule 1 of the Loan
Agreement.

SECOND HIGHWAY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
Basic Assumptions for Economic Analysis
The following basic assumptions were used in the economic analysis,
unless otherwise specified in the text or tables.
(a) Traffic
Traffic projections are based on the 1980 traffic census, taking into
account the 1982 data, wherever available. The projections were carried
out for five independent vehicle groups (cars, light trucks, two-axle
trucks, three and more axle trucks and buses). In general, assumed AADT
growth rates vary between 4 and 5% p.a., depending on route location and
traffic composition. No newly generated traffic has been considered,
and diverted traffic has been taken into account in the bypass sub-
projects. Leisure time has been valued at about 25% of the wage rate.
(b) Economic Costs
Investment costs are based on financial costs, including 4% supervision
and 10% physical contingencies. Investment, maintenance and vehicle
operating costs are considered in constant November 1982 values, net of
taxes and other transfer payments. Fuel costs were taken at their
ex-refinery values plus distribution charges.
(c) Pavement Deterioration
Pavement deterioration has been modeled following AASHTO theory, with
PSI varying, in general, between 4 for a pavement with a good condition
and 0 for a pavement with a poor condition.
(d) Project Life
Project life for specific road reconstruction subprojects has been
assumed either ten or 20 years, depending on design standards, which, in
turn, were selected on a net present value basis. In the case of
bridges construction, a conservative 30-year useful life has been
considered.
(e) Shadow-Pricing
Following general ODEPLAN guidelines for public sector investment
analysis 1/, foreign exchange has been shadow-priced at 6% above
the official rate, and non-qualified labor at values varying
between 70% (1983) and 96% (1986) of the corresponding wage rate.
Following the same source, the discount rate has been assumed as 20%
(1983), 16% (1984), and 12% (from 1985 onward).
