I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Local Energy Resources
1.01      Zaire has enormous untapped energy resources, its greatest potential
being hydro-generated electric power. In addition, oil is available from
wells just off the coast of Zaire, and there are other potential sites further
inland. Zaire is luxuriantly forested and firewood and charcoal are used
extensively for energy needs, particularly in rural areas. Wood residue from
sawmills and bagasse from sugar mills are also used. Zaire is also fortunate
:in having large coal deposits located in the Shaba area. Hot springs occur in
several areas suggesting the possibility of a geothermal potential although
there are no proven geothermal resources.
Hydroelectric Resources
l.02      The hydroelectric power potential of the Zaire River near its
discharge into the Atlantic Ocean is about 40,000 MW, of which 350 MW have
been developed and are in operation, with a further 1,400 MW expected to be
in operation in 1983. The maximum flow at the mouth of the Zaire River is
only about four times the minimum flow, a feature which minimizes the need for
the construction of costly reservoirs, and will permit the efficient use of
generating equipment. Electricity production in the country is about 4,100
G,Wh per year which is less than 1% of the estimated potential of the 530,000
GWh, which could be developed at the many potential hydro sites (Annex 1).
Petroleum Resources
L.03      Each year about 8 million barrels of oil are extracted from two
offshore oil fields, and about 250,000 barrels of oil from two small fields
along the coast. The proven reserves are about 150 million barrels, which
would allow about 10 to 15 million barrels of oil per year to be extracted
during the next 10 years. Plans are underway for the drilling of two deep
wells farther inland in the Bandundu region, in 1981. A refinery in Muanda is
capable of processing 5.5 million barrels of oil a year, but operates at some
40% of capacity because, having been built before oil was discovered in the
country, it was designed to refine a lighter imported oil and is unsuitable
for Zaire-s heavy crude. Thus although the output of heavy crude oil is much
greater than the country's needs it is necessary to import refined products.
A study is currently underway on the future of the refinery.
Wood Resources
1.04      Wood is the main source of energy in Zaire with consumption esti-
mated to be about 9 million tons per year. Of this total, about 2 million
tons are used to make charcoal. Zaire has a vast energy potential in its
forests, and it is estimated that an annual production of 100 million tons per
year of fuelwood could be utilized without impairing the potential. About
50,000 tons of wood residue from sawmills and about 125,000 tons of bagasse
from sugar mills are used each year in the production of energy in the form of
steam or electricity for their respective industries, or for neighboring
industrial and domestic use. In addition, the residues from rubber trees, and



- 2 -
from palm fruits used in the manufacture of palm oil, are used as energy
sources to reduce the dependency on expensive oil.
Coal Resources
1.05      The coal reserves of Zaire are located in the Shaba region where
about 100,000 tons per year are used locally for cement plants, copper refin-
ing and the railway. This coal contains from 15% to 50% of ash and has
a calorific value of 4,000 to 6,000 kcal/kg. The reserves are currently
estimated to be in the order of 720 million tons.
Relative Energy Pricing
1.06      The price of many essential commodities, including electricity
and fuel, is regulated by the Government. Despite the wide range in the cost
of generating electricity by hydro or diesel plants, the same tariff structure
applies to consumers in all parts of the country. The tariff is distorted,
however, in that the cost of electricity to low voltage users is less than for
those using medium voltages. As a consequence, many small industries and
commercial establishments, which would normally take power at a medium voltage,
remain on the low voltage domestic rate. Another disparity is that the
selling rate to domestic consumers is 8.5 times greater than that to large
consumers using high voltages, whereas in most countries the ratio is about
2.5 times greater. A review of the tariff structure is therefore recommended
under the project (para. 5.15).
1.07      The selling price of petroleum products has been controlled by the
Government so that diesel fuel and kerosene, at Z 1.15 and Z 1.40 per litre,
(respectively US$1.46 and US$1.77 per U.S. gallon), are sold well below
cost, while gasoline, at Z 4.0 per litre (US$5.07 per U.S. gallon) is above
cost. As a result much more diesel fuel and kerosene are sold than gaso-
line, and there is a net loss to the distributors. The cost of kerosene is
even below that of wood and charcoal - indigenous sources of energy in great
abundance in Zaire. The relative selling price of energy in Zaire is illus-
trated in the following table:
Price per unit         Price per million
Kilocalories/unit      in Kinshasa               kilocalorie
Gasoline          10.5 million/ton      Z 4.00 per litre               Z 544
Kerosene          10.3 million/ton       Z 1.40 per litre              Z 170
Diesel            10.2 million/ton      Z 1.15 per litre               Z 132
Firewood           3   million/ton      Z 0.70 per kilo                Z 233
Charcoal           6.9 million/ton      Z 4.50 per kilo                Z 652
Electricity        860/kWh              Z 0.22/kWh                     Z 256
1.08      Zaire's energy balance was positive in 1979 with total domestic
production of all resources (5,187,134 tons of oil equivalent (toe)) exceed-
ing gross domestic consumption by 6% or 304,100 toe (Annex 2). In view of the



- 3 -
disparity of energy prices in Zaire, a component has been included in this
project to study in detail the overall energy usage of the country, and to
provide an energy adviser to the National Energy Commission, who would assist
the Commission to develop appropriate energy policies for the Government.
Flis prime responsibilities would be to establish terms of reference, accept-
able to the Association, for a consultant's study on the energy pricing policy
for the government, supervising this study (or studies), and investigating
possible uses for the abundant supply of hydroelectric power now available
in the Inga area of Zaire. In addition, this study (or studies) would promote
urban and rural electrification; the increased use of wood and charcoal;
further petroleum exploration and the development of production facilities;
cnd the use of coal and other potential resources, such as the natural gas
from Lake Kivu, geothermal resources, as well as solar energy and uranium.
D)uring negotiations the Government agreed that the adviser would be appointed
by December 31, 1982 with terms of reference for his position acceptable to the
Association. The terms of reference for an energy study (or studies) would be
subject to the approval of the Association and consultant's reports and
recommendations would be approved by the Association.
II. THE POWER SECTOR
General
2.01      The Societe nationale d'electricite (SNEL) is responsible for the
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Zaire.
Electric power is available to consumers in Zaire primarily in two areas:
Kinshasa and the surrounding areas of Bas-Zaire in the west and in the
Shaba region in the south-eastern part of the country. Although SNEL has five
regions and four subregions, they are not interconnected and in 1979, 95% of
all electrical energy sold by SNEL was concentrated in the Southern (Shaba)
and Bas-Zaire regions. The Shaba region alone accounted for 69% of SNEL's
total sales and in the region one consumer, La Generale des Carrieres et des
Mines (GECAMINES) consumed 57% of the total GWh sold by SNEL in 1979 (3,626
GWh). GECAMINES mines copper and cobalt and these exports earn 65% of the
total foreign exchange earnings of Zaire. In the other regions, i.e. Kivu,
Kasai Oriental, Kasai Occidental, Equateur, Haut-Zaire, and Bandundu electricity
is available only in small isolated areas from local hydro and diesel installa-
tions. In 1979 only about 2% of the estimated 26 million inhabitants in Zaire
had access to electricity 1/, and the average estimated per capita consumption
of electrical energy was 156 kWh. 2/
L/   Comparable percentages of population with access to electricity in other
East African countries are as follows: Kenya 6%; Lesotho 3.5%; Malawi
2%; Sudan 8%; Tanzania 3%.
2/   Comparable average estimated per capita consumption of electrical energy
for other countries is; Kenya 90 KWh, Mauritius 573 KWh, Madagascar 91
kWh, Ethiopia 22 kWh, Botswana 450 KWh.

Works in Progress or Planned
2.02      In 1974 the Government decided to embark on a major construction
program consisting of the 1400 MW Inga II hydroelectric station, the 500 kV
direct current Inga-Shaba transmission line, and the strengthening of the
Shaba high voltage system. In this report these three items are referred to
as the Systeme Inga-Shaba (SIS). The construction works of Inga II have been
completed and the eight 175-MW units are scheduled to be ready for operation
in 1982, but there will be no demand until the completion of the Inga-Shaba
transmission line in 1983.
Inga-Shaba Transmission Line
2.03      The Government considered 3 alternatives to meet the expected growth
in demand for electricity in the Shaba region - the construction of the Busanga
hydroelectric station with an installed capacity of 200 MW, the importation of
energy from Zambia, and the transmission of energy from Inga over a 1,700 km
direct current transmission line. After extensive analysis the Government
chose the + 500-kV, direct current, Inga-Shaba transmission line. The line is
being constructed to carry a design load of 1120 MW, but the converters for
the line at Inga will be provided in 3 stages, 560 MW, 840 MW and 1120 MW.
Two lines will be provided, each capable of carrying the full load. Control
stations will be located along the line at Selo, Kikwit, Kananga and Kamina,
so that sections of the line may be taken out of service in the case of
emergency or repair. By means of inverters at Kolwezi the direct current will
be changed to alternating current, and fed into the 220-kV Shaba region
transmission system. The Government scheduled the transmission line for
completion in 1977, but construction and financial problems, as well as the
unrest in the area during 1977 and 1978, have delayed completion. Construc-
tion is now expected to have advanced sufficiently by the end of 1981, to
enable testing to be carried out through 1982 and final commissioning the end
of 1982. Costs of this line, originally estimated at US$341 million, are now
estimated by SNEL to be about US$700 million.
Shaba Transmission System Strengthening
2.04      With the new source of energy for Shaba located at the end of the
Inga-Shaba line at Kolwezi, it has been necessary to construct new 220 kV and
120 kV transmission lines in the Shaba region, to strengthen the link between
Kolwezi and the rest of the Shaba system. On completion of the line, there
will be two sources of power in the region, that from the Inga-Shaba line and
that from the four existing generating stations.
Demand for Power and Energy in the Shaba Region
2.05      The growth in demand for energy in Shaba was small until 1975 when
the total demand reached 2635 GWh. Due to the unfavorable economic climate
and the general fall in the price of copper, there was zero growth in 1976,
the demand for energy fell further to 2,625 GWh in 1977 and to 2,404 GWh
in 1978 because of the internal disturbances during these years. In 1979 the
growth was slight, raising the demand to 2,495 GWh (Annex 3). The estimated
demand requirements for the ensuing years for the Shaba region (shown graphi-
cally, Annex 4) are:

2.06      Known ore reserves in Shaba are estimated to last at least 30 to 40
years, but GECAMINES estimates that it will reach its maximum demand of 2,670
GWh per year in 1985 and foresees no further expansion to its operations in
the Shaba Region. The amount of equipment, which determines the rate of
extraction, has been balanced against the quantity of ore remaining in the
ground, so that, when the ore bodies have been depleted, all equipment and
facilities will have depreciated to zero. The mission agrees with this
approach and, since no new mines are expected to be opened in the foreseeable
future, the only moderate increases in demand for electricity that have been
assumed are for other industry and commerce in the area and for the domestic
sector.
Supply of Power and Energy in the Shaba Region
2.07      The demand for energy in the Shaba region has been met by the
existing hydroelectric generating plant, and Shaba has been fortunate in
receiving above average rainfall for the past 4 or 5 years, enabling the hydro
pyLants to meet the demands of the consumers even though some units have been
olut of service from time to time. SNEL estimates that in an average water
year, the available energy output of the four generating stations in the Shaba
Region - Nseke, Nzilo, Mwadingusha and Koni (Map IBRD 15493R) would be 2500
GWfh, which is insufficient generating capability to meet the energy demands.
Nevertheless, sufficient installed capacity is available to meet expected
system peak demands.
2.08      Not only is the existing hydraulic capability of the system insuffi-
cient to meet energy demand, but the mechanical and electrical capability of
the equipment has deteriorated to such an extent that the supply is unreliable
and power is frequently and accidentally interrupted (Annex 5). The danger
of a serious system failure increases with time because of the age of the
system (25 to 50 years) and because of the lack of spare parts and adequate
maintenance.
2.09      Short periods of reduced energy availability, while hindering overall
mining operations, do not necessarily immediately reduce production because
activities such as clean-up and preparatory works for future operuions can be
postponed to meet immediate production needs. However, these activities
cannot be postponed indefinitely or totally excluded, if future production
is not to be seriously affected. Temporary shortages of power can also be
alleviated by temporary imports of power from Zambia, but such imports are



subject to availability and the equivalent energy would need to be exported
from the region at a later date so as to maintain the export/import balance
between the two countries.
Other Electricity Projects
2.10      Other large investments planned are the rehabilitation of the
Kinshasa distribution network; expansion of the Tshala hydroelectric station
supplying the diamond mines at Mbuji-Mayi (present installed capacity 1.25
MW); construction of a diesel generating station at Kananga; electrification
of the railway line from Matadi to Kinshasa; extension of the Bukavu-Katana
transmission line to Goma; expansion of the Mbandaka diesel generating station,
and construction of generating stations at Kindu and Mobayi. How many of
these projects will be executed within the project period is uncertain. Many
industries in Kinshasa use fuel oil and SNEL is expanding its construction
program to enable these consumers to change to electricity. The Kinshasa
distribution system is being strengthened, which will permit the supply to
additional industrial and domestic consumers. A significant increase in
electricity consumption in Kinshasa would however require additional trans-
mission facilities linking Inga to Kinshasa.
Government Strategy in the Power Sector
2.11      The Government attaches high priority to development of the Inga-
Shaba facilities and is making efforts to attract industry to Zaire to use the
surplus power. Exploratory discussions with individual foreign firms over the
possibility of constructing power-intensive projects such as an aluminum
smelter, and a fertilizer plant are continuing. The Government is also
considering the possibility of establishing a "free zone" near Banana, at the
mouth of the Zaire river to attract these or other power-intensive industries.
Other possible uses for Inga II power currently being pursued include electri-
fication of the railway from Kinshasa to Matadi and of some other existing
industrial consumers such as textile mills presently using oil or other forms
of energy. The Government is also considering export of more electricity
to neighboring countries and Zambia is a potential consumer. Export of
electricity may become another source of foreign exchange.
Bank Lending in the Power Sector
2.12      The proposed Credit would be the first Bank Group lending operation
for power in Zaire. The Association recognizes the particular importance of
maintaining an efficient power supply to the important mining region of Shaba
which in 1979 consumed 69% of the total consumption of electrical energy in
Zaire. The supply in the Shaba region has deteriorated to the extent that
there is a dangerous possibility of major failures in the supply of energy to
the mining industry of the region. The sale of copper and cobalt provides 65%
of the foreign exchange earnings of Zaire, and the immediate rehabilitation of
the Shaba generating stations and transmission system is necessary to ensure
the continuity of power supply to the mining industry, and then to provide a
necessary local source of supply after the completion of the Inga-Shaba
transmission line.

III. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
The Borrower
3.01      The Borrower would be the Republic of Zaire who would relend the
equivalent of US$18.0 million to the Societe nationale d'electricite (SNEL),
the project implementing agency, (para. 4.08). The remaining US$1.0 million
equivalent would be used to finance the energy adviser to the National Energy
Commission, and the energy study (para. 1.08).
SNEL
3.02      SNEL is a Government-owned public enterprise created in 1970 1/
but effectively recreated in its present form by Ordinance 78-196 dated
May 5th, 1978, which gave SNEL a new statute setting out in detail the
organization and authority necessary to discharge its responsibility for the
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Zaire
under the aegis of the Ministries of Energy and of Investments (Portefeuilles).
Under Article 16 of its Ordinance, SNEL is required to operate at a profit
sufficient to cover previous losses; to set aside a statutory reserve of 5% of
its profit (up to 10% of its capital); and to generate such other reserves as
may be agreed by the ministries.
3.03      SNEL is governed by a Board of Directors of five to nine members
all nominated by the President of the Republic for a five year term. The
Directors include the Delegue General (DG) and two directors of the Manage-
ment Committee. The President of the Board of Directors, which meets at
least every two months, is also the DG of the Management Committee.
3.04      A Management Committee comprising the Delegue General, two Directors
and a Workers' Representative is responsible for the executive management of
SNEL. A four member audit commission 2/ has the right to examine all of
SNEL's activities and operations.
REGIDESO
3.05      Regie de distribution d'eau et d'electricite (REGIDESO), the
government-owned water supply company, in the past also sold electricity to
consumers in rural areas, where it generated electricity for its water supply
and pumping operations. These electric generating and distribution facilities
were taken over by SNEL in December 1978.
1/   SNEL was initially technically created by Ordinance 70-033 of May 16,
1970 with responsibility for the construction of Inga I hydroelectric
generating station. Ordinance 74-023 of February 9th, 1974 extended
SNEL's powers to the operation of the sector and Ordinance 74-012 of
July 10, 1974 dissolved the six existing private power companies -
COMETRIK, Les forces de l1est, Les forces bas, SOGEFOR, SOGELEC and
COGELIN.

-8-
Organization and Management
3.06      SNEL, with its head office in Kinshasa, is organized into five
geographical regions, of which Shaba is one. Accounts are kept centrally
and separate accounting heads are maintained covering Head Office, five
regional and four subregional units, and three administrative units covering
the ex-REGIDESO systems, Inga I generating station, and the existing trans-
mission system. An organization chart of SNEL (Annex 6) shows a conventional
organization which, however, was only promulgated in late 1979. In practice,
some 40% of the senior categories of management (122 positions) is either
vacant or the positions are held by the same person because of a severe
shortage of suitably qualified candidates. Thus, a component of the project
would be the provision of technical assistance to improve the financial and
management capabilities of SNEL.
3.07      Shaba regional organization (Annex 7) is fairly typical of all
the regions. It comprises a largely autonomous regional office in Lubumbashi
responsible for regional management, technical control, the transmission
system and local distribution. There are three sub-regions - Haut-Shaba,
Luababa, and Nord-Shaba - where subordinate units are located at generation
stations and appropriate distribution centers. Financial control is exercised
by the Head Office in Kinshasa including the accounting and central pool bank
account. The Shaba local staff and management are competent, and power
failures have been mainly due to shortages of materials and replacement equip-
ment requiring foreign exchange.
SNEL's Staff
3.08      In 1979 SNEL employed 4,481 staff to supply some 95,000 consumers -
an average of one employee per 21 consumers. In view of the nature of SNEL's
operations which include some 32 diesel installations, 12 hydro-generating
stations, and a number of widely scattered isolated systems, the ratio of
employees to consumers does not appear to be excessive in comparison with
other East African countries. 1/
3.09      By the end of 1979, expatriate staff had declined to 32 out of a
total 665 employees of technician grade or higher. SNEL is endeavouring to
improve its public utility, management and business practices and to this
end a French expatriate Secretary General presently advises the DG and
also undertakes some executive management functions and an expatriate finan-
cial director is provided by Caisse Centrale.
SNEL-s Generation Facilities
3.10      Two systems of SNEL's nine regions and subregions have the greatest
electricity demand. These are the interconnected system of the Shaba
Region, and the slightly smaller interconnected systems of Kinshasa and Bas
Zaire. Power is also supplied to many outlying areas by isolated hydro and
diesel generating stations (Annex 8). A summary of the installed capacity of

SNEL's Transmission Facilities
3.11      Transmission of power in the larger regions is by 220 kV, and 132 kV
transmission lines (Annex 10) with some sub-transmission at 70 kV, and with
distribution at 6.6 kV and 415/220 kV. In addition to the foregoing, Zaire
is interconnected to its neighboring countries (Map IBRD 15493R) as follows:
(a) From the Ruzizi generating station near Bukavu in Kivu:
-    a 170 km 110 kV line to Kibuye, Kigoma, Kigali,
Rwanda (capacity about 10 MW)
-    a 115 km 70 kV line to Bujumbura, Burundi
(capacity about 9 MW)
(b)  From Shaba: 1/
-    a 45 km 220 km line to Kasumbalesa - Luano, Zambia
(capacity about 80 MW)
(c)  From Kinshasa:
-    a 30 kV line to Brazzaville, Congo
(capacity about 12 MW)
The energy exported over these lines in 1979 totalled 93 GWh (Annex 11).
1/   The energy exchanged between Shaba and Zambia is generally balanced
so that over a period of time neither country requires foreign exchange
for the purchase of this power.

Training
3.12      SNEL has recently appointed a Training Manager who is responsible
for defining and implementing SNEL's training policy. He also supervises
SNEL's excellent training school at Sanga which provides both theoretical and
practical instruction. The school staff includes expatriate staff on contract
from Electricite de France, and the syllabus covers administrative and book-
keeping subjects as well as courses for technicians to an intermediate level.
Two additional expatriate training advisors would be provided under the
project, one to assist the Training Manager, and the other to manage the
school. The proposed project would also provide finance for training aids and
for postgraduate training abroad. During negotiations SNEL agreed to appoint
the training advisors by December 31, 1982, with terms of reference satisfactory
to the Association.
Insurance
3.13      SNEL's assets in operation are not insured through commercial
organizations against the usual risks of fire, explosion, third party, etc.
The assets are looked upon- as being Government owned and the risks to the
assets are therefore assumed by the Government, although no specific insurance
fund exists within the Government. Contractors employed by SNEL are required
to obtain the usual transit and other insurance cover under the terms of their
contracts. These insurance provisions are acceptable to the Association.
Project Monitoring
3.14      The project will be monitored during the course of supervision as
itemized in Annex 12, and a completion report will be prepared.
IV. THE PROJECT
Background
4.01      The generation and transmission systems of SNEL's Shaba region have
deteriorated to the point that the supply of electrical energy to GECAMINES,
now completing a major reconstruction program (Loan 1090-ZR, 1975), and to
other consumers, has become unreliable (Annex 5). The Government of Zaire
approached the Association in January 1980 for financial assistance for the
rehabilitation of the power system of the Shaba region.
4.02      In March 1980, SNEL requested Tractionel Engineering Inter-
national (Belgium) to study the physical condition of the generating plant and
of the entire power system in the Shaba region and to make recommendations for
its rehabilitation. Their report, dated May 1980, stated that while the
appearance of the facilities in general may give a good impression because of
the cleanliness and good order in which the sites are maintained in reality
the four generators at Nseke, which alone produce 60% of the energy for the
region, are in extremely poor condition. The stator windings of Unit No.
4 had failed in 1978 and, although temporary repairs were made, the unit was
not returned to service until August 1980. Tractionel reports that further
failures may occur in any of the units at any time. The manufacturers,



- 11 -
Ateliers de Construction Electriques de Charleroi (ACEC), recommended that the
complete windings of all four stators be replaced, and in April 1980 SNEL
entered into a contract with ACEC for the completion of this work at an
equivalent cost of US$9.2 million. In addition, SNEL will pay an estimated
US$2.5 million in local funds to cover the cost of local labor, local shipping,
insurance etc. Because of the need to meet the demand for energy, only one
unit can be taken out of service at a time, and therefore the work cannot be
completed before 1984 (Annex 13). GECAMINES has expressed its concern over
the possibility that a unit may fail during the period when another has been
dismantled for repair, and therefore rewinding of the generators will not
commence until power is available from the Inga-Shaba transmission line.
4.03      Tractionel also reports that a general lack of maintenance of the
region's system and equipment, and the unavailability of replacement and spare
parts is another serious cause for concern. The generating equipment has not
had a major overlhaul for 8 to 10 years, and the supply of spares for most
items is used up. The operators are now reluctant to take equipment out of
service as long as it is running because, if dismantled, there is a strong
possibility that the equipment would remain out of service due to the lack of
an essential part.
Objectives of the Project
4.04      The main objective of the project is to rehabilitate the generating
stations and the existing transmission and distribution system in the Shaba
region as soon as possible, to prevent failure of the supply of energy to the'
vital mining industry. The project would also ensure that adequate funds were
available to maintain the Shaba system at an effective level of operation.
The proposed project is the least cost means of achieving these objectives.
The project would also provide funds for studies to improve the training of
SNEL's staff (para 3.12); to provide realistic asset values as a basis for
future tariffs (para 5.22), to provide technical assistance to improve manage-
ment (para 4.12) and to examine the relationship of the tariffs between
consumer categories (para 1.06). An electricity planning adviser would be
provided to SNEL (para 4.12) to improve its capability in planning the most
efficient use of its resources. An energy study would be undertaken and an
advisor would be provided to assist the Government in formulating its energy
policies (para 1.08).
The Project
4.05      Following is a brief description of the project of which further
details may be found in Annex 14.
(a) Generating Stations
-    The replacement of the stator windings in the four
generators of the Nseke generating station;
-    Repairs to the generator cooling systems of the Koni and
Nzilo generating stations;
-    Repairs to the air, oil, and water supply systems and the
electrical service systems in all four generating stations.



- 12 -
Supply of small items of consumable stores, such as charts,
signal lamps, transformer oil, etc. (approximately three years'
requirements);
-    Supply of hand tools, small power tools, and safety equipment.
(b) Transmission System
-    Replacement of deteriorated high voltage transmission system
controls and protective equipment located in the sub-stations;
(c) General - Shaba
-    The provision of consultants' services to assist in procure-
ment of materials and equipment, and to supervise project
implementation;
-    Supply of vehicles for maintenance of both generating stations
and transmission lines;
-    Study of movements of the arch dam at Nzilo and the preparation
of a program of rehabilitation;
(d) Others
-    An adviser to the National Energy Commission who will oversee
energy sector studies (para 1.08).
-    Identification of training needs and priorities (para 3.12);
Technical assistance to SNEL, including an electricity planning
adviser and a financial manager and a firm of management con-
sultants; (para 4.12)
Consulting services to examine and make recommendations
on any changes to the tariff structure (para 1.06), and the
revaluation of SNEL's assets (para 5.22);
Project Cost Estimates
4.06      The project is estimated to cost US$39 million of which US$33.7
million is the foreign exchange component. The Government has expressed its
willingness to exempt the project from duties and taxes. Interest during
construction has not been included in the project because the credit is for
the rehabilitation of an existing system which will continue active operations
throughout the project period. Estimated project costs (Annex 15) may be
summarised as follows:

1/   Payments will be made in Belgian francs which have been converted in
this report at the exchange rate at the time of appraisal which was
US$1 = 30 Belgian francs.
Basis for Estimates
4.07      The estimated project costs are based on December, 1981 prices
and include the actual contract price for the supply and installation of the
stator windings of the Nseke generators, and estimates, prepared by the
consultants and SNEL, of cost for the supply of the remaining replacement
parts, consumable supplies, and other components. The cost of the materials
for the Nseke generators delivered from Belgium is firm, but contingencies
have been included for the installation costs on this contract, and on the
remaining items to be purchased. The Bank's present estimate of international
price increases for manufactured goods -- 7.8% (1982); and 8.0% (1983) and
7.5% (1984) -- were used for price contingencies on foreign costs. Because of
the high local inflation rate it was assumed that the progressive devaluation
of the Zaire currency would compensate for price increases in local costs.
Physical contingencies of about 25% for local cost have been included because
of the uncertainty involved in rehabilitation work, while about 10% has been
considered reasonable for foreign costs. In addition, a sum of US$1.5 million
has been included in the physical contingencies to provide for emergency
repairs which may occur after the rehabilitation period - i.e. in 1985 and
1986.
Financing
4.08      External financing (Belgium US$6.7 million equivalent; OPEC US$5.0
million; and IDA US$19.0 million equivalent) would cover 85% of foreign



- 14 -
exchange and 79 percent of total project cost. The IDA Credit would finance
49 percent of total project costs including 38 percent of local costs. Repairs
to the Nseke generators and the supervision of this work by Tractionel will
be financed partly by the Belgian government loan of FB 276 million (US$6.7
million) which is part of a larger amount of concessionary bilateral aid
already available to the Government of Zaire. Evidence satisfactory to the
Association, that these funds have been made available to the project would
be a condition of effectiveness.   Foreign exchange cost of vehicles will be
financed by IDA, foreign exchange costs of all other components to be reha-
bilitated will be jointly financed by the OPEC fund loan and the IDA Credit
which will also finance local expenditures. Condition of effectiveness would
be condition of effectiveness of the OPEC loan. The IDA Credit to SNEL would
be on standard terms.  US$1.0 million will finance the adviser to the Energy
Commission (para 1.08) and US$18.0 million would be onlent to SNEL over 18
years with a 3-year grace period at an interest rate of 11.6%. SNEL would
assume the foreign exchange risk. 1/ Signing of the subsidiary loan agreement
would be a condition of effectiveness. The Belgian funds are lent to Govern-
ment for 20 years with 10 years' grace at a zero interest rate and are part of
a larger amount of bilateral aid already available to the Government; these
funds will be on-lent to SNEL at the same terms.  The OPEC Special Fund loan
to Government is for 20 years with a 5-year grace period and a service charge
of 0.75 percent; these funds will be on-lent to SNEL for 18 years, with 3
years grace at an interest rate of 9.25 percent.

the Government. Long term lending rates charged by the Banque du Zaire
are currently 9% for agricultural or agroindustry equipment, and 15% for
other loans. In view of its nature and the major joint financing involved,
11.6% is considered appropriate for the project.  Inflation in Zaire from
1977 through 1979 was 63%, 58%, and 98%.  In 1980 inflation was 40% and
is expected to decline with adherence to stabilization objectives.

Status of Engineering and Construction Schedule
4.10      SNEL has entered into a contract with ACEC for the supply and
installation of new stator windings of the Nseke generators (para 4.02) at a
cost of US$9.2 million which includes the cost of services of Tractionel to
supervise the contract. SNEL has negotiated another contract with Tractionel
to plan, schedule, design, and supervise all of the remaining rehabilitation
work in the Shaba power system. It is estimated that this portion of the work
would require 118 man-months of which 33 man-months would be expended in
Zaire. The total cost of the consultant's contract for engineering services,
which would be included in the proposed Credit, is estimated to be US$1.3
million of which US$1.2 million is in foreign exchange. The average cost per
man-month is estimated to be about US$11,000 which also includes air travel
and overseas allowances, while SNEL will provide local housing at no charge,
and IDA will cover vehicle and other miscellaneous local expenses estimated at
US$100,000. Tractionel is acceptable to IDA, and during negotiations SNEL
agreed to continue employment of consultants satisfactory to the Association.
An advance from the Project Preparation Facility in the amount of US$500,000
has financed start up work under this contract.
4.11      The construction schedule provides that after power is available
from the Inga-Shaba line, only one generating unit at Nseke may be taken out of
service at a time (para 4.02). The contract for the new stator windings was
awarded in April 1980 and shipment of the material for the first and second
units has been completed. Although the repair time for each unit in the
contract is stated to be-9 months, discussions were held with the contractor,
and he agreed to try to reduce the time to 7 months which would result in the
completion of the generator work by December 1984. Repairs to other portions
of the system can be scheduled either concurrently with the Nseke generators
or, where necessary, during brief periods when all four Nseke generators are
in operation. In any event, the rehabilitation should be completed by
December 31, 1984 (Annex 13) while the technical assistance and other compo-
nents would extend to December 31, 1986.
Technical Assistance
4.12      SNEL introduced a conventional organizational structure in 1979 but
has not been able to operate effectively due to a shortage of qualified staff
at senior management levels. The project therefore includes $3.5 million for
longer term technical assistance, and studies, to strengthen SNEL's operating
capability in several key areas (management, finance, operation and maintenance).
The proposed technical assistance program would be implemented in two stages.
Ir. the first stage, the program would address several critical and urgent
problems which have already been identified. As agreed during negotiations,
it would finance the recruitment of an electricity planning adviser for
Kinshasa and a financial manager for the Southern Region, who would complement
SNEL's accounting manger, financed by French aid. In addition a firm of
management consultants would be retained by December 31, 1982 to study SNEL's
management, financial and commercial organization, operations, procurement,
personnel policy, capital expenditures and financing including SIS assets. It
would propose measures to improve SNEL's capability by September 30, 1983.
Agreement between the Association, the Borrower and SNEL on the recommendations
of the above studies and on a plan of action to implement them would be a



- 16 -
condition to proceed with the subsequent phase of the proposed technical
assistance program, and no payments for for expenditures would be made until
such agreement has been reached. This second stage of the program would
consist of the implementation of the agreed measures in specific management
aspects of SNEL and power sub-sector related issues identified under the first
stage. Consultants would be selected in accordance with procedures set out in
the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants".
Procurement
4.13      Many of the items to be purchased, especially the spare parts, are
proprietary in nature and can only be supplied by the original manufacturer
of the equipment. Nevertheless, attempts will be made to obtain as broad a
response as possible for the supply of this type of equipment, and the possi-
bility of requesting proposals for substituting equipment from other suppliers
will be investigated. Other items, such as air compressors, batteries and
consumables, (lamps, transformer oil, lubricants, charts, etc.) would be
assembled into groups of similar items to be purchased either under the
Association's guidelines for international competitive bidding for contracts
over US$100,000, or for international shopping procedures for materials and
supplies having a value under US$100,000, where several suppliers would be
invited to submit quotations.
Disbursements
4.14      The IDA Credit would be disbursed over five years and used for:
(1) refunding the Project Preparation Facility Advance for the cost of consult-
ants- services, (2) 63% of the foreign costs and 100% of the local labor cost
of repairs to equipment, (3) 63% of the foreign costs and 100% of the local
costs for the purchase of consumable stores, training, the consultants' costs,
excluding those for the engineering for the Nseke contract (paras 4.10, 5.14
and 5.22), and the energy advisor to the Ministry of Energy (para 1.08) (4)
100% of the foreign cost of vehicles and (5) 100% of the total cost of tech-
nical assistance (para 4.12). Disbursement for local labor by force account
will be made against statements of expenditure based on timesheets for the
works performed, certified by the consultants. Disbursements would be made
for only those local labor costs certified by the consultants as actually
having been part of the project, and for the local expenses of consultants,
and the maximum amount in local currency would be limited to US$2.0 million
equivalent. The disbursement schedule (Annex 17) deviates from the standard
profile for power projects because no new construction is involved, and
because the project consists primarily of the purchase of materials and
parts and their installation in existing facilities.
Environmental Considerations
4.15      The work to be completed under this Credit consists of the repair or
replacement of equipment in existing generating stations and transmission
lines. There would be no significant changes in the structures, nor in
the effect on the environment.
Risks
4.16      The physical risk associated with the project is small because of
the absence of civil works, which are frequently subject to significant cost
increases.



- 17 -
4.17      The main risk is institutional in nature and relates to SNEL s
capability to properly administer this and other projects in its development
program while at the same time administering and later operating the SIS
region assets (para 2.02). These risks have been minimized by the employment
of competent consultants, Tractionel of Belgium, who have had extensive
experience in the design of hydroelectric plants and related facilities, and
will assist SNEL, to complete the project successfully.
4.18      There is a slight risk that a major failure may occur in the system
after the rehabilitation project has been completed and in order to provide
for this eventuality a sum of US$1.5 million has been included as a contingency
item (para 4.07).
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
:Introduction
.5.01     The latest available accounts for SNEL were those for the year ended
December 31, 1979. 1/ These and all other accounts in this report have been
expressed in US$ rather than in Zaire because of the frequent steep devalua-
tions of the Zaire exchange rate resulting from the country s economic condi-
tions. 2/ An exchange conversion rate of Z3 = US$1 has been used throughout
this report and the assumptions used for the financial forecasts in the report
are given in Annex 18.  The implementation of the project will benefit the
Shaba region and in particular, its major consumer, GECAMINES. This report,
therefore, concentrates mainly on the financial effects of the project on this
region but also addresses the question of the Inga-Shaba system presently
under construction and SNEL's overall financial management and operational
problems through technical assistance (para 4.12 and Annex 14).
Accounts and Audit
5.02      SNEL's accounts for 1979 are not certified and are known to be
subject to extensive qualifications including major omissions in the accounting
for the construction projects of Inga II, the Inga-Shaba line and the Shaba
high voltage line. These and other deficiencies in SNEL's 1979 accounts and
billing are mainly due to a shortage of adequately trained accounting staff at
senior and intermediate levels. Other factors adversely affecting the 1979
accounts include the change over to the "Plan Comptable Zairois," which was
first made in 1979; the lack of an adequate accounting manual; and, in the
case of billing and consumers accounts receivable, the swiftly successive
tariff increases of October 1979 and January 1980 followed in November 1980 by
a further structural change in the domestic tariffs retroactive to July 1980.
1/   Partial accounts for 1980 were received after negotiations were completed,
and do not differ significantly from the forecasts used in this report.
2/   On December 21, 1971, the exchange rate was Zl = US$2.0.  Eight devalua-
tions later on December 25, 1980, the exchange rate was Zl = US$0.344
and a further devaluation on June 19, 1981 resulted in an exchange
rate of about ZZ = US$0.183 (about Z 5.5 = US$1).



- 18 -
5.03      In August 1980,  Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
made a loan for the Kinshasa distribution system rehabilitation project in
which was included the appointment of Helios (of France) to carry out a
partial audit, and in particular to examine SNEL-s long-term debt and work-
in-progress. Helios' audit report has recently been received, but in view of
paras 5.02 and 5.22, SNEL-s 1979 and 1980 accounts must still be accepted with
extreme caution, particularly as a basis for future estimates and tariff
decisions. During negotiations, SNEL agreed that its future annual accounts
will be audited by external auditors acceptable to the Association, and audit
reports and copies of the accounts forwarded to the Association within 6
months of the end of the financial year.
Inga-Shaba System Under Construction
5.04      In 1974, when the Government decided to construct the SIS (para
2.02). SNEL was given the responsibility for the program and work-in-progress
in SNEL's 1979 accounts recorded a total of US$297 million, of which US$281
million was in respect of these three projects. According to Helios' report
(para 5.03), the cost of the SIS assets as of December 31, 1979 was Z 3,045
million or US$1,015 million if converted at Z 3 = US$1. In this report,
SNEL's ongoing work on this SIS program has been increased by US$734 million
and the related long-term borrowing by US$763 million in order to agree with
the Helios report. Under-recording in SNEL's 1979 accounts was mainly due to
government transactions not reported to SNEL.
5.05      In view of the long construction period (1974-1983), the 1979 cost
of US$1,015 million has been revalued on the same basis as SNEL's assets (para.
5.21) and so increased to US$2,989 million. With the US$195 million construc-
tion cost still expected to complete the program 1/ and with further revalua-
tion, the total value is expected to reach US$4,506 million by the time the
assets come into operation in 1983. It has been assumed that interest and
other financial charges during the construction period have been included in
the consultants estimates of final cost.
5.06      The financing of the SIS program at mid-1979 comprised some US$840
million in long-term borrowing and US$85 million in Government grants, which
by 1983 are expected to reach US$1,000 million and US$100 million, respectively.
The long term borrowing has not been revalued to reflect exchange rate fluctua-
tions but as the financial forecasts are in US$, the effect on future debt
service would be minimal. U.S.A. sources financed almost 80% of the VHV
Inga-Shaba line costs. Swedish and Italian sources financed the remainder.
Financing for the Shaba H.V. line reinforcement and about 50% of the Inga II
construction came from Belgian sources. The remaining financing for Inga II
came from U.S.A., Italy, Austria and France. SNEL will not be able to meet
the debt service and operating costs of SIS from its own resources as the
average tariff per kWh needed to do so would be about USc5.9 in 1984 or about
1/   Based on current consultants' estimated final costs in 1982/83 (before
revaluation) of US$410 million (Inga II), US$700 million (Inga-Shaba
transmission line) and US$100 million (Shaba HV Line).

1.5 times the projected level in the financial forecasts which assumes Govern-
ment subsidies for SIS, and about five times the current average price of
UScl.3. Increases of this magnitude are likely to be politically unacceptable,
particularly as the main burden would fall on GECAMINES.
5.07      At the time of the Government's decision to construct the SIS pro-
gram it was known that the capacity of Inga II greatly exceeded the expected
requirements of GECAMINES, but it was envisaged that other major industrial
users of electric power would be attracted to the country. Although the
possibility of setting up new energy intensive industries, such as aluminum
smelters in Zaire, continue to be discussed with foreign organizations, no
such projects have as yet been established (para. 2.11). By 1984, it is
unlikely that more than 15% to 20% of the capacity of the SIS program will be
required for the Shaba region.
5.08      In view of the fact that the SIS complex would supply bulk power
to Bas Zaire and Shaba, SNEL would maintain SIS as a separate accounting unit
in the same way as for other regions. Annual income statements, funds flow
statements and balance sheets would be produced which, depending on the level
of tariffs charged for SIS power supplied to the regions, would reveal the
subsidy to be paid to SNEL by Government each year. These tariff would be set
by the Zairian authority and these subsidies would need to be paid in advance
in order to provide SNEL with the funds required to meet the SIS expenditures
as they fall due.  During negotiations, SNEL agreed that such accounts would be
prepared each year, duly audited by auditors acceptable to the Association.
The mechanism to be used to calculate the tariff chargeable to the SNEL region
for SIS power was discussed during negotiations.
5.09      Financial forecasts for SNEL and the Shaba region assume that Shaba
will use 5% and 18% of the available electric energy from SIS in 1983 and
1984, respectively (Annexes 18, and 19 through 24). Actual quantities of
energy used will be determined by the optimal operation of the overall SNEL
system, including SIS and the hydro-power stations in Shaba. The volume of
power taken from SIS and the charges made for it, will determine the operating
costs of the Shaba region and the tariffs to be charged to GECAMINES.
Shaba (Southern Region) Accounts
5.10      Separate accounts for the presently isolated system of the Shaba
region were prepared locally until 1978 and audited by Coopers & Lybrand
(International) from their Kinshasa branch office. The 1979 Shaba accounts
have been extracted from the consolidated SNEL accounts.
5.11      Southern region actual and projected balance sheets, income state-
ments and sources and uses of funds statements are shown in Annexes 19
through 21. The gross fixed assets and depreciation reserves in Shaba's 1978
and 1979 accounts have been adjusted to reflect their revaluation by SNEL as
at December 31, 1979. These will also form the basis for the opening revalua-
tion reserve for the 1980 Southern region accounts (para 5.21). During
negotiations SNEL agreed that it would present separate audited accounts of
the Shaba region to the Association within 6 months of the close of its
financial year.



- 20 -
5.12      Through 1979, Shaba's balance sheet has included only one Head
Office account, which is a mixture of capital, retained earnings and current
account. In the projections, it has been assumed that the 1979 Head Office
account was made up only of the 1978 and 1979 retained earnings (US$7.5
million) with the remainder (US$11.8 million) being capital. Under these
circumstances, a Shaba debt:equity ratio is meaningless.
Shaba Cash Resources
5.13      Shaba has always generated a significant proportion of SNEL's
cash and in 1979 a net US$3 million was transferred to SNEL's central bank
account in Kinshasa. Shaba's cash generation will continue to greatly
exceed its operating and project needs. Revenues from GECAMINES are 77% of
the total regional revenues and, since the Government could not permit SNEL to
disconnect GECAMINES for late payment, during negotiations the Government
gave assurance that the payment of electricity bills by government-owned
entities (i.e. by GECAMINES) would be made within 30 days of presentation of
the bill by SNEL.
5.14      The effectiveness of the Shaba regional system will continue to be
vital for the power supply to GECAMINES (para. 6.01). To assure the avail-
ability of funds for maintenance of the system after completion of the project
and to meet any unforeseen repairs, and to ensure that adequate foreign
currency would be available for such needs through 1986, the proposed Credit
includes a provision of US$1.5 million equivalent (para. 4.07) and agreement
was obtained during negotiations that Government would provide any addi-
tional foreign currency required for such repairs above this amount. The
Government also agreed to provide SNEL with the foreign funds needed to
maintain consumable supplies at a level equivalent to about one year's usage.
Tariffs
5.15      The interrelationship between the various tariff consumer categories,
the optimised operations of the SNEL system with the consequent tariffs to be
charged for SIS power, and the subsidies to be provided by Government require
study. During negotiations, SNEL agreed to appoint consultants by December
31, 1982 to carry out a study under terms of reference acceptable to the
Association, with a view to incorporating the recommendations into SNEL's
tariff structure in 1984.
5.16      SNEL operates uniform tariffs throughout Zaire. 1/  In Shaba, some
84% of the presently available capacity is sold to GECAMINES under a direct
1/   Because of inconsistent billing and recording of revenue from year to
year, the arithmetical average of revenue per kWh sold differs materially
between Shaba and SNEL's other regions even though uniform tariffs have
been charged throughout SNEL. Tariffs for major industrial consumers
such as GECAMINES are, of course, individually negotiated and will differ
from each other.

contract. In this report, Shaba's forecast demand (para. 2.05) has been
suppressed to 2,500 GWh, the average annual capacity of the present four
hydroelectric stations until the Inga-Shaba line comes into operation in
mid-1983. Through 1980, Shaba region's financial rate of return on
revalued assets was about 1% and is expected to decline from even this level
iLn 1981. The achievement by SNEL of a rate of return of a minimum of 6% on
its Shaba assets by 1984 is considered to be a realistic requirement; a rate
higher than 6% might be excessive in view of the suppressed demand, which has
restricted load growth in the region; the expected steep increase from the
:1979 cost of supplying power in Shaba (0.41 US cents/kWh) 1/ due to the much
higher cost of the power purchased from SIS (6.1 US cents/kWh, Annex 18); and
in view of the unused capacity of SIS power available for such future expan-
sion in the Shaba region as may be required, which would further increase the
effect of the SIS costs in the region. Through an increase in tariffs
of 57% on SNEL's Southern Region sales, the rate of return on revalued assets
would reach about 2% in 1982. During negotiations, the Association obtained
the agreement of the Government that it would enable SNEL to adjust the
tariffs of all consumers to a level sufficient to achieve a rate of return for
the Southern region of at least 4% in 1983 and 6% in 1984 and thereafter. On
the assumptions made in the forecasts, tariff increases of about 50% in 1983
and 42% in 1984 would be required. These increases, totalling 110% over the 2
years, have been assumed in Shaba's projected revenues. The average high
voltage rate of under US 2.64 cents/kWh in 1984 would not be excessive by
comparison with other African standards and GECAMINES production cost is not
particularly sensitive to the cost of electricity.
Shaba Project Financing Plan
5.17      Over the project period, 1980 through 1984, the project for Shaba
(US$35 million) 2/ will comprise 91% of the total construction program in the
Shaba region (Annex 21). Minor extensions of US$3.5 million have been
included, financed from internal cash generation. SNEL intends to finance 76%
of its US$35 million Shaba project from long term borrowing including 19%
(US$6.7 million) out of an existing Belgian credit to the Government. The
remaining 24% (US$8.3 million including US$5.0 million of foreign costs) will
be financed from internal cash generation (para 4.09). During negotiations
the Government agreed that it would provide additional funds including foreign
exchange, if required, to complete the project.
SNEL-s Construction Program 1980-1983
5.18      Annex 22 shows SNEL's Sources and Uses of Funds.  The overall
construction program for the period of the project (1980-1984) has, apart from
the project, been limited to the estimated US$195 million cost of completing
the SIS construction program, the US$22.5 million Kinshasa distribution system
1/   Estimated to be 3.2 US cents/kWh by 1984 or about eight times the 1979
level.
2/   Exclusive of training and most of the technical assistance costs.

rehabilitation project financed through a credit of French francs 75 million
(US$17.5 million) from the CCCE of France, and US$35 million of other construc-
tion financed locally. Additional projects identified in the Government's
sector plan have not been specifically included, since the commitment of
possible lenders of the necessary foreign exchange is uncertain, but any local
expenditure on preparation etc. of these projects is included in the US$35
million.

5.20      High tension tariff increases have been assumed at the same rates
for all regions of SNEL as required to earn the covenanted rates of return
(para 5.16) for Shaba, excepting the SIS region (1983 - 50%, and 1984 - 42%).
However, accelerated low voltage (LV) tariff growth is required for the other
regions of SNEL to have LV tariff levels ultimately on the same level as the
Shaba region. Increases of 40% for 1982 and 65% for 1983 and 1984 have
therefore been assumed for LV tariffs, since it is the Government's policy to
maintain national tariffs. With these increases, it is likely that, except
for the SIS region losses, SNEL's losses (increasing through 1981) would
decline in 1982 and 1983 and that SNEL would show a profit in 1984. SNEL's
overall rate of return is negative however and even excluding SIS, in 1984
would only reach 1.1% on average revalued net assets in operation. It is not
intended at this stage, to require SNEL to achieve an overall rate of return
as has been required for the Shaba region (para 5.16) because of the uncertainty
of the correct value of SNEL's assets (para 5.22) and the impact of the SIS
region. The Government will need to provide continuing annual subsidies
because of SNEL's losses in the SIS region.
SNEL's Assets Value
5.21      SNEL's balance sheets (Annex 24) have been based on the 1979 accounts
with assets and depreciation revalued. SNEL has computed this revaluation
using the IRES 1/ consumer goods index compiled monthly for the Government,
from a base of January 1961.  It is the most suitable index available in
Zaire. During negotiations SNEL agreed to the continued annual revaluation of
all of SNEL-s assets (including those of Shaba and SIS) using the most appro-
priate index available.
5.22      In this report, SNEL's net assets have been further revalued for
1980 through 1984 by the expected increases in international prices to
arrive at the net fixed assets value as at 1984. Since SNEL's 1979 and
earlier accounts are unaud-ited; the IRES index is not a wholly appropriate
basis for asset revaluation; and SNEL's assets include some which are inopera-
tive (e.g., Sanga hydroelectric generating station which is only in use as a
training school), the projected value of SNEL's assets should be regarded with
caution even after revaluation. A study should be initiated and completed
by June 30, 1984, to identify, assess the condition, remaining useful life
and current value of at least the major assets in operation excluding the SIS
region assets. The value of the assets studied should aggregate to at least
75% of SNEL's total value net assets excluding the SIS region and the results
of the evaluation would be included in SNEL's 1984 accounts. The value of the
SIS assets would have been reviewed separately by January 1st, 1984 and
included in SNEL's 1984 accounts at their realistic value. During negotiations,
SNEL agreed to initiate such a study and to include revised assets in
SNEL's 1984 accounts.

SNEL's Billing
5.23      SNEL's current ratio is expected to remain over 1 despite the over-
draft requirements through 1983. Accounts receivable from consumers averaged
some 161 days billing in 1979 partly due to successive tariff changes (para.
5.02), which delayed billing and caused considerable consumer resistance
and numerous queries. The forecasts assume that this situation will improve
slowly so that by 1984 outstanding consumer accounts will have dropped below
90 days average revenue.
SNEL's Long term Debt
5.24      SNEL's debt:equity ratio in 1979 (including the revaluation reserve
to be reflected in SNEL's 1980 accounts) was 28:72 and is expected to decline
to 18:82 by 1984. These ratios are acceptable, but SNEL would only be able to
meet the debt-service on the SIS loans out of the government's subsidy
(para 5.06 and 5.08).
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROJECT
Requirement for the Project
6.01      There has been a general deterioration in the physical condition of
the hydroelectric generating plant in the Shaba region, to such an extent that
the existing equipment can no longer be considered as a reliable source of
energy for the GECAMINES mining operations, which provide 65% of Zaire's
foreign currency receipts. The continued uninterrupted operation of the mines
is therefore essential to the economy of Zaire. Completion of the Inga-Shaba
transmission line will provide an alternative supply of energy from the Inga
II generating station but, originally scheduled for completion in 1977, the
project is about five years behind schedule due to construction difficulties
encountered along the route, and to civil unrest in the country. The proposed
project remains necessary because the Inga-Shaba transmission line may yet
encounter further delays and, even when it is completed, its length, 1700 km,
makes it vulnerable to perodic failure due to such causes as adverse weather,
difficult (and therefore possibly inadequate) maintenance, operational inexperi-
ence and theft. Moreover, power from the Inga-Shaba transmission line can
only be fed into the Shaba transmission system if there is local generation in
operation. When fully operational, short-circuit calculations indicate that
at least 250 MW of local generation is needed to maintain the electrical
stability of the system. The hydroelectric facilities to be rehabilitated
under the project will therefore continue to be required, even when the
transmission line becomes operational.
Comparison of Alternatives
6.02      There are no viable alternatives to the project.  The Shaba generat-
ing equipment is now in such need of repair that insufficient time remains for



- 25 -
the construction of new generating facilities and such an alternative would be
economically inferior. Energy from Zambia is on a net zero interchange basis
and can not be considered as a firm source, or long-term solution to the
problem, since no increase in supply from Zambia is envisaged.
6.03      The Shaba system has an installed capacity of 471 MW and an expendi-
ture of about US$35 million 1/ to rehabilitate and so provide the system with
another 15 years of useful life is economically justified. This expenditure
is equivalent to a cost of about US$74 per kw installed, as compared with an
average cost of US$2000 to US$3000 per installed kw for a comparable new
hydroelectric plant.
Economic Rate of Return
6.04      The economic rate of return of most projects is generally based
on the discount rate at which the present value of the economic capital and
operating costs equals the present value of savings and revenues expected
to be obtained from the project. The computations for this project have been
based on the assumption that if no rehabilitation were undertaken, the output
of the system would reduce from an average of 2,500 Gwh per year in 1981 to
1,000 Gwh in 1996 at a rate of about 100 Gwh annually, and then remain constant
at this value. Using a selling price of electricity based on constant 1981
tariffs, the rate of return on the investment calculated with shadow pricing
of foreign exchange at 150% is about 16% (Annex 25).
VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, the Government agreed that:
(a)  An energy adviser to the National Energy Commission would be
appointed by December 31, 1982 with terms of reference both for the
advisor and for an energy study satisfactory to the Association
(para. 1.08);
(b) Payment of electricity bills by entities owned by the borrower would
be made within 30 days of receipt of the said bills (para. 5.13);
(c) It would provide SNEL with the foreign exchange required to continue
the operations of the Shaba power system and to maintain consumable
supplies at a level equivalent to about one year's usage (para 5.14).
(d) It would provide sufficient funds to complete the project (para.
5.17).
1/   The total project is US$39 million, but US$1 million would be for an
energy adviser to the National Energy Commission (para 1.08) and US$3.0
would be used for technical assistance outside of the Southern region.



- 26 -
7.02      During negotiations, SNEL agreed that:
(a)  By December 31, 1982 two training advisers would be appointed
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Association
(para. 3.12);
(b)  SNEL would continue to employ consultants satisfactory to the
Association to carry out the project (para. 4.10);
(c)  SNEL would recruit an electricity planning adviser and a financial
manager for the Southern region, and would retain a firm of
management consultants by December 31, 1982, to study the
needs of the organization, and recommend a course of action to
satisfy these needs by September 30, 1983 (para. 4.12);
(d)  SNEL would retain a firm of consultants to assist in the
implementation of the recommended course of action (para. 4.12);
(e)  SNEL would prepare annual accounts, and separate annual
accounts for its SIS and Shaba regions, and that all of these
would be audited by external auditors acceptable to the Asso-
ciation, and that SNEL would forward copies of such audit
reports and accounts to the Association within six months of
the close of its financial year (paras. 5.03, 5.08, 5.11);
(f)  SNEL would appoint consultants by December 31, 1982 under terms
of reference acceptable to the Association, to study the tariff
structure and related matters with a view to incorporating into
its tariff in 1984 the recommendations of such a study after
consultation with the Association (para. 5.15);
(g) SNEL would maintain its tariffs ill the Shaba region at a
level sufficient to achieve a rate of return on average net
fixed assets in operation after revaluation of at least
4% in 1983, and 6% in 1984 and thereafter (para. 5.16);
(h)  SNEL would revalue its assets, including those of its Shaba
and SIS regions, annually by using the most appropriate index
available (para. 5.21); and
(i)  SNEL would initiate a program to identify, assess the condition,
remaining useful life and current value of its major assets,
whose aggregate value accounts for at least 75% of its total
net asset value. This study would be completed by June 30,
1984 and the results incorporated into SNEL's 1984 accounts.
The SIS region assets whose review would be completed
by January 1, 1984 would also be incorporated into SNEL's
1984 accounts (para 5.22).



- 27 -
7.03      The condition of effectiveness of the Credit would be (a) the
receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Association, that Belgian funds
FB 276 million (US$6.7 million) have been made available to the project,
(b) the signing of the subsidiary loan agreement and (c) the effective-
ness of the joint financiers' agreement (para. 4.08).
Recommendation
7.04      With the above agreements, the project is suitable for an IDA
Credit of SDR 16.4 (US$19 million).

SHABA POWER SYSTEM REHABILITATION
Description of Project
1.        This project consists of the repair and replacement of parts and
equipment in four generating stations, and for the transmission lines and
substations of the Shaba region, which have deteriorated due to the lack of
attention and spare parts. The facilities in the system were installed from 25
to 50 years ago, and with the expenditure of a moderate sum of money, the
system can be upgraded to provide a reliable source of power once more.
Miscellaneous Repairs
2.        Each of the plants require miscellaneous repairs to their air,
water, oil and electrical service systems. The largest item of work is the
replacement of the windings in the Nseke generators which have failed due to
age and inappropriate selection of material. When these units were manufac-
tured in 1957, a new type of insulation was used in the stator windings and,
over time, the insulation has deteriorated, leading to failures. The fabrica-
tion of new windings is underway with shipment for the first and second
units delivered to the site. Because of the size of each unit (60 MW) it
would be Inadvisable to take more than one unit out of service at the same
time. ACEC, the original suppliers of the equipment have established a
schedule requiring each unit to be out of service for nine months.
However, ACEC agreed to try and maintain a schedule of 7 months for the
repair of each unit. Other repairs will be carried out as operating
conditions permit. Some may be delayed because of the long delivery time
required for special items no longer available. A partial list of items
to be repaired or replaced is as follows:
Partial List of Items to be Repaired or Replaced
(a) Nseke Generating Station:
- replacement of stator windings in the four generators
- repairs to the butterfly valves in the penstocks
- painting of the penstocks
- replacement of defective parts of the 4 turbine governors

ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 5
(e) High Voltage Transmission System
- equipment in switching stations and various sub-stations have
been in use as long as the equipment in the powerhouses, and
many items of control and protective equipment require replacement.
Vehicles
3.      SNEL has the same problem with the lack of vehicles that arises in
all developing countries. Thus, a component of this project will consist of
the replacement of about 50% of vehicles and mobile equipment in the Shaba
Region such as
22  standard sedans                            1  bulldozer
9  small 4 wheel drive vehicles               1  grader
5  40-passenger buses                         1  tow truck
9  2-ton trucks                               8  dump trucks
17  8-ton trucks                             10  tractors
3  ambulances                                 1  front end loader with backhoe
2  mobile cranes                              1  ladder truck
3  mobile maintenance personnel hoists        4  5-ton trailers
An appropriate supply of- spare parts will also be included, as well as tools
and equipment for proper maintenance. With the foregoing equipment SNEL
would be in a better position to properly maintain the system. An important
need is for trucks to carry the men and equipment required for grass cutting
and brush re-"val operations along the transmission line routes at the begin-
ning of each dry season, in order to reduce the power interruptions caused
by fires.
Consumable Supplies and Tools
4.      This component consists of consumable supplies such as charts for
recording instruments, lamps for annunciator panels, silica gel to absorb the
humidity in equipment, transformer oil, and numerous other items required in
the normal day-to-day operation of the four generating stations. Sufficient
supplies would be provided for about three years requirements. In addition,
small tools would be provided to augment the existing equipment in the work-
shops, as well as items of safety equipment such as hard hats, protective
equipment for welding, hot line gloves, etc.
Training
5.      SNEL has excellent facilities for training, and in November 1980
about 60 personnel from various sections of the organization were in residence
at the training establishment at Sanga in Bas Zaire. For the past two years,
Electricite de France financed a Director for the training unit, and his
contract was completed at the end of 1980. SNEL requires advice on the
direction this training unit should take. This component of the project
is primarily to supply an advisor with an assistant for a 1-year assignment,
to review the present training program, identify training needs, and establish
priorities. It also includes funds for the provision of post graduate training



- 47 -
ANNEX 14
Page 4 of 5
for selected staff members outside the country, and for the purchase of
training needs and aids. The details of this component were discussed
during negotiations, and agreement reached that the cost of 6 man-years of
post graduate training would be funded.
Consultants
6.        SNEL has retained the services of Tractionel, engineering consultants
from Belgium, to supervise the contract with ACEC (para.4.02) and the cost of
this work will be borne by a Belgian Credit.
7.        The main consulting work for the remainder of the project would be
to call for proposals for the supply of materials and equipment and supervise
project implementation. SNEL has now selected Tractionel of Brussels to do
this work and a PPF has now been approved to allow the commencement of this
component of the work.
8.        A study of the movement of the arch dam at the Nzilo site is included
:-s a component of the project. Appropriate instrumentation has been installed
at the dam to monitor the displacement in a downstream direction, which occurs
when the reservoir is filled, and the movement in an upstream direction when
the water in the reservoir falls. The return movement has not been as great
as in the downstream direction, so that there has been a gradual displacement.
in the downstream direction. One of the piers supporting one of the two
tainter gates has moved to such an extent that the gate may only be raised
about 3/4 of its normal travel. The study would require about 20 man-months
of engineering. The estimated cost includes a sum of about US$500,000 to
cover the cost of testing equipment, laboratory work, and other expenses, such
as sub-surface drilling, which may be needed to carry out the study.
9.        Consultants are also required to review the tariff structure and
make recommendations on any changes which may be required to the rates which
are applied to various categories of consumers. The consultants would at
the same time prepare an estimated valuation of SNEL's major assets, in order
to establish a reasonable base for determining tariffs. About 40 man-months
would be expended in the performance of these tasks.
10.       The failure to satisfy the demand for energy in Zaire has caused
difficulties to all sectors of the economy. The Government has established
as National Energy Commission to devise sound energy policies, and a component
of this project would be the financing of an energy adviser to the Commission
for a period of two years, who would initiate in consultation with the Asso-
ciation, a study, or series of studies, to establish energy pricing policies.
I1.       The project estimate includes a sum of US$3.0 million foreign and
US$0.5 million local in order to provide technical assistance as may be
required by SNEL (para 4.12). It was agreed during negotiations that the
technical assistance would take the form of an organizational study by

consultants and include the provision of an expatriate to act as a
financial manager for the Southern region. Co-ordinating discussions will
also take place with the French and Belgian authorities which are also
providing management and organizational assistance during the course of
the project.

SHABA POWER SYSTEM REHABILITATION
Assumptions Used in Forecast Accounts
The following assumptions form the basis of the 1980-1984 forecasts
for the Shaba and SIS regions.
Balance Sheets
1.   Revaluation of Assets and Depreciation
SNEL and SHABA's assets have been revalued by SNEL as at December
31, 1979 on the basis of the IRES index. Further revaluation of these and
SIS assets has been assumed to be in accordance with the Bank's present
estimate of the international price increases for manufactured goods and civil
works and used as a basis for price contingencies. Those are 12.5% for 1980,
9% for 1981, 8.5% for 1982, 7.5% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984.
2.   Value of SIS Region Work-in-Progress
The construction period of the Inga II, Inga-Shaba Line and Shaba
HV Line extends over nearly 9 years from 1974 through 1983 before they are
expected to come into operation. In view of the length of this period, these
assets have also been revalued on the same basis as (1) above. The 1979 IRES
calculation was made by the mission based on the 1979 constant dollar value of
the work-in-progress as reported by HELIOS in its report of November 1980.
The forecast additions assume that the assets come into operation in 1983 and
are based on the consultants' estimated constant dollar completed costs for
Inga II (US$410 million), Inga-Shaba Line (US$700 million), and Shaba HV Line
(US$100 million). These are some 16% higher than the equivalent estimates
from SNEL, but the respective definitions of "cost" may differ.
3.   Revenue
(a) Increase in GWhs sold has assumed:
(I)  HT and MT supply:
(i) Shaba suppressed demand until mid 1983 resulting in zero
growth through 1982, +8% (1983) and +20% (1984).
(ii) Other regions 2% growth annually.
(II) BT (low voltage):
(i) Shaba suppressed demand - no growth through 1982 then +5%
1983 and +5% 1984.



- 53 -
ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 3
(ii) Other regions 2% growth annually.
(III) Exports remaining at 1979 level.
(b) Tariffs
(I) Shaba 1979 HT/MT tariffs average 64% lower than the overall average
tariff for all the other SNEL regions combined (0.41 US cts/kWh
against 1.15 US cts/kWh), and Shaba BT tariffs 24% lower (0.65 US
cts/KwH against 0.85 US cts/kWh). Tariffs were increased and in
some cases the basis was changed in late 1979 and 1980 resulting in
erratic recording of revenue in 1979. SNEL records higher revenue
in the first six months of 1980 than for the whole of 1979. Extra-
polated for the whole of 1980, HT/MT sales for Shaba region show an
increase of 111% to US$19.9 million and BT sales an increase of 438%
to US$7.0 million. Actual sales for all regions will only be known
when the 1980 accounts are completed, and even then the accuracy of
the billing is likely to be doubtful. Estimated Shaba 1980 revenues
presently average HT/MT, 0.863 US cts/kWh, and BT, US3.53 US cts/kWh.
(II) Tariff increases have been assumed of 50% (1982), 40% (1983) and
42% (1984) for SHABA and SNEL but low tension tariffs have been
assumed increase by 65% in 1983 and 1984 to begin standardising LT
tariffs with SHABA.
4.   Operating Expenses
All expenses have been assumed to be fixed and have been escalated for
1980 through 1984 at the same rate as the assets have been revalued (see
1 above).
Power supplied to Shaba by the SIS region has been assumed to be
5.2% in 1983 and 18.4% in 1984 of the line theoretical capacity of 3,800
Gwh. If the line is used at full capacity the cost of energy would
average 5.9 US cents per Kwh in 1983 and 6.1 US cents per Kwh in 1984,
on the basis of the following assumptions:
Expenses @ 1% of Capital Cost   US$43.7 million    US$45.6 million
in constant dollars escalated
for 1983 and 1984
Depreciation (Inga II @ 2.5%,
Lines @ 3.33%)                    US$134.8 million   US$145.0 million
Interest on the SIS loans         US$45.0 million    US$43.0 million

ANNEX 18
Page 3 of 3
5.   Fuel
In 1979, fuel only accounted for 6.7% of SNEL's operating expenses
before depreciation (4.9% in 1978) so has not been specifically escalated
since its relative importance is expected to decline even further.
6.   Long-term debt
(a) Based on the Helios report, interest on SIS loans for 1983 and 1984
have been estimated at US$45 million and US$43 million respectively,
and repayments estimated at US$70 million for each of the two years.
(b)  Long-term debt on SNEL's other loans has not been revalued but
little debt service becomes due through 1984. Onlending terms for
the project are assumed to be 18 years (including 3 years grace
period) at 10.6% interest.
7.   Interest during construction
(a) No interest has been charged to capital during the construction
period of the project.
(b) Interest on the SIS assets has been assumed to be included in
the estimates of the completed costs (see 2 above).
8.   Tax
Although a 15% tax on profits exists in Zaire, it has been assumed
that SNEL will pay no tax during the period in view of its accumulated losses.

SHABA POWER SYSTEM REHABILITATION
Economic Rate of Return of the Project
Method and Assumptions Made to Determine the Rate of Return on Investment
1.        The economic rate of return is generally based on the discount rate
at which the present economic value of the project and operating costs equals
the present value of savings and revenues expected to be obtained from the
project.
2.        The capital cost of the repairs, spare parts, and new equipment
exclusive of the technical assistance and training components are estimated
at December 31, 1981 prices. Shadow prices were applied to foreign costs at a
rate of 50% above the estimated cost. The economic life of the project was
assumed to be 15 years.
3.        The benefits are assumed to be the revenue from the sale of
electricity which is available due to the rehabilitation program. It has
been assumed that without rehabilitation the output of the system would
fall from 2500 Gwh per year in 1981 to 1000 Gwh 1996 at about 100 Gwh
annually, and then remain constant at this value.
4.        It was assumed that this project does not require an increase in
operating costs.
5.        The streams of costs and revenues are presented in the table on
page 2 of this annex. The rate of return is estimated to be about 16%.
