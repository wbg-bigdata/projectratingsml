Preface
The following is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Bethioua
Port Project in Algeria (Loan 995-AL) for which US$70 million, was approved by
the Executive Directors on May 21, 1974. The loan was closed on December 31,
1981. At that time only US$49.7 million, or 71% of the loan was disbursed.
This PCR was prepared by the Bank's Europe, Middle East and North
Africa Regional office. It is based on information obtained from EMENA
Information Center, Appraisal Report No. 386a-AL, loan documents, staff
supervision reports and project progress reports.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department but
the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft PCR was sent to the
Borrower; however, no comments were received.

Highlights
The Bethioua Port Project had two main objectives:
(i) To help the Algerian Government meet its contractual obligations for
the export of LNG; and (ii) to improve port management and operations
throughout the sector (para. 2.05). These objectives were only partly met,
i.e. the infrastructure needed to assure the export of LNG was satisfactorily
completed, but part of the technical assistance program designed to improve
sector institutions was cancelled; the positive exception was the
reorganization of the port sub-sector following one consultant's study
financed by the project and with UNCTAD direct involvement.
The final cost of civil works performed is not known because of the
unsettled dispute between the Government and the joint venture to whom the
contract was awarded (paras. 3.10 and 3.11).
By comparing forecasts of LNG traffic through the project port and
actual traffic obtained from sources other than the Algerian Government, one
can conclude that the new port has been underutilized (paras. 4.01 to 4.05).
Also, the project has had only a limited institution building impact on the
sub-sector.
At appraisal, no evaluation was made of the economic rate of return
on the investment, as this project was considered one component of a larger
program meant to help develop the country's natural resources of gas. It was
estimated, that the financial rate of return on the port investment was about
7.5 to 10 percent. Since there were no data available at the conclusion of
this project concerning LNG traffic and of operational or financial
performance of the port, the PCR did not attempt to make a financial or
economic reevaluation of the project. (paras. 7.01 to 7.06).
The conclusions of the PCR are not yet finalized because of the many
issues pending resolution. Also, the worldwide low economic activity affected
negatively traffic at the port. It will take another four to five years of
worldwide adjustments to fluctuating petroleum prices and technological
adjustments to a variety of sources of energy to determine whether the
investment was financially and economically profitable to the Algerian
Government.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA: LOAN NO. 995-AL - BETHIOUA PORT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Following the discovery of substantial reserves of natural gas at
Hassi R'Mel in Algeria, ihe Bank provided a loan of US$20.5 million (378-AL)
in 1964, two years after the country became independent, to help finance
construction of the first: liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in the world at
the Port of Arzew, some 6 km east of Oran for export of LNG to France and
Great Britain.   During the ensuing years, Algeria developed an ambitious
scheme for natural gas exports which offered considerable economic benefits,
and earnings which would contribute to other essential economic and social
activities. Additional gas export facilities were provided at Skikda, some
350 km east of Alger, to cater for other contracts with France, Spain and
U.S.A. with gas deliveries commencing in 1971. By that year, it became
obvious that, with the increasing demand for natural gas, further port
expansion was needed and the Government asked the Bank to help finance a
project to expand Arzew Port. Consultants appointed by the Government had
already been carrying out feasibility studies for development of additional
LNG facilities and identification of a suitable port site.
1.02     In late 1972 based upon the findings of these studies, the Government
and the Bank concluded that even expanded facilities at Arzew would not be
sufficient to handle the large additional quantities of natural gas being
committed for export, and the Government decided that a new port at Bethioua,
about 6 km east of Arzew, should be constructed. This port would handle the
export of LNG to the U.S. and Europe, and of its by-products - condensates,
liquid ammonia, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - and crude oil on a
world-wide basis. Thus the combination of the existing LNG export facilities
at Arzew and Skikda together with the new Port of Bethioua, the extensive
proven recoverable reserves of natural gas, and unique experience in gas
liquefaction would enable Algeria to actively participate in this growing
international trade (as set out in Annex 3 of the SAR).
1.03     The new port was to accommodate (a) LNG carriers already under
construction of up to 125,000 m3 capacity with the future capability of
handling carriers of up to 200,000 m3, (b) crude oil tankers of up to
250,000 dwt, (c) condensate tankers of up to 250,000 dwt, (d) LPG tankers of
up to 70,000 m3 capacity and (e) ammonia tankers of up to 12,000 dwt.
Technical assistance was also to be provided including preparation of a master
plan for Algerian Commercial Ports.
1.04     The estimated project cost was US$293.2 million of which the foreign
exchange component was US$182 million.    Financing of the foreign exchange was
to be US$70 million by IBRD, US$20 million by the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development (AFESD), US$32 million by Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau
(KfW) and US$60 million from the Kuwait Investment Company (KIC). The
Government was to be the Borrower from IBRD and AFSED, to issue bonds through
the Banque Nationale d'Algerie to KIC and cause the Banque Algerienne de
Developpement to contract with KfW. The Government would provide the balance
of the project cost.

1.05     The data used to prepare this report was obtained from feasibility
and engineering studies commissioned by the Government prior to appraisal, the
Bank's appraisal report, the Bank's supervision reports on project execution,
the progress reports provided by the Direction general des Infrastructures
(DI), and project correspondence files. Data relating to LNG traffic, and
operational and financial data have been requested from the Government, but
have not yet been made available to the Bank. An economic analysis of the
project benefits has not therefore been possible to date.
II. Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     Algeria had been exporting about 1.5 billion m3 of LNG from Arzew
to France and Britain since 1966, and other contracts had been negotiated with
France, Spain and USA for deliveries of between 7 and 13 billion m3 of LNG
per year to be handled by the new facilities at Skikda. In late 1972, two
contracts were signed with a European Consortium (SAGAPE project) and
Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co. (USA) for deliveries of 15.5 billion m3 and
4.5 billion m3 per year respectively. These contracts, together with the
existing El Paso contract concluded in 1969, for an overall supply of 40
billion m3 per year seemed to guarantee the full utilization of the planned
capacity being built at Bethioua, but the El Paso contract was the only firm
one, all others having to be ratified by their respective governments. In
fact, El Paso II contract submitted for approval in April 1973, was cancelled
by Sonatrach before the project was appraised in October 1973, because the
U.S. Federal Power Commission (FPC) did not approve it within the required
validity period. This contract was renegotiated and concluded by the end of
1976 for similar quantities, subject again to FPC's approval. The SAGAPE
project lapsed in late 1976 because some European governments disagreed on
proposed gas prices, and Algeria then decided to sign separate contracts with
former members of the consortium, Belgium and France for deliveries of over 10
billion m3 per year (see Annex 1).
2.02     The recoverable reserves of natural gas in the Hassi R'Mel field were
estimated in January 1970 as being 3,000 billion m3 so that expansion of the
LNG export trade was a natural development of the country's economy, and
commitments for exporting up to 40 billion m3 per year had been made by the
gas commercial agency SONATRACH. The question of which part of the LNG
development (pipeline, port, liquefaction plant or part of the LNG tanker
fleet) IBRD would finance, was partly determined when in 1971, the Government
sought bilateral financing for the pipeline, LNG plant and tanker fleet and
requested IBRD to finance the port development.
2.03     The Algerian government showed early reluctance to release detailed
information on gas export contracts. The Loan Committee of April 24, 1972,
agreed that the project could be accepted through a least-cost analysis for
location of breakwaters and quantity of dredging, provided that the whole gas
export scheme would clearly be beneficial to the country's economy. This was
ascertained mainly on the basis of confirmed export prices under the first El
Paso contract and the Bank decided in October 1973 to proceed with appraisal
of the project .

2.04     The preliminary estimated cost of the new port project was US$250 to
300 million, with a forei.gn exchange component of some US$135 to 180 million,
far exceeding the amount included in the Bank's lending program for Algeria.
KFW 1/ and AFESD 21 were invited to participate in co-financing of the
project and confirmed their interest.
2.05     The project was intended to:
a) enable Algeri.a to meet its contractual obligations (current and
under negotiation) for the export of LNG and its by-products based on
an exploitation period of 25 years; and
b) assist in improving port planning, management, administration,
operations, accounting and tariff structure in all Algerian ports.
2.06     The main elements of the project comprised three breakwaters to form
an enclosed harbour with ten berths and a shallow draft basin, and technical
assistance for project preparation, construction supervision, management and
operational studies and training. The associated processing slants, pipelines
and ship-loading facilities were to be provided by SONATRACH -_ (financed
from other bilateral sources.)
2.07     The basic criteria for the project were analysed during appraisal in
October 1973 by the Bank who accepted that the facilities to be provided
corresponded with the least cost solution and the LNG project requirements. No
separate economic rate of return was calculated for the project port since it
was an integral part of the LNG export scheme. The financial rate of return
was estimated at 7.5 to 9.7 percent.
2.08     During loan negctiations, the Government accepted compliance with the
standard Bank loan conditions related to civil works, with some modifications:
(i) clauses on insurance were omitted since the Algerian insurance industry is
state-owned; (ii) clauses on re-evaluation of fixed assets and exemption from
contributing to the State budget were omitted, since the Government requested
that re-evaluation in the port sector be undertaken at the same time as in
other Algerian public enterprises and not at the frequency normally required
by the Bank; (iii) the section dealing with prequalification was deleted from
the Loan Agreement after the Government pointed out that prequalification had,
in fact, been completed before negotiations in a manner acceptable to the
Bank; and (iv) the Algerian system does not allow for independent external
auditors, and the Bank, therefore, agreed that the "Controle Financier de
l'Etat" would carry out the audits.

2.09     The Office National des Ports (ONP) had been set up in 1971 to
replace the separate autonomous port authorities, and would normally have been
appointed as Management Authority of the Bethioua Port. However, in view of
ONP's lack of experience, no decision was taken at appraisal on management of
the port; the Government only committing itself to nominate a Management
Authority not later than June 30, 1976. ONP was eventually nominated.
2.10     In order to assist in effective implementation of the project, the
Government undertook at the Bank's suggestion to employ qualified engineering
consultants for studies and other assistance and to consult with the Bank on
results of studies undertaken. In addition, the Government agreed to the
preparation of a master plan study for all Algerian ports to improve overall
port sector planning including traffic forecasting, financial analyses,
economic evaluation, and tariffs policy, organisation and management,
operations and training.
2.11     Retroactive financing of US$4.5 million equivalent was agreed for
financing payments to consultants for preparation and for mobilisation
payments to the contractors. Both retroactive financing and disbursements for
works carried out would be made on a prorated share of the foreign exchange
costs among the co-financers.
2.12     A single contract covering the main civil works was to be awarded
following international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines.
III. Implementation
General
3.01     A chart showing key dates in the estimated and actual implementation
schedules is reproduced in Annex 2.
3.02     Eight months elapsed from the loan signing date to February 10, 1975,
the date of effectiveness of the Loan for the Bank, but the additional cross
effectiveness condition in Section 7.01 of the Loan Agreement caused further
delays. The Arab Fund was last to declare effectiveness for its Loan on April
20, 1975, which made the first disbursements possible.
3.03     The main features of the Bethioua Port Project are: (i) the
successful completion of the civil works some 19 months later than estimated,
with relatively few revisions and with actual costs fairly close to those
which were expected at appraisal (see Annex 3); (ii) a very flat disbursement



- 5 -
profile, due to slow withdrawals and a long outstanding claim by the
Contractor which has still not been resolved (see Annex 4); (iii) the
non-compliance with many of the covenants; and (iv) the poor performance of
the technical assistance program.
Implementation of civil works and provision of equipment.
3.04     The preliminary and detailed design studies had already been
commenced at the time the Loan Agreement became effective by a U.S. consulting
firm who was also assigned to supervise construction.
3.05     On September 3, 1974, the Government signed a contract for the
Bethioua Port construction with a joint venture of two German and one Dutch
firm in association with a local firm for all civil works (DA 711 million) and
dredging (DA 102 million) equivalent to a total of about US$213.5 million with
a foreign exchange component of US$127.5 million (59.7%). The works were due
to start in September 1974 and be completed within 34 months (July 1977), 6
months less than the appraisal estimate.
3.06     The contractors' consortium had asked for a six-month mobilisation
period, but this was disallowed by the Government who argued that, based on
Algerian law, it could not allow any period for equipment mobilisation since
the joint venture included an Algerian firm. However, the contractor actually
commenced work in December 1974, and while the work progressed satisfactorily
from the technical viewpoint, there were delays mainly due to poor initial
coordination between the four contractors, and their unfamiliarity with
customs regulations and procedures in Algeria for importing equipment and
materials, and to shortage of skilled Algerian labour due to extensive ongoing
and new projects in the area.
3.07     According to the contractor's revised schedule, work was due to be
completed by November 1978, a period of 48 months (which included an extension
of 14 months granted by the Government on November 14, 1976). All civil and
dredging works were actually finished in February 1979, 19 months behind the
Appraisal Report schedule. The first LNG plant was considerably delayed and
the berths were ready in late 1977, long before they were needed to make the
first LNG shipment. A comparison of the planned and actual schedules for
completion of the various components of the civil works is given in Annex 5.
3.08     The first gas-processing plant, which was to be constructed by a US
company and financed from bilateral sources, was originally planned to come on
stream in mid-1976 but contractual problems delayed it for 18 months.
The second LNG plant contract was awarded on a turnkey basis to a US
company in March 1976, and completed as scheduled by mid-1979. The third LNG
plant was due for completion by another US company in August 1980, with a
revised capacity of 15. 7 billion m3 per year. Construction work was stopped
as a consequence of cancellation of the European LNG consortium contract and
the plant has remained uncompleted. The fourth



- 6 -
plant had earlier been diverted to a different site at Issers near Algiers but
has not yet been constructed. The existing capacity at Bethioua to date is 21
billion m3 compared with 40 billion m planned at appraisal.
3.09     The Loan Agreement stipulated that SONATRACH should provide loading
facilities at the first two berths by mid-1976 (Section 4.02). However,
subsequent to the delays in completion of the first LNG plant, there were
additional delays in the provision of the port loading facilities, and in
November 1979, it was reported that only two berths (out of ten) had been
equipped for loading by SONATRACH; since then no further information regarding
commissioning of the other berths has been provided (see Annex 6). Such
delays are understandable as Algeria lost the consumer contracts which, at the
time of appraisal, accounted for the largest part of the Bethioua traffic.
Project Cost
3.10     The project cost at appraisal was estimated at DA 1200 million
(US$293.2 million) with a foreign exchange component of DA 745 million
(US$182.0 million). The unsettled dispute between the Government and the
joint venture makes it difficult to assess the true final cost.
At the completion of the civil works, actual payments to the joint
venture amounted to DA 848.2 million (US$204 million) of which DA 818.4
million had been paid to the contractors; the detailed breakdown of the
components as compared to the appraisal estimate is shown in Annex 3. The
contractor has outstanding claims for a total of DA 530 million, but the
Algerian Government has a counter claim against the contractor for unpaid
taxes amounting DA 245 million.
3.11     Nearly all dredging was carried out by cutter suction dredgers (no
blasting being necessary) and no dredging of lead-in channels was needed since
the natural depth at the outer berths and entrances was adequate for the
design requirement for oil tankers of up to 250,000 dwt. No cavities in the
subsoils have been found at the locations of any civil works and no additional
cost was thus required to ensure stability of such structures. These
advantages have, however, been offset by the longer time needed to complete
the civil works (19 months), which made the project cost subject to
inflation. The distribution between local and foreign costs is not known at
this time.
Disbursement
3.12     A comparison of actual with expected disbursements is made in Annex
7. The first disbursement was made 9 months later than forecast due to
delayed effectiveness of the co-financing arrangements and late withdrawal
submission. Annex 4 shows that, in addition to the initial delay, actual



disbursements increasingly lagged behind the appraisal estimate due to: (i)
Government's slowness in processing contractor's monthly statements and
applications to the Bank for disbursements; and (ii) difficulties encountered
by the Contractor in importing the necessary construction equipment and spare
parts. There has been rno disbursement since December 31, 1978, because of the
dispute between the Government and the Contractor. The US$2.2 million
allocated for training and studies remain undisbursed, since the Government
has not submitted withdrawal applications.
Performance of Consultarits, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrowers
3.13     The Government was initially dissatisfied with the services provided
by the consultant in charge of design and supervision, and six of the
consultant's staff, including the project manager, left Algeria in March 1975
at Government's request. The monthly reports prepared at that time by the
consultant were also inadequate. Replacements for the consultant's site staff
were sent to Algeria and with the subsequent improvement in performance, the
consultant has been considered satisfactory by both the Government and the
Bank. The Borrower's staff was actively associated with construction
supervision and received useful training and experience in port construction.
3.14     From a technical standpoint, the contractor performed well.
Equipment was generally adequate and worked efficiently. However, the
organization and planning showed some early deficiencies.
3.15     The relationships between the contractors and the Government were
good during the construction period. However, certain disputes occurred, the
first when no contractors' mobilisation period was given by the Borrower.
This is normally a matter for contractual negotiation at the time of bid
acceptance, but the contractor did agree during contract negotiations to
accept existing Algerian regulations which did not permit a mobilization
period.
3.16     The Contractor has complained that the delays to monthly payments by
the Government generated serious financial difficulties. Payment due to the
contractors in March 1978 was rejected by the Borrower in September 1978
because of a typing error, and all subsequent payments were withheld, since
under Algerian law, no further payments could be made until the original error
was resolved. The Government eventually suspended further payments to the
Contractor and processing of claims, and in June 1979, blocked the
Contractors' accounts in Algerian Banks involving a total value of DA 245.5
million because of unpaid taxes. A Commission was appointed to review the
claim made by the Contractor and reported to the Government which deferred its
decision for many months. It was only in December 1981, that a compromise
solution to the dispute was communicated by the Algerian Government to the
Contractors. The Contractor has since responded indicating that the compromise
solution is not satisfactory. The Loan closing date was extended to December
1981 to ensure that funds were available for settling negotiated



- 8 -
claims. Following the Borrower's request, the Loan was closed in December
1981, and the undisbursed balance of US$2O.336 million cancelled without any
claims being settled (see Annex 8 for disbursements against Loan Agreement
categories). The Bank has encouraged the parties to make every effort to
resolve their differences.
3.17     Bank missions have endeavoured to maintain an effective dialogue with
the Borrower at all times. Reporting by the DI has been spasmodic and
generally not in accordance with Bank requirements. Despite a formal request
to the Borrower to participate in preparing the completion report and provide
specific information, no response has been received from Algeria.
IV. Operating Performance
4.01     In 1976, the Government decided that ONP would eventually be the
Management Authority for Bethioua Port, but gave ONP no legal status to
operate it. The neighbouring port of Arzew supplied the necessary staff and
marine services. No traffic data and operating costs have been released by
the Government since the new port started operations in early 1978, and
therefore the operating performance cannot be accurately evaluated. However,
information collected from external sources may be used to compare the actual
level of port operations to those anticipated by the Bank at appraisal.
4.02     Until the mid 1970's, the Algerian LNG trade was expected to grow
rapidly, and large outlets were apparently guaranteed. The new facilities at
Bethioua were meant to serve both the US and the European market for supply of
25 and 15 billion m3 each year respectively. Related contracts were signed
at appraisal (but still needed respective Government approvals before they
could become operational, with the exception of El Paso 1, already confirmed
by the US Federal Power Commission). By 1978, Algeria had committed about 60
billion m3 under various contracts, out of 70 billion m3 considered as the
maximum yearly exports that the then proven reserves would allow. Other
possible contracts were discussed for an overall supply of some 50 billion
m3 which would have called for a new gas development program.
4.03     Important changes occurred over the period 1979-81, primarily arising
from a major disagreement about gas selling prices between Algeria and its
customers. Many contracts were cancelled and ei§ht should be operational in
1982, for an overall supply of some 25 billion m ; in addition, Italy is
expected to take 12.5 billion m3 through the new Trans-Med Pipeline from
1982 onward for which negotiations are presently in progress.
4.04     In retrospect, Algeria has exported much lower quantities of natural
gas than anticipated since 1976 as a result of price changes occurring soon
after Bethioua port was operational. Annex 13 gives the evolution of exports



- 9 -
from 1976 to 1980, showing the expansion which followed the opening of the
Bethioua Port in 1978 and the steep decline after deliveries under El Paso 1
contract ended in April 1980. Algerian LNG exports for 1981 are estimated at
some 8 billion m3.
4.05     Considering the planned allocation of traffic under specific
contracts and data obtained from external sources as provided in Annexes 1 and
12, a broad assessment of the actual traffic in Bethioua (based upon figures
from external sources) compared with the appraisal forecast is given below
(traffic in billion m3):
Appraisal       Estimated
Years        Estimate        Traffic        Differences
1976            5.0             0.0           - 5.0
1977           17.5            0.0            -17.5
1978           30.0            2.0            -28.0
1979           40.0             7.0           -33.0
1980           40.0             2.0           -38.0
1981           40.0            0.0            -40.0
The above figures strongly suggest that the new port has remained
under-utilized so far. Traffic expansion is foreseeable in the future but not
to the extent that would guarantee a normal utilization of LNG port
facilities, as will be discussed in paras. 7.03 to 7.05
V. Financial Performance
5.01      Section 3.08 of the Loan Agreement stipulated that the Borrower
should charge the Management Authority, with the operation of the assets of
the Port of Bethioua, by not later than June 30, 1976 or such other date as
the Bank might agree. By 1981, in spite of many reminders being sent to the
Borrower by the Bank, this covenant has not been complied with. ONP has shown
an understandable reluctance to take over the financial responsibility of the
port before an agreement could be reached with SONATRACH on dues, rates and
other charges for services and facilities that would provide ONP with enough
funds to repay to the Borrower the total investment cost of the port's
infrastructure as defined in Section 3.08 of the Loan Agreement. The Bank was
informed in 1980 that negotiations thereon were proceeding, but to date, no
further details have been given.
5.02     Operating accounts and balance sheets for ONP were obtained for the
years 1976 and 1977 (see Annexes 9 and 10), but they are based on an
unrealistic and incomplete valuation of fixed assets and do not allow
assessment of ONP's financial performance. Audited accounts have not been
submitted to the Bank as required by the Loan Agreement (Section 5.01 (c)).



- 10 -
The commercial accounts of the new port have never been communicated to the
Bank, and a comparison between actual results and appraisal prospects has not
therefore been possible. Any attempt to estimate the financial flows would be
meaningless, since the main factors have not yet been defined in that: (i) the
final cost of the port investment will only be determined after the
contractor's claim has been resolved; (ii) details of port activity, level of
staffing and equipment and the operating costs have not been provided; (iii)
there are no traffic statistics or declared port charges, which prevent
estimation of flow of revenues. However, if the port is to be financially
viable, this will require SONATRACH to pay wharfage charges at a much higher
level than foreseen at appraisal, in view of the excess structural capacity
which exists in the port now, as will be seen in Section VII.
VI. Institutional Performance and Development
6.01     Technical assistance was to be provided for preparing a master plan
for Algerian ports including site investigations, traffic forecasts,
development programs, preliminary engineering, economic evaluations, financial
analyses, tariffs, and organization of the commercial ports and management
authority. Technical assistance was also to be provided to ONP, CNAN, and
SONAMA for training, management, operations and administration.
6.02     The original contract between the Government and British consultants
for a port study did not include all the institutional requirements of the
Loan Agreement, such as the organization of ONP, CNAN and SONAMA, internal
auditing and data processing (including computerization) and training
programs. When these omissions were pointed out to the Government, they
indicated that it was too late to change the scope of that study, but agreed
to use consultants acceptable to the Bank under agreed terms of reference to
carry out all additional studies required later on. The supervision mission
of July 1976 obtained a copy of the report on ports management, traffic
forecasts and recommendations for future expansion of port's facilities and
found it to be very thorough and comprehensive. The Bank confirmed its
readiness to reimburse the foreign expenditures involved, but no application
was made by the Government.
6.03     The Borrower undertook under Loan Agreement Section 3.04(a) to
streamline the existing organization of the port sector. New legislation
issued on June 17, 1975 gave increased powers to ONP, with an overall
responsibility for all port services and efficient running of ports,
restricting cargo storage periods, creating additional cargo storage areas
outside the ports, and setting up a permanent committee to coordinate port
operations. This committee was set up under the Secretariat d'Etat au Plan
(SEP) with the assigned responsibility to deal with specific matters and with
the recommendations of the British report. Its work was reported by the
Borrower to subsequent Bank missions as progressing satisfactorily. UNDP's
assistance was requested to further improve the port organization, and in
early 1978, a group of experts from UNCTAD executed project ALG 77/009 to
draft new port legislation and regulations.



- 11 -
6.04     With regard to the preparation of a master plan for Algerian
commercial ports, the Government did not invite consultants to submit
proposals until April 14, 1976 (about 18 months late). This study was to be
financed out of this Loan but the deferred decision to undertake it resulted
in its financing being transferred to the new port Loan 1427-ALG (Port of
Jijel project) signed on September 30, 1977 (which has since been cancelled).
6.05     The project made provision for assistance to SONAMA, the state
enterprise responsible for cargo handling. In August 1976, the Bank suggested
the need for (i) technical assistance to improve the port operations and
modernization of handling equipment and techniques; and, (ii) training of
personnel involved in cargo operations and in equipment maintenance. With the
Bank's concurrence, a contract between SONAMA and a French consultant was
signed on March 7, 1977 for training SONAMA's personnel to maintain forklift
trucks, but six months later, the contract was cancelled, the Borrower being
dissatisfied with the Consultant's performance. No application was made to
the Bank for disbursement in relation to this contract, and the Bank is not
aware of any further contracts concluded for assistance to SONAMA.
6.06     In order to strengthen the managerial skills of its personnel, ONP
commissioned another French consultant in November 1976 to prepare a training
program. The Bank agreed to finance the study, but since then, has been
unable to obtain details about its outcome and no application for disbursement
against the contract has been made by the Borrower. The technical assistance
program to CNAN has never been implemented.
6.07     The project's relative failure with regard to technical assistance is
partly attributable to a lack of coordination between the respective
government agencies and. the state-owned enterprises, and a project unit to act
as a link between the Covernment and the Bank, was repeatedly suggested by
supervision missions to no avail. The training concept as envisaged by the
Bank did not accord with the Algerian concept of its needs, and the consequent
absence of dedication to such training by the Government is not altogether
surprising.
VII. Economic Re-evaluation
7.01     The Loan Committee of April 24, 1972, agreed that the Bethioua Port
Project could be accepted on the basis of a least cost analysis. During the
project preparation, a comparison was made between the estimated break-even
level and gas prices under negotiated contracts, (mainly El Paso 1) and the
conclusion was reached that the project would have a positive economic rate of
return. It was decided to go ahead with the project appraisal, although there
were some reservations concerning both level of prices and risks. The least
cost solution provided for the optimal number and location of berths and the
optimal location of the breakwaters, in relation to the size of vessels
expected to use the port and based on a given traffic and a gas liquefaction
plant capacity of 40 biLlion m3 a year at the port.



- 12 -
7.02     The Borrower has not released any information on the investment costs
and on export sales (prices and volumes) and therefore, an economic
re-evaluation of the gas export scheme to date has not been possible.
However, based upon data researched from external sources, a review of the
recent evolution of the energy market and its future prospects with special
reference to gas, has been carried out and is given in Annex 14.       Based on
these data the existing and possible future economic status of the LNG project
in Algeria is reviewed hereafter. However, some data from different sources
were not consistent, and judgments had to be made as to their relative
reliabilities.
7.03     The gas liquefaction capacity available at Bethioua is now limited to
21 billion m3 per year - half the amount planned at appraisal. The current
situation is thus: (i) the port is highly specialized and has no apparent
alternative uses; (ii) when the existing liquefaction capacity at Bethioua is
fully utilized, the port facilities will still be over-provided, unless new
liquefaction capacity is built there.
7.04     The Bank agreed to finance the port project because the economic
viability of the gas export scheme seemed credible. At appraisal, the
break-even point of the land-based investment was estimated at 23.9 cents per
million BTU. In 1975, the Algeria f.o.b price per million BTU was about 50.0
cents, while the average oil price per equivalent BTU was more than four times
higher. This situation was not normal and Algeria rightly decided to
renegotiate its selling prices, aiming at reaching f.o.b. parity with crude
oil (approximately $6.11 in 1980). Negotiations with Belgium's Distrigas
determined a new base price of US$4.80 at January 1, 1981, and the recent
contract with France (February 1982) was settled at a f.o.b. price slightly
over US$5, this price being indexed on oil prices. The above demonstrates
that Algeria should now derive substantial benefits from its gas export scheme.
7.05     Bethioua port was designed for LNG export but more recently, the
Algerian investment program for liquefaction plants has been cut, and the
provision of trans-ocean pipelines is of increasing interest to the Algerian
government. Algeria expects to deliver natural gas to Italy through the
Trans-Mediterranean pipeline now completed. Yearly volumes will amount to
12.5 billion m3 and there are plans to increase them to 18 billion m3. A
second project is still being considered to supply Spain throught the "Segamo"
line with 10 billion m3 per year and its capacity could even be doubled in
order to pipe natural gas into the northern parts of Europe. Since Western
Europe is the main market where Algeria can sell its gas, the question arises
as to whether it is more economic to send natural gas to Europe through
pipelines or to liquefy it. If the former is true, then building the LNG
plants at Bethioua to full capacity would have been a costly decision.
7.06      There is however no straightforward answer to this question even in
retrospect because the necessary information to evaluate it has not been
released by the Borrower so far, but some comparative figures from external
sources may be utilized for a general analysis. Piping the gas directly from
Algeria to North Europe would cost from US$l.6 to US$2.5 per million BTU,



- 13 -
which compares with LNG freighting costs of about US$2.20 - US$2.30 1,
Deliveries to Southern Europe naturally give a more clearcut advantage to the
pipeline. On the other hand, laying deep-sea pipelines for natural gas still
poses practical problems. A provisional conclusion drawn is that the LNG
system may still be just:ifiable for long maritime routes on two counts: it
remains competitive for deliveries to the Northern part of France and to
Belgium where the Zeebrugge terminal is due to start operations by 1985, and
to Germany which is expected to import gas from Algeria in the second half of
this decade. If the US market is reopened during the next decade, the LNG
system would have to be used. In view of the advantage to Algeria of
maintaining flexibility in markets and modes of delivery, the parallel use of
LNG and pipeline systems as exercised by the Government, seems fully justified.
VIII. The Role of IBRD
8.01     The project suffered serious initial setbacks when the main gas
contracts collapsed and the new port temporarily lost much of its traffic.
Such problems had been envisaged at the identification stage, but it would not
have been practicable for the Bank to insist that contracts for LNG sales be
signed and ratified by the respective governments before agreeing to finance
the project. The first contract with El Paso offered an apparent guarantee
which has since proved unreliable following the final breakdown of price
negotiations early in 1981.
8.02     Loan covenants for institutional improvements in port organizations
through technical assistance are normally more successful where organizations
will perform their normal duties and functions in the project port. The
general ineffectiveness of the technical assistance program may be attributed
to the fact that their current activities and needs were unrelated to the
specialized operations to be carried out in the new port. The Bank's
assessment of the Government's capacity to coordinate the various studies and
to effect the necessary organisational changes may have been over-optimistic.
The Ministry of Public Wlorks, which alone had the authority to communicate
officially with the Bank, did not succeed in coordinating public enterprises
and agencies placed under the authority of other Ministries.
8.03     It should be noted that in Algeria the period 1976 to 1980 was marked
by intense public debates on restructuring of economic systems in order to

pricing."

improve efficiency. A consensus was not yet been reached on the new policy to
follow and therefore, the time was not favourable within the country itself
for a straightforward implementation of organizational changes by the port
agencies involved in the project, and this was beyond the Bank's control.
8.04     Bank supervision during the project was carried out with a good
continuity of staff. The supervision reports reflected the difficulties in
gaining information and access to the responsible Government officials in some
cases. The relations between the Bank and the Borrower have mostly been good
so far as personal contacts were concerned, but these were rarely followed up
by firm official commitments for the reasons mentioned above. Such relations
have been less effective during the past two-year period, when some letters
sent by the Bank have remained unanswered. None of the requested data has
been given for the preparation of this project completion report.
IX. Conclusion (Interim only)
9.01     The project has met with many difficulties as enumerated in the text;
some of them still await resolution. It was in fact an enclave project, and
the Bank should have treated it as such; the Port of Bethioua is nothing more
than a link in the processing and marketing chain of liquefied gas; much more
than to the port sector of Algeria, it belongs to the gas sector. Financial
viability of the port per se does not make much sense in that context, nor the
envisaged intervention of ONP, nor, as noted above, technical assistance
programs to SONAMA. Failure to reach project objectives is not automatically
failure in project implementation; it may be, and this seems to be the case
here, the demonstration of a failure to correctly identify objectives.
9.02     This report remains incomplete in many respects; finalising it would
require an active collaboration of the Borrowers and of the co-financiers. It
is hoped that this will materialise, so that full benefit can be drawn from
the lessons given by the project

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA: LOAN NO: 995-AL - BETHIOUA PORT PROJECT
WORLD ENERGY MARKET AND LNG TRAFFIC
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
1.01    The appraisal report rightly assumed that world consumption of
primary forms of energy would slow down, but its forecasts were still too
optimistic, since the energy scene altered dramatically due to a
combination of political and economic factors. Following the Arab embargo
in 1973, a fivefold increase in oil prices triggered a severe recession in
the world economy, which extended through 1975. At the same time, the
future of energy supplies became a universal concern, calling for new
policies trying to reduce the energy intensity of the economic activity and
to develop alternative sources of power such as nuclear energy, which
explains why the world consumption of primary energy has grown over the
period 1970-1979 at a yearly rate of 2.8% only, as compared to the 5%
forecast at appraisal, (see Table 1 ).
1.02    The SAR's assumptions on the evolution of the energy consumption
pattern are closer to what really happened. Three areas still dominate the
world market: North America, Western Europe and Japan, but their
importance has diminished more quickly than anticipated -- by the end of
1979, they accounted for some 55% of the overall world consumption,
compared with 58% assumed at appraisal. The forecast contribution of each
energy source to the world supply also changed. In 1980, world oil demand
was about 65 million barrels/day, instead of the 70 million forecast and
the expansion of natural gas has been much slower than expected; in 1980,
the commercial production of gas amounted to 1522 billion m3, whereas the
appraisal report estimated it would exceed 3550 billion. (See table 2) Gas
only slightly increased its share in the overall consumption pattern from
19.9% in 1970 to 21.2% in 1979.
1.03    International trade in natural gas had expanded at a higher rate
than consumption during the 1970's. In 1977 it was still limited to 147
billion m3 (10.4% of the world energy consumption). In 1980 it reached a
total of 202 billion m3 (13.3% of the world energy consumption). (See
table 3) LNG technology played an important part in this expansion, and the
LNG trade increased from 18 billion m3 in 1977 to 32 billion m3 in
1980. However, even though rapid, this growth was more moderate than
anticipated a few years ago 1 . This reduced pattern of growth has been
the result of technical, economic and political problems of which
1/ See LNG Review 1977 E. K. Faridany (page 11). In 1980 the world LNG
trade was expected to reach as much as 60 billion m3

liquefaction plants coming on stream several years behind schedule, and the
increase in gas prices causing cancellation of major contracts were the
most significant.
1.04    Over the next 20 years, the energy demand should grow at a slow
rate of 2.5% with an economic growth elasticity of some 0.7 when it was
well over 1.0 before 1973. Its worldwide distribution should be marked by
a further decrease in the share taken by North America, Western Europe and
Japan; on the other hand, developing countries should raise their share
from 13% in 1980 to 17% in 1990, and the Eastern countries of Europe should
also increase their share. Concerning the pattern of energy demand by
sources, it is believed that crude oil will be constrained by supply
availability, and that its trade will not increase much over the level
reached in 1979. The contribution of natural gas could be much more
important for three reasons: (i) there are huge reserves still untapped;
(ii) natural gas is a clean, efficient and still cheap fuel; and (iii)
technological constraints which long hampered its transportation over long
distances and in large quantities have been greatly reduced. Table 4 shows
the projected gas trade till year 2000 for major consuming centers.
However, political factors could have adverse effects on gas development.
Furthermore, a disagreement between sellers and buyers on price could limit
the anticipated greater use of gas.
1.05    The deposits in the major consuming areas -- North America, Western
Europe and Japan -- are relatively limited. The major potential supplier
of natural gas is the USSR where almost two fifths of the world proven gas
reserves are concentrated. There are proposals to deliver gas to the
United States and contracts have already been signed with the Federal
Republic of Germany, France and Italy for a total supply of 24 billion m3
a year, starting in 1984. Other projected contracts would bring the total
delivery by the USSR to Western Europe to some 40 billion m3 a year.
These prospects may darken if from political pressures and disputes on
selling prices. For instance, some producers estimate that they would
better utilise their gas supplies to build up petrochemical and aluminum
industries which are energy-intensive. Iran made such a choice and, at one
time, appeared likely to become the leader in international gas trade with
its huge proven reserves of about 11 trillion m3.
1.06    Within this context, the expansion of LNG trade looks uncertain.
Firstly, it will depend on the trend in the international trade of natural
gas, and on its capacity to compete with alternative transport modes. The
dramatic increase in the cost of building liquefaction plants and
specialized ships may hamper future large scaled development of the LNG
system. In addition, the technology of handling LNG still needs to be
improved in terms of safety. Accidents have occurred during the last five
years during maritime transport, and a major explosion at Cove Point (USA)
forced the shutdown of facilities for a month. The technological
possibilities of transporting natural gas through large-diameter or
high-pressure land pipelines and submarine pipelines are also increasing,
and it may even be a cheaper alternative to transform the gas into

methanol for long haul maritime transport than to liquefy it.1'
The number of LNG projects already operational in the world or under
construction anticipate a large increase in the international trade of LNG
compared with the present level. The negative factors reviewed at above
should not prevent the LNG trade to expand vigourously throughout this
decade at a yearly rate of 11.5%. By 1990, it should reach some 95 billion
m3, three times its 1981) level.
