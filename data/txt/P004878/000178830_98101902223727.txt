INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR THE BETHIOUA PORT PROJECT
1.        I s-ubmit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for the equivalent
of US$70.0 million to help finance a project for the construction of a new
port at Bethioua. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including 4 years
of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. Additional financing is
being obtained for this project for a total of $112 million, as follows: (i)
S20 million equivalent from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development
(AFESD) for 20 years including 4 years of grace at 6 percent; (ii) $60 million
equivalent following a bond sale underwritten by the Kuwait Investment Company
([IC) for 16 years including 4 years of grace at 7 percent; and (iii) $32 mil-
lion ecuivalent from the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) for 30 years
including 10 years of grace at 2 percent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Economic Development and Prospects of
Algeria" (155-AL) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 4, 1973.
An economic mission visited Algeria in April/May 1974 and is preparing its
report. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Following a period of adjustment after independence in 1962, the
Governmert has succeeded in creating political stability while pursuing a
strategy of pragmatic and vigorous economic and social development based on
centralized control of the economy, economic independence, rapid growth through
industrialization, rapid expansion of education and training, and a narrowing
of income disparities. Substantial progress has been made in alleviating the
two principal constraints to development - the institutional vacuum and the
lack of technical and professional staff. The exploitation of oil reserves
anti industrialization have played the primary role in development, while the
agricultural sector has lagged.   Unemployment remains high, although there is
an acute shortage of skilled manpower. Policies of financial austerity and
equalizing distribution of income have been pursued, and emigration of workers
from the poorer areas to the cities and abroad have helped to narrow dispari-
ties of income between regions. However, discrepancies still exist, mainly
reflecting differences in resources and the level of economic development.
4.        With the nationalizations in the oil and gas sector in 1971 nearly
all foreign-owned enterprises have been brought under Algerian control. For-
eign capital is welcomed in the form of medium and long term loans, though
joint ventures are accepted in specific cases, e.g. as part of economic
cooperation with other Maghreb countries or when they offer technological
know-how or outlets to foreign markets. A major share of Algeria's invest-
ment effort has gone into basic industry - notably hydrocarbons, cast iron,



- 2 -
steel and chemicals - and into education. To narrow income disparities, the
Government has established wage and salary ceilings, minimum wage policies,
generous social security, free education, government transfers in the form
of veteran's pensions and price subsidies. Special regional development
programs have also been started to narrow regional differences. Firally, an
agrarian reform began in 1971 whose ultimate aims are to redress asset dis-
trilbution and unlock productive potentials in the agricultural sector.
5.        The Government exercises economic and investment controls either
directly or through large state enterprises and "self-managed" modern farms
which dominate the various economic sectors. To relieve the shortages of
teclnical and managerial staff in most sectors, public spending on education
and training was raised to 10 percent of GDP, and innovative solutions were
found to the difficult problem of adapting the education and training system
to the needs of the economy. Extensive recourse was also made to external
technical assistance, and pretraining on the Job was made a feature of proj-
ect contracts implemented by foreign firms. The Government and the state
enterprises greatly increased their capacity to implement development proj-
ects, particularly in the hydrocarbon and industrial sectors, although ac-
celerating investment implied cost overruns and initial operational ineffi-
ciencies. The Government now seems to realize the need for more efficient
use of investments, and is trying to introduce improvements in project eval-
uation, and some decentralization of decision making.
6.        During the First Four-Year Plan period (1970-73), preliminary data
indicate that GDP growth averaged 10.8 percent a year from 1969 to 1973 in
current prices. Domestic prices were strictly controlled, probably rising
by an average of about 3.5 percent per year. (There is no general price
index; industrial prices rose by 3.1 percent a year, and the cost of living
index in Algiers by an average of 4.7 percent per year.) Sharply rising in-
vestment and petroleum export earnings were the main sources of this growth.
Gross fixed investment rose from 28 percent of GDP in 1969 to 37 percent in
1973. Public investment, which accounted for about 85 percent of the total,
amounted to roughly $8 billion in the four-year period, and reached a level
of about $2.8 billion in 1973. Petroleum export earnings rose to an esti-
mated $1.5 billion in 1973 from $0.6 billion in 1969.
7.        The main emphasis of the 1970-73 Plan, besides education, was on
the hydrocarbon and industry sectors, which received the largest shares of
public investment (30 percent and 23 percent respectively). In the hydro-
carbon sector, public investment ($2.3 billion in 1970-73) enabled Algeria
to maintain an exploration program, to raise crude oil production from 48.2
million tons in 1970 to 50.8 million tons in 1973, increase petroleum refin-
ing capacity to more than 5 million tons at the end of 1973, expand trans-
port capacity and build up gas export capacity. Algeria also entered into
several long term contracts for gas deliveries to Europe and the USA which
are being negotiated and which could result in export of about 80 billion
cubic meters in 1980. The hydrocarbon sector contributed 19 percent of GDP
and 83 percent of merchandise exports in 1973.



-3-
8.        In manufacturing, Algeria has followed a strategy of developing
heavy industries first; that is, petrochemicals, iron and steel and heavy
mechanical and electrical industries. Less investment has gone into other
manufacturing, such as food processing, consumer goods and construction ma-
terials. Manufacturing contributed 12 percent of GDP in 1973. Agriculture
has been stagnant and suffers from several structural problems. Its share
in GDP was about 8 percent in 1972 and its E:hare of public investment was
only 6 percent. Output has hardly risen abcve the level at independence,
and agricultural exports declined as demand for wine weakened. Algeria's
large food deficit consequently increased; by the end of the Plan period,
it had to import 30 percent of its cereals requirements and nearly all its
needs, in sugar, dairy products and edible oil. Concerned over the struc-
tural problems and the unfavorable trends, the Government gave increased
attention to the agricultural sector towards the end of the Plan, deciding
on a large program of conversion of vineyards, and introducing a program of
agrarian reform as well as increasing the supply of needed inputs. Invest-
ments in transport infrastructure, housing and health also seem to have
lagged behind the growing needs.
9.        Due to high capital intensity, investment and output growth did not
generate enough new employment opportunities to reduce significantly the high
rate of unemployment. Despite the relief provided by substantial emigration
to France (which has been stopped by Algeria recently), unemployment outside
agriculture was estimated at 25 percent of the related labor force in 1972
and agricultural underemployment at 40 to 50 percent according to official
statistics. However, these figures probably were overestimates, since they
included a number of people who either were not actively seeking employment.
The Government is giving increasing attention to the problems of rural areas
through regional development programs and through agrarian reform.
10.       The financing of sharply rising investments required a large in-
crease in national savings, which Algeria achieved through austere fiscal
and incomes policies. National savings attained nearly 30 percent of GNP
in 1973. This high percentage derived primarily from petroleum and related
revenues and also from the restraints put on public salaries and private pro-
fits. During the 1970-73 period, about 90 percent of investment was financed
by national savings. National savings were supplemented by rising external
borrowing mainly from commercial sources. Algeria's external debt was esti-
mated at $2.4 billion, including $1 billion undisbursed, at the end of 1972.
Borrowings from the Eurodollar market, which exceeded $1.3 billion in 1973,
and other borrowings may have raised the external debt to about $4 billion
(including undisbursed) at the end of 1973. External debt service had risen
to nearly $200 million, or 12 percent of exports and workers' remittances,
in 1972. It is expected to continue rising to over $500 million a year by
the mid seventies, but to represent less than 10 percent of export earnings,
due to the petroleum price rise. Gross foreign exchange reserves exceeded
$1.1 billion at the end of 1973, equal to about five months' imports of goods.
With the substantial oil price increases Algeria's capacity to service addi-
tional debt has been greatly enhanced.



11.       The economic growth prospects of Algeria in the medium term are
bright, given the large additions made to industrial capacity in recent years
anld the considerably higher earnings expected from exports of oil, oil prod-
ucts and liquefied natural gas that can support further rises in the invest-
ment level. A considerably higher rate of GDP growth than in the past can
be expected. The constraints on managerial and technical skills will con-
tinue to be strong despite rapid training. A second Four-Year Plan 1974-77
(involving $25 billion investment) is in final stages of consideration by
the Governnment. It will outline the Government's strategy for taking ad-
vantage of the additional development possibilities resulting from the rise
in petroleum prices, and is expected to continue to give particular attention
to industrialization and education, while putting increased emphasis on sec-
tors that ha( lagged heretofore such as agriculture, transportation, tele-
communication, health and housing.
12.       The export price of Algerian crude oil has risen from an estimated
$3.80 per barrel in 1973 to about $12 per barrel in early 1974.    At this price,
petroleum exports could amount to about $5 billion in 1974, while Government
revenues could exceed $3.5 billion. (In 1973, petroleum exports amounted to
$1.5 billion with Government revenue of $1.1 billion.) Petroleum production
is not expected to increase rapidly, but gas exports will increase substan-
tiallv in the later years of the plan period, with a possible increase in
the price of gas. In these circumstances, and assuming that oil prices re-
main stable in real terms, it seems that Algeria will not face financial con-
straints in raising its already considerable rate of investment. However, it
is not clear at present whether it will accunmulate any significant financial
surplus or may still need further capital inflow in the medium term, since
the result will depend, among other things, on the level of investment (in-
cluding reinvestment in the oil and gas sector); on policies regarding con-
sumption standards and on policies concerning accelerated repayment of short-
term debt.  The possible accumulation of reserves will also depend partly on
the relative movement of prices between exported oil and imported equipment
and raw materials. The Second Plan should throw additional light on these
points and thus provide the basis for a firmer assessment of the balance be-
tween Algeria's financial requiremenLs and resources over the medium term.
An economic mission to review the Plan is scheduled for later this year.
In the longer term, particularly as gas exports become significant in 1977/78,
as the savings capacity outside the oil sector expands, and if new oil re-
sources are exploited, Algeria's need for external capital should decrease
rapidly.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       In the period following independence, the Bank's relations with
Algeria were affected by the question of compensation for the nationaliza-
tion of foreign-owned banks, and insurance, commercial, manufacturing, mining
and oil companies. Settlements were progressively reached in the banking,



- 5 -
insurance and petroleum sectors, and the Bank has been informed that discus-
sions with industrial firms which be-an last year have been concluded satis-
factorily with most claimants. It i; therefore considered that the compen-
sation issue does not present an obstacle to further Bank lending to Algeria.
14.       Lending to Algeria resumed in FY73 with two loans totalling $24.5
million, for education and transportation projects. Annex II contains a sum-
mary statement of Bank loans as of December 31, 1973, and notes on the execu-
tion of ongoing projects. In addition to the proposed project, the FY74 lend-
ing program includes loans for power ($38.5 million) and railway ($49 million)
projects which are being presented simultaneously. A Project Identification
Mission visited Algeria in April-May, in conjunction with the Economic Mission
to help identify and prepare projects suitable for future Bank financing, with-
in the framework of the 1974-77 Plan which is being finalized.
15.       The recent rise in the prices of oil will enable Algeria to further
raise its already high level of investment and to relax its austerity program
without running into balance of payments difficulties. Thus, in the medium
term, the focus of Bank lending to Algeria will be on projects which help
substantially to enhance Algeria's capacity to maximize the returns from its
investments and spread the benefits of growth. This would be done by demon-
strating the value of thorough project preparation and by supporting, through
individual loans, the Government's efforts to increase the efficiency of eco-
nomic institutions. In this context substantial technical assistance may be
needed and requested by the Government; a joint Bank-IMF technical assistance
mission recently visited Algeria at the request of the Government to study
the financial planning system and to prepare a training program dealing with
various aspects of financial planning at the central, banking and project
levels. A further major aim of Bank lending would be to support the Govern-
ment's efforts in creating jobs to alleviate the need for emigration, and in
spreading the benefits of growth and development to the less developed rural
areas and outlying regions. This may be done by focussing on lending and
technical assistance in two specific areas: regional development and agrarian
reform. In my recent visit to Algeria, interest in the Bank's contribution to
these socially oriented programs was expressed by the Government. The future
leniding program which is to be formulated for Algeria will be based upon a
Bank appraisal of the country's needs for financial and technical assistance,
taking into account the special advantages that cooperation with the Bank
can offer. Appraisals are currently scheduled for projects in education,
and indtustry: these two sectors, together with agriculture and general in-
frastructure, are likely to be the main areas of Bank involvement in Algeria.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT AND ENERGY SECTORS
The Transport Sector
16.       The Algerian transport system, mainly concentrated in the densely
populated northern coastal region, needs rehabilitation and expansion to



- 6 -
meet the burgeoning needs of the economv. Road and rail development has
been complementary rather than competitive: road freight represents about:
two thirds of the total land transport but 90 percent of bulk commodities
are carried by rail. However, only 45 percent of the 79,000 km of roads are
paved and much of these suffer from poor maintenance. The pipeline system is
extensive and important both for petroleum and for natural gas. There are
five major commercial ports and there is a need for port expansion, partic-
ularlv for exports of petroleum and natural gas.
17.       Transport investment policy is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Planning. Roads and ports are constructed bv the Ministry of Public Works
and Construct4on. Tle railways are operated by the Societe Nationale des
Gher,ins de Per Algeriens, a government-owned company.   Operation at the ports
is shared between three agencies: the Office Nationale des Ports (ONP), which
is responsible for port administration, exploitation and development; the
Office National de Navigation (CNAN), which controls cargo movement and op-
erates tug boats; and the Societe Nationale de Manutention (SONAMA), which is
responsible for cargo handling. The gas liquefaction plants, fields, and pipe-
lines are owned or controlled by the Societe Nationale de Transport et de
Conmmercialisation des Hydrocarbons (SONATRACII).
18.       Transport planning suffers from several weaknesses, including inade-
quate data, insufficient coordination, and a shortage of qualified staff; the
transport network, which was adequate in the early years after independence,
has progressively deteriorated because of insufficient investments. Several
track sections of the railways are in poor condition and the Bank is assist-
ing with a rehabilitation project, which is being presented to the Executive
Directors separately. The road network has not kept pace withi economic growth
since the mid 1960s. A Bank financed project is hielping to overcome these
deficiencies (Loan 912-AL of June 19, 1973). General cargo port operations
are inefficient, with serious congestion in transit and storage areas. The
existing port facilities for handling liquefied natural gas (LNG) and its
by-products are becoming inadequate for handling the levels of anticipated
exports (see below).
19.       The proposed project will be the third in the transport sector.
The Government objective, whiich the Bank is supporting in its projects, hlas
b3een to meet the urgent needs of the basic transport system including infra-
structure and equipment while financing studies to develop long-term invest-
ment and improvement programs. In the long run, it is expected that Bank as-
sisted projects will help improve productivity and operational and financial
management, planning, project preparation and regulation.
The Oil and Cas Sector
2(.       The oil and gas sector plays a leading role in Algeria's develop-
nent strategy.  Algerian po1.icv has consistently been that the extraction of
hydrocarbons - the depletion of a limited natural resource - must serve to
fintance the integration, diversification and development of the economy. In
fact, oil resources have generated substantial government revenue and foreign
exchlange earnings in support of this policy. The Government has moved away



- 7-
from being simply a collector of revenues from foreign oil and gas interests
and has in the course of seven years taken control of the management and de-
velopment of the hydrocarbons sector. Its instrument has been the state oil
and gas enterprise, SONATRACH, which from 1964 to 1966 provided oil and gas
transport and marketing, and since September 1966, has included all other
phases of thEi hydrocarbons industry. Since February 24, 1971, SONATRACH
has controlled 80 percent of Algerian oil production, all gas deposits, oil
and gas transport, refineries and petrochemical plant, inland marketing and
90 percent of gas liquefaction plants.
21.       Proven recoverable reserves of Algerian crude oil were estimated at
just over 12 billion barrels at end 1971, equivalent to about 30 years of pro-
duction at the 1972 rate of lifting. Production began in 1956 with the first
major discoveries of Algerian crude oil. By 1970 output had reached 46.5 mil-
lion tons (993,000 b/d). It fell in 1971 to 35.5 million tons (760,000 b/d),
reflecting the months when some foreign-owned companies lifted no oil. How-
ever, it recovered to about 48 million tons (1.02 million b/d) in 1972 or 2.2
percent of world output.
22.       Production of Algerian natural gas for commercial sale is currently
made from the Hassi R'Mel field. This is one of the world's largest gas
fields with proven recoverable reserves, using present production techniques,
estimated at roughly 2,000 billion m3. This is equivalent to about 740 years
of life at production rates in mid-1972. Recoverable reserves from this field
could conceivably be increased to the order of 3,000 billion m3 by utilizing
gas injection to increase reservoir pressure. The balance of known Algerian
gas reserves - approximately 1,000 billion m3 - is distributed among some 8
other fields, some of which may need to be brought into commercial production
if new schemes to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) are frbrloprf, in addi-
tion to those already announced.
23.       North America, Western Europe and Japan consume about three-quarters
of world gas supplies, but have in their territories only about one quarter of
world proven gas reserves. Consumption of gas in these countries is growing
faster than that of other forms of primary energy, and domestic resources are
not being developed fast enough to cover needs. Hence these countries are
looking for supplementary sources.
24.       The development of natural gas liquefaction projects throughout the
world is in part a consequence of this rapid growth of natural gas consumption.
Algeria, with unique experience in this field (the world's first gas liquefac-
tion plant, owned by the Compagnie Algerienne de Methane Liquide - CAMEL - was
completed in 1964 at Arzew, financed in part by Bank Loan 378) and with about
8 percent of the world's known reserves is in an excellent position to bene-
fit from this growth. The recent dramatic increases in oil prices are likely
to enhance the return to be expected from gas exports over the long-term.
25.       Besides the initial CAMEL plant, which supplies British and French
users with about 1.5 billion m3 annually, Algeria has the Skikda plant now
producing 3.9 billion m3 annually with another 1.3 billion m3 to be completed
this year. The plant(s) to be built at Bethioua are part of an ambitious na-
tural gas export scheme which is expected to result in shipments from Bethioua



- 8 -
alone totalling 40 billion m3 annually by 1980. SONATRACH has made or is
negotiating commitments for 1,755 billion m3, or 44 percent of Algeria's proven
recoverable reserves for delivery over the next 25 years. Even with an aggres-
sive program of industrialization, domestic needs are not expected to exceed
2 percent of these reserves. The prices of natural gas contracted for export
range from $0.305 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU) for earlier contracts
to $0.65 for more recent contracts. With these figures and the known capital
and operating expenses, this massive gas export scheme is undoubtedly benefi-
cial to the Algerian economy. The Government estimates total earnings from
the scheme at $70 billion over the next 25 years as against a total expendi-
ture of $10 billion.  Mloreover the scheme will provide immediate employment
to several thousand people in gas exploration, transportation, and transforma-
tion: in related industrial activities and in port operations. It will also
provide needed energy to importing countries in Europe, Africa, and North
America.
PART IV - TIE PROJECT
26.       In 1971, the Government asked the Bank to help finance a project to
expand Arzew port so that sufficient facilities would be available for expanded
natural gas exports. In late 1972, it became evident that expansion of facil-
ities at Arzew would not be sufficient to handle the large quantities of natural
gas and its by-products now being conmitted for export. Government then decided
that a new port should be constructed at Bethioua, about 6 km east of Arzew.
Fcllowing completion of the feasibility studies, the project was appraised in
October 1973. Negotiations were held in April and May 1974 with an Algerian
delegation led by Mr. Mahfoud Aoufi, Secretary General of the Ministry of
Finance. A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the
report entitled "Appraisal of the Bethioua Port Project, Algeria, Report
No. 386(a)-AL', dated May 13, 1974, which is being distributed separately.
A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
GCeneral
27.       The project is the construction of a new port at Bethioua for export
of LNG and its by-products (condensates, liquid ammonia, and liquefied natural
gas) as well as crude oil with primary emphasis on LNG export to the United
States and Europe. No dry cargo is expected. The project will: (a) enable
Algeria to meet its obligations for the next 25 years under natural gas ex-
port contracts already concluded and some of those now being negotiated; (b)
allow export of crude oil and by-products associated with the natural gas
export schenie; and (c) assist in improving port planning, management, ad-
miilistration, operations, accounting, and tariff setting in all Alger'an ports.
28.       The main elements of the project are construction of breakwaters,
berths, and a shallow draft basin.   Consultant services were employed for
project design and prep.%ration of ten(der documents and will be provided for
construction supervision and studies of and training in port management,



-9-
administration, and operations.   The project also includes a study of the fu-
ture development of Algerian commercial ports, for which a master plan will
be prepared. The Government has agreed to consult the Bank on the results of
these studies and on the steps to be taken for their implementation (Section
3.04(c) of the Loan Agreement).   Training is an essential part of the project
and will be provided to personnel from the three agencies involved in port
operations: Office National des Ports (ONP), Compagnie Nationale de Navigation
(CNAN), and the Societe Nationale de Manutention (SONAMA). To ensure full use
of the port, SONATRACH, the national oil and gas enterprise, which will be the
sole port user, will finance, procure, and install the necessary LNG plants,
sea lines, pipelines, and loading arms (Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
29.       The project cost is estimated at $293.2 million, including con-
tingency allowances, domestic taxes and custom duties, but excluding interest
on external loans during constructioin (details are given in Annex III). The
foreign exchange component is $182 million, or 62 percent of total costs.
The proposed Bank loan of $70 million equivalent would cover about 38 percent
of the foreign exchange component. Joint financing by other external lenders
will cover the balance of the foreign exchange costs. A consortium of Arab
sources led by Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (AFESD) will
provide the equivalent of $80 million: $20 million equivalent at 6 percent
for a period of 16 years including 4 years of grace and $60 million equivalent,
underwritten by the Kuwait Investment Company (KIC), at 7 percent for 16 years
including 4-1/2 years of grace; the bonds issued by KIC are held by the Banque
Nationale d'Algerie (BNA). The Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) will pro-
vide $32 million equivalent at 2 percent interest for a period of 30 years
including 10 years of grace. Remaining project costs are to be financed by
the Government. The Bank loan is proposed to have a term of 25 years, in-
cluding 4 years of grace.
Implementation
30.       Project implementation will be the responsibility of the Directorate
for Infrastructure of the Ministry of Public Works and Construction, which is
considered competent. Consultants will be employed for construction supervi-
sion and they will work with qualified Algerian counterparts. Consultants
designed the civil works, and prequalification resulted in acceptance of 45
firms from 13 countries, including 3 firms from Algeria. A contract covering
civil works and dredging was put to tender in December 1973, based on inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines for
Procurement. Bids were received on March 18, 1974, and are being analyzed.
Construction is expected to start in June 1974 and to be completed by October
1977. Some LNG berths are scheduled to be completed before then and will be
put to use as they become available.
31.       The Government will, by mid-1976, decide upon an agency to admin-
ister the port of Bethioua and probably the other ports specializing in the
export of hydrocarbons. The proposed loan includes funds for a study of a
proposed management authority to administer the port.



Financial Aspects
32.       During negotiations, the Government agreed to a number of conditions
which are of particular interest:    (a) the Government has undertaken to provide
the Management Authority with sufficient funds to meet operating deficits (if
any), and funds for the renewal of its equipment and for working cash purposes
(Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement); (b) the Government agreed that
tariffs at the port of Bethioua would be set at levels which would enable the
Management Authority to repay to the Government the whole cost oftthe port by
way of a 25 year annuity, starting in 1978, at an interest rate not less than
the interest rate of the Bank applicable to the proposed loan (see Sections
3.08 and 4.03 of the draft Loan Agreement), and the Government has agreed
(in Section 4.04 of the draft Loan Agreement) that charges and tariffs similar
to those applicable to the port of Bethioua shall be applied in all ports
specialized in the export of oil, gas and their by-products.
Disbursements
33.       Retroactive financing of $4.5 million is needed to cover preparation
of preliminary and detailed engineering and bidding procedures, and payments in
foreign currency to the contractor before loan signature. It will be shared
between the financing partners. Disbursements from the Loan Account for the
civil works, including project design and supervision, will be made on the
basis of 38 percent of the estimated foreign exchange component (being 57 per-
cent of total cost for construction and 70 percent of total cost for dredging).
Those for management consultant services will be on the basis of actual for-
eigni exchange costs. The other lenders will finance a prorata share of project
costs, except for technical assistance, which will be financed by the Bank.
Economic and Financial Rate of Return
34.       This project differs from a normal port project as it concerns a
completely new port, designed basically to export a specialized and relatively
new bulk products. Although it has a high capital cost and a very long life
in engineering terms, its economic life for the purposes for which it is to be
built depends on proven recoverable reserves of natural gas in Algeria, the
world demand for this product and the marketing prospects as reflected in gas
sales contracts. A normal economic evaluation of the project in isolation
fromD the whole gas export scheme is, therefore, not possible; however, the
economic evaluation of the proiect was carried out using the "least cost
solution" method of analysis, which shows that the technical solutions
selected for the port of Bethioua are the least expensive for the purposes
it is intended to serve. As noted before, the gas export scheme is expected
to yield handsome economic returns to Algeria.
35.       The financial discounted cash flow rate of return over the estimated
25 years economic life of the project varies between 7.5 percent and 9.7 per-
cent depending on which base year is adopted (i.e. 1976, when the first berths
are put into operation, 1977, the year the project is due for completion, or
1978, the first year of full operation); and to whether a delay of up to one
year will occur in starting up the last gas liquefaction plant.



_afety
36.       Because of the nature of the cargo and the difficulty of maneuver-
ing the large LNG carriers, special safety features are incorporated both in
the design of the port and into its proposed methods of operations. The port
will have two entrances to facilitate maneuvering under adverse conditions.
All vessels will be berthed using tugboats equipped with firefighting equip-
ment and special safety procedures will be in effect during ship loading.
Ecological Considerations
37.       Investigation by the project consultants confirmed that the cooling
water from the LNG plants (800,000 m3 per hour) will not adversely affect the
ecological conditions of the area. The Borrower has undertaken to take all
reasonable measures to ensure that the execution and operation of the project
would have no adverse effect on the environment. The borrower will employ
qualified experts to study the effects of the project on the ecological con-
ditions in the area and recommend steps to be taken thereon. (See Section
3.09 of the draft Loan Agreement.)
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The Draft Loan Agreement between the Democratic and Popular Republic
of Algeria and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolu-
tion approving the proposed Loan are being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern
for port projects.
39.       The following events of suspension and default have been added, namely:
(a) any event shall have occurred which shall have operated to
suspend the right of the Borrower to withdraw amounts under
the Arab Fund Agreement or the KfW Agreement;
(b) the Arab Fund, the KfW or the holders of the BNA Bonds shall
have demanded repayment of any part of the Arab Fund Loan,
the KfW Loan or the BNA Bonds respectively prior to the re-
spective maturity of each such loan or bonds.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Ln. Zo. 912    lligahay Procts- US_18.5 million Loan of June 19, 1973.
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Improvement and construction works started on time; the quality of
work is good and supervision of works by the Ministry of Public Works is satis-
factory. The appointment of consultants has been delayed by several months.
However, the coordinating consultants, who will also carry out the highway
maintenance study, have now been appointed and a selection of the consultants
for feasibility studies in progress. The possibility of regaining part of
the time lost was investigated by a supervision mission which visited Algiers
in April. No disbursements from the loan account have yet been made. The

Retroactive financing of $4.5 million equivalent has been
included in the proposed financing package and will be
shared between the financing partners in accordance to
arrangements to be made. Such financing is required for
payments to consultants ($1.5 million) for preparation
of preliminary and detailed engineering and bidding docu-
ments and $3 million as a mobilization payment to the
contractors. Retroactive financing will be shared pro-
rata by the lenders.
Technical            Consulting services (a) for project design and preparation
Assistance:         of tender documents; (b) to study port management and op-
eration and to recommend improvements therein and to
train personnel; and (c) to prepare a master plan for
Algerian commercial ports.
Rate of Return:     No separate economic rate of return has been calculated
for the project part, since it is an integral part of the
ING-export scheme. The economic evaluation of the project
was therefore carried out using the "least cost solution"
method of analysis which reveals that the technical solu-
tions selected for the port of Bethioua are the least
expensive in relation to the purposes it is intended to
serve. The estimated financial rate of return is estimated
at 7.5-9.7 percent.
