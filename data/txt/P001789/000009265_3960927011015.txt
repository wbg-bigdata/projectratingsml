NEHORANDUM AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
FOR AN URBAN REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Mozambique for SDR 44.0 million (US$60.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance an urban rehabilitation
project.  The project would be cofinanced by FINNIDA for FM 56.3  million
(US$13.4 million equivalent) and by Spain for SP 478.5 million (US$4.4
million equivalent).
2.       Backtround.  The Government of Mozambique embarked upon an
Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP) in January 1987 with the assistance
of the World Bank and other donors and the IMF. The ERP has involved major
policy changes and the ensuing economic reforms have started to reverse the
economic decline of previous years. The success of the ERP at the macro-
level has highlighted the need to rehabilitate the country's rundown
infrastructure (maintenance of which has been severely neglected) in order
to increase efficiency and facilitate a supply response. Particularly at
risk is the provision of services essential to the effective functioning of
the main transport corridors, which used to be the country's principal
foreign exchange earners. The transport irfrastructure of these corridors
is being rehabilitated with US$300-400 millions of bilateral and
multilateral investments, which need to be supported with functioning urban
infrastructure and services. Although several donors, particularly the
Netherlands, Italy, the African Development Bank and Finland, have been
investing in urban infrastructure improvements, many critical areas remain
in urgent need of rehabilitation. At the same time, the economic
stringencies of the ERP, including higher prices and public sector lay-
offs, have, at least temporarily, exacerbated an already critical situation
of urban unemployment and low income levels. Government's concern with
these issues led to the request for a project which will initiate
rehabilitation of the urban infrastructure (water, sewerage, roads,
drainage, erosion control, etc.) and housing while rapidly creating jobs to
deal with the problem of growing urban unemployment. The Government's
policy of cost recovery has already resulted in a number of important
actions to increase resource mobilization, including reduction of food
subsidies and substantial increases in housing rents and water tariffs.
(In April, 1988 rents were increased two to five times over their previous
levels, while water tariffs were increased fivefold in October, 1987). It
is estimated that water tarifft, are sufficient to achieve full cost
recovery in Maputo. Salaries have risen less rapidly and there is growing
concern about the affordability of the package of price increases, which is
currently being reviewed in extensive income and expenditure surveys.
Government is also initiating a decentralization policy to strengthen local
governments to enable them to carry out their assigned functions without



-2-
excessive reliance on central goveinment resources.   This will involve the
strengthening of local authorities through training (with the proposed
Center for Urban Management) and technical assistance and the development
of local taxation systems and more effective user charges. The project
would support these initiatives through its institutional strengthening
programs.
3.       Rationale for Bank Group Involvement.  The Government of
Mozambique has been working closely with IDA in developing and implementing
its Economic Rehabilitation Program, for which two IDA credits have been
provided and a zhird is under preparation. In support of these
initiatives, IDA is also developing a program of project-based credits to
strengthen the adjustment process. The intervention proposed under this
project is an integral part of this process in that it would directly
assist in offsetting some of the social costs encountered in the
transitional phase of adjustment and at the same time improve the
environment in the two key urban centers, creating conditions for broad-
based economic development through rehabilitation of infrastructure and
s -rvices and institutional strengthening, particularly of local government.
These activities would complement existing and proposed IDA interventions
in other sectors, including education, health, industry, transport and
agriculture. The cost recovery aspects of the project, in conjunction with
more affordable housing standards, are an important step towards more
rational pricing of urban services. These, and the introduction of more
effective user charges and new local government taxes, will provide a
significant impetus to local resource mobilisation. IDA intervention is
also appropriate to complement the investments of other donors in the
sector and to help ensure an overall coherency to sector development.
Finally, IDA's extensive experience in the sector will help Government
adopt appropriate replicable solutions.
4.       Prolect Objectives.  The project's objectives are to stem the
deterioration in basic urban infrastructure and services in Maputo and
Beira and to mitigate the social impacts of structural adjustment through
the implementation of a program of urban rehabilitation and employment
generation. This program would aim to (i) rehabilitate key elements of
urban infrastructure and housing; (ii) provide employment through labor-
intensive construction methods and stimulation of small and micro-
enterprises, particularly in the building materials industry; and (iii)
strengthen the local institutions responsible for provision and maintenance
of urban infrastructure and services and assist their efforts to become
more financially independent through resource mobilization at the local
level. The project would also aim to demonstrate the replicability of new
approaches to infrastructure rehabilitation and housing rehabilitation.
5.       Project Description.  The project would consist of the following
inter-related components in Maputo and Beira: (i) rehabilitation and
limited extension of the road, storm drainage, water distribution and
sewerage networks, and of coastal protection works (45Z of project costs);
(ii) rehabilitation of low income housing together with completion of
unfinished (since independence) buildings and upgrading and extension of



-3-
sites and services (33% of project costs); (iii) provision of equipment and
spare parts for municipal services (6% of project costs); (iv) provision of
credit for small and micro-enterprises and for materials loans for home
construction (7% of project costs); and (v) technical assistance and
training for the implementing agencies, the municipal authorities k_hrough
the Center for Urban Management) and the institutions responsible for
promotion of small scale enterprises together with project management (9%
of project costs). The project would be carried out over a period of six
years under a tightly defined implementation program under the control of
the Project Implementation Unit in the Ministry of Construction and Water.
Funds would be provided for civil works, equipment and vehicles, training
and technical assistance and operating costs. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$83.8 million equivalent, with a foreiga exchange
component of US$68.7 million (82%). A breakdown of costs, the financing
plan and disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
metnods of procurement and the categories of disbursement are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Mozambique are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The SAR No. 7279-MOZ, dated July 1, 1988 is being
distributed separately.
6.       Agreements Reached.  During negotiations, the Government provided
assurances on the following: (i) completion and follow-up of an IDA-
assisted local government linance and administration study to strengthen
the operational and financial viability of municipal authorities (the
action plan based on the findings of the study would be furnished to IDA by
March 31, 1989 and reviewed with IDA by June 30, 1989); progress on
implementation would be reviewed annually thereafter; (ii) strengthening of
initiatives already taken by Government to achieve full cost recovery for
the components for which direct cost recovery is possible, including water,
sewerage and housing rehabilitation and lines of credit (about two thirds
of project cost); a water and sanitation tariff study would be completed
for review by June 30, 1990 when an action plan to implement its
recommendations would be agreed upon, and targets set for the water and
sanitation agencies in Maputo and Beira to achieve financial viability by
1993; (iii) by June 30, 1989, and annually thereafter, GOM and IDA would
undertake reviews of housing strategy, with the objective of achieving full
cost recovery in public sector housing, the reviews to include levels of
rents and adequacy of maintenance of existing State-owned housing (all new
housing is privately owned); and (iv) provision to IDA by March 31, 1989 of
socio-economic surveys assessing the affordability of the package of cost
recovery measures proposed by Government in this and other sectors and
subsequent review with IDA by June 30, 1989 when an action plan to address
their findings would be drawn-up. Updates of these surveys would be
reviewed annually thereafter.
7.       Justification and Risks.  The expenditure of relatively small
amounts on infrastructure rehabilitation will save the need for much larger
future investments in reconstruction and will yield relatively high
economic rates of return, estimated at 39%. The investments in Beira are
essential to the development of the Beira transport corridor which will be
one of the country's main foreign exchange earners, while much of the



investment in Maputo will assist in foreign exchange earnings or savings.
Risks are that the project may exceed implementing capacity and that the
security situation may Impede the completion of some project components.
The project's restriction to the two principal cities is intended to
minimise the risks associated with limited implementation capacity and the
security situation. The Goverrment's demonstrated strong commitment to the
objectives and approach proposed and the careful consideration given to the
appropriate level and type of Implementation assistance and manpower
development. provided by the project will also help to miniuize these risks.
)ecommendation
8.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
