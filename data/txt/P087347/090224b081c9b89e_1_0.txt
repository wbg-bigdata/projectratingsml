                         Over the last five months overall project activities targeted improving the management of the institutions, and the implementation of the new competency based training (CBT)
                         curriculum at the school. The reform of the TVET system is reaching and increased number of institutions. The number of students assessed through the new competency based
                         system in medium technical institutes is now 4022 representing a 30% increase from 2012. A new batch of 166 students from the medium technical institutes has graduated in
                         December 2012.

                         The introduction on a pilot basis of the new school regulations in all medium technical institutes implementing the CBT system marks an important milestone for the development of
                         an adequate institutional framework. The new instrument incorporates the need for accountability while providing increased autonomy of the schools.

                         The activities under the Development of Standards-Based Qualification and Training System are progressing at satisfactory level. Eight more qualifications have been approved. The
                         curriculum, related training modules, teaching aid materials, as well as, examples of evaluations for all qualifications developed is available for teachers and students. The design of
                         occupational standards and validation of the approved qualifications has counted with involvement of the relevant stakeholders in particular the private sector. The establishment of
                         sector technical committees for the areas of mining and gas with high representativeness of the private sector has been completed and the committees are active.

                         Aiming for the Quality Improvement in Training Institutions, the procurement and delivery of equipment, goods and textbooks is underway as planned. Alongside the rehabilitation and
                         equipment of the institutions worth mentioning is the successful training of 207 teachers in the new methodology. This raised the number of total teachers trained in CBT to 1143. The
                         following medium technical institutions have initiated the implementation of new curriculum in selected courses of industrial maintenance: Instituto Industrial e Comercial “3 de
                         Fevereiro? de Nampula, Instituto Industrial “1º de Maio? de Maputo, Instituto Médio D. Bosco, Instituto Médio Politécnico de Tete and Instituto Médio Politécnico da Matola. The
                         introduction of CBT in those institutions raises the total number of medium technical institutions implementing the new curriculum to 19 in 2013. The Executive Secretariat for the
                         Commission for Professional Education and Training Reform (ES-COREP) and the National Directorate for Vocational and Technical Education (DINET) have contributed for the
                         establishment of partnerships with industry with positive impacts both at conceptual and at implementation level. At conceptual level the private sector has successfully continued to
                         participate in the definition of occupational standards that underpin the design of modularized training course programs and related training materials. At school level the involvement
                         of the private sector in the processes of quality assurance is gradually creating the space for closer interaction between the training institutions and industry. A significant result is the
                         ongoing internship arrangements with industry which catered for 40% of the students of the pilot institutions and in selected institutions the active participation of the private sector in
                         the board of administration of the schools.

                         The National Institute for Employment and Professional Training (INEFP) provided on the job training to the instructors and managers of (CFPs) of Nampula and Beira with emphasis
                         on institution and workshop management. To address the needs of local firms (SMEs and mega projects) the two CFPs delivered training in mechanical and electrical occupations to
                         more than 100 workers from 2012 to April 2013. The CFPs, short but very practical training courses are attractive to industry as skilled personal are made available in the market in
                         short period of time.

                         The implementation of the sub-projects financed under the 5th call for proposals through the competitive fund for development of competences (FUNDEC) is progressing well. The
                         evaluation of the 6th call for proposals was completed in March 2013 and was followed by the training of beneficiaries in administrative and fiduciary matters.

                         Although progress in implementation has improved in the last 5 months, some delays in carrying out the following activities could limit the sustainability of current achievements: (i)
                         agreement of a framework for future financing of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET); (ii) recruitment of sufficient specialized teachers/instructors for the pilot
                         institutions (iii) recruitment of adequate levels of qualified staff for DINET.
