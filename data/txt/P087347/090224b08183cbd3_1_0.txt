                         The pace of project implementation is improving. The new qualifications are being implemented now in 11 institutions of which five have been rehabilitated and equipped with project
                         funds. The other four have benefited from projects funds through FUNDEC but have also the support of selected development partners. The teachers and school managers from all
                         those institutions were trained in administration of new competency based curriculum. Following the observations and recommendation of the regular monitoring of the

                         implementation of the pilot of the new qualifications revealed minor adjustments to the curricula was successfully completed by the Executive Secretariat and approved by the
                         Commission for the Reform of TVET. But as the reform takes shape in the schools there is ongoing evaluation of the reform instruments and the Executive Secretariat has been
                         working closely with key stakeholders to understand the bottlenecks in the implementation of the new qualifications and related evaluation instruments. The result of continuing
                         evaluation of the processes is informing the ongoing adjustments in the evaluation system which was found too onerous by the schools. The second cohort of students that received
                         training in the new competency based qualifications is expect to graduate in December 2012. These first batches of students that graduated in early 2012 were from the fields of
                         Agriculture and Administration and Management. In December the first graduates in electricity and tourism and hospitality will be available in the market

                         The government continues to show strong commitment to the implementation of the PIREP which is also reflected in a functional Commission of the Reform of TVET (COREP) Board
                         Members with major representation of the private sector. The significant increase of representatives of the private sector creates the space for increased deliberation on issues of
                         governance, management and financing of the TVET sector.

                         As of October 2012, COREP approved 53 qualifications. The quality of process for the development of curricula continues to show strong involvement from the private sector.
                         Selected qualifications are being implemented in the pilot institutions but also in other institutions. Overall implementation is taking place with better preparation from the institutions.
                         But the success of the reform is continuously challenged by the insufficient recruitment and deployment of qualified teachers and managers. To mitigate for the current situation,
                         project funds and from other Development Partners such as DANIDA, Spanish Cooperation, GIZ have been used for teacher's capacity development in-country and outside the
                         country. In addition, some agencies have been providing technical assistance directly to schools, for example GIZ.

                         The following works have been completed: (i) Rehabilitation and Expansion of Instituto Industrial e Comercial de Pemba, (i)Reconstruction of the Circulation Galleries of Instituto
                         Industrial e Comercial de Pemba, (ii) Rehabilitation and Expansion of Instituto Agrário de Mocuba, (iii) Rehabilitation and Expansion of Centro de Formação Profissional de Nampula,

                         Overall procurement of equipment, furniture and supplies is developing forward satisfactorily. Equipment purchased for the courses of hospitality and tour ism, electricity labs and
                         workshops, metal mechanics and agriculture, as well as school and administration furniture have been installed in eight schools and centers in Maputo, Beira, Chimoio, Mocuba,
                         Nampula and Pemba and are now available for the use in the pilot courses. Equipment for the industrial maintenance courses (mechanics) in Instituto Industrial e Comercial de
                         Nampula has been installed but refreshment training for teachers. Due to delays in civil works the installation of equipment in ICM Maputo for the course of hospitality and tourism
                         was put on hold.

                         The competitive fund, FUNDEC has completed the evaluation of the 5th call for proposals and is in the process of disbursing the funds. It also launched its 6th call for proposals.
