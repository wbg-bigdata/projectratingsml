POLAND
SECOND HARD COAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Government of Poland
Amount:                   EUR 112.8 million (US$100 million equivalent)
Terms:                    Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) Euro denominated commitment linked;
bullet principal re-payment in 10 years; at the standard variable
interest rate for Euro FSLs.
Commitment Fee:           0.85% on undisbursed loan balance for first four years, standard
charge of 0.75% on undisbursed loan balances thereafter,
beginning 60 days after signing, less any waiver.
Front End Fee:            1% principal amount, capitalized.
Objectives and Description:   The development objective of the project is to support
implementation of the Government's 1998-2002 Hard Coal
Sector Reform Program. In particular, SECAL 2 will support the
Government in implementing the Revised Program which
contains more extensive mine closures and employment reduction
than in the original Program. Specific objectives relate to support
for actions to (i) assist workers leaving the industry to find new
jobs; (ii) improve the industry payment of taxes and fees to
government; (iii) accomplish further progress regarding
preparation for privatization; and (iv) continue progress to
improve environmental performance.
Benefits:                 From the point of view of society, the immediate beneficiaries of
social mitigation measures under the Program, and SECAL 2, are
the miners and their immediate dependents. The population of
the mining regions are benefiting from continued social peace and
employment opportunities, while increasingly enjoying a cleaner
environment. Successful implementation is helping stem the
losses of the coal companies and is helping turn a money losing
state controlled sector into a competitive and profitable private
industry. The Polish people are benefiting through improved
economic performance and an assurance that government
revenues are being applied to constructive needs rather than to
propping up a loss-making industry.
Risks:                    Coal sector restructuring is an inherently difficult task and in this
context the operation must be considered a high risk operation.
There are four major risks: (1) The main risk is that despite the
extensive restructuring being undertaken under the Program, the
industry may not become profitable. If needed, there will be



additional employment, capacity and financial restructuring
following completion of the present Program in 2002. (2) An
immediate and difficult risk is that the employment restructuring
targets may not be achieved because of a slowdown in take-up of
severance packages by miners.  The Government has taken
additional measures to support workers leaving the industry
including introducing a new severance package to assist surface
workers, many of whom are women. (3) If the industry does not
become profitable, then environmental performance may be
restrained by a lack of funding. This risk is mitigated partly by
the efforts to improve profitability and partly by access to other
sources of funds for environmental investments. Also the mining
company business plans include environmental actions and
targets and performance will be closely monitored by different
arms of Government. (4) Poor financial performance may also be
a barrier to privatization. If needed, this will be addressed as the
Government's privatization strategy is further developed and
implemented.
Schedule of Disbursement:   Single tranche following effectiveness.
Poverty Category:         None.
Rate of Return:           Not applicable.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SECOND HARD COAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
PART I. INTRODUCTION
1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Second Hard Coal Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL 2 ) to the Republic of Poland for US$100
million equivalent to support implementation of the Government's Coal Reform Program. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate for Euro fixed spread loans, and has a
10 year bullet principal re-payment.
2.   Reform Program  In June 1998, the Government approved a comprehensive Reform
Program for the restructuring of the hard coal sector, which had become a significant drain on
the economy with financial losses reaching about US$1 billion annually. The Program was
updated and a Revised Program was approved in December 1999. Cash costs of the Program
are estimated at about US$2 billion over the period 1998-2002 consisting of about US$1.5
billion for severance costs and US$0.5 billion for physical mine closure costs.
3.   Program implementation started in 1998 and is now well advanced. As of end of April
2001, about 90,000 workers had left the industry and production had been terminated at 12
mines. In addition, the government has completed a Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA)
which provides the basis to improve environmental performance and a Sector Privatization
Assessment (SPA) and a Sector Privatization Framework (SPF) which is presently being
discussed with the Trade Unions and will be the basis for privatizing the sector.
4.   Request for World Bank Assistance The Government has requested the Bank to provide
financing equivalent of up to half of the cash costs of the Program. An initial loan (Hard Coal
SECALI) of EUR 280.13 (US$300 million equivalent) was approved in June 1999 (Loan 4490-
POL). The objective of the loan was to support the successful implementation of socially
acceptable employment restructuring and actions to help improve industry financial
performance, strengthen environmental protection and start preparing the sector for
privatization. A first tranche EUR 68.16 million was released in December 1999 and the
second tranche of EUR 211. 97 million was released in September 2000.
PART II. MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT
A. Macroeconomic Developments in Poland
5.   The Polish economy is its tenth year of economic expansion, combining strong economic
growth and a gradual decline in inflation. Real growth has averaged just under 5% over the last
decade, while inflation has declined from 70% in end 1991 to just over 6% in the twelve months



2
ending in May 2001. The economic expansion has in recent months come under increase strain,
however, as domestic demand continues to slowdown under the pressure of very high real
interest rates (over 10%), and the wave of enterprise restructuring that followed the Russia
crisis. While the slowdown has allowed the current account deficit to decline from a 8% of
GDP peak in the Spring of 2000 to just over 5% of GDP one year later, it has been accompanied
by a sharp rise in unemployment, reaching a historical high of 18% in the first quarter of 2001.
Also, the slowdown has exacerbated some of the structural problems in public sector, as lower
wages and higher unemployment have reduced revenues, increased expenditures, and lead to a
widening of the public sector deficit. (Table 1.1).

p) Projection.

2) End of year period.
6.   Several factors account for the recent economic slowdown and its negative side effects.
The Russia crisis in mid-1998 significantly reduced the country's eastern exports, including an
active cross-border trade that generated income and employment opportunities for the
population in eastern Poland. Food exports were particularly affected, with a deleterious impact
on the demand for agriculture products and the demand for less skilled workers. The recovery
of exports since mid-i 999 has resulted, therefore, from the growth rebound in western Europe
and the shift in the structure of Polish exports toward more skill and capital intensive goods.
While the first development further aligned Poland's economic cycle with western Europe, the
second development has implied a shift in labor demand away from less skilled workers.
7.   The rise in oil prices in the spring of 2000 added to the negative effects of the Russia
crisis. Higher oil prices provided a boost for inflation, and led the Polish authorities to respond
with higher interest rates to keep inflation in check. Although inflation eventually came down,
the widening of the public sector deficit caused, in part, by the slow down in the economy, left
little room for maneuver. The Polish authorities have been reluctant to lower interest rates
without progress on further fiscal consolidation. This in turn requires tackling some of the
structural dimensions of the fiscal deficit, including stepping up the enforcement of tax and
social security payments, and enforcing a hard budget constraint on the operations of State
owned enterprises and the regional health funds. It also requires reforms aimed at reducing
unnecessary government spending and at boosting the economy's production potential. The
latter includes the restructuring and privatization of remaining state owned enterprises; opening
energy and transport infrastructure operations (currently dominated by the state) to private
investors; and improving the design of the tax system.
8.   The recent macroeconomic developments in Poland also reflect the intense economic
restructuring the country is undergoing as it integrates into the European Union. In addition to
weakening domestic demand by slowing investment, the high real interest rates have made
foreign holdings of Zloty-denominated assets very attractive leading also to an appreciation of



3
the currency. While this has not yet been fully felt on export growth, re-establishing a virtuous
cycle, whereby foreign and domestic savings are channeled back into productive investments,
rather than to the financing of the budget deficit, requires addressing some of the structural
dimension of the public sector deficit. This includes the ongoing restructuring of state-owned
enterprises (coal mining, railways, steel mills, etc.) and the completion of the reforms in the
pension system. This should open room for a reduction in domestic real interest rates, allowing
a sustained recovery in investment and an eventual reversal of the recent appreciation of the
Zloty. These developments would, in turn, set the conditions for sustaining Poland's decade
long economic expansion.
9.  It is against this backdrop that the Government is continuing with its coal sector reform
program and this Second Hard Coal Sector Adjustment Loan is presented for Board
consideration. While the recent slowdown in real GDP growth has exposed some weaknesses
in fiscal management, the overall economy remains sound, as reflected in the strong growth in
exports to the European Union. Indeed promoting growth and completing the economic
transformation will require renewed efforts toward the privatization of State owned enterprises,
improving competitiveness throughout the economy and imposing greater fiscal discipline on
all levels of government.  The proposed operation contributes toward achieving these
objectives. It contributes toward the restructuring and eventual privatization of the hard coal
sector. In doing so, it helps reduce the fiscal drain the sector imposes on the budget. It also
helps increase the sector's productivity, proving a net contribution to the overall economy.
10. IMF Assessment. This assessment is broadly shared by the IMF, as reflected in the 2000
Article IV consultation with Poland concluded on March 9, 2001. While acknowledging that
Poland's economic performance in the past two years has been robust in the face of external
shocks, the IMF board recognized that strains had recently emerged. Output has fallen below
potential, unemployment rates have risen to worrisome levels, and fiscal and inflation targets
have been overshot. During the review, the IMF board stressed the need to strike a balance
between securing progress towards medium term fiscal and monetary targets, while avoiding an
unduly tight policy stance in the short term when growth is below potential. The board also
noted deepening structural reforms would strengthen Poland's medium-term economic
performance, placing the country in a strong position to secure accession to the EU. This
assessment was recently confirmed during an IMF staff-visit in May 2001. The mission found
that, while Poland still faces a challenging situation, the quick response from macroeconomic
policies has allowed inflationary and current account pressures to receded. Also, the recent
corporate restructuring efforts have resulted in remarkable increases in productivity and lower
wage costs. There are still concerns, however, that rising unemployment, together with external
shocks and tightening of policies, have ushered in a period of weak demand and output growth.
A strong Zloty and the declining growth in Poland's export markets have only added to these
difficulties. In these circumstances the IMF staff indicated that there was some scope to set
policies so as to support growth and employment while remaining vigilant about the risks of re-
igniting inflation and current account pressures. Over longer term, with close coordination of
policies and determination to pursue needed changes on all fronts, the prospects for growth and
stability in Poland remain excellent.

B.  The Hard Coal SECAL 2 and its Relation to the Country Assistance Strategy
11.  May 1997 CAS The proposed Bank lending to support coal sector reform is fully in line
with the main program objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy approved by the Board in
May 1997. Key themes of the CAS include: (a) promotion of structural reform and private
sector development; (b) rationalization of the role of the state; and (c) reduction of poverty and
development of human capital. The proposed SECAL2 directly supports all three themes. It
will: (i) promote structural reform and help advance preparation of a major state-owned sector
for privatization; (ii) rationalize the role of the state and improve corporate govemance
arrangements in the sector; and (iii) help mitigate the effects of the industry reform on local
communities, and provide support for retraining and improving the employment prospects of
workers leaving the industry.
12. October 1999 CAS Program Report Update A CAS Program Report update was
presented to and endorsed by the Board in October 1999. The CAS update noted that the Bank
country program, while fully consistent with the above objectives, has evolved substantially in
the light of the reform being pursued by the current Government. In particular, the Bank Group
is providing support for private sector development, state enterprise reform and privatization,
socially sustainability transformation of the rural sector, and environmental sustainability. In
this context, the Government continues to look to the Bank to play a leading role in
environmental and socially sustainable state enterprise reform with the hard coal sector reform
as a leading example.
PART III. THE HARD COAL SECTOR AND THE GOVERNMENT'S
REFORM PROGRAM
A.  Hard Coal Sector Overview
13. Industry Structure. Hard coal represents the backbone of the Polish energy sector
providing over 60 % of total primary energy consumption in Poland and about two thirds of
power sector fuel supplies, and accounts for almost 4% of GDP. The sector comprises seven
mining holding companies, established as joint stock companies, a Mine Restructuring
Company and two individual mines. At the start of the Program the seven mining companies
operated a total of 50 mines and also had 3 mines under liquidation. As of end 2000,
production has been terminated at 12 mines, the Jaworzno mine has been transferred to the
Jaworzno III power company, and the seven joint stock companies had only 39 operating mines.
There are ten other mines which were originally set up as individual joint stock companies of
which two Budryk and Bogdanka are operational and being privatized. The remaining mines
terminated production by the end of Year 2000, following which they had been transferred to
the Mine Restructuring Company (MRC) where they are being closed and liquidated.
14. Performance. Table 1.2 provides details on employment, production, sales and financial
performance for 1998, 1999 and 2000 (actual) and 2001 and 2002 (planned) for the industry.
Total coal sales have declined from about 200 million tons per year (TPY) in the early 1980s to
102 million TPY in 2000. Domestic demand has declined due to ongoing changes in energy
efficiency and energy substitution (e.g. gas for coal) which reflects in part the restructuring
away from heavy industries to lighter industries and services. Exports have declined reflecting
a combination of a depressed global coal market and a lack of competitiveness .

15. Demand and Sales. When the Program was prepared in early 1998, it was expected that
sales would stabilize and that total coal sales would be about 116 million tons in 1999 including
89 million tons of domestic sales and 27 million tons of exports. But actual sales were only 109
million tons in 1999 (of which domestic sales were 84 million tons and exports 25 million tons)
and further declined to about 101 million tons in year 2000 (of which domestic sales were 78
million tons and exports 23 million tons). The weakening demand resulted in oversupply and
depressed prices in the domestic market in 1998 and 1999. Export prices were also weak due to
world market conditions and due to sales terms. Because of cash shortages, the companies
resorted to sales pre-financing and marketing arrangements with third parties that realized cash
immediately, but at the cost of further weakening of their financial position. The companies
have since terminated these arrangements following instructions from the MOE as shareholder.
In December 1999, the Government revised the Reform Program projections regarding capacity
liquidation and coal production and sales to more rapidly eliminate market imbalance. The
Revised program introduced additional reduction of 10 Mtpy of production capacity and



6
planned total sales at the level of about 101 million tons which helped stabilize coal prices and
sales in year 2000. The MOE as shareholder has taken steps to ensure that the companies
rationalize coal export arrangements and arrangements for coal sales for electricity exports.
16. Prices. As of end 2000, measured in PLN per gigajoule (PLN/GJ), natural gas costs
household and industrial users 23.3 (PLN/GJ) and 18.6 (PLN/GJ) respectively, fuel oil costs
37.6 (PLN/GJ)and 34.7 (PLN/GJ) respectively, electricity costs 68.8 (PLN/GJ) and 43.3
(PLN/GJ) respectively and coal costs 12.7 (PLN/GJ) and 7.2 (PLN/GJ) respectively. Thus, in

terms of PLN per energy unit, coal remains a low price fuel compared to alternatives (Chart 1).
From January 1998 to end 2000, polish coal prices for households, as measured in PLN per
gigajoule, increased by 12% in nominal terms (and declined by about 5% in real terms). By
comparison natural gas and fuel oil prices for households have increased by 27% and 64%
respectively over the same period. (Chart 2 overleaf). Electricity prices also increased by about
40% over the period, indicating that coal fired power plants have been benefiting from higher
prices even though the cost of the feedstock (coal) has not increased.
17.  Labor Cost Reduction. Faced by a difficult coal sales and price situation, the coal
companies have made considerable progress in reducing both labor and non-labor costs. From
1998 to 2000, the industry has reduced employment costs from 8.7 billion PLN to 6.9 billion
PLN. These figures are in nominal terms showing a decrease by about 21%. The reduction in
employment costs reflects the benefits of employment restructuring as well as initiatives to
make sure that the reductions in employment translated into improved efficiency and did not
impede production - the decline in real terms is about 14% higher. As a result unit labor costs
have declined by about 12% (from 76 PLN per ton to 67 PLN per ton) in nominal terms
(equivalent to about 25% in real terms) from 1998 to 2000.

18. Non-Labor Cost Reduction. From 1998-2000, the industry succeeded in reducing non-
labor operating costs (excluding financial charges) from 7.8 billion PLN to 6.2 billion PLN. The
reduction in non-labor costs reflects considerable initiatives to reduce contractor services,
materials and energy costs. As a result non-labor unit costs declined from 68 PLN per ton to 61
PLN per ton in normal terns (equivalent to about 22% in real terms) for 1998 to 2000. Overall,
total unit production costs (including both labor and non-labor costs) were reduced by 24% in
real terms for the same period.

19. Profit/Loss on Coal Operations. Despite the reductions in costs, the mining companies
did not improve their operating profitability as much as expected. Net loss on coal operations
was 2.6 billion PLN in 1998 and 1.44 billion PLN in 1999. But the situation improved in Year
2000 when the industry made a small surplus of about 0.24 billion PLN on coal operations. For
year 2001, the situation is improving further and the industry achieved a profit of PLN 0.2
billion on coal operations in the first quarter 2001.
20. Overall Profit/Loss. But, the companies continue to make an overall net loss due to high
financial costs, non coal operational charges and charges for certain severance costs and mine
closure costs which are paid from the companies own funds and not from budgetary funds.
Aggregate losses of the sector were PLN 4.2 billion (equivalent to about US$1.2 billion) in
1998 and PLN 3.2 billion (equivalent to US$0.8 billion) in 1999 and in some mining companies
equity has been fully eroded by accrued losses because of the large losses in recent years.
Despite the progress towards profitability on coal operations, an overall net loss of PLN 1.6
billion (equivalent to about US$0.4 billion) was made for year 2000 because of high financial



8
and non-coal operating charges. The situation, however, has improved in year 2001 and the
overall loss for the first quarter 2001 was reduced to PLN 0.18 billion.
21. Cash Shortages and Liabilities. Because of the high losses, the companies have faced
severe cash shortages. They have been able to stay current on wage payments, but in doing so
have not been able to pay their obligations to the Government (taxes, social security,
environmental fees and fines) in recent years. Total accumulated liabilities have reached a level
of over 22 billion PLN (about US$ 4.5 billion equivalent), of which less than 5% are long term
liabilities and over 95% are short term liabilities with over two thirds of those due to
Government institutions. The situation has improved considerably in year 2001 compared to
year 2000. In year 2000, the shortfall to social security (ZUS), value added taxes (VAT) and
workers income taxes (PIT) for current operations averaged about PLN 120 million per month
on aggregate and little was paid in terms other taxes, environmental fees and fines. By
comparison, for the six month period, November 1, 2000 to April 30, 2001, the shortfall on
ZUS, VAT and PIT was reduced to about PLN 25 million per month (and the companies have
paid 100% of ZUS, 100% of PIT and 80% of VAT obligations). With regard to payrnent of
other taxes, environmental fees and fines, the industry has reduced the shortfall to PLN 30
million per month and the situation should continue to improve providing the industry financial
performance continues to improve.
22.  Social Assets. Substantial progress has been made by the industry to divest itself of
social assets: (a) hospitals and clinics have been merged into the general health care system, and
under the Government's new national health care insurance system that was introduced on
January 1, 1999, workers are able to select the services they need from different health care
providers; (b) schools and kindergartens have been turned over to Gminas, schools have been
rationalized where there is duplication, and a mix of Gmina funding and user fees has been
developed for kindergartens; (c) sports and cultural facilities have been turned over to Gminas
or leased to clubs; and (d) there are multiple approaches being used to divest housing, including
transferring housing to tenants coops.  All companies also have non-coal commercial
subsidiaries which typically are used as vehicles to provide alternative employment for miners
when mines are closed. These are being progressively divested.
23. Environment. Mining operations in Poland have been a significant source of water
pollution, land degradation, and to a lesser extent air pollution problems. The two most critical
issues are: (a) salt water discharges into surface waters, and (b) waste disposal from mining
operations and coal preparation plants. Poland has a well conceived environmental regulatory
and institutional framework in place to manage these issues based on user fees for
environmental discharges. However, fees and fines have not been adequately enforced, with the
result that a massive liability (over US$1 billion) has accumulated to different environmental
funds in terms of unpaid pollution fees, penalties and associated interest. Under the program,
there has been a significant important in environmental performance as outlined in Section
III.C.2.
B.  Program Objectives
24. Original Program The Government's Hard Coal Sector Reform Program aims at
restoring profitability of the sector in a socially and environmentally acceptable manner. It
focuses on five key elements (i) restructuring and rationalization of the sector's labor force; (ii)
reducing production capacity; (iii) financial restructuring; (iv) improving environmental



9
performance; and (v) management and corporate governance. More specifically, the original
Reform Program approved in June 1998 established the following goals:
*   Employment in the coal mining sector would be reduced to the level of about
138,000 employees by the end of 2002 (from about 243,000 employees in end
1997);
*   Production capacity of the coal mining sector would be reduced by approximately
25.5 million tons of annual production by the year 2002 (from about 137 million
TPY capacity at end 1997);
*   Coal companies should obtain a positive financial result from coal operations, at the
latest, at the end of year 2000;
*   Environmental management practices are to be improved to ensure that the sector
becomes environmentally sustainable; and
*   Once restructured, the coal companies could be privatized.
25. Revised Program. Given the difficult coal market situation in 1998 and 1999, a Revised
Program was approved on December 21, 1999. It provides for additional employment reduction
and capacity closure and puts much stronger emphasis on improved company management and
cost reduction, requires the industry to fully meet environmental protection requirements by
Year 2005 and establishes privatization as the final step of the Reform Process. Recognizing
that there were difficulties in improving financial performance in 1998 and 1999, it delays the
targets for improved financial performnance by one year. More specifically the Revised Program
established the following goals:
*   Employment in the coal mining sector should be reduced to the level of about
128,000 employees (subsequently modified to 133,000) by the end of 2002;
*   Production capacity of the coal mining sector should be reduced by approximately
36 million tons of annual production by the year 2002 (to about 101 mtpy );
*   Coal companies should obtain a positive financial result on coal operations, at the
latest, from the beginning of year 2001;
*   Coal companies should obtain a positive net financial result in the year 2002;
*   Environmental impacts of the mining operations should be improved so that the
hard coal sector is to fully meet environmental protection standards by the year
2005; and
*   Mining companies will be privatized according to the Government's privatization
strategy.
26. To achieve these objectives, the Government is committed to fund the Program, to
provide strong support for affected workers and communities, and to maintain effective
monitoring and auditing arrangements. It is also committed to maintain a hard budget
constraint on the industry whereby there will be no non-Program subsidies or guarantees and/or
repayments by Government of commercial debts of mining companies. The Government's
commitment to implement the Revised Program is presented in the Letter of Sector
Development Policy (LSDP) which was transmitted to the Bank by letter dated June 12, 2001
and is attached as Annex 1. The Policy Matrix is attached as Annex 2.
27. Management Arrangements The Reform Program will be largely implemented by the
mining companies. The mining companies operate as autonomous, independent companies
supervised by independent Supervisory Boards (Board of Directors) appointed by the
shareholder. Management Boards were selected in a competitive process and appointed with
three year employment contracts for the period 2001-2003. These management contracts will



10
contain incentives based on financial performance, cost reduction and environmental
performance. In case of highly unsatisfactory performance or failure to implement their
business plan, members of the Management Board can be dismissed. As part of the Program,
annual operating plans are prepared for the mining companies covering planned production,
production costs, sales, capacity closures, employment and employment reduction plans,
investments, productivity, projected environmental improvements, etc. and providing pro forma
income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements for the period.
C.  Main Features of the Revised Program
1.  Employment Restructuring and Social Packages
28. Mechanisms and Objective. The Revised Program continues the same mechanisms for
employment restructuring available to the miners as the original Program. According to the
social compact agreed with the Trade Unions, these mechanisms exclude mass redundancies
although involuntary departures are possible on a limited basis. The Government's objective is
to ensure that there is an adequate safety net in place to support all persons who may become
unemployed as a result of the restructuring of the coal sector. To this end, the Government has
put in place a comprehensive set of financial support measures, active labor market services and
measures to assist all unemployed workers in the mining regions and to encourage the
development of new employment activities outside the mining industry.
29. Miners Social Packages. Underground workers and the workers of coal washing plants
are eligible for Miners Social Packages (MSP) that comprise a range of options designed to
encourage workers to leave the mines as follows: (a) miners leave Package: a social allowance
consisting of a financial bridge lasting up to five years to encourage voluntary early retirement
of eligible underground miners and workers of coal washing plants.  This instrument costs
about 31,000 PLN per miner per year (in 2001 terms excluding associated social society (ZUS)
payments ); (b) social allowance package: a type of re-employment incentive consisting of a
two year allowance paid to workers that are interested in re-employment outside of the mining
sector. During the two years workers are also eligible to receive a single free training or
retraining course, and will be assisted through the provision of job offers to find alternate
employment. The Revised Program introduced a provision that in addition to the above benefits
workers who find jobs outside the industry during the period of 2 year allowance will receive
50% of the social allowance for which they were eligible. This change is aimed at making the
package more attractive because it was used by less then 1% or eligible workers as during 1998-
1999; (c) unconditional lump sum payment: a single lump sum departure incentive consisting
of a one time payment of PLN 58,000 (in 2001 terms), given to workers who are willing to
leave their employment in the mine. This incentive is reduced each year and will be about 20%
lower in 2002. The Revised Program reduced the lump sum package for the workers of coal
washing plants down to 70% of the package for which the underground miners are eligible.
This was done in order to increase availability of that instrument to more workers within the
original budgetary allocation.
30. Surface Workers. At mines that are being closed, clerical workers and other surface
employees (who are predominantly women) are eligible for a lump sum payment of 3.6 monthly
wages. The European Union (EU) is making funds available to help the Government make this
package more attractive in order to stimulate more labor restructuring. In March 2001, the
Government and EU signed an agreement whereby EU funds will be used for a special package



11
for surface workers in addition to the 3.6 monthly wages. The special package comprises
training and up-to 12 months monthly compensation to create a bridge to help workers during
the period between leaving the mine and starting a new job. It will help make more packages
available to women in the industry since the MSP are only for underground and coal preparation
plant workers.
31. Unemployment Support Mechanisms. Those who leave the industry without receiving
any type of special package are eligible for standard severance payments under the labor code.
In addition, all unemployed workers from affected companies have access to: (a) immediate on-
site assistance from the Mining Labor Agency (GAP), which maintains a network of Vocational
Assistance Offices (BPZs) in individual mines; (b) additional employment and job counseling
services from Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MOLSP) regional and local labor offices;
(c) once registered as unemployed, mine workers also have access to additional active labor
services (e.g. retraining, small business assistance) from labor offices, as well as the right to
unemployment benefits the same as any other unemployed worker; and (d) miners' families
who meet means-tested minimums are eligible for social assistance services and related
payments through local social assistance offices.
32. Employment Reduction Targets. The total reduction in net employment under the
Revised Program (as modified in 2001) is planned at about 110,000 workers (from 243,000 to
133,000) as shown in Table 1.3 (overleaf). From 1998-2002 about 72,000 workers are expected
to use one of the options under the MSP and an additional 48,000 workers are expected to leave
through natural attrition. According to the Revised Program, new hires (obligatory,- mining
school graduates and special experts) will be about 10,000.
33. Progress To Date. Progress was very rapid in 1998 and 1999 when employment
declined by 35,369 and 34,304 respectively well above the planned levels, but slowed sharply to
18,601 in 2000. The slowdown was not due to lack of funding (all of the available budget funds
were not used) nor to institutional problems (there were no complaints relating to miners not
being paid or long delays in receiving payments) but instead to a deterioration in the UJpper
Silesian employment market (where unemployment has increased from about 6% at the start of
the program to 15% in 2001) and a general perception, on the part of the miners and employers,
that the miners lack suitable skills for employment outside the sector.
34. Year 2001 Employment-Related Plans. The mining companies report greater interest
on the part of surface workers to leave the industry than underground workers. The surface
workers include a large proportion of women who typically are not eligible for the MSPs
(which are only for underground and coal washing plant workers). Surface workers presently
make up about 24% of the workforce - but in an efficient industry should be about 18% (or
even less) - which would indicate a surface labor force of about 27,000 compared with 36,000
today i.e. an excess of 9,000 surface workers.  The MOE has prepared a Year 2001
Employment Restructuring Plan (ERP) which includes specific measures to provide incentives
to encourage administrative staff and surface workers to leave the industry (including the
training and compensation package financed by the EU) and has set performance targets for
reducing the number of administrative staff and surface workers. MOLSP has prepared a Year
2001 Employment Support Plan (ESP) of other measures including active employment
interventions (such as counseling and labor exchange activities that reduce frictional unemploy-
t Mines must often rehire young miners who return from military service.

ment), and activities to support private sector job creation (such as incubators, business
counseling, and micro credits) to support regional development in Upper Silesia so that workers
will continue to take MSP and leave the industry.
2.  Capacity Restructuring
35. Planned Closure. The closure of 36 million tons annual production capacity will involve
(a) complete closure of 23 mines (16 in the joint stock mining companies and 7 in the single
mine companies including 6 mines where production stopped earlier in the 1990s) with 26
million tons annual capacity and (b) shutting down large parts of mines and uneconomic
production faces and levels in 21 mines which accounts for 10 million tons annual production
capacity. Thus, by May 2001, 40 mines were active including 37 in the seven coal holding
companies (CHCs) plus Budryk, Bogdanka and Jaworzno, and 23 mines were closed including
18 fully liquidated mines (Table 1.4).
36. Progress To Date. In 1998 and 1999 production was terminated and liquidation started
at 9 mines with just over 12 million tons of annual capacity. By the end of Year 2000
production had been terminated and liquidation started at another 5 mines with another 7



13
million tons of annual capacity for a total of 18 million tons annual capacity liquidated
(including 6 mtpy of capacity at mines that terminated production prior to the start of the
Program) since the start of the Program (Table 1.4).

37. Closure Costs. Costs of closure of mines (averaging US$16 per capacity ton or about
US$19 million per mine to be closed) include: (a) closing of underground roadways; (b)
stowage of underground roadways, if required to avoid subsidence; (c) closing and capping of
shafts; (d) installation of water pumping equipment to prevent flooding of the mine, if this could
endanger neighboring mines; (e) costs of recovering equipment, if any; and (f) limited above-
ground mine site reclamation work.
38. Capacity Closure Plan. MOE has prepared a Year 2001 Capacity Closure Plan taking
into account present knowledge about subsidence impacts. The Plan confirmed that all
proposed capacity closures are irreversible.
39. Mine Restructuring Company (MRC). A Mine Restructuring Company (MRC) was
established in August 2000 as a separate entity. The objectives of the MRC are: (i) liquidation
of mines assets more effectively through reducing closure costs and shortening closure time, (ii)



14
more transparent and effective use of budget funds, and (iii) management and disposal of mines
assets. The MRC will also undertake employment creation initiatives. The MRC will not
produce any coal. Costs for closure of entire mines by MRC will be financed from the state
budget, but the companies must finance partial mine closure from their own resources including
the cost of closure of the additional 10 million ton of capacity envisaged under the Revised
Program.
40. Liabilities of Closed Mines. The MRC will take over from the existing mining
companies the assets and liabilities of mines where production has been terminated. Liabilities
to Government entities will be written off in the MRC. It is estimated that about PLNI.8 billion
will be written off through that process. Funds from the sale of assets will be used partly to pay
off liabilities that cannot be forgiven and partly for job creation activities. The MOE as share
holder has provided clear instructions and criteria to MRC and to the mine holding companies
regarding the transfer of assets and liabilities so that process can be undertaken in a prompt
manner with a high degree of transparency and automaticity with little or no need for
negotiation. MRC has proposed a Year 2001 Operating Plan with milestones and targets for
mine closure activities together with a detailed cash flow statement with regard to its ability to
service any liabilities which are not eligible for rescheduling or forgiveness under the program.
A separate mine restructuring company Bytom MRC was set up by BSW. This has since been
placed under the control of MRC.
3.   Financial Restructuring
41. Financial Restructuring. The Government Program provides for rescheduling or
forgiveness of liabilities to Government and govemment institutions including environmental
funds - but not commercial liabilities. The Revised Program introduces some changes to the
provisions for financial restructuring that are to reflect the worsened financial situation of the
mining companies that occurred during 1998 and 1999. The Revised Program provides for (a)
forgiveness of social fund, health and environmental fund liabilities that accrued to Government
before December 31, 1998; and (b) rescheduling of liabilities due for VAT and to mining
gminas until December 31, 2002 - after which they will be paid back over the period of 5 years.
With respect to mines fully closed all liabilities due for VAT will be cancelled. With respect to
mines that would be transferred to the MRC, the liabilities due to Social Insurance Fund that
accrued before December 31, 1999 and those due to VAT, Worker Guaranteed Benefits Fund,
Fund for Rehabilitation of the Disabled, environmental funds and mining gminas that accrued
before December 31, 2000 can be fully cancelled with interest.
42.  Transition Provisions. With respect to liabilities arising after March 31, 1998 and until
December 31, 2002 (except for liabilities to Social Insurance Fund which is until December 31,
2000), the mining companies would seek to reach agreements with individual creditors as to the
extent and method of repayment.  The revised law provides that (i) liabilities to the
Govemment, including interest (excluding the VAT and fees and fines due to gminas) can be
waived fully and (ii) rescheduling would not apply to liabilities incurred after December 31,
2002, and (iii) repayment periods would not exceed 5 years. To reflect the difficult financial
situation of the mining companies that occurred in 1998 and 1999, the Revised Program
expands the transition period for current liabilities until December 31, 2002. From then these
liabilities would be paid on conditions agreed upon with the creditors. The overdue liabilities to
ZUS that occurred during 1999 would be paid back by the end of year 2000. The above
provisions would cover about 61% of the total accumulated liabilities of the sector as of April 1,



15
1998 (about PLN 8.6 billion liabilities out of PLN 14.0 billion (US$3.8 billion) total liabilities
as of March 31, 1998) plus about 87% of the additional liabilities that accrued until December
31 1999 (about PLN 4.8 billion out of the total additional PLN5.5 billion that added up during
1998 and 1999) as shown in Table 1.5.

43. Environmental Liabilities. Restructuring of financial liabilities resulting from unpaid
environmental fees and fines will require official confirmnation of the Ministry of Environmental
Protection. The Ministry will be requested to approve the proposed environmental remediation
program (including measures and compliance schedule) of the mines requesting restructuring.
Before such an approval, the Ministry would assure itself that the program is satisfactory. In
addition, the Revised Program introduced a provision that with respect to the enviromnental
liabilities from saline water discharges, each mining company will have to implement actions
aimed at environmental improvements resulting from recommendations of the Sector
Environmental Assessment.
44. Eligibility Criteria For the mining companies to be eligible for the debt restructuring
provided under the Program, the following main conditions must be met. First, during the
period of 1999-2002, the increase of the average monthly wage may not exceed the mean
annual increase of the CPI established for each year in the budgetary act. Second, the debtor
must implement the process of restructuring according to the Program. Third, the debtor must



16
pay its current liabilities due to the Social Insurance Fund (ZUS), the Labor Fund and the Fund
for Guaranteed Workers Benefits in a timely manner.
45. Inability to meet Eligibility Criteria Due to the poorer than expected financial
performance of the mining companies in 1998 and 1999, the companies have had difficulty in
meeting the provisions for financial restructuring and application thereof have proven
insufficient. The Revised Program introduces new provisions for financial restructuring that
are built around the establishment of MRC and extension of dates for repayment and write-offs
of past debt. However, these measures have so far proved insufficient considering that all but
one (JSW) of the mining companies have been unable to meet the requirement to stay current
on obligations to ZUS and were unable to pay back by the end of year 2000 the overdue
liabilities to ZUS that occurred during 1999. Thus none of the mining companies have been
unable to implement the financial restructuring and restructure their balance sheets.
46. Arrangements with ZUS Because of the unpaid liabilities, liens and mortgages have
been placed by ZUS and the tax office on all available mining company assets. If the mining
companies sell any assets then the proceeds are shared 50/50 with the lien holder. When the
mining companies make payments to ZUS or the tax office the practice of the creditor is to
credit part of the funds against past liabilities and part against current liabilities - which makes
it all the more difficult for the companies to meet current obligations. The mining companies
have prepared and provided to ZUS detailed monthly cash flows and cash management plans
and four of the companies have signed interim agreements with ZUS but these only cover the
period through the end of Year 2000.
47. MOE Plan MOE is preparing a plan of possible measures and incentive mechanisms for
discussion with creditors (including proposed agreements between companies and creditors)
with the objectives of (a) improving industry financial performance and liquidity so as facilitate
the implementation of the financial restructuring measures under the law; and (b) working out
new arrangements with ZUS in an attempt to arrange for all payments to be credited against
current year liabilities; and (c) to prevent any unplanned increase of liabilities to ZUS, VAT,
PIT.
48. Payment Priorities Given the lack of liquidity of the mining companies, available funds
must be allocated between creditors. In practice, all available funds are directed towards ZUS,
the tax authorities and the gminas with very little payment for environmental fees and fines. As
the mining companies' financial performance improves, it will be important, that the members
of the IMCSC, as representatives of different types of creditors, continue to address the issue of
the relative priority of payments to the different state creditors.
4.   Environmental Improvements
49. Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA) Environmental protection was largely
ignored by the coal mining industry for many years. Since 1998 the industry has started to
improve its environmental performance but a systematic approach is needed for the sector to
improve public acceptability and meet EU accession conditions. The Ministry of Enviromnent
(MoEP) has undertaken a Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) using technical assistance
funds from the ongoing Privatization and Restructuring Project (Loan 3442-POL). The SEA
concluded that while the range of environmental problems is significant, technical solutions
exist. The most significant problem is saline water discharges. Other significant issues include



17
land subsidence, land use damage from surface disposal of mine wastes, and releases of coal
bed methane. There are also some instances of radium in waste-water effluents, radon gas
releases, and persistent fires at some mine waste disposal sites, but these are of lesser
importance.
50. Saline Water Discharges. The SEA found that the costs of saline water discharge were
not as serious as previously estimated and identified least cost options for addressing the
problems of saline water discharge. Rather than investing public funds in large desalination
plants, the SEA identified less costly options as equally if not more effective. Such options
include selective mining techniques, shifting production away from mines with the worst saline
water release, building underground dams to seal closed workings and re-injection of water and
re-directing the flow of water into underground sedimentation reservoirs where chemicals can
be used to precipitate salt and clean the water for release. Following the SEA, a study will be
undertaken to examine the present and future operation of the Debiensko Saline Water plant to
see if it provides a least cost approach given that some of the mines using the plant are being
closed.
51. Five Year Mine by Mine Environmental Action Plans. To address the above issues
and reach compliance with environmental protection standards by Year 2005, preliminary mine
by mine five year (2001-2005) environmental action plans (EAPs) have been prepared. Each of
the mining companies Year 2001 operating plans include mine by mine Environmental Action
Plans (EAPs) based on the results of the SEA which identify: (a) the priority environmental
mitigation measures, (b) the associated cost and sources(s) of financing, (c) the reduction in
environmental fees to be expected from implementing the measure and (d) the schedule for its
implementation which have been presented to and endorsed by the Ministry of Environment
(MoEP). The work of the SEA is being extended so that the five year mine by mine EAPs can
be finalized.
52. Subsidence. The SEA also identified land subsidence as an important environmental
problem caused by mining operations. The current regulations and procedures do not ensure
that full economic costs of land subsidence and damages in surface infrastructure are
appropriately included in coal production costs. The MOEP in agreement with the MOE will
undertake a study to analyze the subsidence problem in detail, recommend some improvements
to current regulations and estimate the economic costs of subsidence. The results of study will
be taken by the MOE into account in further decisions regarding closure of uneconomic
capacity in the industry.
5.   Privatization
53.  Sector Privatization Assessment. The Revised Program states that privatization will be
one of the basic tools to achieve the Program's longer term objectives and the Government has
re-confirmed its commitment to privatization as the final step in industry reform in the Letter of
Sector Development Policy (LSDP) attached as Annex 1. The Ministry of State Treasury
(MoST) has completed a Sector Privatization Assessment (SPA), using technical assistance
under the Privatization and Restructuring Project (PRP) (Loan 3342 POL). In addition, an
information memorandum has been completed for Bogdanka and is being prepared for Budryk -
the latter also using PRP technical assistance funds - and the Jaworzno mine has been merged
with the local power plant and will be privatized under the power sector privatization. The SPA
concluded that while the Revised Program makes a significant improvement in the situation of



18
the hard coal sector in Poland and should be continued, further structural reforms beyond those
included in the Revised Program will be needed in order to achieve a sector in which all the
remaining mines are financially viable, internationally competitive and fully privatizable
54. Alternative Strategies. The SPA considered three possible privatization strategies. The
first involved an immediate "step change" reduction in employment and capacity followed by
early privatization of the industry.  This is not considered politically feasible, socially
acceptable or affordable from a near term budget perspective. The second involved a more
gradual reduction in employment and capacity followed by a later privatization - this would be
more costly for the budget (but costs would be spread out over several years) and would run the
risk of chasing a moving target - by the time the restructuring was completed another round
might be needed before privatization could be implemented. The third option involved closure
by the end of 2002 of about eight or nine mines that clearly have no economic future and the
offering of the rest of the industry to investors. This runs the risk that not all of the mines
would be taken by investors in which case more closures would be needed in 2003 and 2004.
55. Privatization Strategy Framework. Following completion of the SPA, the MoE as
shareholder has prepared a Privatization Strategy Framework (PSF) document. The MoST will
be responsible for implementing the privatization transactions for whole companies and the
mining companies will prepare and implement privatization of individual mines with approval
from MoST as per legal and regulatory requirements. The PSF recognizes that further
provisions may be needed regarding arrangements for restructuring/forgiveness of arrears to
Government and treatment of environmental and health liabilities at time of privatization. The
PSF also states that further employment restructuring and further capacity restructuring will be
undertaken if needed so that industry can be privatized. The PSF proposes trade sales to
strategic investors as the preferred method of privatization transaction and provides specific
milestones and timetable for privatization. The MoE has started a structured process of
consultation with its social partners in order to build the political and social consensus needed to
be able to implement the privatization of the sector. Based on the outcome of the consultation,
the MOE in consultation with the IMCSC will submit a privatization strategy to the Economic
Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) following which Government will finalize and
adopt a privatization strategy for the sector. In the meantime Bogdanka has been offered for
privatization and Budryk will be offered once the information memorandum is complete and
approved.
6.   Social Monitoring
56. Regional Situation. Most hard coal mining is based in the Upper Silesian region (around
Katowice). In spite of the past predominance of obsolescent heavy industry, this region has
achieved high growth rates, has unemployment well below the national average and has
increasingly diversified into light industries and services. These factors have helped to ease the
social impact of the Program so far and are expected to continue to do so, although there are
indications that the labor market is becoming less able to absorb redundant workers compared
with 1998 and 1999.
57.  Consultation with Regional Authorities.  The Government has addressed the social
impacts of industrial restructuring and employment downsizing and the Program emphasizes the
need for a coordinated approach towards restructuring of the hard coal sector in the context of
regional development of Upper Silesia. To ensure strong coordination with regional authorities,



19
representatives of the Katowice Voivodship and the local parliament are members of the Inter-
Ministerial Coal Steering Committee.
58. Local Authorities. The Program also fosters cooperation between the mining companies
and the local administration (Gmina) in respect to dealing with past liabilities to the gmina as
well as opportunities arising from the closure of mines and the reclamation of abandoned mine
sites. The government is taking steps to ensure that the Program implementation is coordinated
with the new powiats (county governments) which were established effective January 1, 1999,
as part of the regional administrative reform.
59. Monitoring Arrangements The Government is using the following multiple approaches
to monitor the social impact of restructuring including:
* using existing labor office administrative data to monitor unemployment, and the degree to
which displaced miners are entering the ranks of the unemployed;
* using existing social assistance office administrative data to monitor the number and types
of families, including miners families, which qualify for means tested services and
payments; undertaking special follow-up surveys of workers taking social packages (see
paragraph 29 for description); and
- planning regional labor surveys to more generally monitor movements and trends in the
labor market.
60.  Tracer Surveys of Miners.  A bi-annual tracer survey of displaced miners2 has been
carried out on three occasions to date, covering miners who left the industry since the second
half of the 1999. The surveys focus on the labor force and income status of ex-miners, and also
cover the assessment and ways of utilization of the Miners Social Package (see Section III.C. 1).
The surveys found that:
*     Older miners who were five years within the retirement age as a rule took the miners
leave package. Not surprisingly, a vast majority (90%) of the beneficiaries of the
"rminers leave" has retired and withdrawn from the labor force. Only 4-5% of this group
is employed, and 5-6% is looking for a job.
*     Virtually all younger miners took one-time unconditional lump sum pay. Expectedly, a
majority of this group has entered the labor market, but some sizeable minority has
withdrawn from the labor force. This group's labor market status varies depending on
the time that has elapsed since they left the mining sector. Generally, those miners who
left earlier have been more successful in finding a job, which is likely to reflect both the
duration of job search as well as the deterioration in labor market conditions that has
recently occurred in Poland generally, and in the Silesia region in particular.
*     The first wave of redundant miners (those who left the industry from late 1999 to early
2000) is doing modestly well on the labor market. Nearly one-half (46%) of this cohort
(only lump sum takers) has found a job within the period of 12 to 18 months.3 However,
a substantial fraction (30%) is still unemployed, or out of the labor force (24%). These
figures imply the unemployment rate for this group of about 39%.
2    The term "ex-miners" refers to all persons whose former job was in the mining industry and is not restricted
to underground workers.
3    The results on the labor force status refer to the beneficiaries of the one-time severance pay.



20
*     The labor market status of those miners (lump sum takers) who left the industry later is
worse. For example, among miners who left the industry recently (from late 2000
through early 2001) and thus whose job search duration has been relatively short (a few
months), only about one-fourth (26%) has found work, while as much as 40% are
unemployed and 35% are not looking for a job.
*     While unemployment for ex-miners is relatively high, it should be recognized that in
many cases finding a new job is largely a matter of time and active job search. For
instance, the proportion of the second cohort of displaced miners4 who are employed
increased from 24% to 35% within 6 months. The proportion of those unemployed
remained stable, however, in part reflecting the fact that some of those who had left the
labor force decided to re-enter the labor market.
*     The rate of escape from unemployment is relatively high. For example, 27% of the
unemployed managed to find employment within six months (from November 2000
through May 2001). Many ex-miners who initially had been inactive started to look for
a job (24%), and some of them found new employment (10%). On the other hand,
some of the jobs are only temporary; specifically 12% of ex-miners who were employed
(in November 2000) were again without a job six months later. In addition, some of the
unemployed became "discouraged workers" and withdrew from the labor force (14%).
*     Self-employment has proved an important form of securing one's living. Among those
miners who have a job, almost one-quarter (23%) are self-employed.
*     Income is another aspect of the labor market status. Most miners assess their current
income status as average (from 50% to 56%, depending on the cohort), or above the
average (10-15%), regardless whether or not they have a job. Most likely this reflects
that the MSP packages are very optimally sized to attract workers to leave the industry,
though the package could be regarded as quite generous compared to other sectors under
reform.
*     The majority of miners has seen their income status deteriorate after losing their job.
This could have been expected, as traditionally wages in the mining industry have been
high, well above those in other industries. Thus, moving from a mining job to a job in
another industry has inevitably involved an earnings loss.  In this context, it is
encouraging that around 8% of ex-miners compare favorably their current income status
to that prior to leaving the mining sector, and between 19% and 38% (depending on the
cohort) claim that their income has not changed in the wake of leaving the mining
sector.5
*     The majority (55%) of beneficiaries of one-time unconditional lump sum pay use it
mostly for investment (e.g. purchases of stocks and bonds, bank savings, education for
children, investment in own business) as opposed to current consumption. At the same
time the bulk of miner families (92%) has used a small part of the severance pay also as
an important supplement to current family income.
*     The substantial majority of miners (48%) consider their decision to leave the mining
industry as beneficial. Only 16% think they made a mistake by giving up their mining
job. (The remaining part expressed a mixed assessment).
4    Those who left from early to late 2000.
5    LLater cohorts tend to assess more favorably their current income relative to income while having a job in the
mining industry.



21
*     The overall assessment of the MSP tends to be positive however a significant minority
(around 30%) assesses the package negatively. Among those who assess the package
negatively most cite the lack of employment opportunities as the main reason for their
negative opinion.
61. Job Creation Initiatives. In response to the findings of the tracer surveys, MoE and
MoLSP are implementing new initiatives to help stimulate job creation and at the same time
reduce both frictional and structural unemployment. These include an expansion of small
business assistance including incubators, business counseling and micro credits.  These
programs are particularly effective for the select group that have the background and initiative
to be entrepreneurs. As indicated in the tracer surveys, some ex-miners have already been
successful in creating businesses. The EU-supported package of additional 3.6 months wages
for surface workers (para. 30) should help women planning to leave the mining industry. The
planned changes to the social allowance package, whereby participants will be able to keep 50%
of their remaining allowance if they find a job in less than two years, is also a move in the right
direction. It should make this option more attractive and given that this option supports training
it may lead to a reduction of structural unemployment. The plans to further reduce frictional
unemployment by creating more comprehensive profiles of miners and vacancies, expanding
counseling services and enhancing labor exchange activities are all positive developments.
62. Public Information Campaign. In addition, the Government has mounted a Public
Information and Communications (PIC) campaign, including public opinion surveys, to
facilitate program implementation and gauge general public awareness and understanding of the
Program.
D.  Expected Results
63.  As shown previously in Section IIIA, Table 1.2 the Revised Program projects that
production will decline from 116 million tons in 1998 to 101 million tons in 2002 and that sales
will decline from 114 million tons in 1998 to about 100 million tons in 2002 - consisting of 77
million tons of domestic sales and 23 million tpy of exports in year 2002. The domestic market
sales as projected by the Reform Program are in line with market estimates in the SPA. The
export projections reflect the level of sales required to balance supply and demand .
Employment is expected to decline from 243,000 at year end 1997 to about 133,800 at year end
2002.  The industry is projected to generate a net profit in 2001 (after subsidies for miners
social packages and mine liquidation costs). This is based on critical assumptions from 1998-
2002 regarding average coal price (8% decrease), and unit operating costs (30 % decrease)
(both in 1999 real terms). These appear feasible if the industry can avoid over supply, if the
employment targets are reached, and if managers make a determined effort to continue to
reduce non-labor costs.  The final expected outcome of the reform  effort will be the
privatization of the industry
E.  Expected Costs
64.  The overall cash costs of the Program (1998-2002) to be financed from the state budget
for the period are estimated at about PLN 7.2 billion of which about PLN 5.6 billion is related
to employment restructuring (including PLN 0.2 billion for gmina support and employment
creation) and PLN 1.6 billion for mine closure and repair of surface damage caused by past



22
mining. In addition, the mining companies plan to spend about PLNO.5 billion on employment
restructuring and 0.2 billion for partial mine closure over the period 2000-2002 from their own
funds - but this will reduce their ability to pay other liabilities by that amount. In addition, and as
described in para. 42, it is expected that about PLN 8.3 billion of financial liabilities will be
forgiven and another PLN 5.1 billion rescheduled.

(December 1999).
F.  Implementation, Management and Monitoring of the Program
65. Enabling Law. Based on the Program document, the Government prepared an enabling law
(Adjustment of the Hard Coal Mining Sector to Operations in a Market Economy), which sets out
the rules for key features of the program. The law became effective on January 13, 1999. The
Government has also issued implementing regulations. In order to implement the provisions of the
Revised Program, the law has been modified and a revision to the law was approved by Parliament
on October 26, 2000 and became effective on February 8, 2001.



23
66. Ministry of Economy. Under the Program and enabling law, the ownership functions of
the Government for the mining companies have been transferred from MoST (previously the
owner) to the Ministry of Economy (MoE). Therefore, MoE has produced the Program and
coordinated inputs from other interested parties (ministries, regional authorities, agencies and
NGOs). However, MoST retains the responsibility for privatization of mining companies.
67. Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for providing
finance for the Program. In 1998 the MoF mobilized additional funding to help finance extra
MSP to meet demand which was well in excess of Program estimates. For 1999 and 2000, the
MoF adhered strictly to the Program budget providing about PLN1.7 billion and about PLN1.5
billion (excluding a loan from Labour Fund) respectively in budgetary funds for the Program.
For Year 2000, the budgetary funds provided under the program were not fully utilized because
of a slowdown in demand for MSP. The program continues to be adequately funded; MoF
budgeted about PLN1.4 billion for 2001 Program's implementation.
68. Ministry of Labor and Social Policy. The Ministry of Economy, in coordination with
the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MoLSP), is taking the lead in respect to the
management and implementation of the Miners Social Package (MSP) . MoE has overall
responsibility for the Program, but MoLSP is heavily involved in ensuring that there are
adequate employment services available to support miners leaving the industry. In addition,
MoLSP is responsible for overseeing the Public Information Campaign, and assisting with
implementation of previously described social monitoring activities. The MoLSP is also taking
the leadership for social monitoring and provision of employment services for miners.
69. Ministry of Environmental Protection. The Ministry of Environmental Protection
(MoEP) will be responsible for managing preparation of the Sector Environmental Assessment
(SEA). The National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management (National
Fund) and Voivodship Environmental Departments will provide advice to the MoEP, as well as
the Mining Companies on environmental matters. Furthermore, MoEP, in conjunction with the
Voivodship Environmental Department, will monitor implementation of the environmental
aspects of mining company business plans.
70.  Inter-Ministerial Coal Steering Committee.  An Inter Ministerial Coal Steering
Committee (IMCSC) appointed by the Prime Minister and reporting to the Council of Ministers
is overseeing Program implementation. The IMCSC consists of Deputy Ministers from five
ministries (namely Ministries of Finance, Economy, Labor, Environment, and State Treasury)
as well as the Voivod of Katowice Province and the Chairman of the Local Parliament of
Katowice, and will help MoE to monitor progress in carrying out the Program.
71. The State Hard Coal Restructuring Agency. The State Hard Coal Restructuring
Agency (PARG) is monitoring industry performance under the Program. This monitoring will
cover both company performance, as well as the aggregate sector performance and, will be
based on the performance targets included as part of company business plans and associated
employment contracts.
72. Audits. Audits of both the employment restructuring funds and the mine liquidation
funds are carried out by the mining companies auditors, PARG, and the Supreme Audit Office
(NIK). All the state budgetary funds have been fully accounted for and the audits confirms that
they have been used for their intended purpose. In addition, a special audit unit has been
established by the Ministry of Finance in Katowice to provide additional spot checks and audits



24
that the funds are not being misused. Audits carried out in 1998, 1999 and 2000 confirmed that
funds have been used properly.
G.  Reform Program Progress to Date
73. Employment and Capacity Restructuring. The Government's Reform Program started
in 1998 and was supported by the first SECAL in 1999. The Program has made exceptionally
good progress in employment restructuring and reducing production capacity. In 1999 alone
34,304 miners left the industry, about 9000 more than planned. As at end of year 2000, more
then 88,000 workers had left the industry, 14 mines have stopped production and production
capacity has been reduced by 27 million TPY. Over half of the workers leaving the industry
have reached retirement age. Social monitoring studies indicate that most of the other workers
who have left the industry are being absorbed in the local labor market and there is so far no
undue social stress in the region as a whole, although some communities are harder hit than
others. However, there are some early signs that there are less opportunities for redundant
workers entering the labor market as it is tightening and workers are now less willing to take
packages.
74.  Financial Performance. Progress in reducing the losses of the sector has been slower.
Despite significant cost savings, lower prices and coal sales led to continued losses in 1999
(when net losses were PLN 3.2 billion against a plan of PLN 1.5 billion). The situation
improved considerably in the first half of Year 2000 as production was adjusted in line with
sales so that prices have recovered. Marketing arrangements and sales terms have also started
to improve. The industry is now achieving a profit on coal sales but still makes an overall loss
due to high financial charges and non-coal operating costs. Net losses have been reduced to
PLN 1.6 billion for the Year 2000 and PLN 0.18 billion for first quarter 2001.
75. Liquidity and Cash Flow. But, the industry continues to be face a very difficult liquidity
situation and is still very short of cash. None of the mining companies was able to stay current
on their obligations to ZUS for 1999 and 2000 which is a precondition for financial
restructuring. Arrangements have been made regarding Financial Repair Programs and on
aggregate the mining companies are now achieving 100% of social security (ZUS) payments
and workers income tax (PIT) payments. The situation regarding payments for VAT has
improved significantly, and the companies are expected to pay only about 80% of due value
added tax (VAT) on sales in the year 2001. From 2002 onwards, the mining companies should
pay 100% of their VAT (as well as all their ZUS and PIT obligations). The Ministry of
Economy has proposed arrangements involving sales or transfers to mining gminas of non-
productive assets proceeds which could be used for payments of ZUS or VAT tax debt which
could further improve the expected VAT payments for Year 2001.
76. Privatization. The work of the SPA has provided a detailed assessment of the many
issues that must be addressed if an industry of this size and social and political importance is to
be privatized. The SPA has identified the key strategic decisions that must be taken in order to
prepare an implementable privatization strategy. The findings of the SPA have been presented
to industry and government officials at two major seminars. Following completion of the SPA,
the Ministry of Economy in collaboration with other ministries has prepared the SPE which has
been approved by the IMCSC and is now being discussed with the Trade Unions.
77. Environment. The work on the SEA has brought to light full details of the industry's
environmental performance and has provided for a rigorous analysis of alternatives to address



25
the major problems. Preliminary mine by mine environmental action plans to achieve
compliance with environmental protection standards by 2005 have been prepared. Following
further work to take place under an extension of the SEA, these plans will be finalized,
endorsed by MOEP and adopted by the mining companies. Based on the SEA findings,
expensive investments in desalination plants have been reconsidered and instead less costly but
equally effective measures have been introduced including reduced production at the worst
mines and the use of closed mines to provide storage space and protective barriers. Under the
environmental action plans other environmental impacts such as solid waste disposal and
subsidence are also being addressed on a mine by mine basis.
H. Reform Program Benefits
78. The Program is providing substantial benefits to the economy and to various social
groups. In particular, as a result of Program implementation:
* The drain on the national budget is being progressively reduced as a hard budget constraint
is applied with the result that Government revenues are being applied to constructive needs
rather than propping up a loss-making industry;
* Redundant miners are benefiting from temporary income support packages and assistance in
finding alternate employment, retraining, and small business assistance during a transition
period;
* The remaining miners are working in an industry that will become more stable over time
with safer mining conditions6 and which will be able to provide more secure incomes when
reform is complete;
 The regional economy is benefiting from improved labor mobility and re-deployment of a
significant number of persons in new jobs, thereby contributing to a growing GDP, rather
than being a drain on it;
* The region is benefiting from reduced pollution and from clean-up of abandoned mines and
related industrial facilities; and
* The country's energy sector is benefiting from stable coal supplies at internationally
competitive prices and increasing coal quality as more selective mining concentrates on
easier accessible and higher quality deposits.  This will contribute to the growing
competitiveness of the Polish economy, an important feature in the context of EU accession.
I.   Reform Program Risks
79. Experience in other countries shows that the restructuring of a large coal sector is very
difficult. So despite positive progress so far, significant risks remain and Government must stay
alert.
80. Financial Performance - Coal Operations. The main risk facing the program is that
despite the extensive employment, capacity and financial restructuring being implemented
under the Program, the industry may not become profitable. If coal demand should drop
sharply below the levels projected in the Reform Program, the employment restructuring
presently included in the Program may not reduce production capacity and improve productivity
sufficiently for costs to be brought below prices and a positive result on coal sales achieved.
This issue has been specifically recognized by Government and the SPF states that there may be
6 Most mines which will be closed are older and more prone to accidents and less safe operations.



26
a need for additional employment and capacity restructuring following completion of the
present Program.
81. Employment Restructuring. An immediate and very difficult risk facing the Program is
that given the slowdown in take-up of packages in Year 2000 and 2001, the employment
restructuring targets may not be achieved.  The Government recognizes that additional
employment reduction is required, especially regarding surface workers and is taking actions as
identified by MoE and MOLP.
82.  Overall Profitability. Even if a positive financial result on sales is achieved, companies
may still have difficulties achieving a positive net financial result because the present financial
restructuring measures may not reduce the burden of financial costs sufficiently for the industry
to achieve overall profitability. The PSF notes that additional financing restructuring may be
needed for some companies following completion of the Program in 2002.
83. Environmental Performance. Environmental performance may be restrained by a lack
of funding. While companies can undertake low-cost environmental improvement, some
improvements require money to be spent and if funds are not available, progress may be less
than planned. This risk is mitigated partly by the efforts to improve profitability and partly by
access to other sources of funds for environmental investments. Also the mining company
business plans include environmental targets and performance which will be monitored by the
Ministry of Economy as well as by the Ministry of Environment and the local Voivod
Environmental offices. The employment contracts for the mining companies management
boards also include environmental performance criteria.
84. Privatization. Poor financial performance may also be a barrier to privatization. If
needed, this will be addressed as the Government's privatization strategy is further developed
and implemented.
PART IV. BANK SUPPORT FOR THE REFORM PROGRAM
AND THE PROPOSED SECAL 2 LOAN
A.  Rationale for Bank Involvement and Objectives of the Loan
1.   Rationale for Bank Involvement
85. The Bank has been involved in an on-going dialogue with the Government since the early
1 990s regarding coal sector restructuring and has taken an active role in reviewing and advising
as the Govermment has prepared, designed, started to implement and revised the Program. The
Government has requested financing from the Bank to help meet the budgetary cost of its
Program and the Bank has agreed to consider lending of up to US$1.0 billion to help finance up
to half of the cash costs of the Program, on the basis that this level of financial support is
required and that there is satisfactory progress in Program implementation. To provide this
level of support, a series of three SECALs over the period of 1999-2002 is envisaged. The
Bank approved the first SECAL in June 1999 which was fully withdrawn in September 2000.



27
2.   The First SECAL Loan and the Progress to date
86. World Bank Involvement. The first SECAL loan of $300 million was made as
finalization of a long period of policy dialog that the Bank had with the Govemment regarding
the scope and design of the coal sector reform program. The Bank decided to become
financially involved in this difficult reform because the Reform Program approved by the
Govemment in June 1998 was the first ever in Poland that addressed the need for coal sector
reform in a meaningful manner. It dealt with politically difficult matters such as employment
and capacity downsizing, financial restructuring, and corporate management matters and for
the first time ever it introduced a possibility for privatization of profitable mines or entire
mining companies once restructured. The Government's commitment to implementing the
Reform Program was demonstrated by a Letter of Sector Development Policy (LSDP) which
became for the Bank the basis for specific conditionality for the first SECAL and for monitoring
progress in the program's implementation.
87.  Conditionality. The specific conditionality for the first SECAL loan was built around the
areas of satisfactory macroeconomic performance of the country, offering MSP packages with
specific priority and numbers, establishing a social monitoring system, completing liquidation
and terminating production in an agreed number of mines according to the LSDP, introducing
transparent and tight procedures for budget funds transfers needed for reform, improving
corporate management, undertaking specific actions in areas of improving environmental
performance and starting to prepare for privatization.
88. Progress.  In addition to the progress in Section III G (Reform Program Progress to
Date) the conditionality for the release of the first and second tranches of the first SECAL
supported the following accomplishments:
Employment Restructuring
89. Under the first SECAL, employment was reduced to 186,000 and 18,000 lump sum
packages were accepted. The Ministry of Economy issued an order to the mining companies
that that the MSP are to be provided with priority to those employed in mines being closed
under the program and the mining companies have administered the packages accordingly.
Satisfactoiy audits of the budgetary payments under the program to the mining companies for
MSP have been provided by qualified independent auditors. With regard to social safety net
measures, the Government set up an extensive system of social monitoring over the next several
years including: (a) labor market/economic trend surveys every few months, (b) displaced miner
follow-up surveys every few months (the result of the first survey have just been released), (c)
regular reporting of social assistance and unemployment data, and (d) regular monitoring of
divestiture of social infrastructure to ensure essential social services are being maintained. The
MOLSP assigned a full time person to keep all this monitoring moving and to supervise
contractors A satisfactory plan was prepared for the MSP for calendar year 2000 and provided
to the Bank.
Capacity Restructuring
90. Under the first SECAL about 20 million tpy capacity was liquidated. The assets of the
following 5 mines have been liquidated (ZWP Anthracite, Paryz, Pstrowski, Zory and
Siemianowice). Production has been terminated at the following 5 mines i.e. one more than
agreed (Rozalia, Gliwice, Niwka-Modzejow, Sierza, and Nova Ruda). The liquidation and



28
production termination at the above mines has been independently verified. Satisfactory audit
of the budgetary payments under the program to the mining companies for physical mine
liquidation have been provided by independent auditors. Resolutions for liquidation of the
following complete mines in year 2000 (ZG Jadwiga, ZG Wojkowice, Debiensko and Jan
Kanty) as well as the following parts of mines (Moszczenica, Polska, Wawel and I Maja) in
calendar year 2000 were adopted by the mining companies.
Privatization
91. Under the first SECAL, the SPA was prepared for the overall sector privatization and the
Government selected and appointed for Budryk and Bogdanka a major international firm as
privatization advisor to prepare the information memoranda which were needed to offer each
mine to private investors. The information memorandum was completed for Bogdanka and the
mine was offered for privatization. The information memorandum for Budryk is under
preparation and will be advertised once completed.
Environmental Performance
92. Under the first SECAL, the SEA was prepared and environmental actions have been
included in the mining companies business plans and implemented and total saline content of
water discharges in the hard coal sector and the quantity of solid waste generated during the
period from January 1, 1999 till September 30, 1999, was lower by 15% and 17% respectively
compared to that of the same period in 1997. The aggregate amount of fees and fines assessed
on the Mining Companies for solid waste surface discharges for the period from January 1,
1999 till September 30, 1999 were 9% lower compared to those for the same period in 1998. A
report with this data was prepared by MoEP based on a study by independent consultants, that
was verified by the regional and voivodship environmental authorities.
Mining Companies' Supervisory Boards
93. Under the first SECAL, the supervisory board of each mining company was reconstituted
on January 1, 2000, including the appointment of one full time supervisory board member for
each company.
Minine- Companies' Operating Plans for Year 2000
94. Operating plans for the mining companies were originally approved in January 2000.
Following completion of the SEA and SPA, the plans were revised and approved, satisfactory to
the Bank in August 2000.
3.   Objectives for the Proposed SECAL 2 Loan
95. Following completion of the first SECAL, the Government has requested the Bank to
continue its support for implementation of Reform Program in the form of the proposed
US$100 million equivalent single-tranche SECAL 2. The overall development objective of the
project is to support implementation of the Government's 1998-2002 Hard Coal Sector Reform
Program which is designed to reduce the capacity, employment, cost and enviromnental
problems of the sector and improve the financial performance of the sector so that it becomes
profitable and can be privatized. In particular, SECAL 2 will support the Government in
implementing the Revised Program which contains more extensive mine closures and



29
employment reduction than in the original Program. Specific objectives for SECAL2 relate to
support for actions and measures to (i) assist workers leaving the industry to find new jobs and
thereby keep up the process of labor force down-sizing; (ii) improve the industry financial
performance and, in particular, payment of taxes and fees; (iii) make further progress regarding
preparation of the industry for privatization;  and (iv) continue progress to improve
environmental performance.
4.   Sector Issues to be addressed under the Operation
96. While considerable progress has been made so far in implementing the Program, several
challenges remain. First, the Mining Companies and MoE report that interest in taking MSPs is
now very low and that not all of the budgetary funds available in 2000 for MSPs were used.
New initiatives are needed to encourage workers to leave the industry so that the Program's
employment restructuring targets are achieved.  The MoE has prepared a Year 2001
Employment Restructuring Plan regarding actions to be taken by the Mining Companies to
reduce employment and MoLSP has prepared a Year 2001 Employment Support Plan
containing active employment intervention and regional development initiatives to help workers
leaving the industry to find jobs in the private sector. Second, industry financial performance
remains fragile and the industry is not yet able to pay all of its taxes and fees. New measures
are needed to increase profitability, improve liquidity and facilitate financial restructuring. The
Year 2001 business plans of the mining companies place a continued emphasis on productivity
improvements and cost increases. They also include increased exports to take advantage of an
improvement in international coal prices in the second of half of year 2001. Most importantly,
the Year 2001 cash management plans of the mining companies address the liquidity situation
of the mining companies and focus on improved payment of taxes and fees. Also, the balance
sheets of the Mining Companies will be improved by the arrangements for transferring assets
and liabilities of closed mines to MRC. Third, the Government is carefully considering how to
develop its privatization strategy and gain the necessary political and social consensus so that
the strategy can be implemented. The SPF has been prepared and discussions started in June
2001 with the Trade Unions. The SPF notes that the Government will have to address key
issues such as the treatment of environmental and health liabilities and that, in order to
successfully privatize the industry, there may be a need for greater employment reduction and
mine closure than previously planned. Fourth, there is a need to follow-up the environmental
work undertaken under the SEA and to ensure that implementation of environmental protection
actions is not hindered by lack of funds. MoE and MoEN are initiating further work for the
mine by mine environmental action plan, subsidence and desalination. The mining companies
have included environmental actions in their operating plans and environmental performance is
one of the measures for evaluating and rewarding mining company management. In addition,
MoE and MoEN will provide oversight to help ensure that environmental concerns are not
relegated to a low priority due to preoccupation with employment restructuring, mine closure
and financial performance.
B.  Loan Arrangements and Tranching
1.   Financial Arrangements.
97. Tranching. The proposed Coal SECAL 2 of US$100 million equivalent will be quick-
disbursing linked to the conditionality specified for the tranche release. The loan will be
released in one single tranche following loan effectiveness which is expected shortly after
Board presentation.



30
98. Loan Product. The proposed loan, in the form of a Euro-denominated commitment
linked Fixed Spread Loan (FSL), will be made to the Republic of Poland, represented by the
Ministry of Finance. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate for Euro
FSLs, with a fixed spread and a 10-year bullet principal repayment. Disbursements will be
made into a Deposit Account of MOF established in the Central Bank of Poland for this
purpose.
99. Disbursements. In accordance with the Operational Directive on the Simplification of
Disbursement Rules under Structural Adjustment and Sectoral Adjustment Loans (February 8,
1996), disbursements of the loan will not be linked to any specific purchases, and hence, there
will be no procurement requirements. Disbursements of the loan will be subject to the standard
negative list of ineligible goods and countries of origin. The Government has indicated that the
counterpart funds generated by the loan will accrue to the budget. Upon notification by the
Bank of the tranche release, proceeds of the loan will be deposited by the Bank into the MOF
Deposit Account following receipt of the Borrower's withdrawal application.
100. Audits. If after deposit in this account, the proceeds are used for ineligible purposes (i.e.,
to finance items imported from non-member countries, or goods or services in the standard
negative list), the Bank will require the Govemment to either (i) return that amount to the
account for use for eligible purposes, or (ii) refund the amount directly to the Bank, in which
case the Bank will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount of the loan. Although routine
audits of the Deposit Account will not be required, the Bank reserves the right to require audits
at any time. The expected closing date of the proposed loan is end December 2001.
2.  Tranche Release Conditions
a. Overview
101. Disbursement of the single tranche of US$100 million equivalent, which focuses largely
on the progress in implementation of the program, will occur upon effectiveness. The tranche
will be available for release upon effectiveness because the following actions have already been
completed: (i) a review satisfactory to the Bank of the country's macroeconomic performance;
(ii) satisfactory progress in implementation of the coal reform program as set out in the
Revision to the Program and the Letter of Sector Development Policy (LSDP); and (iii) specific
actions which demonstrate progress in implementing employment and capacity restructuring
under the program, improving financial performance of the mining companies, developing a
privatization strategy framework, and improving mining industry environmental performance.
b. Macroeconomic Performance
102. In evaluating Poland's macroeconomic performance for the tranche release, the Bank has
formed an overall assessment of the short and long term sustainability of economic growth
setting a path for low inflation and external balance. The assessment of macroeconomic
balances, inflation, growth and employment presented in Section II.A indicates that Poland's
macroeconomic situation and performance is satisfactory for the disbursement of the proposed
SECAL 2 single tranche loan (paras. 9 and 10). The assessment has drawn upon regular
analyses by the Bank and the IMF, with a particular focus on progress in maintaining a
satisfactory consolidated budget deficit (taking into account targets for 2001); progress in
maintaining external competitiveness as (evidenced by the current account balance); and



31
progress in selling enterprises which are important for achieving efficiency gains and promoting
EU accession.
c. Implementation Performance
103. The Bank has also reviewed the progress of implementing the Program as set out in the
Revision to the Program and the LSDP and confirmed that the progress is satisfactory.
d. Specific Conditionality
104. The specific conditionality consists of: (i) actions satisfactory to the Bank completed
prior to negotiations which relate to socially acceptable employment restructuring, capacity
restructuring, financial performance, environmental performance, privatization, implementation
and monitoring arrangements; and (ii) actions completed prior to Board Presentation which
relate to improved financial performance and tax payments, preparation of a privatization
strategic framework and progress regarding three environmental studies.
(1) Specific conditionality completed prior to negotiations
105. Employment and Capacity Restructuring. With regard to employment restructuring,
the objective is to continue to ensure that the miners are getting their financial packages and
labor redeployment services, that sufficient workers are leaving the industry, and that the
Program is not causing unmanageable social stress or having an adverse impact on the most
vulnerable. With regard to regional development the objective is to develop new initiatives to
support job creation in the Upper Silesia region. With regard to capacity restructuring, the
objective is to continue the reduction of supply in line with market demand.
106. Financial Performance. With regard to improved financial performance the objective is
for the industry to be current in its payments on an aggregate basis to government for social
security (ZUS) payments and workers income tax (PIT) payments and to be making substantial
(about 80%) payments for value added tax (VAT) payments and to confirm that additional
provisions for restructuring and forgiveness of public debt will be developed if needed in light
of the evolving industry financial situation and the needs of privatization.
107. Environmental Performance. With regard to environmental perforrnance the objective
is to make progress on the process of implementing environmental improvements and to ensure
that the necessary oversight and incentives are in place to ensure that mining companies do not
relegate environmental concerns to a low priority because of preoccupation with layoffs, mine
closure and financial performance.
108. Privatization. With regard to privatization the objective is to establish next steps towards
privatization and to develop an implementable privatization strategy framework that starts the
process of building political and social consensus with key groups such as the Trade unions.

C.  Other Loan Features
1.   Monitoring Arrangements
111. The Government is committed to a continuing program of social monitoring to track the
social impact of the coal restructuring program. Social monitoring reports which measure
overall compliance with the social impact indicators will be submitted to the Bank on a semi-
annual basis. MOLSP has prepared a revised and streamlined Survey Instrument (questionnaire)
for Year 2001 so as to (a) focus on questions directly related to the survey's objective of short-
term projection of economic and labor market conditions; (b) simplify the questions and group
possible answers into broader categories; (c) present results in a more readable format with
more thorough interpretation of results and their policy implications and (d) to highlight the
implications of the projected changes in economic and labor market conditions for employment
and unemployment.
2.   Poverty Category
112. The proposed Coal SECAL 2 has some important poverty-related features. However,
specific focus of this loan is not on the poor and it does not meet the criteria for being classified
as a "poverty-focused" operation since that is not the objective of the loan. It should, however,



34
be noted that it supports Government policies that aim to make coal sector restructuring socially
sustainable. This will be accomplished in part by ensuring that the existing social safety net
meets the needs of those most affected by restructuring: redundant coal sector workers and their
families and communities. The Miners' Social Package, in combination with the existing social
protection system, should ensure the establishment and financing of a minimum safety net for
the unemployed and for pensioners of mines being closed. The design and implementation of
the delivery mechanisms ensures that individual beneficiaries receive the safety net support to
which they are legally entitled and that local and municipal governments have the capacity to
operate essential social assets divested by the coal industry to such administrations.
3.   Environmental Category
113. The Bank's insistence on environmental improvements, both as part of the Program and
in connection with mining company operations and the direct involvement of Govermnent
environmental institutions, has been an important Bank contribution and remains an important
area for further work. As a Sector Adjustment Operation (SECAL 2), the proposed Project,
itself, will not result in any adverse environmental impact.  Instead, considerable net
environmental benefits are expected as a direct consequence of requiring environmental
remediation programs as an integral element of the business plans. These plans have been
reviewed and approved by an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee which will also help ensure
their proper implementation. The Project is classified as a Category B Project and a Sector
Environmental Assessment has been carried out.
4.  Participatory Elements
114. The process of preparing the Program was a comprehensive one, involving central
Government institutions, regional and local administrative bodies, the mining industry and
Union representatives. Moreover, the Bank also had an intensive dialogue with the Steering
Committee Members and with representatives of local Government, Voivodship administration,
and a number of NGOs. These included groups, concerned with environmental matters, as well
as NGOs with a focus on social acceptability. Among the latter were also groups dealing with
the issue of women in the coal mining sector, and the impact of restructuring on families, and
notably women and children. Moreover, the social assessments which are being executed and
will be repeated during and at the end of Program implementation, will allow to improve
detailed features of the Program as its execution moves along.
5.   Other Donors and Potential for Co-financing
115. The technical assistance provided by Bank staff and consultants in helping to shape the
Government's Program has been financially supported by a number of bilateral agencies
including those of EU Phare, Canada, the UK, and the US. Presently the U.S. Department of
Labor is on-site, and the UK Know-How Fund is defining a strategy to assist Gminas with local
economic development and job creation. The Bank has maintained regular contact with
representatives from the EU and bilateral institutions to keep them informed about progress in
Program preparation. The EU has undertaken operations to support the coal sector; and for the
period until EU membership, further EU support of the sector as well as for regional
development in Upper Silesia is envisaged. In addition, IFC and EBRD have expressed an
interest in considering financing or equity contributions as mines and/or mining companies are
privatized or IFC could assist as a Privatization Advisor. IFC might also be able to provide
assistance for small and medium enterprise development in Upper Silesia.



35
D.  Lessons Learned From Other Operations
1.   First Hard Coal SECAL
116. The preparation and supervision of the first SECAL have been integral to the preparation
of the proposed second SECAL and provides the basis for the areas of emphasis, proposed
conditionality  and approach to key issues such as employment restructuring, capacity
restructuring, financial restructuring, financial performance, environmental performance and
privatization. The first SECAL has confirmed the suitability of adjustment lending to support
this type of sector reform program, and identified the challenges involved in achieving
improved financial performance and in successfully absorbing miners in employment outside
the coal industry.
2.   Employment Services Operations
117. Social Support Measures The social component of the proposed SECAL 2 builds on the
Employment Promotion and Services Project (Loan 3338-POL) which helped to create a
country-wide labor services system, including labor re-deployment, retraining, and small
business assistance, with a special focus on Upper Silesia, and introduced modem labor re-
deployment programs throughout Poland. The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy has
expressed its satisfaction with the important infrastructure built under that loan and with the
major lessons learned with regard to social support measures and labor re-deployment.
118. Targeted Income Support. Further valuable lessons for actionable programs, and
notably the importance of fast acting and targeted income support with demand driven labor re-
deployment programs have been derived from other labor redeployment operations in the ECA
region. These other operations include operations with direct linkages to privatization in
Macedonia, Romania and Turkey. These operations show that the selection of capable
implementing agencies is crucial. This has been achieved in Poland through close cooperation
between the mining companies' Human Resource Departments, the Mine Labor Agency (GAP),
and the MoSLP local labor offices of the Katowice Region.
3.   Other Coal Restructuring Operations
119. Other Countries. The employment and capacity restructuring aspects of the project have
been considered in the light of experience with the Russia and Ukraine Coal SECAL operations
as well the Romanian Government's experience with mining industry restructuring and
severance payments. The Bank's experience with coal SECALs in the ECA Region has been
that implementing coal sector reform is highly dependent on overall macroeconomic conditions
and that a high level of commitment is required over several years to achieve sustained change
in an industry such as coal.
120. Poland. The social, political and economic environment are quite positive in Poland and
provide solid basis for the proposed operation in Poland. This is borne out by the successful
release of the second tranche of the first SECAL. Poland is a fast growing, robust economy
with a sound economic policy which has demonstrated its inherent strength during the onset of
the Asian and Russian Crises. The Polish coal industry does not suffer from wage arrears
problems or from problems with inter-enterprise debts or barter. Due to rapid growth,
unemployment (particularly in Upper Silesia) is not excessive which has helped facilitate the



36
absorption of miners into other industries or services. Local governments are strong enough
that the transfer of social assets such as schools and hospitals has taken place in an orderly
manner in Poland.
121. EU Accession. Poland has already started negotiations to join the EU as part of the first
group of Central European Countries invited to join. EU accession provides a significant
impetus for state enterprise restructuring, notably in coal and steel, as both industries will have
to be able to operate competitively in the EU market environment. Social support mechanisms
are well established and have been functioning satisfactorily, including programs developed
with the support of the Bank's Employment Promotion and Social Services Project. All these
factors suggest that a much more favorable environment for successful implementation of the
Program is prevailing in Poland.
PART V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
122. Benefits. The Program and by implication the SECAL 2 would have a number of
important benefits for Poland, for the region, for the mining companies and the miners as
outlined in Section III H.. From the point of view of society, the immediate beneficiaries of the
Program, and the SECAL 2, would be the miners and their immediate dependents. In addition,
the population of the mining regions would benefit from continued social peace and
employment opportunities, while increasingly enjoying a cleaner environment. Successful
implementation will help continue to reduce the losses of the coal companies, enable the
industry to pay its way with Government and turn a money losing state controlled sector into a
competitive and profitable private industry. This will not only reduce the drain on the budget
but also help strengthen Poland's capacity to compete within the EU. Even if profitability takes
longer to achieve than forecast, losses will be much lower with the Program than without the
Program. In addition, it could well become a model for the reform of other sectors. The Polish
people will benefit through improved economic performance and an assurance that their tax
payments are being applied to constructive needs rather than to propping up a loss-making
industry.
123. Risks.   The SECAL 2 operation is considered a medium to high risk operation.
Experience around the world demonstrates that coal sector restructuring is an inherently
difficult task, but the experience to date in Poland is promising.  The Government is
successfully implementing the employment and capacity aspects of the Program and responded
well to make coffections to the Program when the financial performance did not improve. The
Government has recently taken new initiatives to assist workers leaving the industry including
measures to support new job creation. There has also been considerable inter- ministerial co-
operation in revising and implementing the Program. But the industry is a price taker - both in
the domestic and international markets, and as discussed in the risks section for the Program
(Section 111.1), there remains the following critical risks:
* the industry may not be able to become profitable;
* the targets for employment restructuring may not be reached;
* environmental performance may be restrained by a lack of funding; and
poor financial performance may be a barrier to privatization.

POLAND
HARD COAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING
LETTER OF SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY
L     Introduction
The Government of Poland is implementing a comprehensive Hard Coal Sector Restructuring
Progran. This Program was approved by the Council of Ministers on June 30, 1998. The
Program is designed to reduce the capacity, employment, cost and environmental problems of
the sector and improve the financial performance of the sector so that it becomes profitable and
can be privatized. Implementation of the Program is supported by the Enabling Law on
Adjusting the Hard Coal Mining Sector to Functioning Under Conditions of Market Economy
and on Specific Privileges and Tasks of Mining Communes, that was ratified by the Parliament
and signed by the President on December 29, 1998 and by an amendment to the law dated
December 15, 2000 (state its name) that was ratified by the Parliament and signed by the
President on January23, 2001. The Program was revised in late 1999 in response to a drop in
coal demand and prices in 1999 below that projected in the original Program. The Revised
Program, which was approved on December 21, 1999, introduced changes to compensate for
reduced revenues by further reduction in costs, and further reduction in employment and
production capacity.
IL    Objectives for Coal Sector Reform
Specific objectives of the program include the following:
Profitability: Coal companies should generate surpluses from coal operations as of the
year 2001 and make a profits in year 2002. This is to be achieved through:
- Employment Restructuring: The level of employment in the coal mining sector will be
reduced by about 110,000 and will be about 133,000 employees by the end of 2002;
- Capacity Restructuring: Mining companies will reduce the production capacity of the
coal mining sector by approximately 36 million tons of annual production by the year
2002, after which capacity will be about 100 million tons of annual production;
- Financial Restructuring: Mining companies will have the opportunity to write off in
whole or in part and reschedule a significant portion of their overdue financial
liabilities to the state and to environmental funds according provisions of the Enabling
Law;
- Mining Sector Organizational Changes: a Mine Restructuring Company (MRC) was
established to take over and liquidate mines under closure in a more effective manner.
- Cost Reduction: Mining companies have introduced cost reduction measures in the
key cost categories with the result that costs per ton of production have declined by
about 12.2% in nominal terms and 25.6% in real terms from 1998 - 2000
-  Cash Management Plans: Mning companies will produce detailed monthly cash
management plans which will be the basis for operational decisions and discussions
with creditors.



40
* Environmental Improvements: Mining companies will improve their environmental
management practices by preparing and implementing mine by mine environmental action
plans so that the sector will have enviromnentally sustainable performance and meet
environmental protection standards by year 2005; and
* Privatization: The privatization process has started with the preparation of the Budryk
and Bogdanka mines for privatization. The Government has undertaken a Sector
Privatization Assessment (SPA) study to analyze possibilities for privatization of the entire
coal sector. The study was completed in January 2001. The Ministry of Economy has
developed a comprehensive Privatization Strategy Framework Paper, which has been
endorsed by the IMCSC and adopted by the management of the Ministry of Economy,
prior to consultations with social partners. Privatization of entire mining companies will
be undertaken in accordance with the strategy.
IIL   Policy Framework and Reform Program
(a)   Free Trade and Prices
The Government is committed to maintaining free prices and free trade for coal. Subsidies from
Govermment are not used to support commercial operations but may be provided to finance the
physical closure of mines and reduction in employment under the structured program of
reforrn, and according to generally applicable rules, for certain environmental investments.
(b)   Employment Restructuring
The Government is committed to socially responsible employment restructuring in the coal
mines based on voluntary redundancies. Underground workers who leave are eligible for
temporary income support, through a specially designed Miners Social Package (MSP) which
provides (i) miner leaves, for those eligible for retirement within 5 years; (ii) social allowances
or (iii) lump sum cash severance payments, for those not eligible for retirement within 5 years.
In addition, surface workers ineligible for the Miners Social Packages are entitled to payment
of unemployment benefits under the Employmnent Law plus a one time payment of 3.6 months
wages. For year 2001, EU Phare made avadable some additional funds for redeployment
payments which comprise of a up to 12 month training benefit paid to a surface miner willing
to leave the sector. This package is paid in addition to the 3.6 month wage benefit and is
meant to stimulate more surface workers to leave. MSP's will be offered as first priority to
rminers at (i) mines being closed or where production is being terminated and (ii) at mines
which will provide workplaces for miners from mines completely liquidated.
It is estimated that about 110,000 workers will leave the sector between 1998-2002, out of
which about 74,000 will use the MSP's, and another 36,000 will leave though normal attrition.
The use of the MSP's in 1998 was more than double the expected rate. This trend produced a
shortfall in the 1998 budget and additional funds were made available through the Ministry of
Labor and Social Policy. The use of MSP's in 1999 also exceeded the projections of the
Program. Employment was reduced by 88,272 (to 155,032) at end December 2000. The
reduction in employment consists of 33,176 (about 36%) miners leave; 28,646 (about 32%)



41
lump sum packages; 372 (less than 1%) social allowances; and 32,879 (about 37%) natural
attrition and others.
Progress of employment restructuring has slowed sharply in 2000, when only about 18,600
workers left the industry compared with a Revised Program estimate of 28,000. The
slowdown was not due to lack of funding (not all of the available budget funds were used this
year) nor to institutional problems (there are no complaints relating to miners not being paid or
long delays in receiving payments) but instead to a deterioration in the Upper Silesian
employment market (where unemployment has increased from about 6% at the start of the
program to 13.7% at present, and a general perception, on the part of the miners and
employers, that the miners lack suitable skills for employment outside the sector.
The Government is committed to ensuring that the Program objectives for employment
restructuring are achieved. The mining companies report greater interest on the part of surface
workers to leave the industry than underground workers A Year 2001 Employment
Restructuring Plan has been prepared which includes specific measures to reduce
administrative staff and surface worker positions. According to the Plan, the employment in the
sector will go down by about 12,000 workers in 2001 from about 155,000 to 143,700 workers
at end year 2001. The government has prepared a Year 2001 Employment Support Plan of
other measures including active employment interventions (such as counseling and labor
exchange activities that reduce frictional derivative unemployment), and activities to support
private sector job creation ( such as business counseling, and micro enterprise loans) to support
regional development in Upper Silesia to improve the employment prospects for miners taking
a MSP and leaving the industry. The effectiveness of these measures will be evaluated at the
end of Year 2001 and taken into account in preparing the Year 2002 Employment
Restructuring and Employment Support Plans.
(c)   Mine Capacity Restructuring
According to the Program, the mining companies will close about 36 million tons of annual
production capacity by the end of 2002 which has been identified in the mining company
business plans. Further details are given in the attached Table 1. In case the domestic coal
market declines more than anticipated, the mining companies' business and operating plans
may be adjusted accordingly. By the end of Year 2000 production has been terminated at 12
mines and 9 parts of mines with annual production capacity of 18,4 million tons per year. 15
mines have been fully liquidated (Pstrowski, Paryz, Siemianowice, Zory, and ZWP Antracytu,
Walbrzyskie, Morcinek, Porabka-Klimont6w, Saturn, Grodziec, Sosnowiec, Gliwice, Niwka-
Morzejow, ZG Rozalia, and Siersza) and liquidation is taking place at another 7 mines (Nowa
Ruda, Debiensko, ZG Wojkowice, Andaluza (Brzeziny), ZG Jadwiga, Powstancow Slaskich
(Bytom I) and Jan Kanty, which will be fully liquidated by end of June 2002 and Andaluza
(Brzeziny) by end of 2002. The Revised Programn also includes irreversible closure of 10
million tons per year production capacity in underground mining faces and areas of mines. At
the end of year 2000, about 26 million ton per year of production capacity was closed in total,
by both closure of whole mines as well as mining faces and mine levels. According to Year
2001 Capacity Closure Plan, additional 6.85 million ton per year of capacity will be closed in
2001, so that total capacity closed at year end 2001 will be about 33 million ton per year. A
Study is to be undertaken of the Incidence of Subsidence and future mine closure decisions will
take into account the full economic costs of subsidence due to mine operations.



42
According to the Revised Program the Government established a Mine Restructuring Company
(MRC) in September 2000, to undertake the liquidation of hard coal mines that have ended
coal extraction. The main goal of creating the MRC is to separate liquidation processes of
mines that have ended extraction from rehabilitation processes carried out in other mines.
MRC will have a time bound existence of about four years following which its role will be
limited mainly to mine water pumping activities. Expected benefits include a) more effective
liquidation of mines, mainly by lowering the costs of liquidation and shortening the time of
liquidation of mines, b) rational utilization of budgetary funds to properly and economically
carry out liquidation of mines, c) maximum utilization of assets of liquidated mines. The MRC
will make maximum use of the property of the liquidated mines and be responsible for the
creation of new jobs on the basis of this property. Procedures have been established for the
timely transfer to MRC of assets and liabilities of mines to be liquidated The activities of the
MRC will be financed from State budget funds and from the sales of assets at mines being
liquidated.
(d)   Financial Restructuring of Mining Companies
According to the Act of 26 November 1998 on the Adjustment of Hard Coal Mining to
Operation in Market Economy Conditions and the Special Rights and Obligations of Mining
Gminas and the Act of 15 December 2000 on the Amendment of the Act of November 26,
1998 liabilities of coal companies towards the following are subject to restructuring:
1) the state budget - with the exception of liabilities arising from:
a) withholding of personal income tax,
b) installments of loans for building mines, guaranteed by the Minister of Finance in the
name of the State Treasury, with interest,
2) the Social Insurance Agency (ZUS), the Labor Fund and the Guaranteed Employee
Benefits Fund - from contributions due,
3) the State Fund for Rehabilitation of People with Disabilities - from payments due,
4) the National Environmental Protection and Water Management Fund and voivodship
environmental protection and water management funds - from fees and fines due, in the
part concerning these funds,
5) the gmina - from fees and fines due to the gmina.
According to this Act, the principal liabilities with interest occurred before 1 April 1998
towards the state budget (with the exception of VAT), ZUS, the Labor Fund, the Guaranteed
Employee Benefits Fund, the State Fund for Rehabilitation of People with Disabilities and the
National Environmental Protection and Water Management Fund (fees and fines for discharges
of saline mining waters into surface waters) will be totally cancelled. Furthermore, there will
be cancellation of interest on principal liabilities from the tax on goods and services and from
other liabilities concerning environmental protection with the exception of those specified
above. Principal liabilities not cancelled, incurred before 1 April 1998 from the tax on goods
and services, shall be deferred until 31 December 2005, then repaid within a time not longer
than 5 years. Principal liabilities with interest from fees and fines due to gminas shall be
deferred until the end of 2002, then repaid in equal quarterly installments until 2007. There
exists an option (on the consent of the creditor) of changing all or part of the liabilities into
shares of the debtor.



43
In the case of totally liquidated mines taken over by the Mine Restructuring Company,
from the day of acquisition the following liabilities with interest are cancelled:
1) occurred before I January 1999, towards the Social Insurance Agency - from social
insurance,
2) occurred before 1 January 2000, towards:
a) the state budget - from the tax on goods and services,
b) the Labor Fund and the Guaranteed Employee Benefits Fund - from contributions due,
c) the State Fund for Rehabilitation of People with Disabilities - from payments due,
d) the National Environmental Protection and Water Management Fund and the
voivodship environmental protection and water management funds - from fees and
fines in the parts concerning these funds,
e) the gmina - from fees and fines due to the gmina.
Liabilities occurred after 31 March 1998 and before 31 December 2002 may be settled
by the coal companies under principles defined in agreements concluded with the creditors.
Restructuring of these liabilities may consist of cancellation, deferment or spreading out their
repayment over a time not longer than 5 years except for liabilities to ZUS.
The Act does not allow for cancellation of principal liabilities with interest from the tax
on goods and services and from fees and fines due to gminas. These liabilities may be the
subject of settlements only as regards the time and conditions of repayment.
As regards liabilities to ZUS occurred from 1 April 1998 to 31 December 1998, the Act
also allows for the possibility of canceling them. The Act envisages current settlement of ZUS
from 1 January 1999. The Act of 15 December 2000 introduced - in the case of inability to
settle current ZUS liabilities - their settlement under the principles defined in agreements with
creditors.
The grounds for carrying out debt reduction proceedings are that the coal companies
flulfill a number of conditions, described in art. 8 para. 2 of the enabling law. These include not
overstepping the growth of average monthly wage and timely settlement from 1 January 1999
of current liabilities to ZUS (with the option introduced by the Act of 15 December 2000) from
Social insurance, Labor Fund and the Guaranteed Employee Benefits Fund. In the case when
the coal companies do not fulfill any of the statutory conditions (according to art. 8 para. 2),
the debt reduction procedure is cancelled. The decision on cancellation is taken by the Minister
competent for Economy in consultation with the ministers competent for environment, public
finance and the State Treasury.
During 1998 and 1999 the companies were only able to make 64% and 70% on
aggregate for payments due to the Social Security Authority (ZUS) and due to the tax
authority of Value Added Taxes (VAT) and personal income taxes (PIT4). In order to
improve the situation, the mining companies have been working closely with the tax authorities
and providing them with regular (Monthly/quarterly?) cash management plans and payment
schedules. Mining companies are also selling or transferring non core assets in order to pay
their ZUS and tax obligations. The mining companies Year 2001 operational and cash
management plans indicate that, on an aggregate basis and net of any mining company funds
used to make MSP payments, they will be able to pay the charges due for ZUS, VAT and PIT
for their 2001 operations. For Year 2002 mining company preliminary cash management plans



44
indicate that they will be able to pay all environmental charges, taxes and fees due for their
2002 operations. The Govermnent intends to hold the mining companies to this hard budget
constraint in the future and will carefully monitor the cash management activities of the mining
companies to ensure that meeting the hard budget constraint is not accomplished by the
increase of arrears to suppliers or banks.
(e)   Improving Environmental Performance
The Government is committed to ensuring that the mining companies improve the
environmental performance of the sector and comply with environmental standard by 2005. A
Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been carried out, which has helped to establish
environmental priorities in the sector, identify appropriate mitigation measures, provide an
estimate of the costs needed to implement such measures and establish a timetable for
implementation for year 2000-2001. Each individual company will set out its environmental
priorities and mitigation measures and the costs and schedule for implementation, as well as the
targeted reduction of fees for environmental discharges. To address the above issues and reach
compliance with environmental protection standards by Year 2005, the Government has
undertaken to prepare mine by mine five year (2001-2005) environmental action plans (EAPs).
These plans will have been completed by end year 2001. The seven mine holding companies
have each prepared Year 2001 operating plans include environmental action plans (EAPs)
based on the results of the SEA and which identify: (a) the priority environmental mitigation
measures, (b) the associated cost and sources(s) of financing, (c) the reduction where
appropriate in environmental fees to be expected from implementing the measure and (d) the
schedule for its implementation. The Year 2001 Operating Plans include mine by mine
environmental action plans which have been presented to and endorsed by the Ministry of
Environment. In addition the Government is committed to ensuring that mining companies
implement saline water discharge continuous monitoring systems in accordance with the
findings and recommendations of the SEA extension study. The work of the SEA is being
extended so that the five year mine by mine EAPs can be finalized. It is expected that the
mining companies will spend at least PLN 100 million annually on environmental protection.
The SEA examined the issue of saline water discharge and identified least cost options for
addressing the problems of saline water discharge. Rather than investing public funds in large
desalination plants, the SEA identified less costly options as equally if not more effective. Such
options include selective mining techniques, limiting production at miines with the highest saline
water release, building underground dams to seal closed workings and re-injection of saline
water and re-directing the flow of saline water into underground sedimentation reservoirs
where salt can be precipitated and the water cleaned for release. The findings of the SEA will
be the basis for decisions regarding saLine water improvements and investments at NSW. The
SEA NSW Saline Water Study (SWS) examined also the adequacy of present level of fees for
saline water discharges.  The results of the SWS have been verified by a Committee for
Environmental Impact Assessment and the MoEN is considering actions related to the
adequacy of presently applied level of fees. Following the SEA, a study is to be undertaken to
examine the present and future operation of the Debiensko Saline Water plant to see if it
provides a least cost approach given that some of the mines using the plant are being closed.
According to rules that apply to environmental investments across all sectors, part of the
financing for needed environmental investments may be available from the National Fund, the
BOS Bank and other financial institutions to carry out the environmental protection measures



45
envisaged to be undertaken in the business plans. The Government will require that any mining
company applying for such funding will be able to demonstrate improvements in financial
perfonnance as well as a sound environmental management program. Finally, the Government
is committed to vigorous enforcement of the environmental fees and fines after year 2002.
(f)    Privatization
The Government is committed to undertake privatization of the hard coal mining sector as the
final step in the coal reform process. Two mines are currently being prepared for privatization
(Bogdanka and Budryk). A public invitation for expressions of interest to privatize Bogdanka
was announced in the press in late Year 2000. Four expressions of interest were received and
due diligence work is now taking place. Preparation of the Information Memorandum is well
advanced for Budryk; privatization of Bogdanka should be completed by year end 2001. With
regard to the mining companies, a Sector Privatization Assessment (SPA) has been prepared.
The results of the SPA have been presented to the Inter -Ministerial Coal Steering Committee
(IMCSC). The Ministry of Economy as shareholder has prepared a privatization strategy
framework for the sector, and the Minister of State Treasury (MoST) will be responsible for
implementing the privatization transactions. The strategy addresses a number of important
issues including: the preferred method of privatization transaction, and privatization sequencing
with specific milestones and timetable. The strategy framework analyzes and demonstrates the
economic and financial situation of all mines and mining companies in the sector as of the end
of the present Reform Program, when the process of employment restructuring, capacity
closure and financial restructuring will have been completed under the provisions of the current
Program. The strategy framework recognizes the need for the Government to consider
whether additional financial restructuring and other restructuring measures are needed
following completion of the current Program in 2002 in order to implement the privatization.
The strategy framework also considers conditions for resolving the problem of environmental
and health liabilities which could become an obstacle for implementation of privatization of the
coal sector. Based on detailed analysis of historical economic and financial performance of
each mine as well as taking into account the value of its coal reserves, potential future liabilities
and potential for generating cash, the strategy framework proposes a size of the coal sector to
be privatized. The strategy takes into account the present interest of some power generation
companies in acquiring some individual mines and the document also proposes what the
Government plans to do with the remainder of the industry so that the proposed arrangements
do not prevent privatization of the viable mines. The strategy has been endorsed by the
Steering Committee and adopted by the Minister of Economy. The Government is now
undertaking a process of consultation with its social partners in order to build the political and
social consensus needed to be able to implement the privatization of the sector and to address
the issues noted above.
(g)   Social Support to Communities
The law dated November 26, 1998 provides for the mining companies to co-operate with the
mining communes to transfer (either giving or selling) remaining non-core assets to local
authorities. This will allow company management to concentrate on coal production. The
Government is committed to assisting affected mining gminas in the creation of jobs,
improvement of infrastructure, as well as restructuring the transferred non-core assets.



46
(h)   Social Monitoring
The Government has established a social monitoring program that includes extensive
monitoring over the next several years including: (a) labor market/economic trend surveys
every few months, (b) displaced miner follow-up surveys every few months, (c) regular
reporting of social assistance and unemployment data, and (d) regular monitoring of divested
social assets to ensure essential social services are being maintained. Imnprovements have been
made to follow up survey questionnaire regarding ex-miners' welfare to better understand the
impact of the current economic situation on the labor market.
IV.   Implementation Arrangements
(a)   Enabling Law and Regulations
The enabling law underpinning the program was signed by the President on December 29,
1998 and became effective on January 14, 1999. Revisions to the Enabling Law, as per the
corrected Program, were signed by the President on January 23, 2001 and became effective on
February 8, 2001. Other regulations relate to Defining the Eligibility of Companies for
Subsidies; Subsidies for Physical Mine Liquidation; Subsidies for Employment Restructuring;
Loans to Mining Gminas, Establishment of the Mine Liquidation Fund and Payment of Money
Equivalent for Coal Allowance.
(b)   Administration, Oversight, Coordination and Monitoring
The Goverunent is actively supervising the implementation of the program of hard coal mining
reform. In accordance with the Act of 26 November 1998 on the Adjustment of Hard Coal
Mining Sector to Functioning Under Conditions of Market Economy and Specific Privileges
and Tasks of Mining Communes, direct supervision of implementation of the reform is
performed by the Minister of Economy. The Prime Minister, at the request of the Minister of
Economy, on 29 January 1999 appointed the Inter Ministerial Coal Steering Committee
(IMCSC), whose tasks include supervising the course of the reform and performing advisory
functions for the Minister of Economy. In accordance with the needs of the Steering
Committee, specialist advisory working groups may be appointed.
From 1998 the Government has also been pursuing an active information policy addressed to
the wide public opinion, concerning the effects and results of implementation of mining reform.
Monitoring of the reform is also carried out on a broad scale. At the request of the Minister of
Economy, beginning with 1999 the State Agency for Restructuring Hard Coal Mining conducts
monthly monitoring of implementation of mining reform in all its aspects, in this especially in
the attained economic and financial results, employment restructuring and liquidation of mines.
The monitoring comprises a total of 30 detailed studies.
Aggregate results of the implementation of hard coal mining reform are presented each month
for deliberation to the Steering Committee.



47
Moreover, the Minister of Economy presents to the Economic Committee of the Council of
Ministers information on implementation of the reform each quarter, and at the end of the year
submits an annual report to the Council of Ministers.
(c)   Improvement of Corporate Governance of the Mining Companies
The Government is committed to providing the framework for the mining companies to
operate in an independent, autonomous and increasingly competitive manner. Under the
correction to the Program a Mine Restructuring Company (MRC) was established and the
number of operating mines was reduced from 57 at the end of 1997 to 42 operating mines at
the end of 2000. MRC will concentrate on efficient closure of uneconomic mines and
restructuring activities. The use of management contracts with performance criteria regarding
improving the coal industry financial and economic situation has helped improve management
performance. Annual operating plans are prepared by each mining company. These operating
plans show improved financial performance, and profitability from operation in year 2001,
timely and cost efficient mine closures, adequate labor restructuring, priority environmental
remediation, and implementation of some financial restructuring. The Minister of Economy
(the shareholder) has approved the year 2001 operating plans.
Management boards have been appointed for the coal holding companies on a competitive
basis. New managerial contracts were designed to motivate managers through incentives and
hold them responsible to implement their approved business plans and to achieve targets
included in the plans. Remuneration of the management board is linked to certain performance
indicators including financial results of the company, cost reduction and improved
environmental performance. If management fails to implement their company's business plan
or achieve the targets, such management may be dismissed. Supervisory Boards, with one
member delegated to supervise the management boards performance, were appointed for each
mining company following a competitive process.
V.   Amount, Structure and Mechanisms of State Support
The cost of the program for 1999 - 2002 is estimated at about PLN 16.2 billion, of which PLN
7.2 billion will be provided from the state budget in the form of cash subsidy among other
things for employment restructuring and liquidation of mines, whereas PLN 9.0 billion will
cover debt cancellations (in this cancellation of debts totaling PLN 2.1 billion is conditioned on
the decision of creditors). Afler 2002 further payments from the budget will be required for
carryover costs of previously granted miners leaves MSPs.
In addition, coal companies are covering from their own funds part of the costs related to
employment restructuring and costs concerning total and partial liquidation of mines, as well as
the costs of liquidation of specific underground sections and levels.
In the state budget for 2001 financial resources totaling PLN 1.4 billion have been apportioned
for implementation of mining reform. For 2002 it is expected that a minimum of PLN 1.33
billion will be spent from the state budget on implementation of mining reform, which should
cover the costs related to employment restructuring and liquidation of production capacity
projected for that year. State budget funds will not be used for investment in desalination plant
unless endorsed by Ministry of Environment as the most economical method of desalination.



48
The financial resources from the state budget for implementation of the reform  are
administered by the Minister of Economy. They are made available at the request of an eligible
mining enterprise or a mining works enterprise. In accordance with the agreements concluded
for the given year by the Minister of Economy with the eligible applicants, resources from the
state budget are appropriated solely for the tasks defined in the Act of 26 November 1998 on
the Adjustment of Hard Coal Mining Sector to Functioning Under Conditions of Market
Economy and on Specific Privileges and Tasks of Mining Communes, in this for employment
restructuring, liquidation of mines and the creation of new work places. They are transmitted
to mining enterprises and mining works enterprises into separate bank accounts.
Moreover, from 1999 it has been adopted that every half a year an audit is carried out by
independent auditors, of the correctness of utilization of budgetary funds by mining enterprises
and mining works enterprises.

POLAND
SECOND HARD COAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Social Aspects of The Reform Program
Overview
As is often the case in the latter stages of restructuring, it will be increasingly difficult to encourage employees
to voluntarily leave the mining sector. Clearly, those with the best prospects are inclined to leave first. Many
of those who have accepted the Mining Social Package (MSP) claim that their standard of living has
deteriorated and this will not serve as an enticing example to those who remain in the industry. Those who
remain do not generally have the skills and abilities that are in demand and employers express a bias against
hiring miners. Furthermore, there are indications that the overall employment levels in the Silesia region are
declining. Polish authorities are rightly exploring new methods to encourage miners to leave the industry and
at the same to create employment opportunities to absorb surplus labor.
The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy has implemented a social monitoring process based on three broad
sources of information: biannual tracer surveys of ex-miners, biannual labor market surveys of the Upper
Silesia region, and quarterly reporting of unemployment trends based on data from labor and social welfare
offices. This report will provide a brief summary of the various social monitoring reports and will comment
on the Government of Poland's labor redeployment efforts for ex-miners. 7
Labor Market
Unemployment in the Silesia region is on the rise. Labor market trends in Silesia mirror those observed
nation-wide, although unemployment in the Silesia region has increased at a somewhat faster pace than in the
rest of the country. In particular, in the Silesia region the unemployment rate has increased by 1.7 percentage
points over one year (Ql 2001 to Q1 2000), compared with 1.5 percentage points nation-wide.'
Unemployment in the Silesia region is slightly higher than the national average. The most recent labor
market survey provides unemployment data which is quite different than the unemployment data based on the
number of registered unemployed. The labor force survey (generally considered as a more accurate indicator
in comparison to the unemployment register) indicates that the unemployment rate in the Silesia region is
18.6% (as of Ql 2001), whereas the unemployment register indicates that the unemployment rate is 13.9%.
More significantly, the labor force survey indicates that the unemployment rate in the Silesia Region is
slightly higher than the national average of 18.2%. Up until receipt of this labor force survey, the assumption
was that employment conditions in Silesia were more buoyant than the rest of the country.
The high unemployment rate in the Silesia region reflects higher than the average unemployment among
women, while unemployment among men is below the average. The gap between female and male
unemployment rate is quite substantial (over 5 percentage points). Specifically, in Silesia the unemployment
rate for women is 21.5%, compared with 16.3% for men. This male/female unemployment gap in the Silesia
region is much more pronounced than in the rest of the country (17.0% and 19.8% , respectively). This high

57
unemployment rate among women in Silesia is likely to reflect an increase in female labor supply in the wake
of mass lay-offs in the male dominated industries, including the coal mining industry.
Although unemployment in the Silesia region is high and rising, the share of miners in total unemployment is
rather small, and - despite the continuing restructuring which the sector is undergoing - declining. Currently,
ex-miners account for 3.1% of all registered unemployed, down from some 4-5 percent observed in earlier
periods. This is a noteworthy fact, as miners who benefited from the MSP are eligible to register at the
Employment Office and receive appropriate benefits.
The Silesia region is characterized by a low level of job creation. The labor market survey indicates that
the rate of job creation in Silesia is very low (1.7%), substantially lower than national average (around 5%).
The rate of job destruction is at a modest level (7.5%), somewhat below the national average (around 9%)
In most voivodships in Poland job destruction exceeds job creation, which implies a decline in employment.
However, in Silesia the decline in employment is stronger because of low job creation (which is lower than in
most other parts of the country), not because of an unusually high job destruction (which is close to the
national average).  This seems counterintuitive, as one would have assumed that a region undergoing an
intense industrial restructuring is characterized by exceptionally high job destruction, which apparently is not
the case. The main problem of Silesian labor market is poor job creation.
One could argue that Silesia's strategy which attempts to avoid increased unemployment by delaying job
destruction is self-defeating. Job creation requires job destruction in the first place, so that labor resources can
flow to new jobs. Stopping job destruction has only delayed this process and, as a result, Silesia is seeing a
belated increase in unemployment. This is an unfortunate development for a region that has so much going
for it. I
The Experience of Those Who Left the Industry
Most have withdrawn from the labor market and those who have not withdrawn are far more likely to
be unemployed than the general population. Tracer surveys'o of underground and surface mine workers
who accepted the MSP during the period indicate that about 60% have withdrawn from the labor market. This
is not surprising given that about one third of those leaving the industry have reached retirement age and an
additional one third have accepted Miners' Leave which is an option available to workers within 5 years of
retirement.
The unemployment rate (actively seeking employment) for ex-miners who have most recently left the industry
is very high, around 60%, but this is an improvement from 6 months earlier. The unemployment rate in June
for those who left during the period October 1999 to March 2000 is estimated to as high as 73%. The
employment prospects for this group also improved with unemployment dropping to 64%.  The
unemployment rate of those ex-miners who accepted the unconditional lump-sum severance payment (the
option where participants are most likely to seek employment) has dropped to 52% in November 2000 from
66% in June 2000 and the employment rate of this group has increased to 40% in November from 24% in
June."]
The majority of recent ex-miners who have not fully withdrawn from the labor market are unemployed
(approximately 60% in comparison to the national average of 18.2%). Furthermore, there are some
indications that the employment prospects for recent ex-miners are getting worse in that an earlier study
9 Carlos Cavalcanti, Sr. Country Economist (internal correspondence dated February 20, 2001').
10 The surveys focus on the 6,448 ex-miners who made use of MSP benefits in the period October 1, 1999 to March 31, 2000. Of this
amount, 3,624 collected one-time unconditional severance, 2,793 went on miners leave and 71 collected social allowance. The survey
was completed in June 2000 and the sample size was 631 persons (75.5% response rate).
' l   These statistics should be accepted with caution given that the small size of the sample.



58
carried out in 1998 indicated that 54.4% of severance pay recipients found work, in comparison to recent ex-
miners where only 20.3% of severance pay recipients found work.
The first wave of redundant miners (those who left the industry from late 1999 to early 2000) is doing
modestly well on the labor market. Nearly one-half (46%) of this cohort has found a job within the period of
12 to 18 months.'2 However, a substantial fraction (30%) is still unemployed, or out of the labor force (24%).
These figures imply an unemployment rate of about 39%. The labor market status of those miners who left
the industry later is worse. For example, among miners who left the industry recently (from late 2000 through
early 2001) and thus whose job search duration has been relatively short (a few months), only about one-
fourth (26%) has found work, while as much as 40% are unemployed and 35% are not looking for a job.
Fortunately, in many cases finding a new job is a matter of time and active job search. For instance, the
proportion of the second cohort of displaced miners13 who are employed increased from 24% to 35% within 6
months. During the same period, the proportion of those out of the labor force decreased from 38% to 27%.
The proportion of those unemployed remained stable, however, in part reflecting the fact that those who were
out of the labor force decided to enter the labor market.
Of course there will always be some who are working unofficially. It is difficult to make accurate estimates of
this so called gray economy but the contractor who completed the tracer surveys estimates that it amounts to
about 17 to 20% of all miners who accepted the social package. Those working unofficially are probably
most prevalent amongst those on Miners' Leave where the leave benefit is reduced if the person is working.
A majority of ex-miners claim their standard of living has deteriorated.
Given that the majority of ex-miners are not working, it is not surprising that the tracer surveys of recent ex-
mines would indicate a deterioration in their standard of living.

Improvement        7%                  10%                 16.3%
Of particular notice, is the worsening position of those who left the mining industry between October 1999
and March 2000. Shortly after leaving the mining industry, 56% indicated that their standard of living has
deteriorated. A half year later, significantly more, some 66.9% indicate that their standard of living has
deteriorated. At the same time, there is an increasing number (albeit at a smaller scale) of individuals
reporting an improvement in their standard of living upon leaving the mining industry. This trend has
continued with 38% of most recent ex-miners stating that there was no change in their standard of living.
Those who found jobs faired better whereby 33% indicated that their new job pays less than their mining job,
10% indicate that their new job pays more and the rest indicate that their new job has the same level of pay. 14
It should be noted, however, that wages in the mining industry have traditionally been significantly higher
than in the rest of the economy. In this context, the fact that over half of miners who found a job maintained
or improved their wage level is quite encouraging.

It is difficult to take the estimates of the family income of ex-miners at face value because they are only based
on self-assessments and they do not take into account possible income streams from the lump-sum severance
payments. However, what they are officially reporting is of concern because as they exhaust income from
their severance payments, it is possible that many could become eligible for social assistance.
The most prevalent use of lump-sum severance was for investments generating income. Based on those
who left the mining industry between October 1999 and March 2000, more than 50% used all or part of the
money obtained from the lump-sum severance for investments generating income (investment in a firm,
purchase of stocks, bonds or bank deposits), 28% used all or part of their money for investments that do not
generate income (to buy, build, renovate and apartment or house or for their children) and 14.3% used the
entire sum for consumption. Analysis indicates that the higher the household income, the more likely the
lump-sum will be used for investments and the less likely the funds will be used only for consumption.
A comparison of the manner of utilizing funds from the unconditional severance pay by respondents leaving
most recently shows an unfavorable way cash funds were spent. Respondents polled in November 2001 more
frequently used the funds for immediate needs (14.4% more respondents), and less often invested in
immovable property (10.2% less respondents), business activity (1.9% less) or bank deposits, stocks or bonds
(12.6% less respondents).
Those who found work were most likely to find it where the jobs required strictly physical work. More
than 50% of recent ex-miners found work in what can be described as strictly physical work and
approximately 30% claim to have found employment in a non-physical capacity. The remaining 20% had
both physical and non-physical aspects. In 18% of cases getting a job required changing occupations and in
about 30% of cases it required some training or upgrading of skills. The vast majority of recent ex-miners
who are working found a job in the private sector, usually in a small or medium size firm. Most of the
employed ex-miners work in the following areas: 25% in services, 24% in trade, 13% in construction, 10% in
manufacturing and 10% in transportation. 15
The profile of recent ex-miners who found work is slightly different than those who are not working
(including both those who have withdrawn from the labor market and those who are unemployed-actively
seeking employment). Approximately 35% of those who found work had secondary education as opposed to
15 Based on those who left the industry between November 1999 and March 2000. The situation is about the same for those who left
more recently.

22% of those who are not working. Those who found work are also younger than those who are not working
(but data was not provided as to how much younger). Of those who found work 96% were men and in the
group that was not working, 90% were men. For the most part this reflects the fact that virtually all MSP
recipients were men but it also indicates that women were somewhat less successful in finding employment.
On average, the job search duration was 3 months. About 20% of the currently employed found a new job
after less than one month since the termination of the mining job and for 18% of ex-miners it took 5 to 7
months to find a job. The most popular job search method was using the help of friends and relatives (20%)
and the specially established Miner Labor Offices were used by 15% of respondents. The assessment of the
performance of these offices was polarized: one-third of respondents said they were helpful in finding a job
and another one-third said that they were not (the rest had no opinion). Those that were critical of the labor
offices indicated that they did not have enough job offers available nor enough spaces in training courses. (It
is interesting that the point of view of the staff of at least one labor office, is that they have been successful in
finding job offers for ex-miners but these are often turned down because the salaries offered are lower than
what they received while in the mining industry.)
An interesting sub-group of those who found jobs (with very positive ramifications) are the 23% who are self-
employed. Almost all of these individuals who are owners or co-owners took the lump-sum severance and
indications are that these funds had an activating role in starting the businesses. The types of businesses
established include: wholesale and retailing trade, individual transport and services, crafts, food catering,
construction and manufacturing. In almost all cases the number of workers in the businesses created is less
than 5, but there are 4 cases where the new firms employ more than 5 people. The new jobs created by these
businesses are perhaps equal to the total number of jobs found by the other ex-miners. The fact that at least
some ex-miners were able to start their own business is a very positive development and this may have had a
significant impact on the local economy.
Few miners say that the decision to leave the mine was a mistake. Roughly half of the ex-miners consider
their decision to leave the mining industry as the right one and this figure has remained relatively constant.
With respect to those who have left earlier, an increasing number are becoming dissatisfied with their decision
to leave.

Prospects for Miners Who Leave the Industry in the Future
There is declining interest in accepting the MSP, particularly for lump-sum severance. Indications are that
it is going to be increasingly difficult to encourage people to leave the mining industry. At one point
employment reductions were ahead of schedule and now they have fallen behind. Furthermore, Miners Leave
has overtaken lump-sum severance as the most popular option. This means that the people are becoming even
more interested in early retirement as opposed to finding new employment. Or, if they are planning to work,
they will be more inclined to work in the gray economy.
Reductions in employment are expected to exceed additions. In the surveyed firms, in the period from 1998
- 2001 the total number of employed persons gradually declined. The negative employment balance will



61
mainly be the effect of dismissals in hard coal mines and in electricity, water and gas supply. The number of
expected reductions, however, is less than the reductions that took place in the first half of the year. More
than half of the managers admit that they have employment surpluses, and the most often applied method of
resolving these problems by the firms is to dismiss workers. A reduction of employment is planned mainly by
the managers of large firms, with more than 250 employees. The smaller the firn, the less frequent the cases
of planned dismissals. (Given that the survey did not include those firms with 5 or less employees, and that
smaller firms are more positive about the amount of job destruction, it is quite likely that the amount of
dismissals is somewhat more positive than what is presented in this survey.)
Employment prospects for ex-miners are mixed. The survey indicates that the most likely areas where ex-
miners can find employment are in the divisions of production and construction. The specific occupations
with the best prospects are: security guard, driver, welder and ironworker.
The bulk of new hiring, however, is expected to be in areas where ex-miners are not well positioned. The
survey indicates that the best chances of finding employment are among young, educated people that are
skilled in the use of computers, have a drivers license and are proficient in foreign languages (particularly
English and to some extent German). In terms of education, 26% of future openings will be open to those
with a primary, vocational or general education background and 74% will be open to those with secondary
education or higher.
Planned Labor Redeployment and Regional Economic Development Activities
The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy has developed a labor redeployment plan and a draft regional
economic development plan which indicates that during 2001, roughly 33,000 former coal workers will
participate in either a labor redeployment or regional economic development initiative and of these roughly
9,700 will find employment. A listing of these interventions and their suspected impact is as follows:

Employment counseling and labor exchange:

62
Most of the funding for these initiatives comes from the EU Phare Initiative I and Initiative II programs. The
placement rates of ex-miners who participated in EU training in 2000 was just over 60%. This same
placement rate was used to estimate the effectiveness of proposed 2001 training. The average course was two
months in length and the most popular courses were to train security guards, commercial drivers and
warehouse clerks.
The Govermment of Poland and other donors also support initiatives that are not included in the above plans.
For example, the Ministry of Economy has a program which provides loans to gnimas for economic
development projects. A Ministry of Regional Economic Development has also recently been established but
their proposed programming for 2001 is very limited.
Conclusions
There are indications that the most recent round of ex-miners have faced more difficult circumstances than
those who left the mining industry earlier. They have a lower standard of living, are less likely to find
employment and those who found employment are more likely to be paid less than they were before in the
mining industry. They are also entering a labor market in which the overall number of jobs is declining.
Furthermore, their profile does not match the areas where most job growth is likely to occur, particularly in
regard to education, skills and age. It is also quite likely that those who will be leaving in the future will face
equally or more difficult circumstances.
The Polish authorities are of course aware of this and are proposing methods to encourage miners to leave the
industry. They are proposing both "push" and "pull" measures. In terms of push measures they are
considering changes to the collective agreements to allow a more flexible wage structure. Gradual decreases
in remuneration are appropriate to make certain jobs less attractive and should serve as an encouragement to
leave the sector. This will not likely be enough.
In terms of pull measures they hope to stimulate job creation and at the same time reduce both frictional and
structural unemployment. They plan an expansion of small business assistance including incubators, business
counseling and micro credits. These programs are particularly effective for the select group that have the
background and initiative to be entrepreneurs. As indicated in the tracer surveys, some ex-miners have
already been successful in creating businesses. Other proposed measures to stimulate employment growth,
namely loan guarantees, subsidized interest rates and measures to promote exports are less likely to be
successful. Subsidies to business of any type distort the market place and international experience suggests
that it is difficult for governments to "pick winners".
The planned changes to the social allowance package whereby participants will be able to keep 50% of their
remaining allowance if they find a job in less than two years, is also a move in the right direction. It should
make this option more attractive and given that this option supports training it may lead to a reduction of
structural unemployment.  The plans to further reduce frictional unemployment by creating more
comprehensive profiles of miners and vacancies, expanding counseling services and enhancing labor
exchange activities are all positive developments.
