MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECrORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO HAITI
FOR AN EMPLOYMENT GENERATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed credit to the Republic of Haiti for SDR 31.8 million (US$50 million
equivalent) to help finance an Employment Generation project. The credit would
be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years.
2.    Country Background. Haiti is the poorest and most densely populated
country in the Western Hemisphere, and its social indicators are alarming. During
1980-91, Haiti's population suffered a continuing decline in its standard of living,
with real per capita incomes falling by about 2% per year. Political stalemate during
the 1991-1994 period coupled with the international embargo on Haiti aggravated
the economic decline. Preliminary data indicate that real GDP fell by over 17%
during 1992-93, and by a further 10% in 1994. The situation worsened further when
tropical storm Gordon hit Haiti on November 12, 1994. As a result of these events,
estimates of unemployment are as high as 70%.
3.    In the context of the reestablishment of a Constitutional Government in
November 1994, the authorities presented a coherent economic and social
rehabilitation program to face the problems and challenges ahead, which received
the strong support of the international donor community. In its program, the
Government's stated development objectives are (a) sustained growth and
employment creation; (b) poverty alleviation and broad access to social services; and
(c) environmental rehabilitation. To address the current economic crisis and move
toward its development objectives, the Government has (a) been implementing an
emergency assistance program to provide for basic needs through import finance,
civil works and technical assistance; and (b) agreed with the IMF on a stand-by
arrangement. However, notwithstanding these efforts, it has proven impossible to
provide the jobs necessary to compensate for the employment losses caused by the
manufacturing exodus during the embargo, the dissolution of the Armed Forces and
the general loss of revenue opportunities during the economic depression.
4.    In view of these developments, the Bank Group's assistance to Haiti
involves a two-pronged approach. In the very short-term, IDA has provided
emergency financing for the Government's Emergency Economic Recovery
Program (EERP) through the Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (Cr. 2670-
HA), and has worked to reactivate earlier projects in the country. Particular
attention is being paid to aid coordination, to assist the Government in mobilizing
additional financing for the EERP and to ensure that donor efforts are
complementary rather than duplicative. At the same time, with a view to the
medium-term, IDA is working with the Government on the formulation of structural
reforms essential to reviving growth, poverty alleviation and environmental
rehabilitation. Given the continued urgent need for emergency relief, and the
desperate employment situation, IDA is proposing to bridge the transition from
short- to medium-term assistance with this proposed Employment Generation
Project. Strategically, the project would not only serve to boost economic recovery
and alleviate poverty, but would also provide upstream assistance to facilitate the
implementation of the Government's economic policy reform program, to be
supported in FY96 by a Second Structural Adjustment Credit and a complementary
Second Technical Assistance Credit.



5.    Project Objectives. The primary objective of the Employment Generation
Project is to provide short term employment to people in extreme poverty in support
of Government's program for poverty alleviation. By doing so, the project would
continue support for job creation efforts undertaken since 1993, and achieve other
objectives including the improvement of seriously deteriorated economic and
productive infrastructure. In addition, the project will strengthen the capacity of
national and local government entities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
local community organizations to manage employment-intensive small scale
development projects in the future.
6.    Project Description. The project would have the following components:
(a)   Employment Generation.   Contracts covering  management,
supervision, labor costs and associated equipment, vehicles and
materials for subprojects for high priority small scale development
activities, especially in the areas of (i) rural road rehabilitation; (ii)
soil conservation (watershed management, erosion control and soil
reclamation); (iii) rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage canals; and
(iv) urban waste management (solid waste disposal and clearing of
waste water ditches).
(b)   Institutional Development:  Training, technical assistance and
studies, office space, vehicles, equipment, furniture and other
incremental operational support, including staff, to assist (i) the
Central Implementation Unit, selected local government bodies,
NGOs and other project organizations in the implementation of
small scale labor intensive programs on a technically sound and
sustainable basis; (ii) the establishment of a national autonomous
non-government entity offering delegated contract management
services; and (iii) the development of a longer term strategy for
poverty  alleviation,  employment  and  small  infrastructure
maintenance.
7.    Costs and Fmancing. The estimated project costs are US$56.4 million, of
which US$50.0 million would be financed by the IDA credit, and the remainder by
the implementing organizations and beneficiaries.  US$205,000 in Project
Preparation Facility funds have been provided to finance preparation activities.
Retroactive financing is recommended for up to 10% of the IDA credit for eligible
expenditures incurred after June 1, 1995, including technical assistance, training,
studies, civil works and equipment, to enable the efficient start-up of the project.
Schedule A provides the project cost summary and the project financing plan.
Schedule B provides information regarding procurement arrangements and IDA
disbursements. Schedule C provides information on key project processing events.
8.    Project Implementation. The Government implementing agency would be
the Central Implementation Unit (CIU) of the Prime Minister's Office, which would
have responsibility for overall project planning, monitoring and evaluation. For
support in program planning, implementation and supervision of subproject
execution, the CIU would contract with Project Management Agencies (PMAs).
The initial PMA would be the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF),
which has been carrying out an ongoing and USAID-financed JOBS Creation
Project. While the JOBS Creation Project has been successful, USAID funds will
soon be fully disbursed.



-3-
9.    Subprojects would be implemented by local NGOs, community organizations,
local government bodies and private firms known collectively as Implementation
Organizations (IOs). Subproject proposals would be submitted to a PMA and to the
CIU. The PMA, under its contract with the CIU, would, in collaboration with the
CIU, provide technical assistance for subproject preparation, screening, appraising,
supervising, monitoring and evaluating, procure hand tools and other needed
equipment, and make the required payments to the IOs. Final decisions regarding
subproject selection would be the responsibility of the CIU, and the CIU would
furnish to IDA a work program each quarter describing the proposed subprojects
for IDA review and approval.
10.   Procedures now being used by the JOBS Creation Project would be adopted
by the project with a few revisions designed to improve technical quality (e.g., road
compacting and improved use of construction materials), and to increase linkages
with local government authorities and line ministries, such as the maintenance
program of the Ministry of Public Works.
11.   In addition, under the Employment Generation Project, there would be an
increased emphasis on local government entities, with technical assistance provided
to help improve their capability to plan, execute and subsequently maintain small
scale employment intensive works.
12.   Project Sustainability. There are two main issues related to sustainability.
First, there is the question of the sustainability of the works to be rehabilitated
under the project, and necessary linkages for their post-project maintenance by the
responsible sector line agencies. Second, there is the question of the sustainability
of the employment generation program itself, including whether, in the longer run,
such activities should be implemented by a special body such as the CIU, and, more
broadly, how temporary employment programs should fit, if at all, into an overall
strategy for poverty alleviation and economic development. Both of these questions
would be directly addressed by studies and technical assistance in the project's
institutional development component. In particular, the first half-yearly independent
evaluation of the project would focus on these sustainability questions.
13.   Lessons Learned from  Employment Generation Programs in Other
Countries. Employment generation programs in other countries, including Peru,
Chile, Bolivia and India, have been most successful when the following factors have
been present:
(a)   Wages provided are lower than the minimum wage, thereby ensuring
that the benefits of the program would not be appropriated by the
non-poor.
(b)   The program is targeted geographically, to ensure that it is accessible
to the poor.
(c)   The implementing agency has technically qualified staff who are
allowed to function according to clear and transparently applied
guidelines.
(d)   Monitoring systems are established to provide timely feedback.



-4 -
(e)   Works selected have high labor content and result in investments
that are of value to the poor.
14.   The experience in West Africa with the Senegal AGETIP (Agence
d'Ex6cution de Travaux d'Int6r6t Publique -- Executing Agency for Public Interest
Works) model is relevant to the proposed project. The World Bank-supported
AGETIP model was created in 1989 in a context of rapid urbanization, economic
crisis, the ending of the welfare state, the beginning of a decentralization strategy,
dwindling resources at the central level and a lack of resource mobilization capacity
at the local level. The AGETIP was established as an NGO for delegated contract
management of municipal small-scale works, with construction and rehabilitation
executed by small private firms. The objectives of the AGETIP were to, without
increasing the size of the public sector, efficiently implement low cost, high priority
public works, while establishing transparent procurement practices, and
strengthening local contractors by providing technical assistance.
15.   The AGETIP model has succeeded in providing employment and subsistence
to unskilled workers while achieving durable economic benefits through the
implementation of a well-selected works and services program and the strengthening
participating municipalities, contractors and engineering consulting firms. Today
there are a number AGETIP-type organizations in West Africa. Keys to the success
of the AGETIP model have been:
(a)    Clear focus and Government support.
(b)   Private independent status of the agency and a competent director.
(c)    Transparent and flexible subproject selection.
(d)   Rapid procedures allowing payments in less than two weeks --
restoring public credibility and reducing costs.
(e)   Transparent procedures, including frequent audits and ex-post
controls.
16.   Lessons Learned from Haiti Employment Programs. In May 1995 an
independent evaluation of the JOBS Creation Project was completed. The key
lessons learned were:
(a)   The project's institutional structures contributed to its success. Four
layers of institutions were involved: (i) the international donor; (ii)
a Project Management Agency (PADF) with a good network of links
to grassroots organizations; (iii) the grassroots organizations
themselves; and (iv) social groups and associations that supplied
workers for the subprojects. In particular, the role of the Project
Management Agency was critical: (i) it provided transparency,
accountability and political neutrality in the selection of both
subprojects and implementing organizations; and (ii) it maintained
satisfactory financial, technical and management standards.
(b)   The majority of project resources went directly to the work force.
Of total project costs, between 60 and 65% were direct labor
payments, and another 15% covered the incremental costs of local



NGOs. Thus more than 75% of the project costs went directly into
the subproject areas. The remaining funds covered the costs of
tools, other equipment and materials, and PADF engineering,
management and administration.
(c)   The project improved governance at the local level. The project led
to more intensive activities by local groups, encouraging skills in
group interaction, organization and management.
(d)   Cash payments were more effective and efficient than providing food
for work. Workers overwhelmingly preferred cash payments rather
than payments in food or by other means, which have traditionally
been used in Haiti. The evaluation showed that workers used cash
payments to pay for schooling, seeds, tools and medical care, in
addition to food. The use of cash payments also greatly reduced the
project management requirements that are associated with food for
work programs.
(e)   Subproject prototypes and standards were veiy useful to project
implementation. Prototypes and standards allowed the Implementing
Organizations with less experience to produce good quality work and
facilitated estimating labor supervision needs.
(f)    The project had the flexibility to adjust to unforeseen events.
Design flexibility allowed the project to adjust to marked changes in
the political and economic climate, which ranged from the
international embargo under the military regime to the restoration
of democracy.
17.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Bank Group's Country Assistance
Strategy for Haiti is briefly described in para. 4 and would be formally presented to
the Board for discussion along with the Structural Adjustment Credit in FY96. The
proposed project would immediately and directly support the Government's
objectives of growth and employment creation, poverty alleviation and
environmental rehabilitation by financing labor intensive subprojects for the
rehabilitation of economic infrastructure (roads, irrigation, drainage), and
environmental management (soil conservation, waste management).   The
Employment Generation Project would provide a transition between the emergency
nature of the JOBS Creation Project and the longer term development agenda by
addressing issues of works sustainability and sectoral linkages, especially for
maintenance, and issues of decentralization and governance, through institutional
development and training for local implementing organizations.
18.   Agreements Reached. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Borrower that:
(a)   The CIU would maintain adequate staff and/or engage consulting
firms with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA to carry
out the project.
(b)   Contracts with Project Management Agencies would be on terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA.



- 6 -
(c)   Subprojects would be executed on the basis of technical, financial,
environmental, managerial and other specifications and procedures
described in operating manuals acceptable to IDA.
(d)   Environmental checklists acceptable to IDA would be used for
subproject screening and an environmental assessment specialist
would be contracted by the CIU within one month of Credit
effectiveness.
(e)   Half-yearly independent evaluations of the project would be carried
out as agreed with IDA.
(f)    Expenditures for subprojects would only be eligible for IDA
financing if included in a quarterly work program approved by IDA;
the first quarterly work program would be furnished to IDA within
one month of Credit effectiveness.
19.   Environmental Aspects. The project has the environmental classification "B."
The IDA credit would finance: (a) rehabilitation of roads; (b) rehabilitation of
irrigation and drainage works; (c) environmental protection (gully control, soil and
water conservation); and (d) waste management (urban solid waste disposal and
clearing of urban waste water ditches). Subprojects would be small with an average
cost of US$360,000 per project. No new infrastructure would be established. The
project would have a positive environmental impact, especially through the
components dealing with soil conservation and waste management.
20.   The only activity considered to have possible adverse environmental impacts
is waste management, which must deal with general issues associated with landfill
sites. Creation or expansion of landfill sites would be subject to an environmental
assessment satisfactory to IDA, following the practice utilized by USAID in the
JOBS Creation Project.
21.   Each subproject would be subject to simple environmental screening to be
carried out by an environmental specialist in the CIU, who would consult with the
Minister of Environment on issues raised by specific subprojects.
22.   Program Objective Categories. As described above, most project activities
and benefits are related to employment generation for the target poverty group for
work programs related to productive agriculture, transport and environmental
management. Therefore the project would be designated as belonging to the
Program Objective Categories of (a) Poverty Alleviation and (b) Environmentally
Sustainable Development. The project would be included in the Poverty Category:
Program of Targeted Interventions.
23.   Participatory Approach. Subprojects under the JOBS Creation Project are
being implemented by local IOs, and a number of these were consulted during
project preparation and appraisal. The Employment Generation Project would
further enhance the role of the 1Os, especially local government entities and their
subdivisions, in the identification, planning and maintenance of employment
generation works; and provide training and technical assistance to the 1Os.
24.   One of the selection criteria for potential subprojects would be the
willingness of the proposed IOs to make labor or in-kind contributions to the



subproject. Typically, this will include an 10 contribution of management and other
overheads of about 5% of total subproject costs, and a contribution by direct
beneficiaries of one day of free labor for each five days of paid labor. Among other
things, this selection criterion will help ensure that the proposed subprojects are a
priority for the IOs and beneficiaries.
25.   Benefits. A recent independent evaluation of the ongoing JOBS Creation
Project concluded that the economic benefits on a net present value basis are high.
For individual families, the immediate difference in household income and
nutritional levels provided by the project's direct employment generation income was
substantial. While most of the wage income was used for buying food, some income
was invested in schooling, medical care, improved seeds, livestock and other assets.
Other direct economic benefits included the productive impact of irrigation, drainage
and soil conservation works.
26.   One measure of project economic performance is its cost effectiveness in
achieving its job creation objective. The cost per job in subprojects under the JOBS
Creation Project averaged about US$1.80 per person per day, which compares
favorably with the performance of job creation projects elsewhere. For example,
although in an Indonesian program the costs per job were lower at US$1.10 per
person day, in similar projects in Kenya and the eastern Caribbean the costs per job
were US$3.20 and US$23.90 per day, respectively. In the JOBS Creation Project,
irrigation and drainage subprojects have been the most cost efficient at US$1.54 per
day, followed by soil conservation at US$1.82, road rehabilitation at US$1.83, and
garbage collection at US$1.89.
27.   The independent evaluation of the JOBS Creation Project estimated that the
net present value (NPV) of the irrigation and drainage subprojects is US$15.3
million at a discount rate of 15% and the economic rate of return (ERR) is 70%.
Road rehabilitation had an NPV of US$4.1 million and an ERR of 32%. Soil
conservation had an NPV of US$710,000 and an ERR of 23%. Similar NPVs and
ERRs are expected under the Employment Generation Project.
28.   In summary, the project would have four main categories of benefits:
(a)   Poverty reduction: The project is targeted at the poorest sectors of
Haitian society. Although the jobs created are short term, according
to past experience part of the wage income would be reinvested in
schooling, tools and seed, which would have long term impacts. The
project would require that 20% of all jobs go to women, which are
the most disadvantaged group.
(b)   Sustainability of institutions: By reaching an important share of the
population, the project would help sustain expectations about
improved governance and help necessary institutions develop.
Moreover, because implementation of the subprojects is through
local IOs, the project would help strengthen grassroots organizations.
(c)   Improved infrastructure:  The project would help rehabilitate
physical capital (roads, irrigation and drainage) and natural capital
(soils). Increased economic output at lower cost and increased
agricultural productivity would generate economic growth and
benefit the Haitian economy as a whole.



(d)   Improved environment: Garbage collection and pollution control in
urban centers would reduce health hazards in population centers,
benefitting the urban poor directly and reducing health costs in the
country.
29.   Risks. The project faces many risks. There are political risks that are
inevitable in the current Haitian context, including possible events adversely
affecting project implementation arising from the Presidential elections in December
1995 and a change of Government administration in February 1996. There are also
managerial and technical risks; both the capacity the CIU to implement the project
and the ability of the sector line agencies to maintain project investments in the
post-project period are uncertain, although the project will help mitigate these risks
through the institutional development component. In addition, although PADF has
performed well until now, Government recognizes that the program is unduly
dependent upon the continued participation of this international NGO. However,
while Government hopes that other organizations will develop the capability to help
manage the project in addition to PADF, and the project will support this objective,
the likelihood of such organizations developing this capability in the short term is
not certain. Finally, there are risks that the project could distort incentives in the
local economy; some of the public works to be carried out under the project would
provide private benefits, such as irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, and could
reduce incentives for private rehabilitation of such works.
30.   Despite these risks, the project should be seen as an mitense labor
generation effort, with immediate and critical short term benefits, which will also
help support the development of more sustainable approaches in the future.
Moreover, the considerable success of the ongoing JOBS Creation Project makes
it more likely that the proposed project will be successfully implemented.
31.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
