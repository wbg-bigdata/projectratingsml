EMPLOYMENT GENERATION PROJECT
CREDIT 2765-HA
HAITI
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Employment Generation Project (EGP) originated during the Consultative Group
follow-up meeting held in Haiti in May 1995. It was prepared on the basis of employment
generation studies carried out for the Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (Cr. 2670-HA).
The Project was conceived to bridge the transition from short-to medium-term economic
assistance. It was to reach short-term poverty alleviation objectives during a politically volatile
period and while democratic institutions were still fragile. It was estimated that nearly 1.6 million
famnily members of unskilled workers in mostly economically depressed areas would benefit from
income generated by the creation of about 487,000 person-months of employment.
A. Project Objectives
2.    The objectives of the Project were to: (a) create short-term employment for people in
extreme poverty in support of the Borrower's program for poverty alleviation; (b) rehabilitate
seriously deteriorated economic and productive infrastructure in the Borrower's country; and
(c) strengthen the capacity of non-government and community organizations operating in the
territory of the Borrower and the Borrower's central and local authorities to manage labor
intensive small-scale development projects, including the establishment of a national
non-government contract management entity and the development of a longer term strategy for
poverty alleviation, employment and small infrastructure maintenance.
3.    Comments on Project Objectives. Considering the political situation, the short-term
objectives were ambitious. The longer-term objectives mentioned under (c) would have stood a
better chance of being reached in an institutional development program than in a short-term
action-oriented project.
B. Implementation Experience and Results
4.    The Project outcome is rated highly satisfactory. The employment creation component
(92 percent) of the Project is rated highly satisfactory because: (i) the component reached the
ambitious job creation objectives; (ii) project funds benefited the poorest layers of the population
and provided the highly-needed cash to stimulate recovery from the economic hardships during
the international embargo; and (iii) rehabilitation of crucial productive, economic and basic
infrastructure along with protection/conservation of environmentally degraded or threatened areas
meet or exceed appraisal expectations in most cases.



- ii -
5.    The institutional development component is rated satisfactory. The Project enhanced the
managerial, administrative and operational capacities of UCG, participating municipalities and
CASECs, NGOs, various community organizations and small rural private enterprises. The
Project, however, fell short of developing a strategy for poverty alleviation through small-scale
labor intensive investments on a more sustainable basis. The Project was closed one month after
the original date in the Credit Agreement.
6.    Among the key factors that affected the performance of the Project were: (i) strong
Government support and excellent cooperation between the Bank and Government during project
preparation and processing; (ii) UCG's pragmatic and effective management; (iii) excellent
performance by NGOs and implementing organizations; (iv) a good project methodology; and
(v) the Bank's flexible procurement and disbursement procedures and continuous follow-up.
C. Summary of Findings
Sustainability.
7.    The sustainability of the Project is uncertain. Soil conservation and particularly irrigation
works which directly concern the beneficiaries are likely to be maintained. Sustainability of
sub-projects such as solid waste management and rural road rehabilitation is unlikely. They
belong to the public sector domain and need specific funding. The Project strengthened national
and local institutions with staff trained and experienced in labor-intensive infrastructure
rehabilitation works at local levels. It did not establish a national non-government contract
management entity to implement a longer term strategy for poverty alleviation, employment and
small infrastructure maintenance.
Bank and Borrower Performance
8.    Bank performance is rated highly satisfactory. In addressing GOH's urgent need and
request for assistance, the Bank showed swift responsiveness and extreme creativity and flexibility
that led to a record-breaking short period for preparation, appraisal, Board presentation,
effectiveness and first disbursement. To ensure success during implementation, the Bank
dedicated a significant amount of resources to assist the Borrower.
9.    The Borrower's performance is rated satisfactory. While the Borrower was very actively
involved in project preparation, subsequent administrations have reduced their support for the
Project and eroded its sustainability. Nevertheless, the Project has achieved significant job
creation results.
D. Future Operations
10.   At present, an IDA-financed basic infrastructure project is being prepared. It is
recommended that this project uses the private sector, which has been strengthened by the EGP,
to act as a major player in project implementation. The possibility of bilateral donors using this
approach also remains likely.



- 111 -
E. Key Lessons Learned
11.   The lessons to be drawn from the implementation of this Project comprise the highly
successful cooperation between private and public sector, eligibility criteria of sub-projects,
participation by the beneficiaries and institutional development.
(i)    a well coordinated partnership between public and private/non-governmental
sectors can live up to tremendous challenges. NGOs have shown a substantial
implementation capacity and drive, which the public sector cannot match. Future small
infrastructure projects should take this experience into account and make use of this
private implementation capacity;
(ii)   not all infrastructure rehabilitation sub-projects are suited for labor-intensive
methods. Road construction and some other sub-projects requiring heavy-duty equipment
need more capital inputs for satisfactory completion than were agreed upon under the 60-
40 percent rule for allocation of labor and capital expenditures. The type of sub-projects
undertaken should be consistent with the type of resources available;
(iii)  substantial and time-consuming participation with beneficiaries and local
authorities are necessary from the inception of sub-projects to ensure sustainable post-
implementation maintenance and operation. This often conflicts with the pressure to
disburse and achieve quick results. Although tradeoffs are unavoidable, higher beneficiary
contributions and participation in the sub-project design would have increased the
likelihood of sub-project sustainability;
(iv)  the Bank and the Government are able to move very fast when supported by senior
officials. Fast project preparation need not to diminish quality. Moreover, flexibility in
procurement, disbursement and intense supervision have ensured successful
implementation; and
(v)   more realism is needed about what can be achieved in terms of institutional
development in such a short time period and in an environment such as the one prevailing
in Haiti in 1995-96.

HAM
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Background
1.    The Employment Generation Project (EGP) originated during the Consultative Group
follow-up meetings held in Haiti in May 1995. The reinstated constitutional Government
requested IDA's support to continue financing the USAID Jobs Creation Project which was soon
to be completed. The 1991-1994 international embargo and economic decline caused great
hardship for the rural and urban poor who were left with few prospects for short-term
improvement. In the context of an aggravated economic deterioration, the Government attached
high priority to the extension of this Jobs Creation Project to alleviate poverty. EGP's swift
identification and preparation benefited extensively from the Jobs Creation Project's successful
experience and from initial work done on employment generation as part of the preparation of the
Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (Cr. 2670-HA). With unemployment hovering near
70 percent, the Project was seen as a critical component in the maintenance of political and
economic stability during this period of transition and emerging democratic institutions.
A. Project Objectives
2.    EGP's objectives were to: (a) create short-term employment for people in extreme
poverty in support of the Borrower's program for poverty alleviation; (b) rehabilitate seriously
deteriorated economic and productive infrastructure in the Borrower's country; and (c) strengthen
the capacity of non-government and community organizations operating in the territory of the
Borrower, and the Borrower's central and local authorities to manage labor intensive small-scale
development projects, including the establishment of a national non-governmental contract
management entity along with the development of a longer term strategy for poverty alleviation,
employment, and small infrastructure maintenance.
3.    EGP was composed of two parts: employment generation and institutional development.
Part A:     Employment Generation
4.    This component was to carry out high priority small-scale development activities
(including labor costs and associated equipment, management and supervision thereof), especially
in the areas of (a) productive and economic infrastructure, including the rehabilitation of roads,
culverts, bridges, and irrigation and drainage canals; (b) environmental protection, including
watershed management, erosion control and soil reclamation; (c) pollution control, including
urban solid waste disposal and clearing of urban waste water drains; and (d) other activities. It



-2 -
was to create an estimated 487,000 person-months of short-term employment. This would
generate an average income of US$70 (equivalent to about 6 months cash income) for
approximately 325,000 extremely poor laborers supporting about 1.6 million family members.
Part B:      Institutional Development
5.    This component was to provide technical assistance (including training, studies and
auditing services, vehicles, furniture, staff and other incremental operational support) for the
implementation of Part A and develop the Borrower's long-term employment and poverty
alleviation strategy.
6.    The Project would:
(a)   strengthen non-governmental and community organizations involved in the
implementation of part A, as well as the Borrower's local authorities, by improving their
capacity to identify, prepare, implement and maintain small-scale labor intensive economic
development projects;
(b)   assess the experience of previous employment generation programs, and increase
the maintenance of investments in rural roads, irrigation and soil conservation by
developing maintenance strategies; and
(c)   support development and initial implementation of a longer term strategy to
generate employment in economically depressed areas, including the creation of a national
autonomous non-governmental entity able to provide delegated contract management
services (e.g. as in the AGETIP model) ' especially for small-scale labor-intensive works.
7.    The Government of Haiti was the Borrower and UCG (Unit6 Centrale de Gestion attached
to the Prime Minister's Office) was the implementing agency. To carry out Part A, UCG made
agreements with four MDODs (Non-Governmental Organizations) which in turn made sub-
contracts with other implementing organizations (NGOs, local authorities or other private sector
organizations) to implement sub-projects.
8.    Comments on the Project Objectives. EGP's objectives were ambitious and challenging
in terms of outcome and disbursement flow. Implementation has shown that the goals were
reachable. With respect to the institutional development component, it is doubtful whether the
longer-term strategy objectives could have effectively been reached within such short project
period. More time is needed to fully accomplish such goals.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
9.    EGP was an intense labor generation effort, with critical short-term benefits. It was also
to form a bridge towards a more sustainable long-term approach. Accordingly, the primary goal
AGETIP refers here to management agencies for small public infrasructure works. These agencies have
been successful for the implementation of municipal infrastructure works on the African continent and have been
sponsored by the World Bank.



-3-
of EGP was to address immediate poverty alleviation needs through job creation and income
generation and to improve severely dilapidated economic and productive infrastructure. EGP
made substantial contributions to immediate poverty relief mainly through the creation of a large
number of short-term jobs, a substantial injection of money in the local economies, the
improvement of infrastructure affecting the livelihood of the poor, and the protection/
rehabilitation of various environmentally degraded locations. EGP also strengthened communities
and implementing agencies and financed several interesting but scattered institutional development
activities. As was feared for in the Staff Appraisal Report, it fell short of ensuring long-term
sustainability.
Employment Generation Component
10.   The main physical outcomes of the employment generation component are summarized
below (Table 1).
11.   EGP created 475,700 person-months of short-term employment in 18 months. The job
distribution over the project period is irregular: about 25,000 jobs per month were created during
the first project year (September 1995 - August 1996) and 60,000 jobs per month in the last
quarter of 1996. This can be explained by the late recruitment of three MDODs whose contracts
were only signed in the second quarter of 1996.

12.   The arithmetic average of 26,500 jobs per month created by EGP over that period is to be
compared with the 40,000 monthly jobs provided by the national assembly industry before the
military coup in 1990-91. Twenty-one percent of the jobs have been carried out by women. The
total wages paid to workers and directly injected into largely depressed local economies amounted
to US$22.0 million (53 percent ofthe component's total disbursement). About 317,100
individuals supporting some 1.6 million household members (22 percent of the Haitian population
of 7.2 million) were employed in the Project all over the country. An average laborer received
over a six week working period an income of about US$70 (31 percent of per capita GDP).
Some additional US$4 to 6 million of Project funds have been channeled to the local economies as
wages for employees of the private sector providing the building materials.
13.  Independent studies on a sample of workers indicate that 60 percent of the earned income
went to consumption (food, closing, housing), and 40 percent to investment (education, livestock,
small-scale trade, and farming). The Employment Generation Component (US$47.4 million,
90 percent of total costs) of the Project was disbursed in its entirety by March 1997.
14.   EGP carried out 158 community sub-projects in 96 (out of 133) municipalities in the nine
geographic departments. Average sub-project size was US$276,000. Most of the SAR
quantitative physical goals have been exceeded. The quality of the works is generally satisfactory
(in over 75 percent of the sub-project samples independently evaluated). Durability (especially for
rural roads) appears uncertain due mainly to the lack of adequate post-project maintenance
mechanisms. In addition to the three initial eligible categories of works (productive and economic
infrastructure including the rehabilitation of roads, culverts, bridges, and irrigation and drainage
canals; environmental protection; and pollution control), EGP financed also rehabilitation
expansion of potable water supply.
15.   EGP had also some secondary benefits. The following are two examples of the kind of
indirect/secondary benefits brought by the Project. At Goyavier/St-Marc, savings generated
through the implementation of a soil conservation project enabled the community to initiate the
construction of a local school and to attract other funding and assistance for completion.
Self-confidence and positive momentum built within the community of Desdunes/Artibonite from
the successful implementation of a drainage/irrigation sub-project allowed the community to raise
more than US$32,000 to rehabilitate the badly deteriorated access road to that locality.
Moreover the employment generation component contributed towards: (i) the training of
specialized laborers; (ii) the development of local enterprises; (iii) the strengthening of local
training centers; (iv) the elaboration of a technical reference manual for labor-intensive projects;
and (v) the improvement of the environmental impact assessment system.
Institutional Development Component
16.   Multiple diverse institutional strengthening actions were undertaken and their outcomes
are generally satisfactory. EGP provided working experience in labor-intensive infrastructure
projects to 135 implementing organizations (mostly local NGOs, community groups or
associations, selected municipalities and small rural private firms). It provided sta training for
municipalities, CASECs and selected central administration entities. It also financed: (i) basic
office equipment and furniture for municipalities and CASECs; (ii) various urban studies (urban



-5 -
development master plan outlines, strengthening of municipal fiscal management, and
socio-economic studies); and (iii) equipment for the ministries of agriculture and public works.
Some actions, however, were somewhat dispersed and lacked cohesion which reduced their
impact.
17.   UCG was slow to start with the development of a long-term strategy and the creation of a
national autonomous entity to provide infrastructure contract management services. When UCG
finally began actively promoting the proposal in mid-1996, GOI's interest and support for the
creation of such autonomous entity had diminished. GOH had become more favorable to a public
sector management approach of employment creation and infrastructure development. As a
result, EGP fell short of developing a long term national strategy to support and promote
employment generation in poverty stricken areas. It did not establish an AGETIP-type national
institution with the capacity to carry out such a strategy on a sustainable basis.
C. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
18.   Overall, the employment generation component (Part A) of the Project was implemented
with some delay. The initial objective was to disburse most funds in the first project year to
address immediate poverty situations after the economic embargo and to revive the rural
economy. Late contracting of three MDODs and intense sub-project (particularly environmental)
screening by UCG has caused some bunching at the end of the project period.
19.   The institutional development component (Part B) was more difficult to implement as it
lacked a basic design. This resulted in a very late start (April 1996) and several months of
negotiations between UCG and the Bank on the component's objectives, strategies and content.
Time for implementation and quality control was consequently reduced. To accommodate
completion of some elements of the component, the Project closed one month later than planned.
About US$2.2 million for Part B was not used. The major determinants of project
implementation are discussed below.
20.   Government Support. EGP's quick start-up benefited largely from GOH's strong
support and commitment, and from an already existing, fully operational USAID Jobs Creation
Project implementation structure kept in place thanks to bridge financing from the "Fonds
d'Assistance Economique et Sociale" funded by the Interamerican Development Bank.
Continuous support for the Project at the local level (municipalities, CASECs, NGOs) has been a
key factor in EGP's overall success. At times, changes in the Central Government2, however,
generated distractions and delays (specifically with respect to the institutional development
component).
21.   UCG Management. UCG's flexible and efficient administrative and operational
management has been a decisive positive factor in achieving the job creation and physical targets.
Nevertheless, late contracting of three MDODs and delays in approving MDOD work-plans
resulted in a 4-month lag in reaching interim job creation targets. This reduced the time allocated

for maintenance of sub-projects and bunched a considerable part of the works in the second
semester of 1996. UCG's financial management performance declined after the closure of the
project. It is expected that the final project audit will be qualified.
22.   EGP's management arrangement with three layers of entities (UCG, MDODs, IOs), each
with different and well specified mandates and responsibilities clearly stated in enforceable
performance-type contracts was also a key element in ensuring efficient, within budget and timely
delivery of project outcomes.
23.   MDOD Performance. The management capacity and experience of the MDODs,
particularly the Pan American Development Foundation responsible for two-thirds of the works,
has been the center piece of EGP's successful implementation. The three other MDODs (Centre
Canadien d'ttude de Cooperation Internationale, Cooperative Housing Foundation and Centres
pour le Developpement et la Sante) have also proven to be highly capable of fulfilling their
contract and delivering outcomes in excess of expectation, in a timely fashion, within budget and
up to agreed quality standards. The same considerations are also applicable to most of the 135
implementing organizations involved in EGP's implementation. This collaboration between public
and private sector is exemplary in the region and should be continued.
24.   Methodology. EGP's methodology was built on the main success factors of the previous
USAID Jobs-Creation Project. In particular, the use of sub-project prototypes was key in
speeding-up the whole sub-project cycle (from formulation to implementation). Nevertheless, the
design and formulation of sub-projects in some cases suffered from technical shortcomings due to
oversimplification or lack of in-depth studies.
25.   Bank Procurement, Disbursement and Supervision. The Bank's flexible procurement
and disbursement system which allowed a sole-source contractor for US$32 million, accepted
relatively high thresholds for direct contracting, provided advances to MDODs exceeding US$20
million without requiring a bank guarantee and relied exclusively on ex-post control has
significantly facilitated field implementation. Moreover, funds were transferred to MDODs
without an intermediary account in the Central Bank, hence speeding up money transfers.
26.   As shown in Table 10 of the Statistical Annexes, the Bank conducted 11 project
supervision missions between August 1995 and February 1997, seven of them emphasized the
status of MDOD's hiring, the institutional development component's start-up and initiatives to
establish an AGETIP-type contract management agency. This intense pattern of assistance to the
project has contributed significantly to its successful implementation.
27.   Direct Payments to MDODs and Ols. Direct payments to well-screened, reliable, but
overall well-trusted MDODs and implementation organizations has been key to timely payment
for works and wages; a critical concern in a politically and socially sensitive environment
characterized by the public administration's past inability to pay on time.
28.   Foreign Exchange Fluctuations. Nine months after start-up, fluctuations in the SDR
exchange rate resulted in a reduction of about 7 percent (US$3.5 million) of the US$ amount of



the Credit available for the Project. Concurrently, a reduction in the Gourde/US$ exchange rate
contributed to offset partially that loss.
D. Project Sustainability
29.   EGP's sustainability contains two aspects: (i) the sustainability of the infrastructure works
and post-project maintenance by responsible sector line agencies, local authorities and
communities; and (ii) the sustainability of the employment generation program itself as to whether
and how such activities in the longer run would fit into a comprehensive poverty alleviation and
economic development strategy. These two questions were to be addressed by studies and
technical assistance in the Project's institutional development component.
30.   Sustainability (or durability) of physical rehabilitation works varies a great deal depending
on location but also on the category of works. An independent evaluation of sub-project samples,
indicates that soil conservation and particularly irrigation works are most likely to be sustainable.
Initiatives already undertaken by beneficiaries to maintain and/or operate the rehabilitated
irrigation systems (in more than 50 percent of the cases) or to protect soil conservation works in
many sites are positive indicators for sustainability. Sub-projects such as garbage collection,
street and drain cleaning along with rural road rehabilitation is likely to be less sustainable. People
consider such works part of the public sector domain and will not maintain them on a voluntary
basis without being paid. Such maintenance requires public funding and management, still a
scarce commodity in Haiti.
31.   Concerning the sustainability of the employment program itself, EGP did neither define a
strategy for poverty alleviation through small-scale labor intensive type investments at local levels,
nor establish an AGETIP or similar private management unit to promote employment on a more
sustainable basis through creation and training of small local private contractors. Recent GOH
initiatives in basic infrastructure investment opt for program management through sector line
Ministries.
32.   The Project, however, left behind strengthened national and local institutions (UCG,
selected central administration agencies, municipalities, MDODs, and 1Os) with staff trained and
experienced in labor-intensive infrastructure rehabilitation works at local levels. Some of these
MDODs could undertake large programs of small-scale infrastructure investments. EGP also left
behind large quantities of tools and various type of office equipment and furniture. Those are
very valuable and ready-to-use assets on which GOH has the option to keep building on.
E. Bank Performance
33.   Overall Bank performance is rated as highly satisfactory. The involvement of the Bank
was justified at a time when it was critical that donor-financed projects generated income for the
poor during the transition to political and economic stability, while private led employment and
economic growth would pick up the slack in the economy. In addressing GOlfs urgent need and
request for assistance, the Bank showed swift responsiveness and extreme creativity and
flexibility. This led to a record-breaking time 10-week period for preparation, appraisal, Board
presentation, effectiveness and first disbursement. This rapid turnover was the result of



-8-
tremendous cooperation and coordination within the Bank and between the Bank and GOH.
EGP's design was based on the Borrower's extreme poverty situation, the judgment of in-country
implementation capacity, risk assessment of success and sustainability that proved to be accurate.
The Bank's performance during appraisal is thus rated highly satisfactory despite shortcomings in
the preparation of sections of the institutional development component.
34.   To ensure success during implementation, the Bank dedicated a significant amount of
resources to assist the implementing agency. Eleven supervision missions took place over the
21-month implementation period. The Bank's responsiveness in addressing unforeseen
implementation problems or issues was swift, and communication with UCG was steady. Close
coordination between the Bank and UCG contributed to keeping the Project on track, and the
required technical assistance was made available to UCG according to the implementation plan.
Given the fast pace of project implementation, the change of task manager less than ten months
before project completion caused some delay, but related negative impacts were eventually
limited. The Bank has shown some inflexibility in the application of the rule of 60 percent (of
sub-project expenditures for wages). It has maintained that UCG was to identify and finance sub-
projects with a high labor content. It also feared that a reduction in the percentage of labor costs
would make too many solid waste urban sub-projects eligible for financing under EGP.
F. Borrower Performance
35.   Overall Borrower's performance is rated satisfactory. While the Borrower was actively
involved in project preparation, subsequent administrations have reduced their support for the
Project and its sustainability.
36.   The Borrower's performance during project preparation is rated highly satisfactory. Upon
its re-establishment in October 1994, the Constitutional Government mapped a coherent
economic and social rehabilitation program to face the problems and challenges ahead. The Prime
Minister's Office took a leading role in coordinating major donor emergency programs. To
underscore the importance of emergency actions, it created the Central Implementation Unit
(UCG) in December 1994 to ensure and supervise the implementation of the Economic
Emergency Program and the EGP. The GOH expressed its request for assistance under EGP with
a clear focus and high level of priority, fully supported and was actively involved in all phases of
project preparation.
37.   The Borrower's performance in implementing Part A of the Project is rated satisfactory.
UCG showed adequate leadership in building on the previous JOBS Creation Project experience,
in improving and adapting EGP's rules, procedures and standards to the new environment of the
national post-embargo period and kept the employment generation component on track.
Participation and involvement of central and local government authorities at all steps of sub-
project cycle were routinely sought. UCG found it difficult to manage EGP under the 60/40 ratio
( labor content over materials and other costs) mandated per sub-project. Nonetheless, MDODs
and most IOs demonstrated a high level of flexibility, creativity and professionalism in carrying
out their respective contractual commitments and in meeting (when not exceeding) outcome
delivery targets. Despite widened positive response at local levels, active support of key central
administrations and sector line ministries never materialized.



-9 -
38.   The Borrower's performance in implementing Part B of the Project is rated satisfactory.
After initial enthusiasm, the Borrower demonstrated hesitation and at times noticeable lack of
interest and support for the main long-term options of the institutional development component as
agreed during project preparation. As a result, the institutional development objectives were only
partially met and the Project's sustainability remains uncertain.
G. Assessment of Outcome
39.   The ICR rates the overall outcome of this Project as highly satisfactory. UCG's evaluation
of the outcome of the Project is included as Appendix B. In general, UCG also considers that the
successful outcome of the employment generation component should be the defining factor of the
overall evaluation.
40.   The employment generation component (Part A), amounting to 92 percent of the Project
is rated highly satisfactory for the following reasons: (i) the Project reached the ambitious job
creation objectives; (ii) project funds benefited the poorest layers of the population and provided
the highly-needed cash to stimulate recovery from the economic hardships during the international
embargo; and (iii) rehabilitation of crucial productive, economic and basic infrastructure along
with protection/conservation of environmentally degraded or threatened areas meet or exceed
appraisal expectations in most cases.
41.   An independent evaluation of EGP's economic impact indicates that the rehabilitation of
irrigation schemes has provided most economic benefits to the country. The rehabilitation of
roads and water supply showed also substantial return on investment. The returns on the
construction of new roads were not evaluated as being important. Data lacked to carry out an
economic evaluation of the soil conservation projects.
42.   The outcome of the EGP's institutional development component (Part B) accounting for
about five percent of the Project cost is rated satisfactory for the following reasons.
(i)   the managerial, administrative and operational capacities of UCG, selected central
Government bodies, participating municipalities and CASECs, NGOs, various community
organizations and small rural private enterprises were significantly enhanced;
(ii)  the Project has supported punctual operations, which may not always have been
internally coherent, but which have mostly supported ongoing long-term strategic programs (such
as UNDP's urban development program) which may prove to be vital to the country's
development; and
(iii)  communities have received large numbers of tools and equipment redistributed to
beneficiaries after EGP's completion which they will be able to use for the maintenance of the
works and completion of other works.



- 10-
H. Future Operation
43.   Despite various recommendations on ways to connect EGP's immediate poverty
alleviation objectives with long-term development assistance, GOH decided not to create an
AGETIP. It is however strongly recommended that future Bank-financed operations be carried
out using the private sector capacity created under EGP.
44.   During a project closing seminar future actions to build on EGP's positive achievements
have been reviewed and discussed. UCG and the UNDP-funded technical assistance project
HAI/94/003 "Priority Assistance to Municipalities" carnied out by the United Nations Conference
for Human Settlement (UNCHS-HABITAT) have expressed their intention to follow-up on a
wide diffusion and "marketing" of the main studies carried out under EGP, specifically the seven
urban development master plan outlines and the socio-economic studies.
I. Key Lessons Learned
45.   The lessons to be drawn from the implementation of this Project comprise the highly
successful cooperation between private and public sector, eligibility criteria of sub-projects,
participation by beneficiaries, project ownership, institutional development, and realism in
establishing project objectives. The lessons include:
(i)    a partnership between public and private/non-governmental sectors can live up to
tremendous challenges. NGOs have shown a substantial implementation capacity and
drive, which the public sector cannot match. Future small infrastructure projects should
take this experience into account and make use of this private implementation capacity;
(ii)   not all infrastructure rehabilitation sub-projects are suited for labor-intensive
methods. Road construction and some other sub-projects requiring heavy-duty equipment
need more capital inputs for satisfactory completion than were agreed upon under the 60-
40 percent rule for allocation of labor and capital expenditures. The type of sub-projects
undertaken should be consistent with the type of resources available;
(iii)  extensive participation with beneficiaries and local authorities are necessary from
the inception of sub-projects to ensure sustainable maintenance and operation. This often
conflicts with the pressure to disburse and achieve quick results. Although tradeoffs are
unavoidable, higher beneficiary contributions and participation in the sub-project design
would have increased the likelihood of sub-project sustainability;
(iv)  the Bank and the Government are able to move very fast when supported by senior
officials. Fast project preparation need not to diminish quality. Moreover, flexibility in
procurement, disbursement and intense supervision have ensured successful
implementation; and
(v)   more realism is needed about what can be achieved in terms of institutional
development in a short time period and in an environment such as the one prevailing in
Haiti in 1995-96.

rehabilitation de routes rurales, assainissement urbain et adduction d'eau potable. En termes de
quantitd, les objectifs ont ete largement depasses. La qualite de travaux a et en general
satisfaisante, bien que leur durabilite demeure incertaine, particulierement du fait du manque de
mise en place de dispositifs d'entretien pour la periode post-projet.
2.3- Renforcement Institutionnel:      Le projet a partiellement realise les objectifs
institutionnels vises.  Les activites entreprises et les resultats atteints sont g6ndralement
satisfaisants:
a)    le projet a donne une experience de travail a 135 organismes de base d'execution
(OE), a finance la formation de cadres des mairies, des OE et des minist6res
centraux;
b)    le projet a finance: i) un appui aux inunicipalites et aux conseils d'administration
des sections communales (CASEC) comprenant des equipements, des fournitures
de bureaux: et des etudes urbaines (schemas d'amenagement urbains, renforcement



de la fiscalite municipale, etudes socio-economiques), ii) des dquipements aux
Ministeres de l'Inte'neur, de l'Agriculture et des Travaux Publics, iii) la formation
des cadres de ces ministeres et de certaines municipalites;
c)   le projet n'a pas atteint l'objectif de developper une strategie nationale a plus long
terme en vue de favoriser la creation d'emplois dans les zones economiquement
defavorisees, ni de creer une agence nationale de maitrise d'ouvrage deleguie
(genre AGETIP) a meme de mettre en oeuvre une telle strategie.
EVALUATION DE LA PERFORMANCE DE LA BANQUE MONDIALE (Par l'UCG)
3.    Malgr6 la rapidite avec laquelle le Gouvernement et la Banque Mondiale (BM) ont prepar6 le
proj et (2 mois), la performance de la BM a dte hautement satisfaisante dans l'identification, la preparation
et evaluation du.projet. Pendant l'execution du projet, elle a appuye fortement le suivi de la mise en
oeuvre du projet Cependant, elle stest montrie inflexible quant a l'application de la regle de 60% du
contenu de la main d'oeuvre dans chaque sous-projet.
EVALUATION DE LA PERFORMANCE DE L'UCG ET MDOD
4.    En ce qui a trait a la composante Creation d'Emplois, la performance de ITUCG et des MDOD
a ete hautement satisfaisante. Quant a la composante institutionnelle, elle a demarre avec un important
retard, ce qui a reduit le temps d'execution, la performance et la qualite de cette composante. Toutefois
cette composante a ete bien appreciee par les instances beneficiaires.
IMACT DU PROGRAMME
5.    Le projet a eu divers impacts socio-economiques: creation d'emplois, avantages econorniques de
l'arneIioration de l'infastructure et services de base, injection de numeraires dans les economnies locales,
appui au renforcement de la capacited'une vingtaine de mairies, appui au processus d'organisation de la
soci6te rurale, formation d'ouvriers specialises et developpement du secteur prive rniral.
AUTRES APPORTS DU PCE
6.    i) constitution d'un cadre methodologique sur les travaux a haute intensite de main d'oeuvre;
ii) developpement d'une experience locale dans 1'6valuation environnementale de sous-projets;
iii) renforcement de trois MDOD dont une haltienne;
iv) constitution d'un reseau d'OE crddibles et competentes;
v) distribution d'outils aux organismes locaux;
vii) renforcement au Cap-Haitien de Ia capacite de production et de distribution de composte a



partir du traitement d'ordures menageres (dont 70% d'origine organique).
RAPPORTS
7.    Les rapports suivants sont encore a recevoir de l'UCG: i) rapport technique et financier final; ii)
rapport d'audit de fin de projet; iii) rapport final de l'etude economique du PCE; iv) rapport final sur la
disposition des outils, materiels et vehicules; v) rapport d'ivaluation des formations (composante de
Renforcement Institutionnel); vi) rapport final du PNUD/HABITAT.
AUDIT
8.    La mission a re,u le rapport d'audit couvrant la periode se terminant au 30 decembre 1996 et date
du 24 janvier 1997. Ce rapport recommande un certain nombre d'amrliorations dans la gestion
administrative des MDOD et de la documentation des depenses.
Recommandation:   Le rapport final d'audit devrait inclure: i) une opinion sur les etat
financiers; ii) une opinion sur les comptes sp6ciaux; iii) une opinion sur les
Etats de Depenses (SOE) prepares par l'UCG; et iv) urne opinion finale sur
I'administration comptable du projet.
RECUPERATION DES AVANCES SUR TRAVAUX
9.    Un montant approximatif de US$541,000 (soit environ 1.3% du montant de la composant de
Creation d'Emplois) reste Ajustifier ou a etre recouvre par lUCG avant le 31 juillet 1997, date de cloture
du compte du projet a Washington. L'UCG s'engage a recuperer les pieces justificatives des d6penses
eligibles ou tout montant non justifie pour remboursement a l'IDA. S'il averait impossible de recup&er
ces montants des OE, l'Emprunteur (en l'occurrence, le Ministere de l'Economie et des Finances), aura
la responsabilitd de rembourser le dit montant a l'IDA tel que specifie dans l'Accord de Credit 2765-HA
(Annexe 4, paragraphe 6). L'UCG revesera dgalement dans les meilleurs delais a l'IDA les reliquats
rcouvrds des MDOD ainsi que les balances des comptes speciaux moins les depenses justifi6es.
PROGRAMME FUTUR DU PROJET
10.   En accord avec la section 3.03 de I'Accord de Credit, I'Emprunteur a organisd un seminaire de
cl6ture de projet pendant lequel des actions futures potentielles ont etd revues et d6battues. Les
representants de l'IDA ont formuld des commentaires sur ces plans d'action. Cependant les actions
demandent des financements suppilmentaires qui ne sont pas encore disponibles.



RAPPORT D'EXECUTION DE PROJET (ICR)

U.S.A.
Dear M. WERBROOK:
At the UCG we have read the english version of the Implementation Completion Report
(ICR ) dated september 15, 1997. In general, we concur with the facts, ideas and opinions
found in the report.
We have, however, three (3) comments:
i)    Contrarily to what was noted in p.12, we believe this project had a considerable
stabilizing effect not only on the short term macroeconomic situation but also on the short
term political environnement. An average of additional 35.000 jobs over an 18 month
period is considerable. This is equivalent to the number of jobs in the government sector
and a multiple of jobs in the export industry sector. In september and october 1996, the
project had 62.000 jobs. This coincided with the start of the school year (october), which is
always a difficult time financially for people in a country where most families are poor and
most schools are private because of a lack of public funding for education at all levels.
As the program approached its end and the number of jobs started reaching very low levels,
the country entered a period of political instability from which it has not emerged yet.
2)    Today, the need of this type of employment program is more widely recognized.
Elected officials. especially, have now acknowledged the important role played by small
projects of high labor content. A program with a labor content of 40% on the average will
now find a secure ground of acceptance among a wide range of policy makers.

3)    The loss of dollar revenue from the loan due to the change in the SDR exchange
rate was a surprise for us at the end of the program. This affected the budget of institutional
development. Cuts had to be introduced at the last minute.
We recommend that steps be made at the Bank to avoid these kinds of surprises.
We thank you on behalf of the UCG.

RESUME EXECUTIF
Le Programme de Creation d'Emplais (PCE! a e  n6goci6 entre la Banque Mondiale et le
Gouvernement Haitien au cours des mois de mai a juililet 1995 dans un contexte de recent retour
a l'ordre constitutionnel et de la nbcessite d'une intervention d'urgence au benefice des couches
les plus d6favoris6eS de la population suite a la grave crise politique qu'a vecue le pays durant les
trois (3) ann6es precedentes.
Le Programme, qui comprenait une Comrosante de Creation d'Emplois et uns Composante
de Renforcement Institutionnel, poursuivait deux (2) grands objectifs:
Creation de 487.000 ,personnes-mois d'emplois a travers notamment des travaux de
rehabilitation de certaines infrastructures locales
* Renforcement de la capacite de certaines administrations nationales, municipales et
locales
L'Unite Centrale de GeVtion (UCG) a 6t6 choisie par le Gouvernement Haitien comme
Agent d'Ex6cution du Programme.
La strategie generale de mise en oeuvre :u Programme repose sur l'utilisation des services
de Maitres d'Ouvrage Delegues (MOOD) pour a reaiisation de certaines operations-clefs telles
notamment la realisation des etudes des prc;ets, 1'encadrement des organismes charges de
1'ex6cution des projets ainsi que la supervision ies travaux. L'execution des projets est assuree
par des Organismes d'Exbcution (OE) qui sont eni grande partie des groupements communautaires
et des organisations d'aide au developpement. En tant qu'Agent d'Ex6cution du PCE, I'UCG est
responsable de la planification et du suivi de ('ensemble du Programme.
L'Accord de Credit 2765-HA relatif a i'execution du PCE a e  signe entre la Banque
Mondiale et le Gouvernement Haitien le 13 juillet 1995. Le premier projet du Programme a
demarre physiquement sur le terrain le 18 septembre 1995. La fin officielle des activites du
Programme est intervenue le 30 avril 1997. L'exbcution des projets generateurs d'emplois s'est
en principe etendue sur une p6riode d'environ 15 mois.
Au niveau de la Composante de Creation d'Emplois, les projaets du PCE refirent aux
cirq (5) categories de travaux suivants: i) Rehabilitation de Petits Perimetres Irrigues; ii)
Conservation des Sols et des Eaux; iii) Assainissement et adoquinage de rues en milieu urbain; iv)
Re aration de pistes rurales; v) Rehabilitation et extension de petits systemes d'Adduction d'Eau
Pozable.



Ces categaries de travaux ont ete retenues en raison de leur potentialite  aoccuper une
main d'oeuvre abandante. De fait, 1'exigence fandamentale du PCE est que chaque prajet doit
allouer au moins 60% de son budget au paiement de la main d'oeuvre non qualifiee.
Le PCE a permis la mise en oeuvre de 158 petits projets d'intert communautaire au
niveau des 9 departements gbagraphiques du pays. Environ 96 communes ont ete touchees par
les interventions du Programme.
Un nombre total de 135 OE ont participe a la mise en oeuvre des projets du PCE sous la
supersion de 4 MOOD: la PADF, le CECI, la CHF et le COS. Au cours de la p6riode d'execution du
Programme, une quantite globale de 475.691 personnes-mois ont e  crHes. Cela sous-entend
qu'avec seulement la mise en oeuvre du PCE, le Gouvernement a, pendant une periode de 15
mois, cree des emplois temporaires pour une moyenne mensuelle de 32.000 personnes.
Les extrants physiques globales des 158 projets du PCE peuvent etre synthetises comme
suit:
Curage de plus 2.000 km de canaux d'irrigation, ameliorant ainsi la situation de la
presence de 1'eau sur plus de 62.000 hectares dissemines dans les 9 departements
g6ographiques.
- Amenagement de 13.000 hectares de terre dans les bassins versants les plus d6grad6s
et traitement de 600 km de ravines a travers le pays
- Adoquinage de 13.5 km de rue dans 10 villes importantes du pays, enlevement de
272.600 m3 de dechets solides et amenagement de 4 sites de decharge dans 4
principales villes de province.
* Rparation d'enviran 700 km de routes tertiaires au niveau des villages, bourgs et
communautes rurales.
-Rehabilitationlextension de 18 petits systemes d'adduction d'eau potable au niveau de
plusieurs villes secondaires, en milieu rural et meme au niveau d'un grand quartier
populaire d'une importante ville de province.
Au niveau de la Composante de Renforcement Institutionnel, le bilan global des
rbalisations peut se resumer comme indique ci-apres:
- Etudes urbaines au profit surtout des 9 chef-lieux de departement et des 5 Mairies de la
Region Metropolitaine dans la perspective du developpement futur de ces communes
- Support logistique aux MARNOR et aux TPTC et leurs representants en province dans le
cadre de la decentralisation des services de l'Etat (mat&riel roulant, o.rdinateurs etc.)



* Appui a la formation de cadres de l'Etat Central, de l'Etat regional et de l'Etat local sur
les aspects modernes de gestion administrative, gestion comptable et gestion des projets
de developpement.
* Appui a la formation des Maires et des caissiers-payeurs des toutes les Mairies du pays.
* Appui a la formation de 1373 membres de CASEC au niveau du pays tout entier.
* Oistribution d'equipements (bureaux, chaises et autres) a tous les 565 CASEC du pays
et 132 Mairies.
* Appui a l'assainissement et a I'am6nagement des sites de decharge dans 4 villes
principales du pays.
* Recuparation des biens entre les mains des MOOD et distribution de ces biens a des
organismes d'Etat.
En addition aux travaux realises, I'un des plus grands m6rites du PCE a ete de faire arriver
I'argent au niveau des couches sociales les plus desheritees. Apres tout, c'etait le principal
objectif du Programme.
Les budgets des projets executes accusent un montant global de l'ordre de 525 millions
de gourdes. De ce montant, pres de 347 millions de gourdes (environ 67%) ont e  depensees
sous forms de salaires au b6ndfice de la main d'oeuvre non qualifiee.
Selon une etude d'evaluation independante, I'argent recu par les beneficiaires directs a ete
d6pens6e a 60% pour I'achat de biens de consommation (nourriture, habillement, sante, loyer...) et
A 40% pour l'achat de biens d'investissement (education, outillage, animaux, commerce ...)
L'ex6cution du PCE nous a permis de degager les lecons suivantes:
i) 11 y a dans le pays une tres forte demande pour les travaux de creation d'emplois
ii) Le PCE represente pour l'Etat un ban outil pour atteindre les coins les plus recules du
pays.  11 est particulierement bien  adapte pour attaquer les problimes lids a
l'environnement (curage, conservation de sol et de l'eau, stabilisation de ravines,
reboisement etc...)
iii) Le concept de MOOD introduit dans le PCE est positif; car, il permet A l'Etat d'agir
avec plus de ceierite tout en augmentant sa capacite de coordination et de supervision



iv) Une supervision serree des travaux ainsi qu' une bonne integration des autorites
locales et des elus locaux constituent deux facteurs-clefs du succs d'un programme de
ce genre
v) L'exigence d'allouer au moins 60% du budget de chaque projet a la main d'oeuvre non
quaiifiee doit etre abandonnee. Une moyenne de 40% sur l'ensemble de I'enveloppe
apparalt plus realiste. La reduction dans les emplois crees serait largement compens6e
par une plus grande durabilite des travaux et un plus grand soutien aux communautes
pauvres des villes.
vi) Une animation bien orientbe est une nbcessitb d'une extreme importance pour un
progamme de ce genre.
vii) Dans le meme ordre d'id6es, le renforcement institutionnel s'av6re une composante
absolument indispensable du PCE..
viii) L'enveloppe de 50 millions de dollars US a depenser sur une periode d'une annee est
acceptable mais en augmentant le nombre de MOOD.
ix) L'adoption des mairies comme OE a constitub une bonne expbrience: on aboutit a de
tres bons rbsultats chaque fois que la mairie est aidbe par un comitb d'appui technique.
x) Compte tenu du faible niveau de profit des projets du Programme, les firmes priv4es
dprouvent de grandes difficultbs A opbrer comme OE.
Le secteur prive a caractere social (ONG, Cooperative, Groupement Communautaire ...)
presente des avantages comparatifs dans ce sens. 11 est possible cependant d'apporter des
changements au Programme de facon a mener les taux de profits a un niveau normal at ainsi
attirer les firmes privees succeptibles d'tre des mains plus expertes.
Compte tenu de la 6eme journbe de travail apportee sous forme de contribution volontaire
(contre partie locale), 1'exbcution du Programme aura coutb globalement la somme approximative
de 52.000.000 de US dollars. De ce montant global, environ 90% ont tet apportes par la Banque
Mondiale au titre de l'Accord de Credit 2765-HA. Les 1 0% restants ont e pour leur part
apportes par les organismes d'bxecution des projets et les bbnbficiaires directs des travaux sous
ia forme de cette journee volontaire de travail par semaine.
