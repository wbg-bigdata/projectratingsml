INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPPMNT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOiM}ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA FOR A POPULATION
PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $21.2
million on standard terms to help finance a population project in the States
of Mysore and Uttar Pradesh. The project would be financed jointly with
Sweden, which would make available a grant in Kronor for the equivalent
of US $10.6 million. The Association would act as executing agency, with
responsibility for project supervision and for disbursement of its credit
and the Swedish grant.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.       This credit would be the Bank Group's first lending operation in
India for family planning. The Government of India (GOI) has adopted
national family planning policy as an integral part of its development
planning, and an elaborate multi-disciplinary organization exists for
coordination, guidance and services both at the Center and in the States.
Accomplishments so far are considerable, but following a surge of activities
in the middle 1960s, program performance over recent years has been levelling
off. The project, experimental in nature, is aimed at assisting the GOI
in making their family planning program more effective.
3.       My Report and Recommendation on a proposed credit for the Seventh
Industrial Imports Credit Project will be distributed before the end
of this fiscal year.    If approved by you, these two credits would complete
the FY 1972 lending program for India, totalling US $60 million in Bank
lending and US $412 million in IDA credits (of which US $158 million would
be subject to IDA replenishment).
4.       In FY 1973, I expect to present you with recommendations on lending
for projects which will reflect priorities established by the Government
of India in several sectors. They would include lending for power transmission
and telecommunications, as well as several operations in agriculture - irrigation,
agricultural credit and regulated agricultural markets. I also expect to
recommend further lending for increasing capacity for the manufacture of
fertilizers. Plans are fairly well advanced for assistance to small industrial
firms, in keeping with the importance the GOI pays to industry. This would
be the Bank Group's first operation in this field in India, as would also
be a planned credit for an urban water supply and sewerage project. There
is also a possibility that FY 1973 lending will include lending for urban
development.
5.       Since 1949, the Bank has made 40 loans to India, amounting to
US $1,111.2 million, and the Association 42 credits amounting to US $1,740.0
million, both net of cancellations. A summary statement of loans and
credits as of April 30, 1972, is in Annex I, together with comments on the
status of disbursements of certain loans and credits.

6.       Since 1957, IFC has made 13 investments in India totalling
US $42.3 million, of which US $3.9 million has been repaid, US $5.9 million
sold and US $6.3 million cancelled or terminated.  Of the balance,
US $18.0 million represents loans and US $8.2 million equity. The
largest commitment to date has been US $18.9 million to Zuari Agro-Chemicals
Limited for a fertilizer plant in Goa. A summary statement of IFC
investments as of April 30, 1972 is in Annex I.
7.       The population project was prepared jointly with the GOI, the State
Governments of iMysore and Uttar Pradesh and the Swedish International
Development Authority (SIDA), and appraised in July and October 1971. In
January, 1972 a mission visited India to develop a specific component of the
project dealing with nutrition. Negotiations were conducted in Washington
from April 26 through May 4L, 1972. The Borrower was represented by
Mr. R.N. Madhok, Additional Secretary, Department of Family Planning,
Mr. D.N. Chaudri, Director, Department of Family Planning, Mr. S. Guhan,
Special Assistant to Planning Minister, and Dr. L.V. Phatak, Commissioner for
Family Planning. The Government of Mysore was represented by Mr. B.S. Hanuman,
Health Secretary and Mr. P.R. Desai, Director Health, and the Government of
Uttar Pradesh was represented by Dr. J.K. Anand, Deputy Director Health,
Mr. B. Narain, Finance Secretary, and Mr. S.P. Pande, Health Commissioner.
Mr. C. Lidgard, Economic Counsellor, Swedish Embassy, and Mrs. B. Johansson,
Mr. K. Markensten and Mr. 0. Poluha of SIDA, represented the Government of
Sweden.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
8.       The year 1971/72 was one of the most difficult India has faced since
Independence. Resources, physical as well as fiscal, were greatly strained
by events in East Pakistan, the influx of nearly ten million refugees, and
the outbreak of hostilities in December, 1971. The economy responded as
well as might be expected to this challenge; the increased fiscal burden
was largely met, the resources required for refugee relief and defense were
mobilized in time, and prices and the balance of payments were kept under
control.
9.       The economy continued to grow during 1971/72, but at a pace slower
than envisaged in the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The growth of national income
in 1969/70 came to somewhat less than the Plan target of 5.5 percent and,
in 1970/71, the rate will probably be a little less than 5 percent.
Indications for 1971/72 are that the rate of growth will be of the order of
4 percent. Sectorial contributions to the growth of national income are not
in accordance with the pattern envisaged by the Plan. While the output of
foodgrains has been increasing sharply, industry appears to have relapsed
into relative stagnation.
10.      Despite all the difficulties faced in 1971/72, India was able to
maintain the pace of public sector development at about the planned level
in financial terms, and this with only moderate inflation. But satisfaction
over this achievement has to be tempered, since it was accompanied by a
continuing low level of investment in private industry. In aggregate terms,
there has been a slight decline in the rate of savings to NDP during the
first three years of the Plan (8.4 percent of NDP in 1968/69 against an
estimated 8.2 percent in 1971/72), on account of the low saving in the public



- 3 -
sector. Public sector outlays have, therefore, been met to an extent larger
than expected, by drawing on private savings. However, the Government of
India expects domestic savings to increase to 9.5 percent and 10.2 percent
of NDP in 1972/73 and 1973/74 respecti.vely3 large-ly owing to i.nxroved
public sector savings - for which the 1972/73 bud-7et gives good hopes. During
the first three years of the Plan, per capita income increased only by the
equivalent of US $2.40 at constant prices   Given tlhe small-ess of this
increase, it is not suprising that i;; was entirely absorbed sy con;Twnption
and that the savings ratio did not imp,rove. There is no doubt that in the
long run, a slow-down of population growth, which would allow some acceleration
in the growth of per capita income, would also help to raise the marginal
rate of savings.
11.      Net transfers from abroad are expected to decline slightly from
1.0 percent to 0.8 percent of NDP during the two remaining years of the
Fourth Plan. It is hoped that Jn the fifth year of the Plan total investment
would be about 11 percent of NDP as compared to about 13 percent postulated
when the Plan was drawn. Contribution of net foreign assistance to total
investment is unlikely to be much more than 7 percent in 1973/74.
PART III - THE I\DIAN FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM
12.      According to the 1971 census, the population of India was about
547 million and was growing by some 12 million people every year. The
population has doubled since 1920, and if the present growth rate were
unchanged, it would double again over the next 30 years only to reach
1.1 billion at the turn of the century. While the birth rate over recent
decades has remained at about 40 per 1,000, a continuously declining
mortality, now at 17 per 1,000, results in a growth rate of about 2.25 percent.
The rapid growth of the population has an adverse effect on India's efforts
to raise the welfare of its people; in the sixties, more than 60 percent of
the growth in income has been absorbed by the increasing population. The
net addition to the labor force (which totalled about 200 million in the
late sixties) is about 4 million annually, of which 80 percent is in rural
areas. No reliable information is available on the actual amount of
unemployment or under-employment, but a rough estimate shows that to eliminate
unemployment, about 40 million new jobs would have to be created in the
1971-75 period and about 75 million jobs over the next decade.
13.      Since the early fifties, the GOI has become increasingly aware of the
problems related to the rapid growth of population. The Government pro-
claimed an official population policy in 1951, but it was only in the mid-
sixties that this was translated into specific goals. In 1967, the Government
decided to encourage couples in the reproductive ages (15-44), at present
about 98 million couples, to adopt effective family planning, through activities
which:
(a) promote acceptance of the concept of the small family;
(b) assure that all individuals have personal knowledge about
family planning methods; and
(c) make services and supplies readily available.



- 4 -
In quantitative terms, the goal set by the GOI is to reduce by 1980 the
birth rate to 2.5percent, and the growth rate to 1.5 percent.
14.      The GOI has impressive achievements to its credit in the national
family planning. Financed almost entirely by the GOI and implemented by the
States, the program is integrated with the health services. An administra-
tive machine of more than 60,000 people has been set up; a mass information
campaign has been launched; an approach was introduced to provide services
at central points for groups of villages; postpartum programs were initia-
ted in selected large hospitals of several cities; and recently, a
Pregnancy Termination Bill was passed. Sterilization (male and female),
IDs and conventional contraceptives (mostly condoms) are the main famaily
planning services offered.
15.      In the five-year period 1966-67/1970-71, actual annual expenditure
for the family planning program rose from about US $19 million equivalent
to US $63 million equivalent. The nu1mber of new acceptors also increased
over the same period, from about 2.4 million to some 3.8 million. However,
while the average expenditure per 1,000 populations on the rise, the
number of reported acceptors in the program has levelled off in the last
year or two, and sterilizations and IUDs already show a downward trend. At
present, about 11 percent of all couples are protected by contraceptive
methods and the birth rate may have been reduced by at most three points,
from 41 per 1,000 to 38 per 1,000. To reduce the population from an expec-
ted total of 1.1 billion, if present trends continue, to 800 million in the
year 2000, the percentage of couples practicing contraception will have to
be increased to 50-60 percent by 1980, which will require a very effective
program.
16.      Several factors have contributed toward the recent levelling off.
Attitudes toward family size, illiteracy, a large rural population and low
standards of living interact in limiting total effective demand. Moreover,
the supply of services is hampered by a scarcity of para-medical personnel
at field levels and the low quality of their training. Also, a shift has
occurred towards contraceptive methods which are generally considered to be
less effective. But while these factors are clearly important, no compre-
hensive analysis has been undertaken, to determine the relative importance
of these and other factors, and thus to develop a strategy for improving
the effectiveness of the program. The present project is designed to assist
the GOI in this task.
PART 3T - THE PROJECT
17.      A report entitled "Appraisal Report of a Population Project, India"
(PP-9b dated May 15, 1972) is being distributed separately. A credit and
project summary is at Annex III.
18.      The proposed five-year project is designed to assist the GO0 in
developing a Management Information and Evaluation System (MIES) that would



meet the need for a systematic analysis of program data which would result
in recommendations on a continuing basis for developing new approaches
relevant to the whole program. Conceived as an applied research-oriented
program, the project would cover five districts in NIysore, including Bangalore,
and six districts in Uttar Pradesh, including Lucknow, with a combined
population of about 20 million. In these two States, districts with varying
conditions have been selected in order to produce performance data as
representative as possible for varied conditions faced naturally by the
Indian family planning program. A basic feature of the project is the
establishment of two P    ation Centers, one in Bangalore and the other in
Lucknow, to develop the MIES, which will collect and analyze performance
data (see also paragraph 21). These data will be generated from four main
project activities:
(a) An Urban Program would be tested in Bangalore and
Lucknow. It will concentrate upon motivation and
family planning services to recently delivered
mothers, be they women who deliver in hospitals
or at home.
(b) An Optimal GOI Projram would also'be implemented
throughout the project areas. By providing all the
staff and facilities which the national family
planning program would provide if it had sufficient
resources, the effectiveness of the GOI pattern will
be tested. This part of the project is intended to
discover whether the present system could bring about
the declines in fertility which are the targets of
the program, and the reasons for success or failure.
(c) An Intensive Rural Program would concentrate on
recently delivered mothers in rural areas. It will
test how additional inputs in parts of the project
areas -- two districts each of Mysore and Uttar
Pradesh -- may influence the effectiveness of the
GOI pattern. The project areas selected will repre-
sent different levels of socio-economic development.
To support all these activities, the project would provide buildings and
hostel accommodation for training of Auxiliary Nurse-lidwives (AN1iMs) and
tutors in mid-wifery practice, delivery and child care, and rural health
practice in each State. In all, the construction component of the project
includes more than 1,500 buildings for administration, training and family
planning services; and about 230 jeeps, ambulances, mini-buses and mobile vans.
(d)  Finally, a Nutrition Component, covering one district in
Mysore and a         area (a development block) in Uttar
Pradesh, would be set up.



19.      This component, experimental by design, has two objectives:
(a) to determine the effect that improved nutrition
for infants and mothers will have on the acceptance
of family planning services, both directly as an
incentive and indirectly via the effect of a
decline in infant mortality on the desire for
children; and
(b) to test the best means of providing nutrition.
This program would provide supplementary feeding for women during the last
three months of pregnancy and the first six weeks of lactation, and to
infants aged 6-24 months; the women would collect their weekly supply of
food at selected sub-centers. In the first two years, this component
would be tested in two blocks in Mysore and one block in Uttar Pradesh.
On the basis of a joint review between Mysore, Sweden and the Association
during the third year, the desirability and method of expanding these
activities in Mysore to a district-wide basis would be determined. In
Uttar Pradesh, the project provides funds for a modest expansion beyond
one block if the mid-term review should determine that this is technically
and administratively feasible without prejudice to other project components.
Project Implementation
20.      Project implementation would be the responsibility of the two
States, in each of which a Governing Board is being set up under the
chairmanship of the Chief Secretary. This Board, which would meet quarterly,
would be responsible for broad policy formulation, for reviewing progress
of the family planning program and the construction program, and for
approving suggestions for innovation and experimentation in project areas.
Four groups in each State would be responsible for project execution,
headed by a Project Family Planning Officer for the family planning
program, a Nutrition Project Officer for the nutrition component, a
Superintending Engineer for the Project Construction Unit, and the Director
of the Population Center. The heads of these groups would be part of the
Board, to which the Director of the Population Center would have a direct
reporting relationship. For necessary coordination of project activities,
a State Project Coordinator supported by adequate staff would be appointed,
linked to the Office of the Secretary of Health. The Project Construction
Unit will operate within each State Ministry of Health, and the Superin-
tending Engineer in each, provided with adequate staff, will supervise the
building program. The Chief Architect of the Central Public Works Depart-
ment, OI, will serve as a consultant to each governing Board for the
coordination of the physical and financial elements of the project.



-7-
Population Centers
21.      Each Population Center would cover the project area in its State.
Its basic functions would be to develop the experimental design of the
project, and to devise and implement a system for the collection and
analysis of data, in order to guide program operations and evaluate the
program. Research would also be initiated, by the Centers or appropriate
agencies, to assess existing program components and to test new program
elements; and persomnel will be trained in data collection and analysis.
The Centers will be headed by persons experienced in evaluation and manage-
ment methodology. The Head of each Center will be supported by four
assistant directors and a staff of 20-30 research assistants and investigators.
To initiate and support the Population Centers, the services of two Indian
management institutes will be employed. These institutes have been selected
on the basis of their management capability and orientation, and GOI has
agreed to provide direct support to each institute to make it more effective.
Project Costs and Financine
22.      The total costs of the project excluding land, are estimated at
about US $32 million equivalent. The land would be provided by the GOI,
which would also bear the cost of recurrent expenditures in project areas
over the project period estimated at about US $12.5 million equivalent,
mainly for salaries of personnel. This contribution from the GOI to
project-related activities would be part of expenditures to the tune of
about US $500 million equivalent, which the GOI would spend during the
project period on family planning activities, of which about US $100 million
equivalent would be spent in the two States of Mysore and Uttar Pradesh.
23.      The foreign exchange component of less than US $2 million includes
construction, furniture and equipment costs (US$1.0 million), technical
assistance and some technical equipment for the Population Centers. Of the
total cost, about US $12.6 million (40%) is for civil works; about US
$3.85 million (12%) for equipment and furniture; about US $0.8 million
(2.5%) for the GOI's direct support to the Indian management institutes to
be employed by Mysore and Uttar Pradesh; about US $1.9 million (6%) for
technical assistance to Mysore and Uttar Pradesh; about US $0.85 million
(2.5%) for vehicles; about US $2.1 million (6.5%) for nutrition; about
US $4.6 million (14.5%) for incremental recurrent costs; and about US
$5.1 million (16%) for contingencies.
24.      Sweden and the Association would Jointly finance the total project
cost, pari-passu, on a one-to-two ratio. Sweden would thus participate
with the equivalent of US $10.6 million -- as a grant -- and the Association
would extend a credit of US $21.2 million equivalent. In broad terms, the
Joint-financing arrangement would cover expenditures under the project for
three main purposes, namely:



- 8 -
(a)  investments in plant (buildings, furniture, equipment,
vehicles) to complete and supplement the GOI pattern
in project areas;
(b) the nutrition component; and
(c) incremental recurrent costs for the innovative parts of
the project (the intensive rural component and the
Population Centers).
One result of tho project is a commitment by the GOI to speed up its
expenditures in the project areas to ensure that the level of inputs envi-
saged in the GOI plan is achieved more rapidly than in non-project districts.
This commitment from the GOI would not require it to divert funds out of its
regular budget for non-project areas, and would thus not discriminate against
the provision of family planning services outside the project areas.
25.      The nutrition component, the intensive rural component and the
Population Centers would all incur costs incremental to the GOI's regular
budget for family planning services and these costs would be jointly
financed 100 percent by Sweden and the Association. The nutrition component
inevitably has a high proportion of recurrent expenditures. Because it is
an experiment, there is no guarantee that it will prove successful and
continue beyond the project period. Similarly, the intensive rural compo-
nent and the MIES will involve expenditures strictly related to basic
features of the experimental design of the project. In these circums-
tances, and until project evaluation determines how permanent all these
"experiment-related" expenditures are to be, the financing provided by
Sweden and the Association will cover these costs; once project results
are known, their policy implications for the whole national family planning
program can be reviewed by the GOI with appropriate adjustments in budgetary
allocations from its own normal resources.
Procurement
26.      The building program, phased over four years, contains more than
1,500 buildings widely dispersed over a large area. Its execution, there-
fore, would not be suitable for international competitive bidding. The same
would apply to furniture, which is of unsophisticated design and in ample
supply locally. However, any contracts for equipment estimated to cost the
equivalent of US $100,000 or more would be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding, with domestic manufacturers accorded a preferen-
tial margin equal to 15 percent of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports or
to the existing rate of duty, whichever is lower. As to vehicles, the
Indian Family Program already employs a number of vehicles of the types
which would be procured under the proposed credit. It would be in the two
State Government's best interest to adhere to these types, for reasons of
standardization of spare parts and availability of servicing facilities and
they will be procured through normal commercial channels.



-9-
Justification of the Project
27.      Itis particularly difficult to evaluate the demographic and socio-
economic effects of this project because of its experimental and innovative
nature;  like other research, its socio-economic benefits will depend on
the implementation of the findings that emerge.   It is likely that results
will more than justify the expenditure, not only directly but particularly
in terms of the "spin-off" or demonstration effects on the Indian program
as a whole. In addition to improving the overall conduct of the Indian
family planning program, the project is expected to have large social
benefits -- such as improving the health and welfare of mothers and children,
improving the physical and mental development of the population through
better nutrition in the critical first years of life, etc. In addition, the
direct and quantifiable effects of this project are estimated as follows:
in Mysore as a result of the project about 2.3 million births are expected
to be prevented between 1973 and 2000;   in Uttar Pradesh, the corresponding
figure is about 1.5 million births.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMETS AND AUTHORITY
28.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Joint Financing Agreement between India, the Kingdom
of Sweden and the Association, the draft Mysore Agreement between the
Kingdom of Sweden, the State of Mysore and the Association, the draft Uttar
Pradesh Agreement between the Kingdom of Sweden, the State of Uttar Pradesh
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
29.      The Joint Financing Agreement contains provisions similar to other
such agreements executed on the occasion of joint financing with Sweden of
other projects.  The Mysore and the Uttar Pradesh Agreements follow the
pattern of agreements with other States of India executed on the occasion
of other projects. To the extent possible, the legal documents incorporate
the terms of references for different tasks to be undertaken by third
parties in carrying out the Project.
30.      I am satisfied that the proposed development credit will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
31.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

Co PROCTS IN EXECUTION
1.        Of the undisbursed loans, the longest outstanding is Loan 307-IN
of 1961 to the Indian Imn Steel Corporation (IISCO) for the development
of its collieries, A memorandum to the Executive Directors of July 9,
1970 (R70-135) proposing to postpone the closing date to June 30, 1974
explained the technical and other problems which beset this project.
It is anticipated that disbursements will be completed by the revised
closing date of June 30, 1974.
2.         It was agreed in 1970 that the balance of Credit 89-IN (Beas
Equipment Project) should be allocated to Stage II of the project and
major purchases will be made later this year. As to the Taral Seeds
Project (614-IN), technical considerations regarding required machinery
caused some delay but tenders have now been offered and disbursements
should now accelerate.
3.         Under the Eadana Irrigation Project (176-IN), requests for
reimbursement of civil works expenditures are now being received more regularly
since work on the dam resumed with departmental force account labor
following suspension of the main contractor. Disbursements of the Bank's
recent loans to ICICI (683-IN and 789-IN) have not kept uip with original
forecasts and closing dates have had to be postponed. These loans were
affected by the 1966-68 recession which lengthened the intervals between
ICICIls approval of sub-projects and actual commitment of disbursement of
Bank's funds. More rapid disbursement is IIow expected.
4.         Gujarat (Credit 191-ITT), Punjab (Credit 203-IN) and Andhra Pradesh
(Credit 226-IN) are showing slo,m-r progress than anticipated I--t; the'e 'aas
been a recent accelerationi in disbursements in respect of the n,nor irrigation
components of all but the two most recently approved of these projects. This
trend is expected to continue. A major cause of delay results from tractor
procurement problems, Finally, for the Agro-Aviation Project (23iO-:N),
disbursements are about nine moLths behind schedule, as prequal'ificat:ion
of aircraft supplies is still ottstanding.
