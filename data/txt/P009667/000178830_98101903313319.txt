INDIA: POPULATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a population project for India for which
and IDA credit of U.S.$ 21.2 million is proposed. The Swedish International
Development Authority (SIDA) helped develop the project and the Swedish
Government will make a grant of U.S. $10.6 million.  The Association will
act as executing agent, with responsibility for project supervision and
for disbursement of the IDA credit and Swedish Grant.
ii.       The annual growth rate of the Indian population of 2.25% and
the addition of 12 million persons each year has been a matter of serious
concern to the Government of India (GOI) in their efforts at social and
economic development. The population growth rate is twice as high as in
the 1920's, and given the large possibilities for further decline in the
death rate, may further increase in the future. The success of family
planning efforts will be a critical factor. Depending on this, the
population of India can be expected to increase from 547 million in
1971 to between 800 million and 1.1 billion in the year 2000.
iii.      While the GOI was the first to proclaim an official population
policy in 1951, it was only in 1965 that a large scale and concerted
effort was made to expand the national family planning program. Since
then the GOI has to its credit a list of impressive achievements; pro-
gram targets to reduce the birth rate to 25 per 1,000 population by
1980 were set; a vast administrative machinery, currently employing
more than 80,000 persons was set up in a few years; a mass-information
campaign that greatly increased awareness was implemented; the intra-
uterine device (IUD) was introduced and sterilization was offered with
compensation payments offered to acceptors of these methods; the camp-
approach was introduced to provide services at central points for groups
of villages; postpartum programs were initiated in selected large hos-
pitals of several cities; country-wide schemes for the commercial dis-
tribution of condoms at subsidized rates were initiated; and more
recently the Pregnancy Termination Bill was passed. As a result,
acceptors of contraceptive methods have steadily increased from
200,000 in 1960-61 to 3.8 million in 1970-71; but progress has been
uneven with acceptors levelling off in the last 2 years. After the
introduction of the IUD in 1965-66, a peak was reached 2 years later
but this was followed by a large decline; this pattern was also true
for vasectomies. The decline in IUDs and vasectomies was counteracted
principally by a large increase in condom distribution, and to a lesser
extent, by tubectomies. As a result of these efforts, about 11% of all
couples are currently estimated to be protected and the birth rate may
have been reduced by, at most, three points -- from 41 to 38 per 1,030
population.
iv.       Prospects for the future are uncertain.  The program suffers
from severe constraints. The supply of services is hampered by a
scarcity of personnel at the field levels, the low quality of their
training, overcentralization and a shift to less effective contracep-
tive methods.  Illiteracy, a large rural popu;ation and low standards
of living all conspire to put an upper ceiling on the total effective



- ii -
demand that can be expected. And yet, room for optimism uiidov;itvdWt
exists.  Success has been demonstrated in some areas with little
additional inputs.  More to the point, a recent study suggests that
a substantial part of the variability observed between States and
between Districts of the State is due to program efforts.
v.        While there is undoubtedly a large potential for improvin-
performance within the existing demand constraints, it is not yet
exactly clear what needs to be done to exploit this potential to the
full. The present system of information and evaluation is inadequate
from this point of view. An experimental project is, therefolt, being
proposed to cover a population of 19.3 million in two States -- Uttar
Pradesh (U.P.) and Mysore. Its objectives are to:
a.   provide the health infrastructure, training facilities an(J
equipment to implement the GOI plan for delivering family
planning services in all the project areas; and furnish
additional inputs in some areas to supplement and test
alternatives to this plan -- in particular, by linking tlh
provision of family planning services to a supplementary
nutrition program, more and better trained personnel, and
greater use of motivation and service mobile teams, etc.;
b.   create two Population Centers, one in each State, to evaluate
performance on a continuous basis, recommend changes in the
project area, and ensure that the recommeidations that einerge
are speedily implemented; and
c.   provide the necessary technical assistance to implement the
above, and finance incremental recurrent costs fcr the inno-
vative aspects.
vi.       Total project costs are estimated at U.S.$31.8 million
(Rs 230.8 million). IDA and Sweden will finance 100% of the project,
splitting all items in a two to one ratio; the GOI will finance
expenditures in project facilities estimated at U.S.$12.5 million..
vii.      Project execution will be the responsibility of eachi State.
A Governing Board, chaired by the Chief Secretary, will be set up to
make policy dec'sions and oversee the progress of the project. Day-to-
day implementation will be carried out in each State by: (a) the Popu-
lation Center for the Management-Information and Evaluation System;
(b) a Project Family Planning Officer responsible for the pr.ovision of
services and other aspects of the program; (c) a Project Edtritior1
Officer for the implementation of the nutrition component; ard (d) a
Construction Unit to supervise the construction component. Each State
Government will appoint a project Coordinator, attached to the Office
of the Health Secretary or the Director of Medical Services, to oversee
and coordinate the total project. The project provides technical sup-
port to the Population Centers, on a continuous basis, from two Indian
Management Institutes and for the Construction Unit, from the Chief
Architect of the Central Public Works Department, GOI.



- iii -
viii.     The Civil Works contracts are small and scattered and artr
not suitable for international competitive bidding; they will be pro-
cured on the basis of local competitive bidding. The same will apply
to furniture of unsophisticated design and in ample supply locally.
Contracts for equipment estimated to cost more than the equipment of
$100,000 shall be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidling, with domestic manufacturers accorded a 15% preference margin
on the cif cost of competing imports or to the existing rate of duty,
whichever is lower. Vehicles will be procured locally to avoid any un-
necessary proliferation of makes and to assure spare parts and servicing
facilities.
ix,       This project is particularly difficult to evralulate i!n view of
its experimental nature. Directly the project will have favorable demo-
graphic and socio-economic effects within the project Districts which
are a small proportion (3.5%) of India's population; but the major
results are expected to be those that emerge from the contitinuous moni-
toring and evaluating of project results, and which will hopiefully be
applicable to India as a whole. These are difficult to forecast but
total project costs are small in relation to the total expeniditures on
the family planning progran and insignificant in relation to the large
investments that are absorbed by population growth (about 60C'G of total
investments); this makes the risk in such an experimernt small in rela-
tion to the potential benefits.
x.        Subject to the provisions in paras 7.01 and 7.02., the project
is suitable for an IDA credit of U.S.$21.2 million.



INDIA: POPULATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The annual population growth rate of 2.25% and the addition
of 12 million persons each year has been a matter of serious concern
to the Government of India (GOI) in their efforts at social and eco-
nomic development. Following the Aid India Consortium meeting organized
by the Bank in November 1969 to consider, amongst others, India's family
planning program, the GOI requested the Bank to develop a comprehensive
demonstratior program in a limited area of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) and
Mysore States (covering a total population of about 20 million) which
would include the components-of the GOI program, but would also have
variations and improvements of potential relevance to the Indian program
as a whole. The two States were selected to reflect the differenz levels
of socio-economic development prevailing in India. A critical part of
this project would be the development of a management-inforimation and
evaluation system to assess progress in the project areas on a continuing
basis and to recommend, on the basis of this assessment, vEriations from
existing patterns and experiments that are likely to improve program per-
formance. While these changes would be tested in the first instance in
the project areas, the conclusions shown from these experiments would be
relevant to the performance of the Indian program as a whole.
1.02      In response to the request, a pre-appraisal mission visited
India in July 1970. The mission submitted a report to the Government
in December 1970 which was followed by detailed discussionis leading to
the appraisal of this project in two stages. In the first phase, a
team of four persons (Mr. G. Zaidan and Mrs. M. N. Maraviglia from the
Bank and Messrs. J. F. Kantner and I. Sirageldin, from the Johns Hopkins
University as consultants) visited India in July 1971 to develop further
the MIES. In the second phase, a mission consisting of Messrs. G.
Zaidan (Chief), J. Burfield and Mrs. M. N. Maraviglia from the Bank,
and Dr. R. K. Anderson (Nutrition), Messrs. A. Law (Architocture), J. W.
Ratcliffe (Evaluation) and Miss C. Walsh (Nursing) as consultants visited
India in October 1971 to appraise the project as a whole. Mr. 0. Poluha
(SIDA) joined the mission as an observer to investigate the possibilities
of joint IDA-Sweden financing. The appraisal work was followed by a mission
that visited India in January 1972 to develop the nutrition component.
It consisted of Mr. G. Zaidan, Dr. R. K. Anderson (Nutrition Specialist,
University of North Carolina), Dr. N. Scrimshaw (Nutritionist, Head,
Department of Nutrition and Food Science, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology) and Mr. B. Wickstrom (Economist, Head, Department of Market-
ing, University of Gothenburg). This report is based on the findings
of these missions.

1/ In millions.
2/  Percent based on complete figures.
Between 1871 when the first census was taken and 1921, the population
increased by 20% (to 251 million).  In the following 50 years -- 1921-71 --
the population increased by close to 120 -- six times as rapidly as
before. Today, 12 million persons are being added to the population
every year. At the turn of the century, the corresponding figure was
less than 1-1/2 million. The preliminary result of the 1971 census shows
a population of 547 million, lower than expected by some 12 million, but
a large increase by any standards.
2.02      The population of India is diverse in language, culture, religion
and socio-economic development. It is predominantly Hindu (83.5%) with
significant Muslim (10.7%) and Christian (2.5%) minorities,  It is pre-
dominantly rural although there has been a slow migration to the towns.
In 1921, 89% of the population lived in rural areas; in 1961, the pro-
portion was 82%. It is a young population with 42% of persons under
15 years of age; 71% of those 15-59 years old were illiterate in 1961.
2.03      The annual (geometric) growth rate increased from 1.1% in the
1920's to 2.0% in the 1950's and to 2.25% at present because mortality
declined rapidly while fertility remained at the more or less constant
level of around 40 births per 1,000 population. Life expectancy in-
creased from 20 years five decades ago to 52 years in 1966t70. This
has been due to the control of infectious diseases (smallpox, cholera
and malaria) through mass public health programs and better nutrition.
Today, about one half of total deaths occur in the early years of life
mainly due to gastrointestinal diseases and respiratory infections,
with malnutrition as an underlying cause. The present death rate of
India, estimated at around 17 per 1,000 population, compares unfavorably
with the 6-8 per 1,000 population achieved in the more advanced of the
developing countries in East Asia. The possibility of a further large
decline in the death rate underlines the seriousness of the need to
achieve reductions in the birth rate.



2.'04      These demographic trends have serious eciotumr a.Td social
implications.  Real national income has been growing abui.i) by 3.6%
between 1951-69, but because of the population growth eate -f 2.1',' in
1951-60 and 2.25% in the sixties, more than 60% of rt;,e growth itl income
has been absorbed by the increasing population.  The growth of per
capita income has slowed down -- from 1.657. per year in 1951-60 to
0.6% per year in 1961-66.  In more recent years, wheu economic condi-
tions were unfavorable, economic growth was insufficieat to cotnter
population growth. In 1968-69, after the years of serious drought of
1965-66 and 1966-67 and a prolonged industrial recession, per capita
income was still below its 1964-65 level.  A particulaxti serious
economic and social problem is that of unemployment which, although
difficult to measure, is ccnsiderable. Given the projected increase
in the labor force and rough estimates of the present level of unem-
ployment, about 40 million additional jobs have to be cteated in
1971-75 and abouc 75 million jobs over the next decade, to eliminate
unemployment.
2.05      The extent to which family planning efforts and iruprovements in
socio-economic conditions are successful in reducing the Irth rate will
largely determine the population growth rate over the ;          years.  If
the government goal of reaching a birth rate of 25 pei 3.00C population
and a growth rate of 1.5% by 1980 is to be achieved, tlhea 5Vl-60% of
couples will have to be practicing contraception in l979-60, and 56
million births have to be prevented over the whiole decade. Ihis com-
pares with about 11% of couples presently practicing ae  7-8 %iwllion
births already prevented. By the turn of the century, the population
would reach between 792 million and 1.1 billion depending om the extent
to which the family planning program is successful.  Eve^ wi    moderate
decline in fertility (i.e., a birth rate falling to 315 per 1,000 popu-
lation in 1980 and 30 per 1,000 in 1990), the populatitin would reach
948 million in the year 2000.
Uttar Pradesh
2.06      Uctar Pradesh, with a population of 88.4 milljicu  in 1971, is
the largest State in India and one of the poorest; 78% cf She population
is illiterate. The medical and health care system is exceptionally thin,
particularly in rural areas. Levels of socio-economic development vary
considerably.  Western districts, where the "'green revko.stion' has had
an impact, are the most developed while socio-economic conditions in the
East are far less favorable. The population has inceieased from 56.5
million in 1941 to a present level of 88.4 million.  Il 19.#1-50, the
birth rate was 38.6 per 1,000 population and the deaztc rate was 27.2
per 1,000 population, giving a rate of natural increase of 121% per year.
Due to the rapid decline in the death rate, the rate of natural increase
has doubled to 2.4 - 2.7 per year in recent years.
Mysore
2.07      In 1971, the population of Mysore was 29.Z million.  About 70%
of the population is illiterate, and the medical and health caxe system



- 4 -
compares favorably and is more widespread than irn most utiir X-;e  of
India.  The level of economic development is similar to the 1.iqia
average, although the southern part of the State (Bangaioret Division),
where a sizable industrial, sector has developed, is well above the ave-
rage. Mysore's population grew from 16.3 million in 194i. to 23.6
million in 1961. In 1969, the birth rate was estimated at 34-35 per
1,000 population, and the death rate was 15 per 1,000 population,
giving a rate of natural increase of 2.0%.
III. FAMILY PLANNING EFFORTS
Introduction
3.01      While the Government of India was the first to proclaim an
official population policy in 1951, it was only in 1965-66 that a large-
scale effort to expand the national family planning program was mnade,
The Ministry of Hlealth was renamed the Ministry of Health and Family
Planning with a separate Department of Family Planning; program targuts
to reduce the birth rate to 25 per 1,000 population by 1980 were set;
a vast administrative machinery presently employing more tLhan 80,000
persons was set up; the intra-uterine device (IUD) was i.trodL.sced and
sterilization was offered with compensation payments offered to acceptors
of these methods; the camp-approach was introduced to provide services
for groups of villages; postpartum programs were initiated in selected
large hospitals of several cities; and country-wide schemes f.L  the com-
mercial distribution of condoms at subsidized rates were 3.0tiat ed. Tlhe
following sections outline recent efforts and achievements and t:he pro-
gram's prospects in the coming years.
A. Organization and Administration
3.02      The Indian family planning program is fully iregut-d   for
administrative and technical reasons, with the health services. Although
the family planning program is implemented by the State, ic is centrally
sponsored.  Since 1969-70, the Central Government has finuiiced the whole
program by providing funds to the State Governments for appLoved family
planning schemes. A small cabinet committee chaired by the Finance
Minister expedites policy decisions and reviews program progress. Poli-
cies are laid down by the Central Family Planning Council, chaired by
the Health Minister and including the Minister of State responsible for
family planning, the State Health Ministers, and representativ.s of
organizations working in family planning. Budgetary plaaning and finan-
cial control at the center are the responsibility of the Department of
Family Planning. This Department is also responsible for implementing
a nationwide mass-information campaign and administering the program in
the Union Territories and the Central Government employees progran.  It
also undertakes some evaluation and training activities, The organization
chart at the center is shown in Annex 1, p.1.  The link with the State Govern-
ments is established through six regional directors, with lio executive
responsibilities, but who influence program implementation through their
close relationship with State officials. Uttar Pradesh constitutes a
region with a director in Lucknow.  Mysore is part of the Southern
Region with headquarters in Bangalore.



5 -
3.03      At the state level, family planning activities are paL of the
functions of the Health Secretary and the Director of MedicaL Services.
Program administration is the responsibility of the Deputy Director of
Health and Family Planning, who is the State Family Planning Officer.
He heads the State Family Planning Bureau, an agency entrusted with
the general administration and coordination of the state program,
including services, personnel training, and communications. Annex l, p.2
shows the organization at the state level.
3.04      The district is the main administrative unit of program imple-
mentation (Annex 1, p.3). Typically, it has a population of 1.5 - 2.0 million
and an area of about 5,000 sq miles. All program activities in the field
are managed by the District Family Planning Bureau, which is headed by
the District Family Planning Officer. The District Family Planning Officer
is subordinate to the District Medical Officer for Health and Family Plan-
ning, who is the head of the public health services in thte district.
3.05      The basic health service unit in the ruraL areabi is the
Primary Health Center covering one development block -- a district sub-
division with 80,000 to 100,000 people.  A typical distiict will have
15-20 Primary Health Centers, varying in distance betweeix each ocher from
10 to 100 miles. Each Primary Health Center has under itL 8-l0 subcenters
staffed with one auxiliary nurse-midwife (ANM) each. Recently, the
Government has sanctioned one assistant for the ANTI per subcenter. The
GOI pattern provides one subcenter per 10,000 population. Of the 8-10
ANMs at the subcenter level, three come under the health budget, while
the remainder (5-7) come under the family planning budget, While there
are distinct budgets for health and family planning, facilities and
.services are identical, regardless of the source of f,ladi.og.
3.06      Family planning activities in large cities are coordinated by
a City Family Planning Bureau responsible to the municipal authorities.
In Bangalore, there is a City Family Planning Bureau already func-
tioning; in Lucknow, it has been sanctioned and will becoxue operational
as part of the project.  Services in urban areas are provided by: (a)
Urban Family Welfare Centers which are sanctioned at thie rate of one
per 50,000 population; (b) voluntary organizations (such as the
Christian Medical Association of India, Red Cross, India Family
Planning Association, etc.); and (c) some large city hospitals
where postpartum programs are underway.

3.08       While these figures can only be approximate, they are indi-
cative of broad trends. Acceptors for the whole of India steadily
increased from 200,000 in 1960-61 to 3.75 million in 1970-71. But pro-
gress has been uneven; following a great surge between 1965-66 and
1967-68, there was a levelling off thereafter. Sterilizations, intro-
duced on a large scale in 1965-66, reached a peak of 1.84 million in
1967-68 and declined to 1.28 million in 1970-71. While tubectomies
have increased in recent years (from 191,700 to 460,000 between 1967-68
and 1970-71), this has not been sufficient to counter the decline in
vasectomies. Similarly, IUDs reached a peak of 910,000 in 1966-67 and
declined rapidly to half this number by 1969-70; in 1970-71 the number
stabilized at 458,000. Condom distribution increased uninterruptedly
from 24 million in 1967-68 to about 100 million in 1969-70; last year's
figures reached 139 million. This increase has been sufficient to
counter the decline in sterilizations and IUDs since 1967-68. These
all-India trends for each method are also typical of Uttar Pradesh and
Mysore.
3.09      As a result of these activities, 11% of all married couples
are now estimated to be protected -- 8% by sterilizations, 2% by IUDs,
and 1% by condoms. These efforts may have reduced the birth rate by at
most three points -- from 41 per 1,000 population to 38 per 1,000 from
1961-70.
3.10      In recent years, expenditures have been rising more rapidly
than acceptors (see previous table). Furthermore, an increasLngly
larger proportion of new acceptors are condom users (54% in 1970-71
versus 20% in 1966-67), a method that has a smaller effect on birth
prevention than sterilizations or IUDs. Consequently, the cost-
effectiveness of the program has decreased.
C. Foreign Aid
3.11      Early foreign assistance to the program was in the form of
fellowships and consultants provided by the Ford Foundation and by the
Population Council since 1964. Bilateral aid from the Governments of
the United States, Sweden, Japan, and Denmark started in 1967-68 and has
consisted mainly of the provision of commodities and consultants. More
recently, multilateral aid is coming into the picture, consisting pri-
marily of equipment, experts and fellowships. The United Nations Fund
for Population Activities (UNFPA) is currently considering a grant to
the GOI of about U.S.$5.0 million for new projects. UNICEF is engaged in a
project for ANM schools in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for which Dsek b-1,v\c k
has provided Rs 4-million.  In June 1970, USAID signed an agreement for
U.S.$20 million for program support. Under a 1968 agreement, Sweden has
offered assistance in equipment and materials of U.S.$2 million. In
1971, that Government continued its support to the Christian Medical
Association of India with a grant of U.S.$2 million, and is considering
joint financing of the present project. Denmark has provided 10,000
pieces of IUD (antigon) in 1969-70 for clinical trials. This year an
agreement has been reached with the GOI for assistance in financing a



-8-
new building for the National Family Planning Institute for an amounit of
Rs 6.2 million (U.S.$0.8 million).  Norway has signed an agreement in
January 1972 for U.S.$5.2 million (Norwegian Kroner 37 million) for the
expansion of the postpartum program. In contrast to most of the fore-
going bilateral and multilateral projects, which provide one or two
program inputs, the present project will provide a variety of program
needs in a limited geographical area.
D. Personnel and Facilities
3.12      The increase in financial resources (last column of the table
in para 3.07) reflects a rapid expansion of personnel, facilities and
equipment for this program. In March 1970, the program was run by a
staff of 81,000, of which 3,500 were doctors, 25,500 were paramedical
personnel (mostly ANMs), 26,000 were educational and promotional staff,
and 26,000 were administrative employees. However, there are stili
serious shortages in relation to the Government's plan.  Only about
30% of doctors, 35% of paramedical personnel, and one-half of the
administrative employees that are sanctioned (budgeted) are in position.
3.13      The rural construction program has made some progress, but here
too there are severe shortages; of the 5,044 Primary Health Centers that
are operating, only some 1,133 have adequate buildings. Also, only about
6,600 of the almost 30,000 subcenters operating in rural areas have
adequate quarters.  Thus, a large part of the program is carried out in
rented facilities that are crowded and inadequate for the effective pro-
vision of services.
Uttar Pradesh
3.14      Shortages of health personnel are acute in Uttar Pradesh,
particularly in rural areas. (Annex 2 gives details of these shortages
for each category of personnel.) At present, there are 9,034 posts
sanctioned for ANMs (mostly for work in rural areas), but only 2,300
are in position; another 2,756 posts are filled by family welfare workers,
and 1,619 by trained dais. Family welfare workers are high school gra-
duates with one week preparation in family planning, who are posted at
subcenters and eventually deputed for ANM training. They, and to a lesser
extent dais, have proved considerably less effective than ANMs and are
being used as an interim measure, pending the availability of more ANMs.
Recruitment of family welfare workers has been discontinued.
3.15      There is also a serious deficiency of buildings; only some 60
of 875 sanctioned Primary Health Centers have completed buildings.  And
only 1,262 subcenters have or will soon have adequate buildings out of
close to 4,800 functioning. There are in the State 156 sterilization
beds in 22 hospitals with a capacity of only about 10,000 tubectomies
per year.
Mysore
3.16     The overall situation in rural areas of Mysore is fairly favor-
able (details are given in Annex 2).  For example, there are 4,000 ANMs



-9-
in active service -- an overall ratio of 1 ANM per 5,500 rural populal ion
In 1971.  This places the State above the GO[ pattern and tlhis isi dte l- 1.it.
Mysore Health Units, established before the national family planning pro-
gram, and presently financed by the State.
3.17      The pace of construction for rural health facilities has been
quite active in the last year and the building complexes which will be
available by the end of 1970-71 will cover the requirements of one Primary
Health Center per 80,000-100,000 population. At the subcenter level, close
to 2,000 have buildings or are under construction out of 2,136 needed in
the GOI pattern.
E. Assessment of Recent Trends and Future Prospects
3.18      The GOI has to its credit impressive achievements: planning and
implementing such an administratively complex program in a few years;
mounting a massive information campaign that has greatly increased aware-
ness; a willingness to try new approaches; and more recently, the Preg-
nancy Termination Bill making abortion legal was passed (in August 1971).
The GOI is proceeding with plans to introduce population education in
schools and is experimenting with the pill. And yet performance falls
short of a solution of India's population problem, of the targets set by
the Government and its expectations. Little can be said with certainty
about the reasons for this, or about the specific changes needed to im-
prove recent performance. This will only be determined, on a systematic
basis, after disaggregated data on program performance and socio-economic
conditions are regularly collected and analyzed. In the meantime, the
following are some of the main problems which the program has had to face
and which may explain recent trends:
a.   Quantity and Quality of Personnel
To implement the Government pattern rapidly, the ambitious
training program has paid more attention to numbers than
quality. This "crash approach" has resulted in large numbers
of poorly selected, ill-motivated and inadequately trained
persons. Such persons can have negative effects on the
program. A training program of six days or even 30 days'
duration is inadequate. Inaufficient emphasis is given to
field training and supervision.
b.   Contraceptive Methods
In principle, the India program offers a "cafeteria" approach.
In practice, choice of different methods in rural areas is
limited. According to the plan, women should be able to have an
IUD insertion at the Primary Health Center provided a lady
doctor is there. This is rare in Uttar Pradesh and only a
little less rare in Mysore. Also, the reported side effects
have undermined the popularity of the IUD and the difficulty
of follow-up reduces its effectiveness. Pills are offered
only in limited pilot projects. In practice, rural women
seeking contraception resort to sterilization after having had
at least three children. Even this is done only in hospitals.
Vasectomies are available at most Primary Health Centers,
hospitals and occasional camps. Other than this operation, rural me



- 1") -
have no other choice except to use condoms -- the least
effective of the methods offered in the program.
c.   Administration
The program is over-centralized with planning being carried at
the Central level (GOI) and implementation by the State. The
relevant administrative level, however, is the District with a
population of about 1.0 - 2.0 million persons; but, at this
level, there is insufficient administrative and firnanlial flexi-
bility to encourage local initiative.
d.   Demand Constraints
Illiteracy, a large rural population, and low standards of
living limit the total effective demand. In rural areas, in
particular, where children are put to work at an early age,
it is far from obvious, from the family's point of view, that
a child is a liability. Furthermore, infant mortality is so
high that families have to have a large number of children if
one or two males are to survive to support their parents in
old age.
3.19      While all the above conditions are severe constraints that can-
not be easily removed, room for optimism undoubtedly exists on the basis
of the past record. Success has been demonstrated in many instances --
Gandhigram and more recently a camp in the Ernakulam district of Kerala
for example. In Candhigram, where the program started in a community
development block with a population of ±00,000, the birth rate was reduced
from 43 per 1,000 population to 28 per 1,000 between 1962 and 1968 -- an
achievement comparable to that of the more successful programs in other
countries. Ihis was achieved with only slightly more funds and personnel
than the GOI pattern. Success has been primarily attribtuted to the em-
phasis on the quality of training in the field of supervision. In the
Ernakulam district of Kerala, 15,000 vasectomies were performed in
December 1970 and 63,000 in June and July of 1971. On a population
basis, this is about 9 times as much as the all-India average of the
best of years. These successes suggest that much unmet denmand remains
and that there is need for more flexibility in the approaches to the
problem depending on local conditions. It is very unlikely that these
instances could be extended uniformly throughout the vast irLdian subcon-
tinent; success in those cases has depended to a great extent on special
factors.
3.20      Perhaps more indicative of the potential of the program is the
large observed variability in performance between States and between
Districts within States. Orissa and the Punjab, for example, are about
three times as effective as Uttar Pradesh, on a population basis. While
much of this variability is due to the very different socio-economic
conditions, the degree to which the program is pushed, measured by expen-
ditures and inputs, are undoubtedly important. A recent study suggests
that a substantial proportion of the variability between States and
within the same State is due to program factors, pointing to the pos-
sibility of substantial improvements within the existing demand constraints.



3.21      While the previous analysis suggests that significant improve-
ments in performance are possible, it does not offer detailed guidance as
to how the program should proceed to maximize this potential. The relative
effectiveness of program inputs as well as the level and structure of
demand for these services are not well understood. The present inform-
ation system is not designed to respond to these questions. The following
are its principal weaknesses: (The information system and its constraints
are elaborated in Annex 3.)
a.   Flow of Data
Evaluation of program activities is a major responsibility of
the Central Government and is done in terms of monthly state-
ments on personnel in position and accomplishments in relation
to targets. These monthly statements are supplemented by pro-
gress reports of the Regional Directors and by tour reports of
other staff from the Central Goverrment.  An Annual Report is
issued by the Ministry of Health containing information on the
number of acceptors by method. The State Family Planning Bureau
issues similar summary monthly and annual reports on the program.
This analysis, however, cannot be meaningful because of the loss
of detail that results from successive groupings of data. Much
of the data collected at the field level is lost in the process
of aggregation, when forwarded from the Primary Health Center to
the District Family Planning Bureau. Further information is lost
when these data are again aggregated and forwarded first to the
State Family Planning Bureau and then to the Central Government.
Also, there is a complete separation between reporting of cost
and performance data. Financial accounts and program achieve-
ments are handled by different staff, and no attempt is made to
relate them for studying the cost-effectiveness of the program.
b.   Coverage of Data
Achievement data collected by the system refer only to partici-
pating couples. This has limited value in explaining the level
of demand for family planning services or in suggesting improve-
ments. While much research based on non-program data is going
on in India and abroad, no efforts are made to relate these
studies to the program and to translate their findings into
action.
c.   Administrative and Technical Constraints
The Demographic Cells in the State Family Planning EBureau are too
low in the organization structure to be able to question the basic
premises of the program. Nor are they technically equipped to do
so because of the quality and small number of their staff.
3.22      In summary, the need is to establish a Management-Information
and Evaluation System (MIES) which will collect relevant program data more
efficiently, link the analysis of performance data to cost and to data
from research outside the program, undertake a continuous analysis that
will respond to the need of administrators, and provide the organizational
and technical conditions necessary for an independent evaluation of the
program. Only such an MIES will be capable of providing policy guidance
to exploit the full potential of the program. The project is designed to
respond to this overriding need, on an experimental basis, the result of
which would have demonstrative value throughout India.

IV. 1HE PROJECT
4.01      The project will cover five districts including Bangalore City
in Mysore State and six districts including Lucknow City in Uttar Pradesh
with a combined population of 19.3 million in 1971. Its objectives are to:
a.   Complete the health infrastructure, training facilities and
equipment to implement the GOI pattern for family planning
services in all the project areas; and provide additional
inputs in some areas to supplement and test alternatives to
this pattern -- in particular, by linking the provision of
family planning service to a supplementary nutrition program,
concentrating on recently-delivered mothers, greater use of
mobile teams for motivation and service, and a greater con-
centration on training and supervision, etc.
b.   Create two Population Centers, one in each State, to design
the MIES, evaluate performance on a continuous basis,
reconnend changes in the project area, and ensure that the
recommendations that emerge are speedily implemented.
C.   Provide the necessary technical assistance for the whole pro-
ject and finance for incremental recurrent costs to implement
the experimental aspects of the above items.
4.02      The broad experimental design of the project, which will be
further elaborated and refined by the Population Centers, is to provide
family planning services in: (a) an Urban Frogram in Lucknow (Uttar
Pradesh) and Bangalore City (Mysore), concentrating on motivation and
service to recently-delivered mothers; (b) an  etimal Government of 
India Program in-six Districts of Uttar Pradesh and five Districts of
Mysore to implement the government pattern; and (c) an Intensive Rural
Program in two Districts of Uttar Pradesh and two Districts of Mysore
in which inputs additional to those sanctioned in the government plan
will be provided.
4.03      To control for differences in the levels of socio-economic deve-
lopment, the second and third schemes would be implemented in at least
one District with relatively advanced socio-economic conditions and in
one with relatively backward conditions. Socio-economic differences
within each District would also be present, thus allowing for analysis
of the demand for family planning services within as well as between
Districts. The following is the proposed location of each scheme:

4.04     The most critical part of the project are the activities of
the proposed Population Centers which will further elaborate the experi-
mental design of the project and design and implement, with technical
assistance, the Management-Information and Evaluation System. The
functions, organizational structure, staffing, etc., of the Population
Centers are in paras 5.06 and 5.07 and Annex 3. The project further con-
sists of:
a. Physical Facilities and Equipment for:
(Annex 4 contains further details of these facilities.)
i.   TwO Population Centers -- one in Lucknow and one In
Bangalore.
ii.   One Regional Family Planning Training Center in Lucknow
for training family planning workers, and a new wing
for the center in Bangalore, to extend its capacity from
30 to 48 students.
iii.   Fourteen Urban Maternity Homes, with 30 beds each for
maternity and sterilization -- eight in Lucknow and six
in Eangalore. Each maternity home will have attached to
it an Urban Family Welfare Center which is an outpatient
facility for family planning counselling, IUD insertions,
distribution of contraceptives, etc. In addition, other
eight Urban Family Welfare Centers will be built in
Bangalore and other six in Lucknow.
iv.   Thirteen ANM Schools, with hostel accommodation for 78 trainees
-- five in Mysore and eight in Uttar Pradesh. Living quarters
for 10 students will be built in eight Primary Health Centers in
Uttar Pradesh and five in Mysore to enable ANM students to
undertake three months of rural field experience as part of
their training.
v.   Eleven Buildings for Program Administration -- ten District
Family Planning Bureaus; one for each of the project
Districts except Lucknow Rural and one City Family Planning
Bureau for Lucknow City.
vi.   Nineteen Sterilization Annexes to hospitals for tubectomies --
ten 30-bed annexes to District hospitals in each of the
project Districts except Lucknow City, and nine 24-bed an-
nexes to sub-District-level hospitals in Mysore.
vii.   Forty-one Primary Health Centers and Focty-seven Family
Planning Annexes in Uttar Pradesh
viii.   Twenty Primary Health Center Maternity-Sterilization Wings,
with 24 beds each -- one half of the beds to be used for
tubectomies and the other half for deliveries and post-
partum motivation; these wings will be built in the four
intens've Districts of Uttar Pradesh and Mysore.
ix.   1,348 Subcenters, consisting of clinics and living quarters
for ANMs -- 654 in Uttar Pradesh and 694 in Mysore.

Uttar Pradesh and 57 for Mysore); 12 for the Population
Centers (6 for Uttar Pradesh and 6 for Mysore); 11 for the
Project Office (5 for Uttar Pradesh and 6 for Mysore); one
for the City Family Planning Bureau in Lucknow and 2 for the
mobile training teams (one for each State). Forty-eight
ambulances for Urban Maternity Homes and maternity-sterilization
wings (23 for Uttar Pradesh and 25 for Mysore); 26 mini-buses
for ANM schools (16 for Uttar Pradesh and 10 for Mysore) and
4 for the Population Centers (2 for each State); and 8 mobile
vans for service and motivation teams (4 for each State).
c. Technical Assistance for
i.   training abroad of staff of the Population Centers and
personnel working in program administration; and
ii.   supporting Indian Institutes of Mangement that will
advise the Population Centers.
d. Equipment, Commodities and Salaries for
a nutrition program for expectant mothers and their infants
in Chitradurga District, Mysore and in one block in Rae Bareli,
Uttar Pradesh.
e. Incremental recurrent Costs
needed to supplement the GOI pattori and consisting of staff
salaries, maintenance, and commodities for the:
i.   operation of the Population Certers;
ii.   operation of the Project Coordination Office (10 staff)
and the Family Planning Project Office (25 staff);
iii.   field personnel in intensive Districts additional to the
GOI pattern;
iv.   operation of one mobile on-the-job training team;
v.  A1'R4 schools in the project area;
vi.   operation of sterilization ward in urban maternity home.
A. Urban Program
4.05     In this program, particular emphasis will be given to (a) con-
tacting pregnant and recently-delivered mothers through antenatal counsel-
ling and postpartum advice on contraception. The high proportion of
institutionalized deliveries (70%) in Bangalore City constitutes a good
base for stepping up the postpartum program in the large hospitals along
the patterns set by the Government; (b) contacting and following up women
who do not deliver in hospitals (especially in Lucknow where this propor-
tion is large); (c) enlisting the participation of private doctors in
rendering advice and service in contraceptive practice; and (d) making
available all contraceptive methods in the program, including oral pills.
Although all efforts will be made to organize the supply of family
planning services as efficiently as possible, at the same time the project
will be geared to study the factors that increase demand.

4.06      In Bangalore, the project includes the construction of six
maternity homes with a total of 180 beds, half of which will be used for
tubectomy operations and half for maternity. At present, small homes
with less than 1,500 deliveries do not have a postpartum program. The
project will extend the program in this direction; the new maternity
homes, with an 80% occupancy rate uay be expected to attend a total of
2,600 deliveries and abortions and to perform 5,300 tubectomies per year.
4.07      In Lucknow City, the project will include the construction of
eight maternity homes with a total of 240 beds (30 beds each). Half of
the 240 new beds will be devoted to deliveries and the other half to tubec-
tomy cases. Less than 30% of the 33,000 estimated deliveries which occurred
in 1970-71 were institutionalized and only 10% more were attended at home
by public health service personnel. The new facilities with an estimated
80% occupancy rate, would handle about 3,500 deliveries and 7,000 tubectomies
a year. A combined postpartum program will be conducted in these new small
homes to promote family planning among recently-delivered women, In both
cities, the Urban Family Welfare Center will be responsible for postpartum
motivation in institutions and homes and the provision of conttraceptive
methods.
4.08      The organization of the total urban family plann'ing program in
the two cities will be entrusted to the City Family Planning Bureau. In
Bangalore, this Bureau is already functioning; in Lucknow, it will be
created and a new building is provided in the project. The functions of
each City Family Planning Bureau will be (a) to draw up a detailed plan of
operation to provide maternal and child health (14CH) care and family plan-
ning services covering the whole city; (b) to coordinate services, supplies,
information efforts and the collection of relevant data; and (c) to adminis-
ter a mass-media motivation program. The City Family Planning Bureau will
work with the State Family Planning Bureau and consult the Population
Center on the design of all aspects of the urban program. The Population
Center will also be responsible for the design and analysis of the MIES in
both cities.
B.  Optimal Goverment of India Prozram
4.09      This part of the project is intended to test the GOI pattern
which it has not been possible to implement because of shortages in staff
and facilities. The project aims at assessing the relative importance of
various program inputs in areas with diverse socio-economic conditions and
hence different demand patterns. The project will devote special attention
to assessing the possibilities of attaining target fertility declines within
the existing system and socio-economic conditions and to the reasons for
success or failure. This program has three main elements:
a.   Personnel
All state personnel sanctioned under the GOI pattern should be
in position as quickly as possible. The gaps which presently
exist in the project areas are summarized in Annex 2. During
negotiations, assurances were sought that priority will be
given to implementing the GOI pattern in the project Districts,
principally by posting at least one-third of the graduates from



- 16 -
all state ANM schools and almost all graduates from project
schools in these Districts, but also by suitable transfers.
For ANMs, this should be achieved by 1973 in Mysore and by
1974 in Uttar Pradesh, provided at least one-third of AMM
graduates from all schools in the State are posted in these
Districts.
b.   Training
The Regional Family Planning Training Centers in Lucknow and
Bangalore will be responsible for training new personnel and
retraining those already working in project Districts. At
present, doctors receive a short one-week course .n family
planning, lady health visitors who supervise ANMs and
family planning health assistants who are non-medical male
motivation workers at the field level, are given either 30--day
courses or a one-week "crash" program while ANMs receive a
30-day course. The Government of India has already approved
a plan 2or increasing the teaching staff (from 10 to 13-14) to
allow for training of larger batches of 40-45 students instead
of the present capacity of 30 students at a time.  A new Regiontl
Family Planning Training Center is being built by the State Govern-
ment in Bangalore, and in Lucknow the project will provide for a
new building with hostel accommodation for 48 students. Since
the success of the project depends to a great extent on the qua-
lity of training and the motivation of the staff working in
family planning, a careful review of the training activities of
the two Regional Family Planning Training Centers will be a
first priority of an ad-hoc committee formed by members of the
Regional Family Planning Training Center and the Population
Center. During negotiations, assurances were sought from
the GOI and both State Governments that priority will be given
to training and retraining of family planning personnel in the
project area, starting with the intensive districts. The project
also includes on-the-job training by one mobile team in the project
districts of each State, giving priority to the intensive districts;
this training program will be under the responsibility of the
Regional Family Planning Training Centers.
c.   Medical Facilities for Sterilization
A third important element of the program is the provision of
516 beds for tubectomy cases (150 beds in Uttar Pradesh and
366 beds in Mysore) to annexes of district hospitals in all
project districts and to nine sub-district hospitals in Mysore.
Female sterilization, for which there is a substantial demand
in India, requires an operating room, sterile conditions and
several days of hospitalization. Allocation of beds in each
State has been determined by the availability of personnel to
staff these sterilization units. The added bed capacity for
tubectomies will make possible 30,000 additional operations a
year, of which about 9,000 will take place in Uttar Pradesh
and 21,000 in Mysore. In Mysore, the project will contribute
to an increase of over 60% in the performance of the tubectomy
program ana in Uttar Pradesh, it will allow for a doubling of
the 1970-71 performance.



- 17 -
C. Intensive Rural Program
4.10      In two districts of Mysore (Chitradurga and Kolar), inputs
additional to the GOI pattern will be provided to concentrate on recently-
delivered mothers in rural areas. The additional inputs are (a) rural
subcenters to achieve a ratio of one ANM per 5,000 population, thus
doubling the GOI pattern, with additional supervisory staff at the
Primary Health Center level; (b) intensive on-the-job training; (c) in-
creased bed capacity at the Primary Health Center level for maternity
(140 beds) and for tubectomies (140 beds); and (d) provision of personnel
and transportation for two mobile teams in each intensive district -- a
team for motivation-education on family planning and one for services.
4.11      In Uttar Pradesh, the large deficit of health personnel does
not make the provision of one ANM per 5,000 feasible in the present project.
However, a degree of intensity commensurate with conditions in Uttar Pradesh
will be undertaken in two Districts -- Rae Bareli and Saharanpur. This will
involve building up the staff in these two Districts more rapidly than in
the other Districts, intensive training and adding bed capacity and mobile
teams as in the intensive Districts of Mysore.
4.12      The main components of this program are:
a.   Rural Postpartum Program
Up to the present, programs concentrating on recently-delivered
mothers have taken place in large hospitals of urban areas.
Pregnant and recently-delivered mothers constitute a large pro-
portion of the more fertile women among those in reproductive
ages. Besides, pregnancy and postpartum periods make them
highly receptive to advice on family spacing or limitation. To
reach this group in rural areas, it is necessary to build up the
maternal and child care network and increase the proportion of
deliveries supervised by health personnel. Also, there is in-
creasing evidence that reductions in infant mortality through
better maternal and child (MCH) care may encourage family plan-
ning when parents perceive it is no longer necessary to produce
many children to assure the survival of a few. MCH services
and family planning will be provided, under medical supervision
by ANMs in Mysore and by ANMs and dais in Uttar Pradesh.  An
Assistant will be provided to help the ANM in her duties. The
targeted ratio is one ANK and one assistant for a population
of 5,000 in Mysore, with about 200 deliveries per year. This
ratio will be flexible depending, in particular, upon the topo-
graphy of the area. It is a minimum standard since ideally
there should be one health attendant per 3,000 population.
During negotiations, assurances were sought from the GOI that
medical supplies will be made available regularly on a priority
basis to the project's rural PHC's and subcenters, to allow
for good MCH services.  The design of the operational procedures
for the rural postpartum program will be the responsibility of
the Population Center in consultation with the State Health
Ministry.



- 18-
b.   Maternity-Sterilization Facilities in Primary Health Centers
Maternity and sterilization wings in 10 Primary Health Centers
of each State will be provided to assess the extent to whicht
the availability of facilities for institutionalized deliveries
and sterilizations in rural areas would improve program perform-
ance. The total of 480 beds will be distributed evenly between
States; half of the 240 beds in each State will be for
maternity and half for sterilizations.
c.  Mobile Teams
Two mobile teams are proposed in each of the four intensive
Districts; one team will be for motivation-education, and one for
providing family planning services (Annex 6 discusses the compo-
sition and detailed cost of these teams). A third small team
(3-4 staff) to be in charge of on-the-job training will operate in
the project districts as an innovative approach. The function of
this team will be on-the-job training of staff at the district
hospital and other large hospitals and Primary "alth Centers
including subcenters. The team will spend 1-2 w*eks at the Pri-
mary Health Center level and similar time at each hospital, cover-
ing the district in 9-12 months. Subsequently, revisits will be con-
ducted regularly for supervision and retraining. The organization
of all:mobile teams and the plan of operations will be developed
as part of the whole project design by the Population Center, in
consultation with relevant local staff. In general, motivation-
education teams would precede service teams in visits to villages
and would use group and inter-personal communication to convey the
family planning message. Service teams would remain one week in
each village to perform vasectomies, insert IUDs, give advice,
and distribute other contraceptives. Some personnel would remain
for another week for the follow-up of sterilizations and IUD cases.
D. Training of AMs and Tutors
4.13      The ANM is a multipurpose worker dealing with maternal and child
care and family planning services in rural areas and also treating minor
ailments and maintaining a register of couples eligible for family planning
and other health records. The training of the ANM consists of 2 years of
basic hospital nursing, midwifery practice, including prenatal care,
delivery and child care and rural health experience. In principle, family
planning is integrated into their curriculum. An ANM is supposed to serve
a population of 10,000 in the GOI pattern and in fact in many areas she
is responsible for a much larger population. In practice, however, one
ANM can only effectively serve a population of about 3,000. Annex 2 gives
details regarding the measures needed to improve ANM training and their
effectiveness in the field, and quantitative estimates of the additional
needs of ANMs.
Mysore
4.14      A total of i,359 ANKs will be needed in the project area to
lower the ratio of one ANM per 5,000 population in the two intensive
Districts and to staff the project's facilities. This additional re--
quirement will be met by the ANM schools of the project area by 1973.
The proposed credit provides for new buildings and hostel accommiodation
for 5 ANN schools, one in each of the project Districts, producing 30
graduates each per year, to replace the present inadequate premises.



- 19 -
Living accommodation for 10 ANM students will be provided in five
Primary Health Centers, each assigned to one ANK school, where students
will undergo rural health experience for 3 months. For purposes of in-
creased quality of supervision of student practice, nurse-midwives (who
have better academic preparation than lady health visitors) should be used
to fill supervisory positions in this training program. There is at present
a pool of unemployed nurse-midwives in Mysore, who could be given an orienta-
tion course in public health and MCH and family planning, and deputized as
supervisors for a minimum period of 2 years.
4.15      According to the GOI pattern, one lady health visitor should
supervise four ANMs; in practice, a lady health visitor supervises 15
ANKs in Mysore. The project requires 284 lady health visitors.
Uttar Pradesh
4.16      New buildings for classes and hostel accommodation for 78
students will be provided in each of the three existing ANM schools--
Lucknow, Faizabad and Saharanpur. In addition, five additional
schools at Muzaffarnagar, Sultanpur, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh and Lucknow
will be built. Each of the new schools will be attached to hospitals with
enough maternity patients, to allow clinical practice; it will also be
associated with one Primary Health Center, where the students will receive
rural health experience. The project will provide livinig accommodation
for 10 students in 8 Primary Health Centers for a 3-month field training
course. Eight posts for public health nurses will be needed (3 in 1971,
1 in 1972, 4 in 1973, and 2 in 1975) to plan and oversee the field train-
ing of students in Primary Health Centers. If public health nurses are
not available in sufficient numbers, nurse-midwives or, as a less desira-
ble alternative, lady health visitors could be selected to fill those
positions, after a 3-month additional training in public health and
family planning.
4.17      There are at present 261 ANMs in position in the project area
of Uttar Pradesh. Of the 986 posts sanctioned, 651 are filled -- 261 by
ANMs, 134 by family welfare workers, and 256 by trained dais.  To achieve
the GOI pattern, 1,013 additional ANMs will be needed in the project Districts
-- 923 for Primary Health Centers and subeenters, and 90 for maternity-
sterilization units. Seven hundred and sixteen students will graduate
from the existing and new schools in the project between 1972 and 1977.
With an annual personnel attrition of 3% per year, there would be about
933 ANMs working in the project area in 1977 (Table 7, Annex 2).
4.18      A serious problem facing the expansion of tthe ANK training
program in Uttar Pradesh is the insufficient number of qualified teaching
staff available. This problem may be met by (a) 3-month courses in
teaching methods for 16 tutors and staff nurses already in position,
possibly in Kampur, starting in 1972; and (b) selection of 16 nurse-
midwives with the required education and experience to receive one year
preparation in teaching, possibly in the College of Nursing in Delhi,
the College of Nursing in Indore, M.P., or both. They would be deputized
and given fellowships financed from this credit; the first group of eight
students would have to commence studies in September 1972 (Annex 2).

E. The Nutrition Component
4.19      The nutrition component will be an experimental program that
will cover one intensive District in Mysore (Chitradurga) with a popu-
lation of about 1.4 million, and with the other intensive District
(Kolar) serving as control; and one block in Uttar Pradesh, covering
a population of about 100,000 persons. The project has two objectives:
(a) to determine the effect that the provision of nutrition will have on
the acceptance of family planning service, both directly as an incentive
and indirectly as a result of the effect that a decline in infant mor-
tality can have on the desire for fewer children; and (b) to test the
means of implementing nutrition programs.
The Mysore Program
4.20      This program will provide supplementary feeding for women during
the last three months of pregnancy and the first six weeks of lactation,
and to infants aged 6-24 months. The food to be distributed will be a
processed (but not pre-cooked) food of the Bal-Ahar type consisting of a
cereal and a pulse with a protein content of about 20%; 100-110 grams,
equivalent to about 400 calories would be provided to mothers every day
and 50-55 grams to children.  Vitamin A and iron would be added and pos-,.
sibly folic acid. Processing of food would be done by existing Indian
plants.
Distribution
4.21      Women would come to the subcenters to collect their weekly supply
of food. Additional ANKs (one for every five subcenters) would be needed.
In addition, volunteers would be selected at the village level to visit
homes to follow-up women and children in their homes and collect additional
data for evaluation. They should serve as a link between the subcenter
and the home and could overcome the main difficulty of all nutrition
programs, namely that they do not provide sufficient knowledge of what
is happening in the home. The evaluation activities by the volunteers
will include principally taking the age, weight and height of children
to determine whether the supplements are effective in improving nutrition.
Phasing
4.22      In the first 2 years, the project will be tested in two blocks
of Mysore with one block including volunteers, and the other block being
limited to food distribution. While volunteers are desirable in principle,
there is some uncertainty of their effectiveness in practice. It is also
necessary to test the production, distribution and acceptability of dif-
ferent foods, and the administrative arrangements envisaged in the program
on a pilot basis. In the third year, a decision will be made in consulta-
tion with IDA, on the basis of joint review by GOI, SIDA and IDA, as to
the most appropriate way of expanding this to a district-wide basis. At
the end of the third year, about two-thirds of the District would be
covered, and during the last two years the whole District would be covered.



- 21 -
The Uttar Pradesh-Program:
4.23      In Uttar Pradesh, a program similar to that in Mysore will
be tried in one block. In view of the far more severe administrative
and personnel constraints in Uttar Pradesh, there is some question as
to whether a nutrition program can be effectively carried out without
affecting adversely the provision of family planning services. The
progress of the population and nutrition programs will be reviewed by
a joint GOI-SIDA-IDA mission in the third year; and on this basis a
decision will be made in consultation with the Association, on the
desirability, method and extent of expanding the nutrition component.
V. COST, FINANCING AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Costs
5.01      Total project costs are estimated at Rs 231.5 million
(U.S.$31.8 million). Of this total, Rs 118.7 million or U.S.$16.3
million is for Uttar Pradesh and Rs 112.8 million or U.S.$15.5 million
for Mysore. The foreign exchange component totals U.S.$1.6 million
or 5% of total project costs. This includes technical assistance,
and some technical equipment for the Population Centers and the foreign
exchange component of U.S.$1.0 million for construction, furniture
and equipment costs. Project costs which are exclusive of taxes are
shown in detail in Annex 7 and summarized in the following table.

5.02      The project cost estimates for buildings were derived from
the Government's assessment of actual costs of comparable recently-
completed buildings, and adjusted to include site development and the
provision of water, electricity, drainage  etc.  The cost of construction
is expected to average about Rs 400 per ml or Rs 38 per sq ft, and is
exclusive of the cost of land. For furniture and equipment costs, rea-
sonable bulk costs have been established and included in the estimate.
Detailed lists with itemized costs will be compiled during the design
stage and submitted to the Association before procurement. Professional
fees for construction and furniture and equipment were estimated as
varying between 2% and 7.5% of the cost of civil works depending on the
degree of repetition. Contingencies on capital costs were estimated as
follows: (a) 5% for unforeseen changes; and (b) 7.5% per year for price
escalation on the basis of the average increase in the last 4 years. For
non-capital costs, contingencies were estimated on the basis of a 4.5%
annual increase; wholesale price indices to which movements in government
salaries are related have been recently increasing at this rate.
B. Financina
5.03      The International Development Association and the Swedish
Goverrnent would be jointly responsible for financing 100% of all items
in the project in a two-to-one ratio. The Association would be the execut-
ing agent for the project in accordance with the provisions of the letter
of understanding signed between the Association and SIDA on June 3, 1969.
5.04      The GOI will finance all regular operating costs -s i.e., those
within the GOI pattern, giving priority to the project Districts. For
project-related facilities, the GOI will spend Rs 90.6 million (or U.S.
$12.5 million) in the period 1972-77; these expenditures are higher than
they would be otherwise as a result of the priority that will be given to
the project Districts.
C. Implementation
5.05      The administration, execution and evaluation of the project
would be carried out at the State level. In each of tUttar Pradesh and
Mysore, this responsibility would be vested in a Governing Board to be
created for this purpo8e and to be chaired by the Chief Secretary. The
Governing Board would meet every quarter and would be responsible for
broad policy formulation, the review of progress in the family planning
program on the basis of the results of the ongoing evaluation, the review
of the construction program, and the approval of iuggestions for innova-
tion and experimentation as necessary in all these areas. A State
Project Coordinator, supported with adequate staff, would be appointed
and attached to the Office of the Secretary of Health. He would act as
a point of liaison and coordination for the execution of the project in each
State which would be carried out by four groups. A Project Family Planning
Officer would be appointed in the Directorate of Health Services to be respon-
sible for the progress of the family planning program in the project areas.
He should be of the level of the State Family Planning Officer or of slightly
lower rank. A Nutrition Project Officer of the level of Nutrition Officer or
slightly lower rank would be appointed with the necessary supporting staff,



- 24 -
to be responsible for the progress of the nutrition component of the project.
The National Institute of Nutrition at Hyderabad will provide the necessary
technical assistance in Mysore and the all-India Institute of Medical Services
will do so in 'Jttar Pradesh (Annex 5). The signing of these contracts will he
done in consultation with the Association within sixty days after the date of
credit effectiveness. Management information and evaluation would be the
responsibility of the Population Center; and the implementation of construction
would be supervised by a Project Construction Unit headed by a superintending
engineer. The Governing Board would include at least the Secretary of Hfealthi
as Alternate Chairman, a representative of the Central Department of Family
Planning, the Director of the State Health Services, the State Arclitect, the
Chief Engineer, the Director of the Population Center, the Project Coordinator
who will serve as its Secretary, the Project Family Planning Officer, and
the head of the ProjectConstruction Unit.  It could also i.nclude the Plannin;
Secretary, Finance Secretary, State Family Planning Officer, and others sUch
as the State Town Planner, may be co-opted as necessary.
Implementation of Non-Construction Component
5.06      Each Population Center will have four main functions:
a.   the development of the overall experimental design in the
project area;
b.   the design, in collaboration with those responsible for program
implementation, of a system of routine data collection and
anaLysis with a feedback system to guide program operations anl
to measure its effectiveness in reducing fertility;
C.   the initiation of research, to be undertaken by the Population
Center or to be subcontracted to appropriate agencies, directed
primarily towards assessing existing program components and
experimentation with new program elements; and
d.   training of program personnel in data collection and analysis.
5.07     Each Population Center would cover the project area (the remainder
of each State would continue to be served by the existing Demographic Cells).
It would report its findings and recommendations for change directly to the
Governing Board on a continuous basis. The Director of each Population Center
would be a person experienced in research, management and the methodology of
evaluation; he does not necessarily have to be a medical doctor. His salary
level should be such as to attract a senior university professor and should
reflect the temporary nature of his assignment. His appointment is a condi-
tion of credit effectiveness. He should have sufficient administrative and
financial flexibility to allow him to operate effectively; in particular,
he should have full authority to subcontract research as necessary. The staff
of each Population Center would include four assistant directors to head the
following divisions: (a) Operational and Management Research with primary
responsibility for the experimental design of the project and management
studies that will improve program effectiveness; (b) Survey Techniques (and
Mathematical Statistics) for undertaking surveys that will supplement program
data; (c) Demographic Research to measure the demographic results



- 25 -
of the program; and (d) Research in the Social Sciences to investigate
the demand structure for family planning services. It would also include
a supporting staff of 20-30 research assistants and investigators. Annex
3 gives further details of the functions, organizational structure and
staffing of the Population Center. The Population Center in Mysore will
have a fifth assistant director to head a Nutrition Division, which will
undertake the internal evaluation of the nutrition component of the project.
Supporting Institutes
5.08      Two consulting institutes will be needed in initiating and
supporting the Population Centers.  (See Annex 3 for further details.)         -
Their functions would be to:
a.   Monitor the development of the Population Center and assist
its Director in defining the detailed functions of that
institution in the light of its objectives. This may include
deputizing petsons to work at the center for varying periods
of time.
b.   Assist in the design of initial research needed as a first
priority (fertility and family planning kntmiedge, attitude,
and practice surveys in each project area).
C.   Undertake specialized studies for the Population Center at
the request of its Director.
d.   Train personnel of the Population Center, as well as adminis-
trators in charge of program implementation, in management
techniques through 2-3 month courses.
e.   Lay the groundwork for the possible development of similar
centers in other States by creating an awareness among
administrators in these States of the importance of manage-
ment techniques through special training courses.
The State Governments have agreed to employ the services of the Adm -
istrative Staff College in Hyderabad for Mysore and the Indian Insti-
tute of Management at Ahmedabad for Uttar Pradesh. The GOI will also
provide direct support to each institute to allow it to develop a demo-
graphic capability, which is presently inadequate since the two institutes
were selected on the basis of their management capability and orientation.
The signing of the contract between each institute and each State tovern-
ment for the provision of services, and between those institutes and the
GOI for institution development, will be done in consultation with the
Association within sixty days of the date of credit effectiveness.
Implementation of Construction Components
5.09     Responsibility for day-to-day supervision of the construction
program will be vested in a project construction unit to be established
under each respective Ministry of Health and headed by a Superintending
Engineer. He would be provided with the necessary technical, clerical



- 26 -
and field staff to supervise the physical realization of the project. On
the basis of present GOI standards staff of approximately 50 engineers
will be needed for each Project Construction Unit. During Negotiations
assurances were given by the GOI that wnits of the requisite site would
be created as described.
Professional Services and Supervision
5.10     The respective State Architects, in consultation with the Chief
Architect, Central Public Works Department (CPWD), will take responsibility
for the schematics and master planning including preliminary investigations
and preparation of studies for both the Mysore and U.P. projects. The Clhief
Architect (CPWD-) will serve as a consultant and advisor to each Governing
Board for the coordination of the physical and financial elements of each
of the State projects. During negotiations assurances were given by the
GOI that a project planning research study would be executed of the functional,
anthropometric, and environmental conditions necessary to ensure the s1 isf;1
performance of the types of buildings to be constructed under the project.
This study would be performed by the Building Research Institute of tile (uunc ii
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in consultation with Lhe Nationai
Buildings Organization and the Chief Architect (CPWD).  The resulti,L, dat.. and
recommendations will be taken into account by each State Architect who will
in turn prepare detailed designs, overall site layouts, procurement documents
and implementation procedures. The various project components will, be packaged
for bidding according to the recommendations of each State Architect in con-
sultation with the Chief Architect (CPWD). Professional fees to cover the
above services have been included in the credit based on the scale of the
Indian Institute of Architects.
Project Sites
5.11     Each State Architect in consultation with the Chief Architect (CPWD)
will be responsible for approving the choice of suitable sites. During nego-
tiations assurances were obtained from GOI arLd the State Governments that
they (a) had or would obtain title to all the project sites and (b) would
prepare and execute the necessary work concerned in developihg sites as neces-
sary in accordance with the State Architect's program.
Project Procurement
5.12     Civil works contracts will be procured on the basis of local competi-
tive bidding. The building program, phased over more than four years, contains
over 1500 small buildings disbursed over a large area. International competitive
bidding would not be suitable for this and the furniture component. Contracts
for equipment, estimated to cost the equivalent of U.S. $100,000 or more, would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Domestic manu-
facturers would be accorded a preferential msrgin equal to 157. of the cif costs
of competing imports or to the existing rate of duty, whichever is lower.
Vehicles will be procured locally to encourage compatibility of makes and
ensure spare parts and servicing facilities.



- 27 -
Disbursements
5.13      Disbursements will be administered by the Association (IDA)
on behalf of SIDA. IDA and Swedish funds will be used jointly in the
ratio of 2:1 to finance 100% of the cost of civil works, salaries,
vehicles, furniture and equipment, nutrition and technical assistance,
net of taxes. For civil works executed under lump sum contracts of
U.S. $20,000 or more, disbursement requests will be supported by copies
of certified running bills and evidence of payment. Disbursements for
works totalling below U.S. $20,000, or force account work executed de-
partmentally, would be supported by statements of expenditure certified
by the Superintending Engineer.  Requests for reimbursement on the cost
of salaries, vehicles, furniture and equipment will be supported by con-
tracts, invoices, evidence of payment and certification.
VI. SOCIO-ECONCKIC ANALYSIS
6.01      It is particularly difficult to evaluate the demographic and
socio-economic effects of this project because of its experimental and
innovative nature -- like other investments in research, the resulting
socio-economic benefits will depend on the findings that emerge. It is
likely that these findings will more than justify the investment in this
project, not only directly but particularly in terms of the "spin-off"
or demonstration effects on the Indian program as a whole. Relatively
simple analysis, for example, of the comparative effectiveness of various
family planning workers or of the most receptive target population groups,
could, if translated into national strategy, save large amounts of funds.
The risk of investing U.S. 21.2 million is well justified and should be
compared with the expenditures of U.S. $420 million which the GOI is plan-
ning for the period 1969-74 for the whole program.
6.02      In addition to improving the overall performance of the Indian
family planning program, the project is expected to have large social
benefits -- such as improving the health and welfare of mothers and
children, improving the physical and mental development of the popula-
tion through better nutrition in the critical first years of life, etc.
These benefits cannot be quantified but are considerable and add to the
demographic and economic benefits, which are discussed in the following
paragraphs and which are a miniumn  estimate of the project effect.
(Annex 10 gives further details).
6.03      In Mysore, the project is estimated to prevent about 2.3 million
births between 1973 and 2000, resulting in a State population 202,000
smaller than without the project by the year 1980. This would constitute



-28 
around 40% of the slowdown required to reach in the State a birth rate of
30 per 1,000 population by 1980 and 25 per 1,000 population by the year
1990. In tie year 2000, the population of the State would be smaller by
2.1 million with the project. At the same time, in the project area, the
population figure would be 12X lower than without the project. This fer-
tility decline would be more than sufficient to achieve the target in that
area.
6.04     In Uttar Pradesh, similar estimates indicate that the project
would probably prevent about 1.5 million births between 1973 and 2000, re-
sulting in a State population that is 135,000 smaller than otherwise in 1980.
Such a decline in fertility would constitute 6% of the decrease required to
achieve a birth rate of 30 per 1,000 population by 1980 and 25 per 1,000
population by 1990. In the year 2000, the population of Uttar Pradesh would be
1.3 million smaller with the project and this would mean that in the project
area, the population would be 77. smaller than without the project. This
fertility decline would be sufficient to achieve about 50% of the goal by
1980 and would be more than sufficient to reach the "target" in the year 1000
within the project area.
6.05      The above demographic effects lead to considerable economic
benefits. The project leads to an increase in per capita income; this
is because it reduces the size of the population without effecting total
income. In the Uttar Pradesh project area, the project would lead to a
per capita income of Rs 827 in 1980-81 against Rs 818 without the project.
In Mysore, the corresponding figures are Rs 747 and Rs 733 respectively.
'While these increases in per capita income may be small, they are far
larger than could be expected from i,vesting similar resources in othet
sectors.  If total project costs had been invested-in alternative ac-
tivities, the increase in per capita income produowd by such investments
would have amounted to only about one fifth of th*t achieved by the project
in the Mysore project area and onef third Ili thA Uittar Piadeh pr6ject
area in 1980-81.
6.06      The effect of the project on employswmt would occur only after
15-20 years. The labor force in Uttar Pradesh wwttid be smaller by
137,000 in 2000. In Mysore, the corresponding figure is 220,000. If
unemployment is assumed to continue at present levels then the effect
of the project would be to reduce unemployment by over one fourth in the
Uttar Pradesh project area and by over one third in Mysore.
VII.  RECCMMENDATIONS

PERSONNEL AND FACILITI   FOR HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNTNIG
Introduction
1.        Financial resources for family planning in India have been increas-
ingly available during the last decade, reflecting a rapid expansion of per-
sonnel and equipment for this program. However, there are still shortages
with respect to the physical and personnel requirements sanctioned by the
Government of India. As shown in Table 1, by 1970-71 there were 5,044 rural
family welfare planning centers (complexes for family planning attached to
primary health centers (PHCs)) functioning, out of the 5,427 sanctioned.
Shortage of subcenters,- which constitute the end-points of the health net-
work reaching the rural people, was considerably more acute. Of the 42,142
subcenters required in India, 29,933 (71Z) are functioning at present. The
situation in the urban areas is more favorable in terms of centers available
for family planning services and personnel. In 1970-71, there were 1,777
urban family welfare centers functioning, out of 1,856 sanctcioned (at the
rate of one center per 50,000 population). As of March 1970, the family
planning program was run by a staff of 81,040i of which 3,419 were doctors;
25,506 were paramedical personnel (AMNs and LHV8); 26,115 were educational
and promotional staff; and 26,000 were administrative employees. The staff
in position was only half of the number estimated by the Government of
India as required to carry out the program. The most scarce category is the
medical doctors. Those working at present in the program constitute barely
over 30% of the number required. Paramedical personnel also falls short of
the needs by a wide margin -- only 352 are now in position.
2.        The construction program to produce adequate buildings and living
quarters for staff in rural areas of India is huge in terms of financial
resources and technical skill. Progress to date has been modest. For in-
stance, of the 5,044 rural primary family planning centers, only 1,133 have
buildings (Table 1). Also, only 6,637 of the almost 30,000 subcenters opera-
ting in rural areas have been provided with 44_quate quarters. A large part
of the program is carried out in crowded and barely-working facilities -- a
factor operating against effectiveness.
A. Uttar Pradesh
Existing Situation in the State
3.        The shortage of health personnel in Uttar Pradesh is very acute
and represents a serious obstacle for the implementation of the Government
of India pattern in family planning. At the district bureau level, there
are 54 lady doctors for the IUCD program against 108 sanctioned, leaving a
deflcit of 50%.  All DMOH-PPs are in position in the 54 districts, but only
34 of the 54 male assistant surgeons sanctioned for the sterilization program
are available at present. Overall, only half of the technical staff at the
district level is in position.



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 24
4.        In the rural areas at the field level, there are 775 PHCs func-
tioning, but 104 PHCs do not have doctors in position. Of the 7,440 sub-
centers that would be required on the basis of 1 per 10,000 population, only
4,765 (or 64%) are functioning. A main constraint in achieving this minimumt
coverage of the population is the severe shortage of AMs in Uttar Pradesh.
At present, there are 9,034 posts sanctioned for ANRM&, but odtly 2,303 are
in position. The other 4,375 AMM posts are filled by family welfare workers
(FWW) (2,756) and trained dais (1,619). These FWWs were recruited as an
interim measure among high school graduates who, after havli* rAcelved one
week's orientation, were posted to subcenters.  They were to be deptited
for ANM training in a phased program, but there was a high drop-out rate
among tbem. The Government has stopped recruitment of FWWs and Ihas autho-
rized the appointment of trained dais -- also a temporary measure. However,
both FWWs and dais are considered less effective than AhMs because of con-
siderable deficiences in their training, and, thevifere, stxffing of pr.t
health centers and subcenters will have to be de.s,4ored in terms of AftNPs.
Solutions to this problem for the project are9, *AIC& will undoubted4v have
favorable repercussion on a state-wide basis.t ar elng incorparat*d in this
project and are described in detail in p*ras 31- *n  33 of tb**ex.  Lady
health visitors (LVHs) are also in abort supply. Of the 375 p,tW  sanction-
ed in the State, 564 are in position. For the project area, recemeadations
are given in paras 26-27 and 55.
5.        There is scarcity of adequate buildiags for health and related
family planning services in the rural areas. Only 57 of the main center
complexes for family planning attached to PMCs have buildings compleed,
leaving a balance of 818 with respect to the 875 complexes required in the
State. The subcenters, constituting the lowest level in the health network
to reach the public, are also short of the required minimum. Of the 7,440
required, 4,765 subcenters are now functioning, but only for 380 buildings
have been completed. The GOI has sanctioned other 800 subcenters during
1970-71. Transportation, which is essential for implementing the program
in rural areas, is lacking in about 60% of the primary health centers.
6.        In the State, there are 156 sterilis&stion beds in 22 hopitals
having a capacity for only about 10,000 tubectemise por year. However, only
two hospitals in Uttar Pradesh have an operating theatre exclusively for
tubectomy operations.
7.        Availability of facilities and personnel for family planning in
the urban areas is considerably better. There are 206 urban family plawming
welfare centers functioning, of the 220 needed at the rate of 1 per 50,000
population (154 State, 31 local bodies, 25 voluntary organizations, and 3
public sector undertakings). Five hospitals have postpartum schemes for
motivating recently-delivered mothers.

Project Districts
a.   Existing Facilities and Needs
The project will provide physical facilities in Lucknow City for
the population center (see Annex 3) and the urban program; in the remaining
districts selected, the project will supplement the infrastructure to carry
out the rural program according to the GOI pattern, and in the intensive
districts, it will have components to test new approaches. In the project,
particular attention is given to training of ANMs. Details of the physical
facilities to be financed by the project are given in Annex 4. tere, exist-
ing facilities and justification for the adoption of the specific physical
components will be given in terms of their contribution to the improvement
of the family planning program.
9.        In Lucknow City, the project will include the construction of eight
maternity homes with 30 beds each. Half of the 240 beds will be devote; to
deliveries and the other half to tubectomy cases. In this city, there are
only 451 maternity beds which are also used for gynecological cases. The
new maternity homes will increase delivery facilities by 25% and will allow
the handling of 3,500 more institutionalized deliveries per year (i.e., 35%
more than those attended in 1970-71) and, even more important for the object-
ives of the project, will provide the basis for a combined postpartum pro-
gram both for mothers delivering in these facilities and for those deliver-
ing at home with the assistance of government midwives. In Lucknlw City,
the second part of the program is particularly significant, since a large
proportion of deliveries take place at home (71.3% in 1970-71 - Table 2).
It will constitute an innovation of the postpartum promotion of family plan-
ning, since it will be directed at professionally-supervised deliveries
occurring at home, and not only at institutionalized  cases.  It i8 diffi-
cult to determine at this stage how many more deliveries the goverment
staff will be able to supervise because it depends on the availability of
personnel, but on the basis of present performance, postpartum advice would
be given annually to about 4,000 women delivering in their homes (Table 2).
10.       The balance of the bed input in Lucknow City 120 beds) will be
utilized for tubectomy cases. This will represent a considerable increase
in facilities for this type of operation. In 1970-71, only 772 tubectomies
were performed in the city, while with the new facilities, 5,600 tubectomies
could be handled yearly 1/.
11.       Another contribution of the project to the urban program in Luckuow
will be the construction of fourteen new Urban Family Welfare Centers (UFWCs)
(Annex 4 page 2), eight attached to the new maternity homes, and six separate
buildings. These cen.ers will function as outpatient facilities for (a) the
o..;tl..rt imi progralm hot1h witlln thte maternity homes and for home deliveries;
00 I icid lace-to-lace miotivation of target couples, done by family planning
exte11siotn edtucators; (c) outpatient counselling on family planning methods;
1/   Considering an 80% occupancy rate and 5 days' average stay.



ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 24
(d) provision of services (IUCD insertions and vasectomies) and distribution
of contraceptives; and (e) follow-up of acceptors.
12.       At present, there are 15 UFWCs in Lucknow.  This number is very
close to the 17 UFWCs needed on the basis of one per 50,000 population.
However, only two of the premises in which these centers are now functioning
are adequate; the project will provide new and considerably better quarters
for 14 units, to develop the comprehensive functions described for these
centers in para 11 above.
13.       The organization of the urban family planning program in Lucknow
will be entrusted to the City Family Planning Bureau, (CFPB), which does not
exist at present but will be created and provided with a new building by
this project. The Government has already sanctioned the staff for this
Bureau. Its functions will be (a) to draw up a detailed plan of operation
to provide maternal and child health (MCH) care and family planning services
covering the whole city; (b) to coordinate services, supplies, information
efforts, and the collection of relevant data; and (c) to administer a mass-
media motivation program. It will work under the CFPB and will coordinate
and cooperate with the Population Center on the design of the urban program.
14.       Another component of the urban program that will be directly under
the responsibility of the CFPB is a communication-mass-media motivation
scheme to be designed by the Population Center. This scheme will specify
the most effective means of increasing the demand for family planning ser-
vices. In this area, in addition to other activities that would arise from
the recommendations developed by the Population Center, the following should
be emphasized:
(a) seminars, lectures, printed materials to motivate govern--
ment staff, employees of the industrial sector, and the
public in general; and
(b)  increased efforts to involve opinion leaders through
direct contacts and talks and direct mailing of family
planning materials (bulletins, news letters, program
progress, policy changes, technical information, etc.).
15.       The project will also provide five new buildings for the District
Familv Planning Bureaus in each of the project districts. Present facili-
ties for these Bureaus are inadequate for the increased functions and
efficlency expected from the implementation of this experimental project.
16.       Besides the maternity homes in Lucknow, medical facilities for
sterilizations and postpartum in rural areas will constitute another impor-
tant component. In Uttar Pradesh, 30-bed sterilization annexes will be
built in eachi of the five district hospitals of the project area, and 10
24-bed maternity-sterilization wings will be added to PHCs in the two in-
tensive districts -- Rae Bareli and Saharanpur. Half of the number of beds

1/ In the absence of vital statistics, approximate number of births has been

in the PHC wings will be used for sterilization, and half for maternity,
where postpartum motivation will be practiced in a rural set-up.  A motiva-
tion program to encourage family planning among women delivering at home
will also be carried out from these PHCs.
17.       The number of beds (190 for tubectomies and 140 for maternity)
was set on the basis of personnel availability and potential utilization.
In Uttar Pradesh, the lower number of beds allotted to the project in com-
parison with Mysore was dictated by the scarcity of health personnel.
Besides, in Uttar Pradesh acceptance of vasectomies as a form of contra-
ception seems to be quite prevalent. In 1970-71, the sterilization program
achieved 77,899 acceptors of which 86% were vasectomy cases.
18.       The added bed-capacity for tubectomies in the project area will
allow the performance of about 11,100 operations a year, which would repre-
sent a doubling of the 1970-71 program outcome in the whole State of Uttar
Pradesh. The need for increasing the capacity of facilities for tubectomies
in the State is demonstrated by the fact that the 78,000 sterilizations of
the past year represented only 25X of the Government's expectations.
19.       India is one of the few countries of the world where both male
and female sterilizations are generally accepted by large numbers as means
of controlling fertility. Since female sterilization (or tubectomy) is a
more difficult operation than vasectomy and requires an operating theatre,
sterile conditions and several days of hospitalization, special hospital
facilities are essential. Vasectomy is regarded as a minor surgical pro-
cedure not requiring hospitalization, and consequently will continue to be
performed throughout the project districts in outpatient departments of
hospitals and primary health centers. Special accommodation for this opera-
tion will be allowed in new health facilities to be built under the project.
20.       The health infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh will need reinforcement
in the project area in order to implement the experimental program. For
this purpose, the project includes the construction of 41 PHC complexes for
health services, and 73 family planning complexes attached to PHCs, including
living quarters for personnel in both cases. The details of the facilities
which the project will furnish, by district, are given in Table 3. This
component will enable a minimum coverage of the rural population at the ratie
of I PHC per 80,000 population, using as a basis the 1961 census.        The pro-
ject calls for increased means of reaching the rural people with information
and services in family planning, and the family planning network needs the
support and supervision of the health infrastructure.

21.       The end-points of the network reaching the rural populatlon are
the subcenters, each staffed with one ANM, who has responsibility for basic
health and MCH care and deliveries.  The GOI stan4erd is one ANI per 10,000
population; however, in Uttar Pradesh, there is one ANM per over 30,000
population, and in practice, one such worker can only serve a population of
about 2,500 to 3,000. The number and location of subcenters to be built
through the project have been based on the principle of meeting the GOI
standard of one subcenter (or one ANM) per 10,000 population in all project
districts of Uttar Pradesh. The present situation concerning subcenters
and the additions which will be made by the project are presented in Table 4.
Given the personnel constraints in Uttar Pradesh mentioned above, it
will not be possible to build up the infrastructure to reach a ratio
of one subcenter per 5,000 population in the two intensive districts,
as will be done in Mysore. However, if during the project period the
State finds it feasible to meet that ratio, the Central Goverument has
agreed to finance any additional construction for that purpose in the
intensive districts. The project will finance construction of 654 sub-
centers in Uttar Pradesh.

22.       Besides the fixed facilities for health and family planning which
the project will provide, there will be four mobile teams, two in each of the
intensive districts of Uttar Pradesh for motivation and services. Mobile
teams are dealt with in detail in Annex 6.
b.   Persounel Situation and Project Needs
23.       All personnel sanctioned In the Government of India pattern should
be in position. The GOI and both State Governments have agreed to take the
necessary measures in order to fill the existing gaps in personnel within
the project districts. Posts will be sanctioned, new staff will be hired,
and some transfers to the project districts from other parts of the State
will be required.  In addition, government officials consider that it will
be possible to hire doctors required for the program among those in private
practice, on a part-time basis.

24.       The shortage of ANMs is a matter of serious concern in Pttp:
Pradesh. In the project districts, there are 986 posts sanctioned but only
651 are filled. of these, 261 are occupied by ANHs, 134 bv FWWs, and 256 by
trained dais (Table 5). When the physical facilities of the project are
completed, there will be need for 923 ANMs (662 ANMs additional to those now
in position) to staff the subcenters and to work at PHCs. This is a minimum
requirement considering a ratio of 1 per 10,000 population of 1971
25.       In addition to the 923 ANMs mentioned above, the project demands
90 ANUs to staff sterilization-maternity annexes and IJFWCs.  The total nee,
for the project area is 1,013 ANMs. Vacancies among these positions will 1 i.
to be filled initially by transfers from other districts, but mainly froml
the output of the ANM schools. (Training of ANMs for project area is dis-
cussed in section C of this annex.)

26.       Lady health visitors (LHVs) function mainly as supervisors for
ANMs in the field. These workers are trained in a course of 2-1/2 years'
duration (6 months longer than the course for ANM); the minimum educa-
tional level for admission to this course in Standard 10. Of the total
number sanctioned in the State (875), 98 are in the project area and of
these, only 63 posts are filled. To meet the minimum requirement of 1 LHV
per 4 ANMs, 230 LHVs will be needed for field supervision in PHCs (includ-
ing subcenter supervision). One way of filling these positions is to recruit
among the graduates from four LHV schools in Uttar Pradesh, beginning with
the 1972 graduation. However, since these schools are training personnel
for the whole State, it will not be possible to fulfill the needs in the
project districts only from this source.
27.       The Government of Uttar Pradesh has agreed to fill LHV supervisory
positions preferably with public health nurses. If this proves insufficient,
the Government will have to consider the recommendation accepted by Mysore
(see recommendations in para 55 of this annex) i.e., that plans be made by
the Uttar Pradesh Government to deputize qualified nurse-midwives for a limited
period of 2 years to fill positions sanctioned for LHVs in the project area,
after an orientation course (maybe of 3 months) in public health, family plan-
ning and maternal and child health. It is understood that 50 qualified nurse-
midwives would be made available in Uttar Pradesh each year for this purpose.
C.   Training of Auxiliary Nurse-Midwives and Tutors
28.       Personnel shortages in the paramedical field have been outlined in
previous sections. Solutions to this problem are essential for the imple-
mentation of the project since it is through the end-points of the health
network -- the subeenters -- that the rural population is to be reached and
made aware of the existence of alternative methods of controlling fertility.
While an auxiliary nurse-midwife (ANM) is supposed to cover, according to the
government pattern, a population of 10,000, in fact in many areas she is
responsible for a much larger group and in practice one ANM can only realis--
tically cover a population of about 3,000. This means that a large portion
of the rural population remains outside the reach of regular health service;
and is excluded from family planning advice and services.
29.       Under the supervision of a lady health visitor (LHV), the ANM is
a multipurpose worker, dealing with maternal and child care and family plan-
ning services in rural areas; she also treats minor ailments and maintains a
register of couples eligible for family planning and other health records.
The training of ANMs consists of 2 years of basic hospital nursing, midwifery
practice including prenatal care, delivery and child care, and rural health
experience. Family planning is supposed to be integrated Into their curricu-
lum, although in practice this integration is far from adequate.
30.       Present training facilities for ANMs exist at 22 government centers
in Uttar Pradesh which have a total annual admission capacity of 880 students.
It is estimated that between 1971 and October 1973, these centers will have
produced about 1,700 trained ANMa, bringing the total available to over
4,000. However, this will be only an alleviation of the problem, since at
present the recruitment need in the whole State is for over 9,000 ANMs and
this demand will keep increasing through the years.



ANNEX 2
Page 12 of 24
31.       In the project, particular emphasis will be given to the training
of this essential category of personnel. New buildings for classes and
hostel accommodation for 78 students, to produce an annual output of 30
sldents, will be provided for three existing ANM schools in the project
area -- Lucknow, Faizabad (the only school outside the project atea), and
Sai-aranpur. In additioni, five new schools with the same capacity wi3l be
created under the project and provided with all teaching facilities and
equipment. Location and expected completion dates for the schools are given
in Table 6. Each of the new schools will be attached to hospitals wttlh
sufficient capacity for maternity patients, to allow for clinical prattice,
and will be also connected with one PIIC each, where the students will receive
rural health experience. For the latter purpose, tbe project vill pt'6ide
living accommodation for 10 students in 8 PHCs.  As shown in Table 5, the
total minimum need for the project area will be 1,013 ANX's wh* the proj.ect
facilities start functioning in 1975-76 1/.
32.       As mentioned in para 30, the 22 existing ANM schools in the State
will have produced over 1,700 ANMa between 1971 and October 1973, and the
State Government has agreed to give high priority to filling of vacant posts
in the project areas. However, it is unrealistic to expect that it will
be possible to post most of the new personnel in these districts due to
the political implications of such measure and to problems on the part of
new graduates to accept positions in areas far away from their habitual
places of residence. Consequently, the project will rely on the production
of ANNs from the existing and new schools located within the project area.
Building of ANTM schools has the highest priority in the construction program.
According to plan, two of the schools would be ready in the second year of
the project (probably in 1973), four of the schools in the third year (1974),
and the remaining two schools in 1975 (Table 6).  In the meantioe, thie State
Government will be requested to make a spdceiad effort in (*) fillint is'many
ANIV post vacancies as possible in the ptoject dAstrfttg4 updn irvirttsiion of
the project (b) sanctioning 60 6tud6tt p6sitio`h  in eAth dthool in time for
proper recruitment and selection beginning in September 1972; and (c) enebur-
aging graduates from those schools in 1972 and subsequent years to take
positions as ANMs in the project districts.  The number of personnel which
would be available in the coming years is estimated on the basis of 1971
active ANMs, expected completion date of schools, and a 3X personnel
attrition rate per year. It is assumed that each existing school will
graduate 25 ANMs per year up to 1974 and new schools vill graduate 30 A"Ms
per year.
33.       According to the estimates presented in Table 7, considering only
the output of the schools in the project area and assuming that the ANfs
turning out from those schools will be posted in the project area, it may be
reasonable to expect that by 1977these schools would have turned out enough
ANMs to cover 90% of che estimated additional need. The remaining 10%
could be recruited from other schools in the project districts.
1/   The five-year project period will be probably 1972-77, but part of the
facilities requiring ANM8 are planned to be completed in a shorter time.

34.       A serious problem facing the expansion of the ANM training program
in Uttar Pradesh is the insufficient number of qualified teaching staff
available. This project proposes a solution to this problem for the project
schools by:
(a) three-month courses in teaching methods for 16 tutors (public health
nurses, sister and staff nurses) already in position in the three schools
functioning in the project area, listed in Table 6; arrangements could be
made with the Division of Nursing and the Principal of the Post-Basic School
of Nursing atKampur, to conduct a three-month program starting in September
1972 in methods of teaching, including methodology of integrating family
planning throughout the 2 years' preparation of the ANM; and (b) selection of
16 nurse-midwives with the required education and experience to receive 1
year's preparation in teaching, including methodology of integrating family
planning throughout the 2 year's preparation of the ANM; these nurse-midwives
would be deputized and given fellowships financed by this project to study
in the College of Nursing in New Delhi or the College of Nursing at Indore,
M.P. or both. The first group of six students would have to coumence studies
in 1972. Financial support to these programs through the project is as
follows:

B. Mysore
Existing Situation in the State
35.       In Mysore, the overall situation with reference to personnel avail-
ability for the family planning program in rural areas is fairly favorable;
although at the district level 25% of the positions sanctioned for family
planning are not filled, the main deficiencies are in the administration
category, which is not in scarce supply. This gap may be easily closed
through government action in personnel recruitment, preceded by careful
examination of actual personnel needs.
36.       Of the 265 main centers for family planning attached to PHCs in
rural areas, all except one had a doctor in their staff in 1971. The State
has also a fairly adequate supply of ANMa in terms of number of active per-
sonnel in relation to population. At present, there are 4,001 ANMs in
government service out of 4,352 posts sanctioned -- an overall ratio of
one per 7,300 total 1971 population. However, not all this personnel is
in rural subcenters; some are detailed in hospitals and main centers.
Actual coverage of the rural population by ANMs may be more fairly measured
if account is taken that there are 1,972 subcenters and 679 Mysore-type
health units in the State (Table 1), giving a coverage of one subcenter per
8,400 rural population. Besides, poor quality of training and lack of
adequate facilities for ANM schools are as serious constraints as scarcity
of personnel. The project includes upgrading of teaching in ANM schools, as
described in paras 52 - 54 of this annex. In the State, 530 LHVs, who are
supervisors of ANM work, would be needed but at present only about 265 posts
are filled. A solution to this shortage for the project area is suggested
in para 51 of this annex.



ANNEX 2
Page 16 of 24
37.       Table 1 presents a  tmnary of the health and family planning
facilities in the State. All buildings for PHCs and family planning com-
p'exes (265), sanctioned by the GOI at the ratio of 1 per 80,000 population
or 19(1, have been completed. The building program for subcenters is also
Ca- 7-v advanced. However, that coverage, adopted as standard by the cOl
for practical purposes on a national basis, still leaves large sectors of
-he population without health and family planning services. The purpose of
-:he project is to provide subcenters and supporting supervisory personnel in
Mysore to improve this ratio towards a more realistic and effective service
to the rural population.
38.       A good basis exists for family planning services in urban areas.
There are 59 UFWCs, 3 hospitals doing postpartum motivation, and 211 other
urban institutions carrying out family planning work in the cities of the
State.
Project Districts
a.   Existing Facilities and Needs
39.       The project will provide physical facilities in Bangalore City
for the population center (see Annex 3) and the urban program; in the rem;in-
ing rural districts chosen, the project will finance further development of
t-he health infrastructure to extend the health system in order to reach
effectively a higher proportion of the rural population.  In the intensive
districts, additional components will be incorporated to test new approaches:
the intensive approach includes subcenters to cover 5,000 population per
unit, supplementary supervisory and field motivation personnel, and motiva-
tional and service mobile units to operate in the two intensive districts --
Chitradurga and Kolar (Annex 6). Details of the project facilities are
g4ven in Annex 4. Here, the present situation in the project districts of
Mysore in terms of physical facilities available for the family planning
program will be presented, together with justification of the components
adopted for this project.
4).       In Bangalore, the project includes the construction of six mater-
nity homes with a total of 180 beds, half of which will be used for tubectomy
operations and half for maternity. There are at present 1,608 maternity beds
in government hospitals which in 1970 were utilized to attend to almost
45,500 deliveries around 70Z of the total estimated deliveries in the city
(see Table 2). The high proportion of institutionalized deliveries in
Bangalore City constitutes a good base for establishing or stepping-up post-
partum programs. At present, no small hospltals have such an activity. 1/
1/   According to the GOI pattern, funds and personnel are allocated for post-
partum programs only for large hospitals with 1,500 or more deliveries
per year, although now this rule is being revised to include smaller
hospitals.



ANNEX 2
Page 17 of 24
The project will make provisions for carrying out postpartum prowtion of
family planning in the six maternity homes to be built in Bangalore which,
on the assumption of an 80% occupancy and an average stay of 10 days, will
be able to handle a combined total of 3,200 deliveries per year and provide
bed capacity for 7,100 tubectomies.
41.       In Bangalore, the postpartum program in the project's maternity
homes and for women who deliver at home, assisted by government midwifery
personnel, will be part of the activities of 14 UFWCs to be built -- six
urban family welfare centers annexed to the new maternity homes and eight
additional centers, which will be built in MCH campuses. Other functions
of the UFWCs are those stated in para 11 of this annex. There are at present
18 UFWCs in the city. At the rate of 1 per 50,000 population, the Govern-
ment has estimated that-there is need for 32 centers; the project will elimi-
nate the deficit.
42.       The organization of the urban family planning program in Bangalore
will continue to be the responsibility of the City Family Planning Bureau.
Its functions and responsibilities are the same as those listed for Lucknow's
Bureau in para 13.
43.       The project will also provide five new buildings for five District
Family Planning Bureaus in each of the project districts. Present facili-
ties are inadequate, taking into account the increased functions and effi-
ciency expected of these Bureaus to implement the project.
44.       In Mysore, a particularly important component of the project is
the provision of medical facilities for sterilizations and postpartum
motivation in the rural areas. Ak total of 506 beds for sterilizations will
be added to district and Taluk hospitals in all project districts and to
ten PHCs in the two intensive districts.  Allocation of sterilization beds
has been possible to a greater extent in Mysore, since there is sufficient
personnel to staff the new units. Also, potential utilization of the
facilities has been taken into consideration. During 1970-71, 32,496
sterilizations were performed in Mysore State; this, combined with 14,852
vasectomies achieved 29% of the target set by the Government for steriliza-
tions. One of the resons often mentioned by government officials for low
results compared to expectations is the lack of medical facilities for
tubectomy operations. The added bed capacity in Mysore will make it possibl(
to perform up to 30,000 tubectomies per year, which would constitute a 60%
increase over the present outcome of the tubectomy program.
45.       In the intensive districts, 140 maternity beds will be added to
ten PHCs (together with an equal number of beds for tubectomies, already
mentioned in the previous paragraph). In the rural areas of each state,
institutionalized deliveries are a small proportion of total deliveries
(between 2.2 and 8.3% per year in the project districts - Table 2). This
small input of maternity beds will become part of the experimental rural
scheme to recruit acceptors among recently-delivered women (both at the
PHCs and at home).

46.       This part of the project is focused on providing a minimum stand-
ard of maternity, child care and family planning services to all el4gible
persons with the main Intention of experimenting with a rural postpartum
program for women who do not deliver in hospitals. Up to the present,
programs of this type have taken place in hospitals of urban areas and are
based on the well-proven principle that the postpartum period is the best
time to inform women about contraception. Most women remain fecune after
each birth, and it is considered that a 5% incidence of infertility after
delivery is a generous estimate. Pregnant and recently-delivered mothers
constitute a "high risk" group for pregnancy and are, therefore, an excellent
target for advice on family spacing or limitation. In order to reach this
group systematically in the rural areas of India, it is first netessery to
build up the maternal and child care network and increase the propsrtion of
deliveries supervised by health personnel. Also* there is incresuing
evidence that reductions in nffant mortality through better MMR care may
encourage fertility control, with a time lag, when parents begiti to reaize
that it is no longer necessary to raise large families to a8sute the survival
of a few.
47.       Under the general guidance of the PHC, the ANM in intensive
districts will have an important role in the implementation of the rural
postpartum program, in coordination with the family planning health assist-
ant and the block extension educators sanctioned especially for this
program. The ANM will be entrusted with the identitfication of newly preg-
nant women and the preparation of individual records on each case, with
copies for the family planning personnel, who in turn will contact the
women and husbands before and after delivery to provide them with informa-
tion about family planning.
48.       The coordination of the rural postpartum  program will be the
responsibility of the Project Implementation uIit jotntly with the DW)W,
the District Civil Surgeon and the District W1men'S Hospital Superintendent.
The design of the operational procedures for the rural postpartumt program
will be the responsibility of the population center as part of the general
scheme for the whole project.
49.       The construction of 723 subcenters in the project has the objective
of giving a more realistic coverage of the rural population, In health and
family planning. Table 8 summarizes the present number of subcenters avail-
able in the project districts and the number to be built.

b.   Personnel Situation and Project Needs
50.       General measures to be taken by the State Governments in the
project areas of both States are outlined in section A, para 23. In Mysore,
of the 4,001 ANMs on active government service, 1,289 are in the project
districts. The needs for the districts, including the additional demands
of the project, are estimated at 1,359 ANMN (Table 9). The additional
requirement can be met in 2 years' time if graduates from the five ANM
schools to be built under the project are recruited for those districts
(see para 53 on training of ANMs).

/2 For intensive districts, the ANM requirement is estimated at a ratio of
1 per 5,000 population (1971 census).
13 A higher number is required due to irregular and impassable terrain.
51.       As in Uttar Pradesh, the LHVs are used as supervisors of the ANMs'
work. At present, there are 265 LHVs in position in PHCs throughout the
State. At the ratio of 1 LHV for every 4 ANMs, there is a high deficit of
this personnel to supervise the present 1,972 subcenters, for which 493 LHVs
would be needed in the State. There are three LHV schools in the State with
a total training capacity per annum of 120 students.  However, these new
ANMA will be also needed in other parts of the State. In order to fill
vacancies in the project area, where 284 supervisors of ANM. will be needed.
It is intended that for this project the Mysore Government utilizes nurse-
midwives as supervisors of ANMs in PHCs following a three-month orientation
in family planning and public health, and maternal and child care. The Mysore
Government has agreed to train nurse-midwives and employ them as supervisors
of ANM students ir. their rural health practice. The same type of training
toutld be given to nurse-midwives in order to prepare them for supervisory func-
tions.  'lhere is a pool of unemployed midwives in Mysore from which the Govern-
wevii can draw for this program. In addition, the Government could deputize
personnel to this area. This would entail agreement with the appropriate
Directorates on:



ANNEX 2
Page 21 of 24
(a) Terms of deputation (each nurse-midwife should retain such
rights as those of promotion and transfer, deputation for
further education, etc.);
(b) Number to be deputized each year and period (generally
2 years);
(c) Salaries;
(d) Sanction of the number of supervisory posts required in
the project areas; and
(e) Planning and implementation of an ongoing orientation
course in public health, family planning, and maternal
and child care, to prepare the nurse-midwives for their
functions as supervisors in the field.
C.   Training of Auxiliary Nurse-Midwives and Tutors
52.       There are 19 ANM government schools in Mysore, with a total
training capacity of 570 ANM students per annum. Other six training centers
(private and voluntary) can produce 160 additional ANMb yearly (Table 10).
In the project area, there are five ANM schools located as listed in Table 11.

53.       The sanctioning of students' positions in these schools is soke-
times delayed, and recruiting in the past has been irregular due to lack
of budget allocations. Poor quality of teaching and deteriorated facilities
are serious constraints in the training of A3b in Mysore. Although there
is no need to open new schools to cover the personnel requirements of the
project, new buildings with hostel accommodation for 78 students (to produce
30 graduates yearly) are urgently needed to train the basic workers for the
program. With the ANMe trained in the schools of the project area, personnel
needs can be fulfilled by 1973. Emphasis will be put through the project on
improving the quality of teaching. To this effect, the following measures
are recommended:
(a) Regular budgeting, recruitment, selection and acceptance of
students (30 students should be admitted once a year in each
of the five schools);
(b) Better selection of students within the Government's recruit-
ment rules and following the minimum educational requirements
established by the Indian Nursing Council (i.e., completion
of the first seven classes of schooling and passing the
entrance examination);
(c) Increase in tutor/student ratio (1/30), by sanctioning two
tutor posts in each school in the project area; and
(d) Sanction of posts of PHN at each of the PHCs selected as
training centers for rural health experience of ANNM.



ANNEX 2

D. Measures Concerning Health Personnel Recruitment and
Training in Pro3ect Areas
54.     The ability to meet the targets for family planning depends pri-
marily on the availability of the necessary paramedical personnel to help
carry out the program. At present, the most important worker in this
category in India is the auxiliary nurse-midwife, with the complement of
the LHV as supervisor. In Uttar Pradesh, the shortage of ANMs is a matter
of serious concern.  Poor quality of training, highly inadequate facilities
for classes and living accommodation, coupled with irregular recruitment of
students are problems common to both States. The solutions proposed by
this project include provision of adequate training facilities and fellow-
ships for training tutors; improved quality of training for ANKs and in-
corporation of family planning in their curriculum are priority matters.
The following assurances were obtained from the GOI and the State Govern-
ments, concerning the project areas:
(a) Sanction of such additional positions for field personnel
as shall be required to implement the Program;
(b) Cause the Regional Family Planning Training Centers in
Bangalore and Lucknow to give reasonable priority to
training and retraining of family planning workers;
(c)  Train nurse-midwives and cause them to be employed as
supervisors of ANM students in PHCs, to the extent such
positions cannot be filled with public health nurses
(in U.P. or "LHVs");
(d) In U.P., carry out, starting in September 1972, a pro-
gram to train tutors for ANM schools.
55.     The following points summarize detailed measures that will be
taken by the State Governments to fulfill the objectives of the project
in the area of personnel recruitment and training:
(a) Creation of the extra nurse/tutor posts to raise the
I:utor/student ratio in ANM schools, to meet the re-
quirements of the Indian Nursing Council which specify
one tutor engaged full-time in teaching for every 30
students;
(b) Filling up of posts of staff nurses in the hospitals to
which the ANM schools are attached, to meet the require-
ments of the Indian Nursing Council;
(c) Creation of posts and appointment of public health nurses,
or oriented nurse-midwives, or health visitors in that
order of preference, to the selected primary health centers
to be used as rural training centers, to plan, coordinate
and supervise the ANM community nursing program;



ANNEX 2
Page 24 of 24
(d) Upgrading the methods of teaching, and giving orientation
to existing tutors concerning the methods of integrating
family planning in the AlNMs' basic preparation;
(e) Creation of extra posts of supervisors for ANMs at primary
health center level, to meet the GOI's proposal of one
supervisor for every four ANMs in the project areas;
(f) Deputation of nurse-midwives, following a three-month
orientation course in public health, family planning and
maternal and child health, as ANM supervisors in primary
health centers and subcenters to offset the present short-
age of health visitors;
(g) Creation of the post of district public health nurse super-
visor under the district medical officer in each project
district, to ensure more effective supervision of the ANM's
work, thus raising the standard of services rendered by her;
(h)  Appointment of a qualified, experienced nurse-educator,
who will coordinate and supervise all ANM training at state-
level (or alternatively, this person could be in charge of
the ANM's work and training in the project area under the
project implementation head); and
(i) Making permanent all ANM posts, to provide a feeling of
security and to encourage ANMs to look upon public health,
family planning, and maternal and child health work as a
worthwhile career.

The Population Centers and Supporting Institutes
A. The Population Centers
Objective
1.        The broad objective of each Population Center will be:
(a) To respond to questions posed by administrators upon which
program and policy decisions depend, and to provide informa-
tion regarding changes in the supply system of demand struc-
ture which have implications for policy and program opera-
tions on a continuous basis; and
(b) To organize a management-information and evaluation system
(MIES) that is relevant to the needs of the GOI and the States
of Mysore and Uttar Pradesh. The objective of the Population
Center should be to work within the broad framework provided
by the COI Family Planning program, and to provide information
which can be used in a constructive way to improve the program.
This need not be done through a radical revision of the existing
system; rather, a continuous flow of small but crucial program
adjustments may be necessary -- a slight rearrangement of alloca-
tions here, a shift in personnel there, etc. Thus, the program
will become a dynamic and continually developing one, responsive
to the changing times, to the shifting demand structure, and to
the factors which affect both supply and demand.
Functions
2.        The principal functions of each Population Center will be to:
(a) Establish baseline fertility levels for the project areas in
order to provide baseline data against which the effect of
project inputs may be measured. Since the fertility level is
the ultimate measure of the family planning program effective-
ness, any research design should provide for a'systematic sam-
pling on a continuous basis of the collection of fertility da'-a.
(b) Develop the experimental design of the project. In each project
area, additional trained personnel, paramedical training centers,
and construction of training and service facilities are being
added. In each State, a main urban center (in the cities of
Lucknow and Bangalore) and five districts have been selected.
The selection is designed to provide some variation in the levels
of urbanization and socio-economic development. Three main types
of patterns are proposed:



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 18
(1)  an urban program in Bangalore and Lucknow;
(ii) an optimal GOI pattern in the remaining Districts;
and
(iii) an intensive rural program in two districts in
Mysore State and two Districts of U.P. In addi-
tion, a nutrition program will be introduced into
Mysore State.  In Project areas, the Population
Center will be responsible for designing in detail,
initiating and evaluating the various experimental/
demonstration projects.
The responsibility for experimental design of the Project is
a heavy one which will require not only a highly skilled and
able staff, but will also require additional technical inputs
from the Population Center-affiliated institutions and close
cooperation with program administrators.
It is important that a framework should exist within which
the Population Center Director and his consulting institute
are to work, but it is imperative that the Director be allowed
considerable latitude in the selection of specific ways in
which tc achieve the Center's obJectives.
(c)  Develop and effective monitoring system by revising and
improving the present system of recording and reporting
for the Project area. The existing system does not supply
adequate data for an in-depth, systematic evaluation of
proposed Prcject inputs. A non-exhaustive list of aspects
of the program and the Project which will require monltor-
ing is as follows:
(i) Estimates of various demographic rates in particular
fertility levels for the Project areas;
(ii)  The extent and types of contraceptive practice (non-
program methods as well as program methods) among the
target population;
(iii) Measurement on a continuing basis of the type and
quality of Family Planning services utilized; this
will include appraisal not only of technical skills
(e.g., insertion technique, sterilization procedure,
etc.) but also the subjective assessments of clients
who have availed themselves of the services:



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 18
(iv) The extent of service utilization relative to service
capacity;
(v) The initial levels and continuation rates of family
planning practice among program acceptors; in all
probability, these rates will exhibit variations
between and among project areas due to variations
in the availability of services and different levels
of demand;
(vi) The fertility and family planning histories of samples
of all couples served by the program, especially after
they leave the program;
(vii) The reproductive history of the general population of
child bearing age, not just the part reached by the
program;
(viii) The cost-effectiveness and program and policy implications
of the various experimental project inputs and methods;
(ix) The characteristics and program effectiveness of various
types of workers and administrative arrangements; and
(x) The quality of program management.
(d)  Investigation of the Family Planning Demand Structure.  India's
family planning program is basically a service-delivery system;
i.e., it is dedicated almost exclusively to the delivery of
contraceptive methods and services to those who desire them.
To extend services to all levels of the population, a vast in-
frastructure has been built up -- an infrastructure which is
presently underutilized. In spite of this, suggestions for
program improvement are almost exclusively focused on changing
the supply system, little attention being paid to the demand
structure.  A rapidly-expanding infrastructure and large numbers
of personnel of all levels has resulted in little increase in
the number of acceptors.
The structure of demand for the service is one of the most
important factors in the success or failure of service-delivery
system in the long run; and the family planning demand structure
among the general Indian population remains largely unexplored.
The Indian family planning program has made attempts to influence
the demand structure, through mass and group motivation, with some



ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 18
examples of success 1/. But these attempts have been ad hoc
rather than systematic, in nature, and the small demand pic-ure
still remains largely unexplored. The demand for family planniaig
among the general population may be one of the most vital --
and, presently, the most unexplored -- areas for famlil\ ?lanning
action research. A primary function of the PCs will be to study
the demand, and to recommend possible ways of inrreasing this
demand. This will control research into such topics as the motiva-
tions that determine the fam4tly size of high fertility couples;
the present and potential effect of social structure (laws,
customs, religious practices) on fertility; and, most import-
ant, to barriers to family planning acceptance of family
planning services.
(e)  Establish close working relationships with program administrators
and workers.  Accurate and valid data regarding prpgram performa.:,
and operations can only be gathered with the active cooperation of
those at the operational level; and their trust and cooperation can
only be gained and maintained by demonstrating that the data
gathered from them and about them is used constructivel-. Moreover,
the Population Center's recommendations can be implemented only
with the full cooperation of program administrators. The likeli-
hood that they will accept and wholeheartedly implement Population
Center recommendations will depend critically on the confidence
they have in the Population Center, and that confidence wili be
a direct reflection of the quality of the working relationship
which exists between the program administrators and the Population
Center. A solid working relationship will depend upon the ability
of the Population Center to demonstrate its utility as in adminis-
trative tool through the provision of constructive management in-
formation. Such a relationship can be enhanced through two specific
mechanisms.
(i) Administrative Training - since the Population Center
concept as envisaged in this Project is a departure from
previous attempts toward management information and evalu-
ation systems in India, it is of utmost importance that
program administrators who will use the Population Center
be thoroughly familiar with it. Such an understanding can
best be fostered by formal training. Since each Population
Center is to be affiliated with an institute whose primary
specialty is management training, the formulation and im-
plementation of such formal courses should present no
problem. The details of such courses should be worked out
by the appropriate Population Center personnel (e.g.,
Director and Assistant Director, Training, in consultation
11   The latest attempTt was at the Ernakulum Vasectomy Camp, where high incen-
tives (Rs 100, a sari and a tote bag to each acceptor) were used to at-
tract new acceptors over a one-month period -- 60 times the normal monthly
rate.



ANNEX 3
Page 5 of 18
with the affiliated institute) but such a course should
focus largely on three areas:
(a) the structure and functions of the Population Center;
(b) possible ways in which these new tools might be util-
ized by program administrators; and (c) how the concept of
a Population Center compares with attempts of other countries
(e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Singapore) to provide management in-
formation, and the contributions such attempts have made to
these programs. Funds have been allocated to provide for
such formal training courses at the affiliated institutes,
as well as to cover international travel costs for course
graduates to visit foreign programs.
(ii) Comuunications - Too often management information systems
tend to be viewed -- and view themselves -- as mere clerical
statistical operation; on the contrary, its charge is
to generate research ideas from which program and policy
implications will arise. And very effort should be made
by the Population Center to ensure that these Ideas receive
broad distribution, are widely publicized and clearly
understood. To that end, considerable effort mmt be
directed toward comunications.  Some suggested media of
communication are:
Monthly Newsletter. A monthly or bi-monthly newsletter which briefly
outlines the current status of on-going research studies, evaluation
efforts and demonstration/experimental projects is an inexpensive
and effective way of publicizing the Population Center and of build-
ing rapport between the Population Center And Family Planning opera-
tional staff.
Quarterly or Biannual Periodical. A more substantial publication
published on a quarterly or biannual basis is also a good way to
publicize the Population Center and to establish good relations
with operational personnel and program administrators.
Biannual Research Seminar/Conference. Perhaps the most effective
method of disseminating research and evaluation findings to policy-
makers is through research seminars. In addition to their educa-
tional value, such seminars also provide a base for cross-
fertilization of ideas among professional researchers (e.g., meth-
odological approaches). It is recommended that the Directors of the
two Population Centers collaborate on the scheduling and composition
of such seminars/conferences.
Research Journal. It is necessary that the formalized research and
evaluation efforts of the Population Centers not only be presented
in a teaching/training context, but also as reports submitted to
administrators and researchers, formally edited and compiled for



ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 18
ease of reference. It would be desirable if the Population Centers
established a journal of Family Planning research reports, perhaps
edited and published on a joint basis. One possibility is to pub-
lish the research papers presented in the biannual seminars in a
journal which appears twice yearly. Thus, pertinent research per-
formed outside the Population Center auspices could be included in
a formal manner.
(f) Training. The Population Centers will be responsible for at least
two distinct levels of training: inservice training, and training
of key personnel within the Project area.
(i) Inservice Training. There are two primary reasons
for inservice training: to keep personnel up to date
in their areas of expertise, and to provide a comon
background of training to a group comprised of indi-
viduals from different backgrounds. Both reasons
hold true for the Populatlon Centers, although the
latter will be the more iaportant In the Initial years
of operation.  The profeassonal staff of the 1tpulation
Center will consist of individuals who have received
their formal training and experienee in widely diver-
gent disciplines, and probably with little or Ao train-
ing or experience in family planning. Thus, it will be
.necessary to provide a common training background as a
framework within which to wotk.
(ii) Training of Program Personnel in Data Collection*
Analysis and Evaluation. To effectively implement a
revised MIES and to monitor new project inputs, data
that does not exist in the present system must be
collected and analyzed. The Population Centers will
depend in all their work on the accuracy of these data
and their flow. Consequently, they.should be respons-
ible for training of program persoewl who collect,
analyze and forward the requisite data to the Popula-
tion Centers.
Organization
3.       Each Population Center will be responsible to a Project Governing
Board (PGB) to be established in each State. The PGB will approve the
annual budget of the PC. It will also establish terms of employment and
set appropriate scales of pay and allowances. Since the Population Centers
will work in close collaboration with the State programs, parity in levels
of remuneration would be observed for jobs having identical descriptions.
Exceptions would be made in the case of the Director and his principal
technical associates, whose level of pay would reflect the levels of the
Indian scientific marketplace as well as the temporary nature of the assign-
ment.



ANNEX 3
Page 7 of 18
The Project Governing Board (PGB)
Each PGB will be responsible for the progress of the program in
the project areas. This includes construction, program imple-
mentation and evaluation. The PGB will meet at least quarterly
to:
(i) review the progress of the construction, pro-
gram implementation and evaluation activities;
(ii)  identify the main problems and take the necessary
remedial action;
(iii) to receive status reports on each aspect of the
project (e.g., Population Centers Director) prior
to each PGB session;                   *
(iv) make necessary policy decisions regarding the
desirability of experimenting with novel schemes
on the basis of the recommiendations of the various
units responsible for project execution; and
(v) follow-up the progress of the approved schemes.
The membership of the PGB would consist at least of the following: the
Chief Secretary, Secretary of Health, a representative of the Central
Department of Family Planning, the Director of Health Services, the
State Architect, the Chief Engineer, the Director of the Population
Center, the Project Coordinator, who will serve as its Secretary,
the State Project Family Planning Officer and the head of the State
Project Construction Unit.
Additional PGB members might be chosen from among the following:
Secretary of Finance, Representative of State Registrar General's
Office, Director of Program Analysis and Research Information (PARI),
Joint Director of Health Services, State Family Planning Officer.
*ther members may be co-opted as necessary.  The composition of the
PCs may differ in both States.



ANNEX 3
Page 8 of 18
There could also be representation from the academic and professional
research and training communities, especially from the fields of
public administration, economics and the behavioral sciences. The
terms of appointment to the Board should be for the duration of the
Project. Board membership would be non-remunerative. The powers of
the PGB as a governing body should be set forth by government order,
and should include the authority to enter into contracts for consulta-
tive services, to appoint the Directors of Construction, Program Imple-
mentation and Evaluation Units and to set levels of pay and allowances
as deemed appropriate. The affairs of each of these units would be
subject to annual government postaudit.
The Director of the Population Center
The Director should be, above all, a person experienced in re-
search, management and the methodology of evaluation. It is
important also that he has a keen awareness of problems faced
by program administrators, although technical competence should
take precedence over program experience if a choice must be made.
The Director would be empowered by the PGB to fill regularly
sanctioned positions on the PC staff with the approval of a selec-
tion committee. He would also have the delegated authority to
incur obligations against an approved budget; to make reallocations
within the budget, to an extent determined by the PGB, that would
be consistent with the need fot both fled*lbility ahd accountability,
and to meet contingency expenses out of a renewable fund equivalent
to one twelfth the annual appropriaUto foko non-capital expenditures.
The Director would present a quarterly t.Atus report at the PGB's
quarterly meeting, and a cod#rehensive report on an annual basis.
His reports would be forwarded also to responsible officials of
other related agencies such as the Director of the State Demographic
Evaluation Cell.
PC Staff
The staff of the PC should possess a high degree of technical
skill in some selected areas. All PC professional staff should
therefore have at least an M.A. degree in the various social
sciences, and the four principal technical assistants to the
PC Director should have more advanced training in the following
fields: Demography/Survey Research; Training; Management Economics/
Operations Research; and Anthropology/Social Psychology. The fol-
lowing table summarizes the proposal for the composition of the PC
staff:

B. THE SUPPORTINC INSTITUTES
Ceneral Considerations
A.        Since the PCs will be required to set up a sophisticated managerent-
information and evaluation system they will require assistance on a continuous
basis, in particular in the first three years, to help them achieve these ob-
jectives more efficiently and more rapidly. Aaple local capability exists for
this purpose and the GOl has agreed in principle to enlist the services of
two of India's foremost consulting and training institutions; the Indian
Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad, and the Administrative Staff College
of India (ASCI), Hyderabad. Both institutes have a highly trained and re-
spected faculty with particular expertise in the areas of management consulta-
tion, operations research and formal training in business and publlc adminis-
tration. Such a "management-oriented focus" is necessary for the effective
functioning of each PC. In addition technical inputs will be needed in various
fields - demography, the social sciences, statistical methods, economics, etc.
Both institutions have expertise in many of these areas but they do not have a
developed capability in the population field; funds are therefore provided to
enable both institutions to develop their capabilities in this field and thus
to be of use not only to the PCs and the State administrators of Mysore and
U.P., but also to develop the capability of other States in the evaluation of
family planning activities.
5.        The need for two rather than one institute to be associated with the
PCs is based on the diversity of approach that each PC must follow. India is
a diverse country, and the States of Uttar Pradesh and Mysore are quite dif-
ferent in manv ways: language, weather, culture and geography. One would
therefore expect -- if the PCs are to be truly sensitive and responsive to the
needs, conditions and situations that exist in their particular areas -- the
PCs to develop divergent approaches in order to reach their common objectives.
If one institute were to provide technical and support assistance to both PCs,
diversity might well be inhibited.  There might be a tendency -- to foster
similarity of approach. The provision of two support institutes allows for
maximum diversity of approach, for each support agency can devote its full
attention to the special problems extant in one PC and one State.
6.        The assoctation between each PC and its respective institute will
be in the nature of an affiliation - i.e. the association will be continuous
rather than ad hoc. This is important because a relationship that is spelled
out in detail, and made to be durable over a specified period of time, i. much
more likely to be satisfactory that an ad hoc consultative arrangement. The
reasons for this are many. Although it is certainly possible to provide assis-
tance of a purely technical nature on a short-term, 'one-shot' consultative
basis, it is virtually impossible to provide developmental support of an
institution-building nature on such a basis. The latter grows only out of a
close association with, professional commitment to, and personal involvement
in the development of other institutions. Such an association is only estab-
lished over a period of years, where a clear understanding of the internal



ANNEX 3
Page 14 of 18
needs and problems as they develop over time becomes possible. Support of
an institution-building nature is quite dissimilar to the provision of purely
technical assistance. Instead of the objectivity and emotional neutrality
that accompanies purely technical assistance, institution-building support
requires as well a subjective involvement in the objectives and ideals of
the client-organization. At the same time it is equally important to under-
line that the exact nature of the affiliation (the terms of reference of the
association between each PC and PC Director and the affil1ated institute).
Nothing would be more likely to inhibit the development of a healthy relation-
ship than to present the PC Directors with a fait accompli worked out on his
behalf by the State Government, the GOT or any other party. The PC-Institute
affiliation might therefore range from frequent, short-tenm consultin9g services
to housing the institute representatives within the PC as resident advisory
staff, depending on the needs of the Director of each PC and the affiliated
Institutes. It will be the responsibility of the PC Director, as the affi-
liated institute's client, to utilize his affiliated institute's resource to
the best advantage of the PC. If a close and effective working relationship
is developed between the PCs and their affiliated institutes, dynamic and
flexible enough to continually respond to the demands of changing conditions.
In addition to this close working relationship on the "institution-building"
aspects, these institutes might be involved with others in undertaking tech-
nical assignments such as a particular study or survey; such assignment would
be of a "one shot" nature responding to a specific need.
Functions
7.        The following are the main functions envisaged for the Affiliated
Institutions:
a.   Technical Assistance
i.   Assist the PC Director and staff as requested on the
technical problems related to the functions of the PC.
ii.   Provide senior staff members as expert consultants/
trainers for specific management information studies,
e.g., input-output studies, investigation of the
organizational effectiveness of specific parts of
the operational program structure.
ii.    Guarantee the highest techical standards in research
and training done by the PC, and provide assistance
in technical report preparation.
iv.   Provide information and advice regarding other in-
stitutions that might, on a contract basis, be able
to assist with technical problems as necessary.



ANNEX 3
Page 15 of 18
b.   On-Going Institution-Building Guidance and Support
i.   Advise on a day-today basis to allow the PC to develop
over time. The broader perspective of the already-
established and experienced affiliated institution
should allow them to foresee, identify and to take
necessary measures to meet the pressures to which the
PCs will be subjected to and so that its primary ob-
jectives do not suffer.
ii.   Evaluate and monltor the progress of the PC over
time (especially from the management-organizational
point Qf view), and provide the PC Director with
information regarding PC weaknesses and possible
remidies.
Mii.   Impart to the PC Director and staff through its day-
to-day advice the need for flexibility and dynamism
within the PC.
c.   Training
i.   Develop training materials for a two-tiered course
of formal training; one course for field-investigator-
level-trainees at the PC; and the other for program
administrators who will be asking the questions and
using the findings supplied by the PC. Such training
could include program administrators in States other
than those of the project areas, and thus lay the
groundworlk for the future possible extension of the
PC concept to other States.
ii.   Train the appropriate PC staff in the "case study"
method of investigating specific social situations,
and also its utility as a teaching/educational aid.
iii.   Train PC staff in data processing techniques.
iv.   If required, provide training in the methodoology of
training and in the preparation of training materials
to those PC staff who will be involvedl in training
program personnel.
Staff Requirements
8.        It is essential that the affiliated institutes have the capabi-
lities to see the system as a whole and to be willing and able to devote time.
energy and expertise to see the PCs through their initial', formative years



ANNEX 3
Page 16 of 18
of operation. Both ASCI and IIM require strengthening in the population
area; both institutes have agreed to undertake this effort and GOI has
agreed to offer them, through this project, enough and sustained support
to build a population unit in the institute.
9.      Each institute will hire two to three senior staff to comprise
the nucleus of the population unit. At least three research associates
willI be required to assist them, plus requisite support staff. In addi-
tion, since population is a multidisciplinary field, this unit will need
to draw upon the expertise and counsel of senior staff in other relaLed
areas, e.g., marketing, education/training management development, com-
puter systems, etc.
10.       Although the academic training and past experience of those who
will comprise the population unit will be in fields closely related to the
field of population, their training may have to be supplemented to respond
to the specific needs of this project. Such training can be accomplished
most efficiently in two ways. First, a 4 to 6 month travel study tour or
population programs and certain action-oriented Population Study Centers
outside India would provide a solid base on which these key staff could
build.  Such tours will focus uzpon the management-information and evaluation
systems of other countries (e.g.,-Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, etc.), and upon
study centers that are actively providing expert assistance and counsel of
an institution-building nature to one or more on-going population programs.
In addition, an invaluable form of inservice training will be provided to
the population units (and perhaps the PC Director and senior staff) through
the short-term appointments of international poulation experts to the position
of visiting faculty in the institutes. This would provide a mechanism through
which much-needed cross-fertilization between international programs and locai
experts might take place. Finally, access to information dealing with the
latest developments in the field of population is necessary. A library of a
size adequate to supplement faculty and staff knowledge in the field and to
expand their grasp and perspective of the popu-lation problem is essential.
Funds sufficient to cover what is judged to be ahe minimum need in this area
have been provided in the project.
Phasing of Training
11.       Two levels of personnel in the PC and affiliated institute will
require a fundamental training in population dynamics. The first consists
of the PC Director, his principal technical assistants (Assistant Directors),
and the senior faculty who comprise the population units of ASCI and IIM.
The second level consists of the PC field staff (field supervisors and field
investigators), and the research assistants located in the population units
at the affiliated institutes.
12.       The training requirements deemed essential to an effective per-
formance by the senior-level staff both at the PCs and the affiliated in-
stitutes are basically the same. Training of a theoretical nature is highly
desirable, but training of a practical/experimental level is essential. It
is felt that a 4-6 travel study tour might provide a satisfactory course of
training. For example, the senior-level staff might begin their tour with
2-3 months in the U.S., visiting - and, hopefully, being able to participate



ANNEX 3
Page 17 of 18
in a short course of special training -- one or more Population Study Courses
(e.g., Michigan, North Carolina, Johns-Hopkins). Then, the remaining 2-3
months might be spent touring the population programs of other countries, giv-
ing special emphasis to the different MIES set-ups and their differential im-
portance in and contributions to the programs; Korea provides the ideal country
for an extensive tour, and Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thai-
land for briefer tours.
13.       Whatever the final program of training, all the senior level staff
should undergo training at the same time and in one group.  Not only is a
single group easier to handle in terms of internal and external logistics,
but there are also numerous advantages which should accrue from such an
arrangement. Travelling together and studying together for a 4-6 month
period presents the ideal foundation upon which a close working relation-
ship can be built. Not only is a common background in training provided,
but also the shared experiences of a more informal nature.
14.       Only after this course of training has been completed should the
field staff be required and trained. (They might be recruited while the
senior staff are going through this training program, but they should be
trained after the senior staff are trained.) The training of field staff
should consist largely of on-the-job training, and should proceed for a
minimum period of six months. During this period there would be a maximum
of supervision as training in the basics of social science research is
carried out. To be covered are: basic principles of population dynamics
and family planning; interviewing; preparation of questionnaires; case
studies of situations; "casual" interviewing; editing, precoding and coding;
tabulation; statistical methods review; etc. Or, training can be intensively
pursued relative to a single project (e.g.,-preparting a major baseline sur-
vey), and the other facets of research methodology could be pursued later as
in-service training courses. The training of both senior and field level
personnel should be a continuing process.

DETAIL OF PRJECT FACILITIES
A. Background
1, *The areas selected for the project are five districts in Mysore
State including Bangalore City and six districts in Uttar Pradesh including
Lucknow City, with a combined population of 19.3 million according to the
1971 census. The project has the following objectives:
(a) Provide the health infrastructure, training facilities
and equipment to enable the implementation of the family
planning program according to the pattern set by the
Government of India in all project areas with additional
inputs in some areas to test alternatives to this pattern --
in particular, by linking the provision of family plauning
services to a supplementary nutrition program, by in-
creasing the staff and intensifying their training, and
by operating motivation and service tea _, etc.;
(b) Create, develop and operate management information and
evaluation system (KIES) in the form of two population
centers to evaluate performance on a continuous basis and
recommend changes in the project area;
(c) Ensure that the recommendations which emerge are speedily
implemented; and
(d) Provide the necessary technical assistance and incremental
operating costs to implement the experimental aspects of
the above components.
2.        The broad experimental design of the project, which will be further
elaborated and refined by the Population Centers, is to provide family plan-
ning services in:
(a) An urban program which will concentrate on hospital post:-
partum and field motivation, with provision of outpatieut
family planning counselling and service in Lucknow City
{Uttar Pradesh) and Bangalore City (Mysore).
(b) An Optimal Government of India Program to implement the
pattern officially established in six districts of Uttar
Pradesh (Lucknow, Muzaffarnagar, Pratapgarh, Rae Bareli,
Saharanpur, and Sultanpur) and five districts in Mysore
(Bangalore, Chitradurga, Kolar, Shimoga, and Tumkur).



ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 10
(c)  An intensive rural program which will have all the inputs
of the government pattern, plus additional resources and
components to be tested against the remaining districts.
This program will be conducted in two districts of Mysore
Kolar and Chitradurga, and in two districts of Uttar
Pradesh -- Rae Bareli and Saharanpur.
3.        In Uttar Pradesh, due to the scarcity of health manpower, it will
not be feasible to achieve the level of intensity envisaged in the project
(1 ANM per 5,000 population instead of the official standard of 1 ANM per
10,000 population).  However, the two districts indicated in Uttar Pradesh
will be intensive for purposes of other inputs.
4.        To control for differences in the levels of socio-economic deveiopuielv
the second and third schemes will be implemented in at least one district
with relatively advanced socio-economic conditions and in one with relatively
backward conditions. Socio-economic differences within each district would
also be present, thus allowing for analysis of the demand for family planning
services within as well as between districts. The following is the suggested
location of each scheme:

ANNEX 5
THE NUTRITION COKPONENT
I. SUMMARY
This Annex appraises the nutrition component of the population
project. The nutrition project will cover one intensive district in Mysore
(Chitradurga) with a population of about 1.4 million and one block in Rai
Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, covering a population of about 100,000 persons.
The total cost of this component is U.S.$ 2.1 million (Rs 15.1 million); of
this U.S. $1.9 million (Rs 13.8 million) is for Mysore and U.S.$0.20 million
(Rs 1.3 million) is for Uttar Pradesh.
ii.       The project has two objectives; (a) to determine the effect that
the provision of nutrition will have on the acceptance of family planning
services, both directly as an incentive and indirectly as a result of the
effect that a decline in mortality can have on the desire for fewer children;
and (b) to test the means of implementing nutrition programs.
The Myso te    e
iii.      This program will provide supplomentary feeding for women during
the last three months of pregnancy and the first six months of lactation
and to infants aged 6-24 months. The food to be distributed will be a pro-
cessed (but not pre-cooked) food of the Bal-Ahar type consisting of a cereal
and a pulse witb a protein content of about 20%; 100-110 grams, equivalent
to about 400 calories would be provided to mothers every day and 50-55 grams
to children. Vitamin A and iron would be added and possibly folic acid.
Processing of food would be done by existing Indian plants.
iv.       Distribution.  Women would come to the sub-centers to collect their
weekly supply of food. Additional ANMs (one for every five-subcenters) would
be needed. In addition, volunteers would be selected at the village level to
visit homes to follow-up women and children in their homes and collect addi-
tional data for evaluation. They would serve as a link between the sub-center
and the home and would overcome the main difficulty of present nutrition pro-
grams, namely that they do not provide sufficient knowledge of what is happen-
ing in the home. The evaluation activities by the volunteers will include
principally taking the age and height of c6hildren to determine whether the
supplements are effective in improving nutrition.
v.        Phasing.  In the first two years, the project will be tested in two
blocks of Mysore with one block including volunteers, and the other block
being limited to food distribution. While volunteers are desirable in prin-
ciple, there is some uncertainty of their effectiveness in practice. It is
also necessary to test the production, distribution and acceptability of dif-
ferent foods, and the administrative arrangements envisaged in the program on
a pilot basis. In the third year, a decision will be made taking into account
the findings of a joint GOI, SIDA and IDA mission as to the most appropriate
way of expanding this to a district-wide basis. At the end of the third year,
about two thirds of the district would be covered, and during the last two years
the whole district would be covered.



- ii -
vi.       Implementation and Evaluation.  A Project Officer (Nutrition)
with supporting staff will be appoin,ted in the Ministry of Health to
implement this project. Internal evaluation would be done by a Nutrition
Division to be set up in the Population Center with technical assist t-ce
to be provided by the Hyderabad Institute of Nutrition. This Institute
as well as other suitable institutes could be involved in other aspects
of planning and evaluating the nutrition component.
vii.      The appointment of the Project Direqtor (Nutrition) is a con-
dition of effectiveness.  A joint review willb Ie.undertaken-by a GOI-SIDA-
IDA mission and the expansion of the nutritio4 _pDent ta a district-wide
basis will then be determined,in consultatioi vith the Aaspciation.

viii.     In Uttar Pradesh, a program similar to that in Mysore will be
tried in one block. In view of the far more severe administrative,,and
personnel constraints in U.P., there is,some,question ,as tQowhether, a
nutrition program can be effectively carried out withQut affecting ad-
versely the provision of family planning services. The prqgresa,of the
population and nutrition programs will be reyiewed by a joint GOI-SIDA-IDA
mission in the third year; and on this basis a decision will, -be made in
consultation with the Association, on the desirability, method and extent
of expanding the nutrition component.

THE NUTRITION CCKPONENT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        This annex appraises the nutrition component of the population
project. The nutrition project will cover one intensive district in
Mysore (Chitradurga) with a population of about 1.4 million and one Block
in Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, covering a population of about 100,000
persons.
2.        The project has two objectives:  (a) to determine the effect that
the provision of nutrition will have on the acceptance of family planning
services, both directly as an incentive and indirectly as a result of the
effect that a decline in mortality can haVe on the desire for children;
and (b) test the means of implementing nutrition programs.
3.        Very little attention has been given to the effects of improved
nutrition on human fertility, and no significant attempts have been made to
assess the value of combining nutrition and family programs. Such a com-
bination might help to promote fertility control in the following ways:
a.   The provision of nutrition supplements through health and family
planning centers could increase the exposure of women to family
planning information and education and thus increase the number
of family planning acceptors. It might also improve the image
and prestige of the family planning program.
b.   Improving the nutrition of mothers and children, by decreasing
infant and childhood mortality and morbidity, could reduce the
desire for a large number of children in order to assure the
survival of a few.
4.        There is, of course, the possibility that improving the nutritiorn
of mothers and children may promote population growth by:
a.   increasing the number of surviving children by reducing suscep-
tibility to infection, the commonest cause of death among young
children in developing countries after the first 6 months of
life. However, even a 30% reduction of mortality at ages 0-4
would have little effect on the reproductive capacity of the
population for about two decades, during which time family
planning programs could be developed to counteract the effect
of the larger number entering their reproductive years;
b.   increasing fecundity by lengthening the average period over
which a woman is capable of child-bearing, and in general
improving reproductive functions; and
c.   decreasing fetal wastage caused by spontaneous abortion and
stillbirths and reducing prenatal mortality by lessening the
number of premature and low-birth-weight babies.



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 21
5.        In view of the high fertility rates prevailing in many areas of
poor nutrition, it is doubtful whether improved nutrition would greatly
increase present fertility rates. Any effect in this direction might be
offset by the effects of better nutrition in increasing nursing capacity
and duration of lactation, and thus prolonging the interval between births.
6.        There would also be many administrative and logistic advantages
in integrating family planning and nutrition programs. Mothers, especially
during the prenatal and postpartum periods, are the prime target of both
programs. In the case of family planning, this is evidenced by the demon-
strated success of "postpartum" family planning programs. Information and
education programs with similar appeals and content are needed by both,
both utilize the same or similar types of personnel, both focus primarily
on the health of the child and the family, and similar organizations can
be used for the distribution of supplies and services.
7.        The nutrition component of the project is intended to test some
of these hypotheses in a realistic and potentially replicabic context.
This requires a program carried out within the constraints of a realistic
administrative and cost structure, and on a sufficient scale to test
both the adequacy of the system and provide sufficient numbers for
detailed statistical analysis. In India, a project covering a "disti *:L
(1-2 million population) .woulw4 umet these otitoeria, because a district con-
stitutes a distinct administrative unit, and because a much smaller unit
would not be economical from the point of Y4pw_of the procuremwnt, proces-
sing, and distribution of a fead a       8pp4I t*t.  ?fProjects on this scale should,
however, be preceded by pilot studie, at therK block's level.
II. THE MYSORE PROJECT
A. Description of PrQject Area
8.        Chitradurga, one of the 19 districts in the State of Mysore, has
been selected as meeting the criteria for an experimental nutrition program.
It contains 1.4 million of the 29.3 million inhabitants in Mysore State.
About 35% of the population is employed, m6stly in agriculture.  lhe popu-
lation density is 129 per km2, about the same as that of Mysore State gene-
rally. The growth in population is among the highest in the State, with
a 27.7% increase between 1961 and 1971.
9.        The district headquarters is in Chitradurga (50,275 population),
but the largest town is Davanagerie in the western district (population -
121,018).  There are 10 more tpmm's with a pq1tion of over 5,000 in the
district, and the total urban #opulation Ji8i.Out 280,000 inhabitants.
The total area is about 11,000 k,2, sbout LOO km long and 100 km wide.
10.       Per capita income in Chitradurga for 1968-1969 is estimated at
Rs 500 per annum (about the average for Mysore State). The per capita
yearly expenditure for Mysore State can be estimated at Rs 360 in the
rural areas and about Rs 500 in urban areas. Almost 80% of the expendi-
ture in rural areas and 60% in urban areas is for food. The income dis-
tribution is very skewed.  About 70% of the rural and 557 of the urban

16.       In India, as in other developing countries, children become
increasingly subject to malnutrition in the latter half of the first year
of life and during the second year, when lactation becomes increasingly
inadequate and supplementary foods are insufficient in both calories and
protein. Although some severe malnutrition is also seen in the tlhird and
fourth years of life, the risk is then dinihabing, and the greatly in-
creased cost of extending the program to these age groups would yield a
smaller benefit.
17.       The effectiveness of the program will depend not only on the
supplementary feeding of the target groups, but also on the adequacy of
the immunization program and heal-th care for them. It will also be im-
portant to follow the children after the supplement is discontinued at
24 months, and to treat any serious malnutrition or other disease that
may occur. The final choice of target groups for supplementary feeding
would be:
a.   Mothers in the last trimester of pregnancy and the first six
months of lactation; and
b.   Children from six months to 24 months of age.
C.  Program for ehe Trget _6111triet
Feeding
18.       The supplement should be sufficient to make-up in most instances
for the deficiencies of protein, calories and other essential n-:trients,
if it is consumed as intended. The daily consumption of such a supplemen
at feeding stations associated with health centers would have the advantab
of ensuring that the food reached the target group but the distances mothers
and children would have to walk would probably reduce attetidalnc" to an in-
effectual level.
19.       To allow the mother to take away a week's supply of the food sup-
plement for daily preparation and consumption at home will certainly greatly
increase participation in the program, but will have the disadvantage that
some of the food will almost inevitably be shared with other family members
and the effect on the target individuals correspondingly reduced. To
require the mother to come back to the distribution center for a supply
of the food supplement once a week instead of once every two weeks ot
monthly ensures more frequent contact of htelth center personnel with the
mother and provides a better control over th  supply.
Use of Volunteers
20.       The effectiveness of the program will depend on the regular con-
sumption of the supplement by the target groups and on prompt intervention
when any young child becomes significantly malnourished through the with-
drawal of food as commonly happens during prolonged episodes of diarrhea
or other infectious disease. Evaluation of the program will be enhanced
by more accurate ongoing data gathered on morbidity and mortality, and by
closer following of weight trends than would be possible through periodic
visits to the health center. In addition, frequent contact with the



ANNEX 5
Page 5 of 21
mother in her home provides an opportunity for imparting nutrition inform-
ation and advice, and for increasing the awareness of the mother of the
availability of help in family planning.
21.       The cost of frequent house-to-house visiting of all mothers by
regular fully salaried employees is generally prohibitive. The problem
has been solved elsewhere on a small scale by the use of volunteers, and
it is recommended that the present project determine the feasibility of
using them on a larger scale in rural India as adjuncts to the regular
health and family planning staff. They could play a dual role in pro-
moting better nutrition and family planning and providing regular inform-
ation on key aspects of the project. Specifically, their functions would
be to:
a.   Maintain surveillance of the nutrition of pre-school children
by periodic home visits during which the weight of the child
would be recorded for the information of the health team, and
also entered on a weight chart kept in the home.
b.   Record the disease experience of each child in the target
group in the interval since the last visit.
C.   Report any births, deaths, or new pregnancies as a check of
other records.
d.   Use the weight chart in the home to encourage the mother to
feed her child properly, and to identify cases of developing
malnutrition, which should be brought to the attention of the
regular health personnel for remedial action.
22.       The volunteers would be women recruited through the Village
Councils (Pachajats) or Women's Clubs (k4ahela Mandelas), given one to
two weeks training, and paid a small monthly honorarium. They should
also be given a distinguishing badge, arm band or article of clothing.
For most villages, one woman will be sufficient. In the smaller villages
only a few hours per day will be required, but some of the larger villages
will require more than one volunteer. Ideally, they should be able to
visit each family once every two weeks, but the practicality of this
schedule will have to be pre-tested, as will the maximum number of families
per volunteer and the average time required per visit. This will vary
somewhat with the degree of concentration or dispersion of the village
population.
23.       The recruitment, training and utilization of these volunteer
workers will require considerable time and effort, and it is unlikely
that it will be possible to cover all families. Nevertheless, the number
of mothers and children that can be reached will be greatly increased if
these volunteers are successfully utilized.  Therefore, the experimental
program to test their value would appear to be decidedly worthwhile.
24.       The person-to-person approach of regular health workers and
volunteers will be supplemented by a community education program intended
to bring about an environment of understanding in which the advice of the



ANNEX 5
Page 6 of 21
health eiucators has a better chance of being acted upon.  The techniqtues
will include the use of films, puppet shows, radio, and the like. The
program should bring about the appreciation of the food suppleaent and a
desire on the part of parents to purchase addi.tional quantities for their
young children beyond 24 months of age.
25.       To provide information on the effectiveness of the LJnv. tional
nutritional measures alone, it is proposed that a second block be starteo
6 months after the initial pilot block, but that for 12 months it receives
the food supplement only, without either the home visits by volunteers or
the awareness campaign at the community level. There should he a trial of
the use of volunteers alone without any regular food distributiont in one
of the blocks in Kolar, the other- iptensive district.  In t'hiis case, their
primary function will be to reduce deaths by the early dete tion and cor-
rection of serious malnutrition in young infants and to rep' t comparaqive
data for the ongoing evaluation. Their effect upon cooperatLio with thle
family planning program in the abserico. of food distribution cant aL-o be
determined.
D. The Food Supplement
Nutritional Value
26.       On the basis of extensive international discussions and cDnsulta-
tions, the composition of weaning food for young children is well standardized.
Essentially, the same nutritional specifications are used for 'lncaparina in
Latin America; Bal-Ahar in India; Faffa in Ethiopia; and CSM and WSB supplied
as donated foods by the U.S. These have been endorsed by the Protein Adviso-..
Group of the U.N. System and the World Health Organization.  Theq.  -g.kificz
tions can be readily met by a wide variety of combinations of care-ls, oil-
seed meals, and legumes, appropriately fortified with vitamins and minerals.
Folic acid is included in CSM and WSB and is an optional ingredient for
Bal-Ahar. In vi.ew of the evidence from the National Institute of Nutrition.
Hyderabad, on the occurrence of folic acid deficiency anemia, it would be
wise to include folic acid in the formulas adopted for the project. The
specifications are given in detail in Table 3. -
27.       While a supplement for pregnant women need not contain as high a
concentration of protein, the cost of handling two different formulas would
outweigh the benefits, and it is, therefore, proposed that the same supple-
ment be used for both mothers and young children.
Nomenclature
28.       "Bal-Ahar" is a generic name used by the Government of India for
a low-cost, protein-rich vegetable mixture suitable for the supplementary
feeding of infants and young children. It means, literally, "iNutritious
Child's Food" in most of the Indian languages. As long as'it meets the
specifications of Table 3, its ingredient sources and composition may
vary with local tastes and availability of ingredients. The government-
owned Food Corporation of India produced about 33,000 tons of Bal-Ahar
in 1970-71 and plans to produce 55,000 tons in 1971-72.  When properly
produced and packaged, Bal-Ahar proved highly successful throughout India.
Tn Mysore State, taste-tests conducted by CARE show the current Bal-Ahar
preparation is preferred to CSM.



ANNEX 5
Page 7 of 21
29.       Formulas of the Bal-Ahar type have a bland flavor that mixes
well with other foods, or can be readily flavored by the consumer to her
own taste. This provides the mother with an opportunity for variety in
the flavor and use of the formula. Flavorings used in the home include
vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, or curry, and sugar (or jaggery) is often
added. The addition of sugar and flavors before distribution not only
would raise the cost unnecessarily, but would also restrict the variety
of uses for the product. It is recommended, therefore, that flavoring
the product be left to the mother as a part of home preparation.
Available Raw Materials
30.       The prbduction formula and the location of the production
facilities will depend partly on the availability of raw materials.
There is ample production of the principal ingredients for a Bal-Ahar-
type product both in Mysore State and in the Chitradurga district. In
Chitradurga, there is also the Davangerie plant which produces soy flour.
The Central Food Technological Research Institute will provide technical
advice on appropriate Bal-Ahar formulas and the processing and packaging
of the product.
Organization and Location of Production
31.       As it will be possible for the project to contract for the pro-
duction of the supplementary food with the Food Corporation of India,
which in its turn will sub-contract production to either private or govern-
ment companies, no specific production plant is envisaged for the project.
Several grain mills in Mysore State are currently producing Bal-Ahar, or
can be easily converted to produce and package it. Most probably, one of
the mills in Bangalore will be selected by the Food Corporation of India.
This would mean an average distance of 130 miles from the production to
the distribution area.
Distribution
32.       The distribution of the product from producer to recipient wil
take place in several stages. It is suggested that the product be dist-ri-
buted by truck from the mills to go-downs to be erected in the 13 primary
health centers. These go-downs will each have a capacity for about 2
months' storage and could be built at a cost of Rs 30,000 each (about
30 tons capacity). A typical central store will supply about 20 subcent s
within a radius of about 15 kilometers. Each subcenter would meet the --eds
of the population within a radius of about 3.5 kilometers.
33.       For the distribution of food and recording of attendance data,
reliance will be primarily placed on ANKs in subcenters.  If these ANMs are
not to be overburdened with food distribution, follow-up, record-keeping,
and data collection, however, they will need some extra assistance for
the nutrition program. Mysore plans to give each ANM an assistant who
can and should help with the nutrition program, but these assistants will
have other functions to perform. Additional workers, preferably ANMs with
some special training, should be assigned to the nutrition program in the
ratio of one for each five subcenters. This would permit each ANM to visit
each center on one day of the week to help with the food distribution,
information, and education, etc. This role might be assigned to the



ANNEX 5
Page 8 of 21
fari lly planning health assiatant8, who are employed in Mysore at the ratio
of aboujt one ptr five subcenters, and who are not currently contributing
eifectively to the family planning program.
Potential Volume of Product
34.       The supplementation for women will be 100 grams per day mnd for
chitdren 50 grams per day. In reality, there might be small deviation,
from these recommended intakes as, obviously, children might take less of
the product in the beginning of the programq and more at the end.  rhere
wotld also be adjustments in the quantities allowed as the program goes
along.  Tables 2 and 3 indicate what the total potential of the p o6rraq
would be if all eligible participants were included. Thiey show the volume
when the program is in a steady state, for obviously, in the beginning
there may be a certain reluctance to join the program, and all eligible
women and children cannot be included.l/
35.       The total number of women becoming pregnant in a year and a'
delivering is estimated at 4% of the population, or 56,000 (Mysore Stu 2
proposal).  Each of these women participates three months in the prc
The lactating women will participate six months, and the total nualber
women who will be participating during one year will, because of overlap-
ping, be 84,000. The total food supply to be distributed to this potent- 
target group is 1,512 tons per year. There will be 48,000 children in a
year between 6 and 12 months of age who will participate, and an equal
number of children between 12 and 24 months of age.2/ The total volume
of food to be distributed to these children will be 1,296 tons. The total
yearly potential demand for the product is, therefore, 2,808 tons. Tables
6 and 7 incorporate estimates of the growth over the 5-year project perLod
of target population participation and of the demand for supplementary
nutrition.
36.       As there will be ultimately 280 subcenters in the district, there
will be about 240 participating pregnant women and 170 childr,n per cent er,
so the yearly potential volume to be distributed per center will be about
1 tons, or roughly 190 kilos per week.
E. Organization of the p,roiect
Implementation
37.       The nutrition program should have its own Project Director and
its own central staff consisting of an Assistant Director and administrative
personnel. The Project Director (Nutrition) would be in the State Ministry
of Health with a rank equivalent to or slightly below the State Nutrition
Officer. His group should be responsible for overall planning and evalua-
tion of the program. The Project Director need not necessarily be a phy-
sician; he or his Assistant Project Director should have a wide adminis-
trative experience with training in economics, sociology or business
administration. There should also be an administrative officer in charge
of day-to-day administrative work.
1/ It is suggested here that during the first year, the children above 18
months of age should not be included in the program; however, no account
of this has been taken in the calculations.
2/ Mortality up to 6 months estimated at 15%. No account has been taken of
mortality rate after 6 months.



ANNEX 5
Page 9 of 21
38.       Actual food distribution would be done through the primary
health center which has to be supplemented with a store keeper, and
through the subcenters, which should be supplemented by additional ANMs
(or by family plamling health assistants, as suggested in para 33) one
for each five subcenters. The field work will be augmented by an informa-
tion and education team consisting of a communication expert, two motiva-
tors, and an audiovisual technician, together with drivers, bearers, etc.
There will be an extra budget of Rs 200,000 for production of special
material for the intensive promotion campaigns during the 5-year period.
39.       The project calls for the number of volunteers for home visits to
increase to 1,000 in the fifth year. Probably there will be even more in-
dividuals in the program, as there will be some turnover of volunteers.
The minimum time for service of a volunteer should, however, be at least
one year. For the administration of the recruitment, training and control
of the volunteers, a lady health visitor is required. She will be respon-
sible to the Assistant Project Director. To assist her, she would have
the additional 56 ANMs who each would be in charge of some 20 volunteers.
The project organization can be seen from an organization chart at the end
of this annex.
40.       The Hyderabad Institute of Nutrition will lend it8  technical
assistance in the planning and evaluation of the nutrition component in
Mysore. The services of other institutes may also be enlisted to supple-
ment this work, as necessary.
41.       The ANMs and some of the other workers will need not only
instruction on food distribution and record-keeping, but also elementary
training in nutrition, to enable them both to recognize nutritional needs
and deficiencies and to provide nutrition education in addition to family
planning to mothers. A considerable share of this indoctrination could
be given by training on the job, but some special short courses (e.g.,
two weeks long) will probably be needed also. It may be possible to con-
duct these in the ANM schools at a time when the regular school is not in
progress. The eventual goal should be to include this special instruction
in the regular ANM curriculum.
Resource Requirements
42.       The requirements for resources each year for the whole 5-year
period can be seen from Table 10. Resources will be built up progressive-
ly as the number of participants increases. For some of the functions,
such as the project direction, the survey team, and the information and
education team, the project will operate with full capacity almost from
the beginning.



ANNEX 5
Page 10 of 21
Total Costs
43.       The total costs of the project can also be seen from  3able 10.
Thev amount to Rs 13.8 million for the whole 5-year period.
F. Phasing and Evaluation
44.       Internal evaluation, based on data regularly forthcoming from
the program will be the responsibility of a Nutrition Division with three
to five professionals to be set up in the Population Center. The PC may
also undertake some external evaluation, for example studies regarding the
effect of the nutrition program on family planning. It may also call upon
the services of outside consultants as necessary to undertake these and
other studies. The Hyderabad Institute of Nutrition will be involved in
providing the necessary technical assistance to develop the Nutrition
Division in the PC, in undertaking preliminary baseline surveys ai  other
surveys at the request of the PC.
45.       It is estimated that 12 months will be required for the preli-
minary activities leading up to the initiation of the pilot study. These
will include completion of detailed plans; testing of various procedulres
in the field; development of a manual of standard definitions and operating
procedures; recruitment and training of personnel; securing cooperation of
the villagers; construction of storage facilities; arrangements fo-- pro-
duction and distribution of the food supplement; preparation of educational
material; planning for the nutrition education of the community; p-oniotion
of the food supplement; and the initial comprehensive nutrition survey.
46.       A pilot study providing a thorough test of all of the aspects of
the nutrition program to be ixnplemented on a district level should be con-
ducted in one block from 12 to 24 months. After 18 months, it should be
possible to add a second block, which will recei7e supplementary feedinB
only for 12 months, followed by introduction of the full-scale program.
A block utilizing only home visits by volunteers in the othet intensive
district should also be initiated at this time. From 24 to 28 months
should be a period of intensive evaluation of the pilot experience; any
necessary modifications should be made at this time in the program for
the definitive phase.  This should be done in consultation with a GOI-ZI)DA-luA
team which should visit India at this stage; the same team would also
review the Uttar Pradesh project so that the experience can be mutually
reinforcing.
47.       From 28 to 30 months should be a period of intensive prepara-
tions for expansion of the nutrition program to the entire district.
This will include the recruitment and training of additional personnel,
the construction of additional storage facilities, the arrangement of
logistics on a district level, baseline survey data on an appropriately
selected sub-sample of the entire district, and other necessary activities.
48.       From 30 months on, the study should be implemented as rapidly as
possible throughout the entire district. There should be ongoing evalua-
tion activities throughout, but from 48 months onward a great deal of
evaluation of the definitive project at the district level should take



ANNEX 5
Page 11 of 21
49.       A comprehensive   survey should again be conducted by the State
Nutrition Office and the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, at
the end of the 2-1/2 years of the definitive phase, on a district level
(5 years after the start of the project).
III.  THE UTTAR PADESH PROJECT
50.       In Uttar Pradesh, a program similar to that in Mysore will be
tried in one block. In view of the more severe adminiistrative and person-
nel constraints in U.P., there is soae question as to vlsether a nutrition
program can be effectively carried out without adversely affecting the pro-
vision of family planning services. The progres8 of the population and
nutrition programs will be reviewed by a.joint GOI-SIDA-IDA mission in the
third year; and on this basis a decision will be made in consultation with
the Association, on the desirability,.method and extent of expanding the
nutrition component.
A. Evaluation
51.       This will be a critical part of the program.  Internal evaluation
will be provided by the collection of regular data on periodic weights,
obtained in the home, and mortality data compiled from periodic visits.
External evaluation will be done by the All-India Institute of Medical.
Services (AIIMS) team through community nutrition surveys at the start and
annually. The AII1S will also be responsible for the analysis of the data
from the on-going program.
B. Phasing
52.       As in the Mysore project, it is estimated that 12 months will bt
required for the preliminary activities leading up to the pilot study in a
single block. These will include completion of detailed plans, testing
of various procedures in the field, developing of a manual of standard de-
finitions and operating procedures, recruitment and training of personnel,
securing cooperation of the villages, agreement on the education program
and materials, and an initial comprehensive nutrition survey. Implementa-
tion should 1-hen begin in an entire block as rapidly as possible so that the
evaluation of one year's experience, including a repeat comprehensive nutri-
tion survey at the end of the second year, will be prepared in time for a
th'irough "mid-project" review.



ANNEX 5
Page 12 of 21
C. Organization of the Project
53.        The project should be administered by a Project Director who will
be responsible for planning, organization, coordination and contro& of the
activities. He should have a small office staff at his disposal. In addiLion
the medical field team should perform baseline studies and also undertake variol-
nutrition surveys and evaluation activities in the project area. The team
should utilize the technical guidance of the AIDMS and may include personnel
secured by this institution. For the periodic comprehensive nutrition sur-
veys outside assistance should also be sought from the AIIMS. A lump sum
of Rs 120,000 has been provided for such assistance. An organization chart
is attached to this annex.
D. Cost of the Project
54.       The cost of the Project in Uttar Pradesh will be Rs 1,411,640 wVitl
the following allocation between the 5-years of operation:
Year                        Amount (Rs)
Year 1                         242,500
Year 2                         229,500
Year 3                         282,500
Year 4                         247,200
Year 5                         308.300
TOTAL                        1,310,000

1, The product must contain no pathogens by standard methods, must be free of
rodent hairs and excreta.
Because peanuts can become contaminated with a toxin produced by a cop,on mold,
inspection of the peanuts during processing, strict adherence to the&*HO /FAO-
PAG standards of 50 parts of aflatoxin per billion parts of final product and
close quality control with the help of the Central Food Technological Research
Institute is necessary. The product may be made from any of the following pro-
tein concentrates providing they meet present or future WHO/FAO/UNICEF Protein
Advisory Group Specifications. (Acceptance df these specifications includes
the use of approved solvents extracted materials produced within and outside
India.)
Soya, cottonseed, peanut, sesame,ileguie floua*s, non-tat dried milk, fish
protein concentrates.
Permissible cereal grains: suitably, processed coru, wheat, millet, sorghum,
jowar,ragi, oats or rice meeting food, standard4s
Permissible vitamin an4 mineral sourcts: Vitasn, any suitable, stable bio-
logically available sources, synthetic or natGrg. Calcium - food grade
calcium phosphate. Iron - iron orthophosphate, sodium ironpyrophosphate or
iron pyrophosphate.
Acceptability - production of any specific formula should not 6W authorised
unless found acceptable in India by the Contral Food Technological Research
Institute.
2/  The Central Food Technological Research Institute research has shown this level
also to be helpful in reducing insect infestation when tri-calcium phosphate is
used (References: Nature 20; 135960,. 1964; J. of Invert. Path. 7; 384-87.

Mobile Teams
A. Ilotivation and Service Teams
Approach and Objectives
1.        Provision is made in the project for support of two mobile teams
in each of the four intensive districts of Uttar Pradesh and Mysore. In
each intensive district, one team will be for motivation education and one
for rendering family planning advice, services and medicdl care related to
contraception. Mobile team operations will be the responsibility of the
District Family Planning Bureau (DFPB) which will-.function under the super-
vision of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The orgatization and pat-
terns of operation of the mobile teams will be developed by the Population
Center in each State in close consultation with the DFPB and the PIU. This
approach will be tried in the intensive districts on the following grounds:
(a)  the shortage of lady doctors in rural areas makes it un-
feasible to have permanent personnel available for IVD
insertions and examinations in remote villages;
(b) the creation of a group phychology that leads individuals
to adopt family planning more easily if they know that
their neighbors are also accepting these services; this
has been borne out by the success of the camp technique
in India; and
(c) the mobile team approach allows for considerably more ef-
ficient utilization of costly udical an4 audiovisual
equipment.
2.        The mobile teams would provide thw £adily planning services in
the villages along the following lines:  Mot P  ion-education teams would
precede the medical service teams in visit t) vllagas tnd would use group
and interpersonal communication to promote the adoption of family planning
among eligible couples.  At each stop, the mobile team would cover 8-10
villages. Medical service teams would arrive in the villages immediately
thereafter to give advice on contraceptive methods, distribute contracep-
tives, insert IUDs and perform vasectomy operations. Women wanting to have
a tubectomy operation would be referred to the nearest sterilization unit in
the district (details on project sterilization units and location awe pre-
sented in Annex 4). Service teams would remain one week in each village and
a small group would stay for another week to follow up sterilization and IUD
cases.

4.       A third small team (3-4 staff) to be in charge of field training
of PHC and hospital staff for family planning work will also be financed
through the project as an innovative approach to personnel motivation and
training for family planning; this part of the program will be conducted by
the Regional Family Planning Training Centers (RFPTC) of Bangalore and Lucknow
for all project districts giving priority to training personnel in the inten-
sive districts. The definitive approach will have to be worked out by the
RFPTC jointly with the Population Center in each State. In general lines,
the function of this team would be on-the-job training for family planning
of staff of the District Hospital and of other hospitals. it will also in-
clude on-the-job training of PHC personnel. In all cases, all personnel
(whether especially working on family planning or with other duties) would
receive training (of different types) on the meaning of family planning,
availability of services, alternative contraceptives and ways of handling
the public on this matter. In other words, the mobile team approach to
training hospital and PHC staff would aim at creating an awareness of the
problem in the first place and secondly, at specifically training personnel,
who in turn would advise the public and promote the adoption of family plan-
ning. Further motivation by the team would continue through follow-up visits,
which would evaluate the training done during the initial visit.

Demo&raphic Trends and Prolect lpact
Sunmary
1.        The national goal of fertility reduction in India is to achleve a
birth rate of 25 per 1,000 population and an annual rate of growth of 1.5%
by 1980. To reach this target, an increasing nuiber of births would need
to be prevented each year, rising to over 10 million births averted by
1979-80 and totalling 56 million during 1971-79. In estimating the effort
that would be required to reduce fertility in -yore and Uttar Pradesh, this
overall goal has been taken into account.
2.        In this annex, a brief review of the past trends and presenit
demographic situation in both States is followed by a discussion of probable
population projections up to the year 2000 for the entire States and for the
project areas with and without project effect. These projectionb depend
on two different assumptions of fertility decline: (a) for projection I --
called here the "Target" projection or desirable outcome -- it is assumed
that fertility would decline to levels only slightly higher than the national
goal by 1980 (i.e., a birth rate of 30 per 1,000 population and a rate of
natural increase of 1.8 instead of 25 and 1.5 respectively); (b) tor projec-
tion II a slower decline in fertility has been assumed and it represents the
likely trends of population in both States if efforts to reduce fertility
continue at their present level, implying no significant change lu the levels
of acceptance of contraception. The sme aumption of mortality decline
has been used for each State in both ptojectiooi (see Tables 2 and 8).
3.        Starting with projection II as a basls, a third projection is
estimated to reflect the effect that the project will have on fertility
decline.  There are, therefore, three projections which will serve as a
basis for the discussion of project effects in each State and in each
project area:
(a)  The "Target" projection, which would be a desirable
development (mentioned in the Tables sad text also as
"Projection I);
(b) The "Without Project" projection, which may be reasonably
expected to be approached by actual future population
trends if fertility decline is slow (also called here
"Projection II"); and
(c) The "With ProJect" projection, which has been estimated
by subtracting from Projection II of each area and State
the would-be survivors from births prevented through the
project.

4.        The project effects in terms of births averted, reduction in
population size and shifts in age distribution have been estimated on the
basis of reasonable assumptions concerning the capacity of project facilities
and programs to recruit acceptors. The quantitative measure of project
impact presented in this annex should be taken as basic and indicative of a
minimum of the probable impact. It is difficult to assess the total project
impact because so much depends on the outcome of innovative approaches to
increase the demand for family planning services amd contraceptives. 'The
figures presented here do not include allowance for the fact that a large
part of the project is experimental. For instance, it is not possible to
quantify with a reasonable degree of precision the effects that mobile teanms,
comunication efforts, the nutrition program for mothers and infants, and
other innovative means to stimulate adoption of contraception will have on
acceptances. The estimates in this annex are the minimum to be expecteA
from this project.
5.      In Mysore, the estimated project effect is cilculated ill         2A 3
million birth preventions in the period 1973-20.00 (Table 5).  ThLs totb.d ie-
sult in a population 2.1 million smalLer than without the..project by the
year 2000, in the age group 0-25 yetats.  It would tepresett a contribution
of 41.5% to the achievement of the "target" aldoddo   in population growth
in the whole State by 1980; for the project area, the births preYu r -           gh
the project by 1980 might very well exceed by one-third the level of 6!i:.h
prevention needed to reach the target decline. gy 2000 it would constiitute
still almost 100% of the decline needed in the project area to keep the
trends close to the "target." Excluding any effects of internal migration,
by the year 2000 the population in the project area would be 12.3% smaller
than without the project and the "target" fertility decline would be amply
achieved by 1980 (in that year, the population in the area would be 202,300
smaller with the project, while the required reduction to meet the "target"
trend is about 153,000 less people).
6.        The project would contribute to a shift in age structure, more
favorable to economic development. The group uad*f  15 years which in 1971
comprised 42% of the total population In Uttat *00&* mad 1  ore would
approximate 37-38% in 1985 and 29-32 in 2000 if the taret is resUmed in
Mysore.
7.        In Uttar Pradesh, the estimated birth pteomtion with thie projact
would be 1.5 million (Table 11) between 1973 mid 2000.  Presnt levels of
fertility are much higher in this State. Therefost, the effort that would
be required to approach the "target" by 1980 is considerable.  The effect
ofthe project in this State would be small, if maisured only in quantitative
terms and with criteria for acceptors which are to a great extent derived
from present experience. By 1980, the estimated acceptors that would be
recruited through the project would contribute only 6% towards the "target"
achievement of population slowdown in the whole State and with 50% in the



ANNEX 10

project area.  In the year 2000 there would be about  1.3 rillion less people
under 25 years in the State as a result of the project. It is particularly
in this State that the justification of the project lies heavily on its
experimental nature and on its potential for developing new approaches and
for stimulating demand for contraception in rural areas with low socio-
economic levels.
Mysore
8.        The 1971 census counted 29.2 million population in Mysore, with
24% living in urban areas. Almost 30% of the population is literate, and
the medical and health care system compares favorably and is more wide-
spread than in most other States of India. The level of economic develop-
ment is similar to the Indian average, although the southern part of the
State (Bangalore Division) where a sizeable industrial sector has developed,
is well above the average. Mysore's population grew from-16.3 million in
1941 to 23.6 million in 1961, and to 29.3 million in 1971. The last census
revealed a decennial increase of 24% and an annual growth rate of 2.2%
(Table 1). The birth rate was estimated at 34-35 per 1,000 population in
1969, and the death rate was 15 per 1,000 population with a resulting rate
of natural increase of 2% per year.
9.        Rapid population growth in Mysore State represents a problem
similar to that of India as a whole. Population projections under different
asssumptions of fertility change have been prepared with the purpose of
assessing the effect of different rates of fertility reduction in the size
and age composition of the population of the project areas and of the State.
The hypotheses underlying the assumptions are explained in the notes of
Table 2. Internal migration among the States and Districts has not been
included as a component in these projections; therefore, growth is expressed
through the rate of natural increase. Assumptions for projection I ("Target
projection) were chosen to measure the reduction in the niumber of births
which would have to occur to approximate the goals set by the GOI. The
national target has been stated in terms of achieving a crude birth rate
(CBR) of 25 per 1,000 population and a growth rate (GR) of 1.5 by 1980-81.
Projection I for the project areas of Mysore implies a slightly more
moderate goal (CBR of 28-29 and GR of 1.8 by 1980) and the acheivement
of the national goal by 1990. This has been done to work project
expectations on a more realistic basis.
10.       Projection II in Table 2, both for the State and for the project
area (columns 2 and 8 respectively), may be taken as an illustration of the
probable consequences of a slower fertility decline, if efforts in family
planning do not increase significantly from the present situation. The
projections in columns 3 and 9 represent the likely trends that would result
from project effects. It is apparent from this table that on a State-wide
basis, the project effects on fertility decline will not be enough to
bring fertility down to levels which would allow the realization of the
"target" projection; however, it would contribute significantly towards



ANNEX 1 0
Page 4 of 18
this goal; by 1980 41.5% of the slowdown in population growth needed in
Mysore State would be resulting from project effect (Table 2, coluAn 6).
In the project area, the effect would exceed by one-third the needed slow-
down in population growth. By the year 2000, about 2.3 million births
would have been averted through the project and as a consequence, there
would be about 2.1 million less persons among the age group 0-25 years.  ihe
corresponding trends of birth, death and natural increase rates for
projections I and II are shown in Table 3.
11.       Estimates of probable acceptors, births averted and resulting
slowdown in population growth have been worked out on the basis of reason-
able assumptions on the capacity of the project facilities and programs to
recruit and keep acceptors practicing contraception (Table 4). The basis
for these estimates are given in the same table. Using these numbers of
probable acceptors for the period 1973-2000, births averted were calculated
under assumptions of birth prevention given by the GOI, and are presented
in Table 5. About 2.3 million births would not occur in the period 1973-
2000 if project facilities and programs succeed in the expectations. These
estimates have not taken into account any additional effects that the
project may have in the family planning program of the whole State. The
number of likely acceptors in the project areas were calculated by assuming
more efficient performance of the personnel working in famdly planning and
moderate response from the public, taking as a starting point the present
experience. No unusual changes in people's attitude towards contraception
have been expected in making estimates of acceptors (see Tables 4 and 5).
12.       Changes in age structure under different assumptions of fertility
changes are shown in Table 6. In 1971, about 42% of the population of
llysorc was under 15 years of age. If population in the next 15 years
followed the patterns of fertility and mortality similar to projection I,
that group would account for only 38% of the population and by the year 2000
would be reduced to 29%. The dependency ratiol/ which in 1971 was 82%, would
still be 71% in 1985 and 66% in 2000 if fertility declines slowly. If
population trends become nearer to projection I, the dependency ratio would
decline to 66% in 1985 and to 56% in 2000. The project would play an
important role in bringing about this change in iysore.
Uttar Pradesh
13.       With 88.4 million population in 1971, Uttar Pradesh is the
largest State in India and one of the poorest.  At present, 14% of the
population is living in urban areas. Only 3% of the male labor force was
in non-household manufacturing industry in 1961. The medical and health
I/   Dependency ratio is the ratio between "non-producers" (people under 15
and 65 years and over) and those in the labor force (15-64 years of age);
a lower ratio means more income for producers and dependents; in
developed countries, this ratio is about 50%.



ANNEX 10

care system is exceptionally thin, particularly in rural areas. Levels of
socio-economic development in Uttar Pradesh vary considerably. Western
districts, where the "green revolution" has had an impact, are the most
developed while socio-economic conditions in the East are far less favorable.
The population of this State has increased from 56.5 million in 1941 to a
present level of 88.4 million (Table 7). In 1941-50, the birth rate was
38.6 per 1,000 population and the death rate was 27.2 per 1,000 population,
giving a rate of natural increase of 1.1Z per year. Current estimates point
to a high level of natality near 44-45 per 1,000 population, while mortality
is still high -- maybe 18-20 per 1,000 population. Thus, the rate of natural
increase has more than doubled to 2.4 - 2.7 per year. The demographic,
economic and social implications of these trends are at least as grave as
for the whole of India. The economic variables for the State disclose a
disquieting situation. For instance, "the per capita income at constant
prices (1960-61) was only a little higher in 1960-61 than in 1930-31, but
lower than in 1920-21. At present, the level is stifl lower than in 1920-21.
The per capita net cultivated area has decreased from 0.74 acres in 1921 to
0.63 acres in 1951 and to 0.50 acres in 1967-68, although the net cultivated
area has increased absolutely and in relation to the total area. Most of
the gains in productivity have been neutralized largely by the decline in
per capita cultivated area due to population growth." 11
14.       Although mortality is still high in Uttar Pradesh, rapid population
growth is a serious obstacle for social economic development. Even under
rather unfavorable health conditions, mortality is expected to decrease in
the future as mass control programs succeed, even if partially, in decreasing
the incidence of diseases such as malaria, smallpox and tuberculosis, and
childhood infectious diseases through vaccination.
15.       The population projections presented in this Annex (Table 8) help
understand the possible effect of different rates of fertility decline in the
project areas and in the State. The hypotheses underlying the two assumptions
are explained in the notes of the same table. The probAble trends which
would be followed by the main demographic indicators (birtn, death and
natural increase rates) under the stated assumptions are presented in Table 9.
The probable number of acceptors that would be recruited through the project
between 1973 and 1999 are given in Table 10.
16.       In Uttar Pradesh, the estimated volume of birth prevention with
the project would be 1.5 million (Table 11) between 1973 and 2000. Present
levels of fertility are much higher than in Mysore and consequencly, accept-
ance of contraception would have to increase considerably more if similar
lower levels of fertility are to achieved within 10 to 15 years and there-
after.
17.       Table 8 includes some measures of the probable project impact on
fertility reduction in Uttar Pradesh.

In that State, where socio-economic conditions are less favorable and
rapid population growth is a more serious problem, experiment and in-
novation in reaching the rural people with information and services
for family planning will play a much more important role; means
to increase acceptance will have to be devised within the constraints
of facilities and personnel availability.  Future performance estimates
of the family planning program based on present experience (as is mainly
done in this annex) can only be modest. However, the effects of innova-
tive approaches are difficult to translate to quantitative terms at this
stage, although they constitute a very concrete expectation for the whole
project.
18.       By 1980, the estimated acceptors that would be recruited through
the project, by present standards plus a slight improvement, would contri-
bute with only 6% towards "target" achievement of population slowdown in
the whole State and with 50% in the project area. But in the year 200G,
there would be about 1.3 million less people under 25 years in the State as
a result of the project and this slowdown would exceed the decrease needed
to achieve the "target" in the project area. On a state-wide basis, the
project would contribute 12% to the "target."

l/ Assumptions - In the two projections, life expectancy is assumed to increase
0.5 year annually up to 1980 and 0.25 thereafter.
I  - Age-specific fertility (ASF) would decrease by 1980 to about 65% of the
1971 level and the crude birth rate (CBR) would reach about 29 per 1,000
population, which is 4 points higher than the national goal of fertility
decline (25 per 1,000 population for 1980). Thereafter, fertility would
decline fairly rapidly, to 47% of the initial level by 2000.
II - This projection illustrates the likely consequences of a much slower
fertility decline. Age-specific fertility would be 90% of the 1971 level
in 1980 and the CBR would be around 33 per 1,000 population. Further
decline is assumed in the following years, the ASF reaching a level of
7$% of the initial values by 2000. In the discussion, the projection is
taken as an illustration of what would happen without the project.
2/ Excluding internal migration effects.
3/ Estimated as the number of would-be survivors from the births that would be
averted, as calculated in Table   of this annex.

1/  Number of acceptors per year has been assumed to remain the same as in 1985,
up to 1999.
Basis for estimates of project-originated acceptors:
Col. I - The 72 beds in the 6 maternity homes are expected to handle a maximum of
2,100 deliveries annually (80-85% occupancy and 10 days average stay).
Postpartum acceptors have been estimated to increase from 20 to 30% of
deliveries during the period 1976-85.
Col. 2 - The 120 beds in the 10 new maternity-sterilization wings in the PHCs
may be expected to handle a maximum of 3,500 deliveries (70-80/. occupancy
rate). Postpartum acceptors are estimated to. increase from 15 to 20% of
deliveries during the period 1986-85.
Col. 3 - Likely postpartum acceptors from about 81,800 annual home deliveries in
rural areas, supervised by 584 subcenters (at 140 deliveries per subcenter
per year) assuming that 15 to 20% will accept contraceptive methods during
the period 1976-85.
Col. 4 - Likely postpartum acceptors from about 77,600 annual home deliveries in
rural areas, supervised by 554 subcenters (at 140 deliveries per subcenter
per year) assuming that 5 to 10% will accept contraceptive methods during
the period 1976-85 (non-intensive districts).
Col. 5 - The 14 new UFWCs, covering a total population of 700,000 may be able to
recruit 7 acceptors per 1,000 population (1971 level) and go up to 20
per 1,000 population by 1985.
Col. 6 - Number of annual acceptors expected to be recruited from 584 ANMs in
subcenters of intensive districts at the rate of 5 acceptors per ANM
per month during the period (excluding postpartum acceptors).
Col. 7 - Number of annual acceptors expected to be recruited from 554 ANMs in
subcenters of non-intensive districts at the rate of 3 acceptors per
ANM per month (excluding postpartum acceptors).

Basis for estimates by contraceptive method:
Sterilizations - (63.3%) Maximum number was determined by the number of
tubectomies possible to perform in the new facilities
with 80% occupancy and 5 days' average stay. Vasectomies
were estimated as one-third of sterilizations.
IUCD            - 15% of total acceptors (5% more than present performance).
Condom          - Estimated at 80% of conventional users.
Total Acceptors expected from the project was taken from Table 7 of this
Annex. Proportional distribution by methods has been kept
constant throughout the period.
Basis for estimates of births averted:
India's Department of Family Planning estimates of birth prevention have
been used here.
Col. 1 --One sterilization equals 1.7 births averted over 10 years; starting
with year 1977, estimates take into account shorter period of
exposure to pregnancy.
Col. 2 - One IUCD insertion equals to 0.7 births averted in 5 years.
Col. 3 - Conventional contraceptive couple year of protection equals 0.15
birth prevention.

1/  Assumptions - In the two projections, life expectancy is assumed to increase 0.30
year annually up to 1985 and .15 year thereafter.
I  - Age-specific fertility (ASF) would decrease by 1980 to about 65% of the
1971 level and the crude birth rate (CBR) would reach about 30 per 1,000
population, which is 5 points higher than the national goal of fertility
decline (25 per 1,000 population for 1980). Thereafter, fertility would
decline fairly rapidly to 47% of the initial level by 2000.
11 - This projection illustrates the likely consequences of a much slower fer-
tility decline. ASF would be 80% of the 1971 level in 1980 and the CBR
would be around 36 per 1,000 population. Further decline is assumed in
the following years, the ASF reaching a level of 47% of the initial values
by 2000. In the discussion, this projection is taken as an illustration
of what would happen without the project.
2/ Excluding internal migration effects.
3/ Estimated as the number of would-be survivors from the births that would be
averted, as calculated in Table   of this annex.

1/ Rounded figures.
Basis for estimates of project-originated acceptors:
Col. I - The 96 beds in 8 new maternity homes are expected to handle a
maximum of 2,800-3,000 deliveries annually (80-35% occupancy and
10 days of average stay). Postpartum acceptors nave been estimated
to increase from 20 to 30% of deliveries during the period.
Col. 2 - The 120 beds in the 10 new maternity-sterilization wings in the PECs
may be expected to handle a maximum of 3,500 deliveries (70-80%
occupancy rate). Postpartum acceptors are expected to increase
from 15 to 20% of deliveries during the period.
Col. 3 - Likely postpartum acceptors from about 38,200 annual home deliveries
in rural areas, supervised by 273 subcenters (at 140 deliveries per
subcenter per year), assuming that 10-15% will accept contraceptive
methods during the period.
Col. 4 - Likely postpartum acceptors from about 64,960 anaual home deliveries
in rural areas, supervised by 464 subcenters (at 140 deliveries per
subcenter per year), assuming that 5-10% will accept contraceptive
methods during the period (non-intensive districts).
Col. 5 - The 8 new UFWCs covering a total population of 400,000 may be. able
to recruit 17 acceptors per 1,000 population (1971 level) and go up
to 25 per 1,000 population by 1985.
Col. 6 - Number of annual acceptors expected to be recruited from 273 ANMs in
subcenters of intensive districts at the rate of 5 acceptors per ANM
per month (excluding postpartum acceptors).
Col. 7 - Number of annual acceptors expected to be recruited from 464 ANMs in
subcenters of non-intensive districts at the rate of 3 acceptors per
ANM per month (excluding postpartum acceptors).

Basis for estimates by contraceptive method:
Sterilizations - (63.3%) Maximum number was determined by the number of
tubectomies possible to perform in the new facilities
with 80% occupancy and 5 days' average stay. Vasectomies
were estimated as one-third of sterilizations.
IUCD            - 15% of total acceptors (5% more than present perfor-ance).
Condom          - Estimated at 80% of conventional users.
Total Acceptors expected from the project was taken from Table   of this
annex. Proportional distribution by methods has been kept
constant throughout the period.
Basis for estimates of births averted:
India's Department of Family Planning estimates of birth prevention have
been used here.
Col. 1 - One sterilization equals 1.7 births averted over 10 years; starting
with year 1977, estimates take into account shorter period of
exposure to pregnancy.
Col. 2 - One IUCD insertion equals to 0.7 births averted in 5 years.
Col. 3 - Conventional contraceptive couple year of protection equals to
0.15 birth prevention.

Economic Effects of the Project
Introduction
1.        In this section, an attempt is made to roughly measure the
benefits in quantitative terms of the project in the two project areas
of Mysore and Uttar Pradesh. These benefits are a minimum estimate, since
they do not take into account important social benefits -- such as improve-
ments in the health and welfare of mothers and children and in the physical
and mental development of the population through better nutrition in the
critical first years of life, etc. Furthermore, the main benefits result
from the experimental and innovative nature of the project; the research
findings which are expected to improve program performance, not only in the
project Districts but also in the whole Indian program, cannot be quantified
but are expected to be substantial. The following analysis measuring the
effect of the project refers only to those direct economic effects which
can be quantified.
A. Uttar Pradesh
2.        The per capita income in the project area ef Uttar Pradesh in
1955-56 was Rs 274, varying from Rs 202 in Pratapgarh to Rs 367 in Saharanpur
(at 1960-61 prices). The following table suamarizes the total and per capita
income in the project Districts:

Per Capita Income
3.        The income of the State and the project area was pro>_cted to
1980-81. The growth of population -- with and without the project -- was
also estimated to determine the diffference in per capita income that the
project is expected to make. This difference is due solely to the divisio:1
of the same national income among a smaller population. It does not take
into account the possibility of a higherincome than otherwise as a result
(i) of higher savings because of the reduced dependency burden; and (ii)
improvements in the quality of the labor force resulting from better health.,
nutrition and education, which accompany the increased standard of living.
The results are summarized in the following table: (In millions, except
the Per Capita Income columns).

/1   Income estimates for the State and project area are based on the
National Income Projections given in the Fourth Five-Year Plan and
assuming that the ratios of income in the States and in the project
area would remain constant at the present level.
/2   Assuming a capital-output ratio of 3:1.
As can be seen, the gains in per capita incoTie up to 1980-81 would not be
large as the project impact is gradual. The per capita income would be
Rs 763 with the project and Rs 758 without it in 1978-79. In 1980-81, the
per capita income would be Rs 827 with the project and Rs 818 without it.
While these appear to be small magnitudes, they neverthele-s are substantial
if one considers the additional investment requirements that would have been
necessary to produce the same increase in per capita income, if fertility
had not declined. These requirements, shown in the last column of the table,
amount to Rs 336 million. This can be compared with the project cost of
Rs 119 million, which is only about one third of the additional investment
reqtuirements needed to produce equivalent benefits. In other words had the
project cost been invested in other sectors of the economy, it would have
resulted in an increase in per capita income equal to only about one third
of the increase resulting from the project in 1980-81.
Labor Force

occur only after 15-20 years. The labor force in Uttar Pradesh would be
smaller by 137,000 in year 2000. Unemployment in the mid-sixties is
estimated at 7% of the labor force. If this rate continues, unemployment
will be reduced by over one fourth in the year 2000, as can be seen from
the following table:

Per Capita Income
6.        Total income and population with and without the project have been
projected up to 1980-81. The basis of these calculations is similar to that
of U.S. The results are summarized in the following table: (In millions,
except the Per Capita Income columns).

/1   Assuming a capital-output ratio of 3:1.
The per capita income is seen to be Rs 681 without the project and Rs 688 with
the project in 1978-79. In 1980-81, the income would be Rs 747 with the
project and Rs 733 without it. To produce the same increase in per capita
income without the project the additional investment required would be Rs 468
million. This can be compared with the project cost of Rs 112 million which
is only one fifth of the additional investment required to produce an equi-
valent benefit. In other words, had the project cost been invested in other
sectors of the economy, it would have regulted in an increase in per capita
income equal to only about one fifth of the increase resulting from the project
in 1980-81. The economic effects here are larger than those in Uttar Pradesh
in view of the larger number of births averted.
Labor Force
7.        The labor force in Mysore would be smaller by 220,000 in 2000 as a
result of the project. Unemployment at the end of the Third Plan (1966) was
estimated at about 10%. If the same rate continues, unemployment would be
smaller by 34% in the year 2000 as a result of the project, as can be seen from
the following table: (In thousands)
