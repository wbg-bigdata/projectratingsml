strengthening the socio-economic situation in key urban centers and in two isolated areas
- i.e.: (i) improving delivery of basic services in provincial capitals and key medium
urban centers; and (ii) restoring key transport links to reconnect tow isolated regions.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was gradually emerging from a decade of
political instability and conflict. Major fighting ended in 2001 and a UN peace-keeping force
was deployed in 2002. Since April 2001, the government had implemented a program of
economic reforms, supported by the Bretton Woods Institutions, and DRC reached the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries decision point in June 2003 - with a total assistance estimated at
US$6.3 billion. A transitional government of national unity was appointed on June 30, 2003,
creating conditions favorable to social and economic reunification. However, the situation
remained fragile. The size of the country and the lack of infrastructure combined to make
access to certain areas extremely difficult and state institutions remained weak, translating
into extreme poverty and persistent insecurity in these areas.

2.      Per capita income, at about US$107 in 2002, was only a fraction of what it was at the
time of independence. An estimated 16 million people were in critical food need. With the
conflict, the formal private sector almost collapsed, with many enterprises losing assets, staff,
and commercial networks. Traditional export activities dropped to only 5 percent of GDP and
services declined (from about 45 percent of GDP in the 1980s to 28 percent in 2001), while
the share of agriculture substantially increased (from 30 percent of GDP in the 1980s to 54
percent in 2001). Only 5 percent of the active population had a job in the formal sector. The
economy was largely based on subsistence; small-scale trade, services, and day labor in urban
areas and subsistence agriculture in rural areas.

Sector context
3.      Cities in DRC, home to about a third of the population, had an important role to play
in assuring social stability and economic growth. Urban economic collapse, deteriorating
living conditions, and inflows of displaced persons combined to create a highly volatile
environment, as illustrated by a series of riots and violence in June 2004. Infrastructure and
services had considerably deteriorated over the previous decade. Entire provinces did not
have access to energy or clean water, urban streets were in poor conditions and drains were
blocked, providing breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Public health had deteriorated with a
rapid spreading HIV/AIDS epidemic and with other diseases on the increase, and primary
school enrollment had decreased. The urban population was living in increased poverty,
economic activities in cities were limited and they no longer played a role as growth centers
in the national economy. Further, the dilapidation of the road network during the conflict had
resulted in the isolation of entire provinces, where living conditions were appalling.

Government strategy and response
4.      The main mandate of the transitional government was to restore peace and assure
reunification. The government had implemented a program of economic reforms to spur
economic growth and tackle some of the structural bottlenecks which had hampered DRC’s
economic development in the past. The results of the program were significant, but needed to
be further consolidated and the government’s capacity for pro-poor spending was constrained
by lack of resources. A Minimum Partnership Program for Recovery and Transition
(PMPTR) had been prepared by the government in November 2004, as a strategy while the
comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy was being developed. The PMPTR proposed an
overall strategic framework for transition and recovery, and presented the needs in 16 areas,


                                               1
ranging from macroeconomic stability to infrastructure and including the social sectors,
organization of elections and security sector reform.

5.      There was a broad consensus between the government and donors that managing the
social crisis and laying the ground for economic growth and poverty alleviation were critical
to the success of the overall effort. The priority was to focus the reconstruction effort on
generating peace dividends, in particular in urban centers (since they had proven to be highly
combustive), to keep the transition and recovery process on track. The PMPTR focused on
reestablishing the authority of the state throughout the country, pursuing macro-economic,
governance and business climate reforms, and working towards social inclusion. Both the
government and donors emphasized the acuity of the ongoing social crisis and donors had
pledged US$5.7 billion in aid for the three to four year program estimated at US$6.9 billion.

World Bank strategy and response
6.      The Bank’s response was designed and implemented as part of the broader donor
response. A Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) was developed for 2004-2006 to focus on
four strategic elements: (i) security and social stability, including in volatile areas, especially
urban centers, and re-establishing the authority of the state throughout the country; (ii) high
and shared growth, with a particular effort to rehabilitate transport and urban infrastructure;
(iii) governance and institutional strengthening, in particular at the provincial level; and (iv)
social development, in particular to improve living conditions in urban areas, where “quick
wins? could be most easily achieved.

7.       The Emergency Living Conditions Improvement Support Project (ELICSP) was an
integral part of the portfolio of Bank-funded projects, both ongoing and in the pipeline: (i) the
Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EMRRP, 2002), targeted
the most basic and urgent needs through community sub-projects; (ii) the Emergency
Economic and Social Reunification Support Project (EESRSP, 2004), contributed to the
stabilization of the economy and the social fabric in the Eastern and Northern provinces; and
(iii) the Emergency Urban and Social Rehabilitation Project was under preparation to focus
on Kinshasa. Together these projects would cover the whole territory, as it was estimated that
the conflict had in fact also affected the population outside the conflict areas.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
8.       The project's objective was to assist the Government in improving living conditions
by strengthening the socio-economic situation in key urban centers and in two isolated areas,
i.e.: (i) improving delivery of basic services in provincial capitals and key medium urban
centers, and (ii) restoring key transport links to reconnect two isolated regions. The sub-
objectives were not part of the Development Grant Agreement (DGA) but figure in the
project description in the Technical Annex (TA) to the Memorandum of the President and are
retained for the ICR.

9.     The indicators were not fully developed at appraisal, but the TA specifies that they
would measure: (i) the increased quality and coverage of services available in each targeted
urban area, and (ii) a decrease of transport costs to reconnected areas.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
10.      The PDO was not revised, but as demand-driven investments were selected in project
cities the indicators were refined to capture the actual impacts of specific sector investments.

                                                2
The project was restructured three times, and two restructurings included changes to the
results framework (see details in section 2.3).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.     The original beneficiaries were the residents of the 18 medium-sized cities and 7
provincial capitals targeted by the project and the population living near the two roads to be
rehabilitated (Equateur and Katanga Provinces). The provincial administrations were also to
benefit from capacity building.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component A: Support to medium urban centers
(Appraisal/actual cost: US$10.00 million/US$13.16 million)
12.      This component was to finance emergency activities (for infrastructure rehabilitation,
social services delivery, and economic revitalization activities) in 18 medium-sized cities
located in the Western and Southern provinces 1 with investments to be selected based on a
local level consultation process. The component was a geographical expansion of similar
activities successfully implemented under the ongoing EESRSP..

Component B: Support to provincial capitals
(Appraisal/actual cost: US$27.00 million/US$33.66 million)
13.    Component B would finance quick-impact investments in the capitals of the Western
and Southern provinces 2 (including infrastructure rehabilitation, social services delivery, and
economic revitalization activities with a particular focus on labor-intensive activities), as well
as targeted support to specific technical entities. Component B was also a geographical
expansion of similar EESRSP activities.

Component C: Connectivity to isolated areas
(Appraisal/actual cost: US$32.00 million/US$29.95 million)
14.     Also a scale-up of similar activities successfully implemented under the EESRSP, this
component would finance the rehabilitation of two major roads (Akula-Gemena-Mbari-
Libenge-Zongo (RN6) in Equateur and Lubumbashi-Kasomeno-Kasenga (RN5) in Katanga,
see details in Annex 2), to make them fit for circulation and the transportation of goods under
acceptable economic conditions and re-connect two isolated regions to the national transport
network.

Component D: Support to provincial institutions
(Appraisal/actual cost: US$7 million/US$0.01 million)
15.      This component would replicate similar activities successfully implemented with
funds from the EESRSP, the European commission, and bilateral donors. It would support
and strengthen key provincial institutions in all project provinces through: (i) provision of
basic training, (ii) acquisition of equipment, and (iii) minimal rehabilitation of office
facilities.

Component E: Project management
(Appraisal/actual cost: US$3 million/US$5.03 million, including PPF reimbursement)
16.    The objective of the component was to coordinate, monitor and report on the project
(not mentioned explicitly as a component in the TA, but with funds allocated and mentioned
as a component in the DGA).

1.6 Revised Components
17.     Component C was closed on July 26, 2010, due to the poor performance of
contractors and cost overruns (see section 2.2) to help refocus the project on other activities
consistent with the achievement of the PDO. Prior to this, work had been carried out to
reopen critical road sections in both provinces, and traffic flowed freely, in line with the
component objective. Originally planned Component C activities had to be completed under
new contracts partly on the borrower’s own funds and partly through the Bank-funded High-
Priority Roads Reopening and Maintenance Project (PROROUTES). Component D was
closed at the same time as most of the priority activities had been financed by the borrower
and the remaining follow-up activities could be implemented under the Bank-funded
Governance Capacity Enhancement Project and other donor-funded projects more suited for
sector interventions.

1.7 Other significant changes
18.     The project was restructured three times: (i) On June 26, 2010, Components C and D
were closed and proceeds reallocated to Components A and B (details in Annex 1). At the
same time, the project was extended by one year from September 30, 2010 to September 30,
2011. (ii) The second restructuring was approved on March 30, 2011 to drop activities under
Components A and B which were no longer considered a priority and transfer activities
facing a financing gap from the EESRSP (see section 2.2 for details). The closing date was also
extended by 5 months to February 29, 2012 and the results framework slightly revised. (iii)
The third restructuring took place on February 22, 2012, to extend the closing date by another
4 months, from February 29, 2012, to June 30, 2012, to complete activities for the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) of RN2 (transferred from the EESRSP) and limited
activities under Components A and B. The results framework was revised accordingly each
time. Details and background are provided in sections 2.2 and 2.3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Preparation
19.     The ELCISP was part of a broader effort to consolidate the transition and recovery
process. It was prepared as an emergency operation under OP 8.50 to expand the reach of
ongoing reconstruction activities, reflecting an improvement in the security situation, and
built on the existing Bank portfolio, most notably by replicating successful activities of the
ongoing EESRSP (covering the four Eastern provinces) in the six remaining provinces. The
Bank and government operational knowledge enabled preparation and appraisal of the project
to take place in nine months, an acceptable preparation time for an emergency operation. The
government’s engagement in the EESRSP was replicated and the inter-ministerial committee
already in place served for the coordination of the preparation of the ELCISP. The existing
project coordinating unit in the Ministry of Planning (Unité de Coordination de Projets –
UCoP), already implementing the EESRSP was charged with project preparation to
overcome capacity constraints.

                                                     4
Design
20.     The project design built on approaches which had proven successful under the
EESRSP and reflected lessons learned from that operation, including building in flexibility. It
was, however, prepared as a separate operation as EESRSP was a reunification project also
providing balance of payment support and micro-credits, and to introduce new features not
part of the EESRSP, notably providing on-site technical assistance (engineer) to secondary
cities and developing city contracts (as explained below). The project expected to generate
peace dividends in parts of the country which had previously received little assistance, and
focused on living conditions improvement, the government’s highest priority, by using a
multi-sectoral approach. Experience has shown that such support is critical and that relatively
small investments can have a disproportionate impact. This approach was coupled with a
focus on recreation of growth poles and employment generation, contributing to stabilizing
the social situation and strengthening the environment for transition and recovery. The
project fully reflected the priorities of the TSS.

21.      Further, previous experience in DRC had shown that imbalances between the
resource-rich East and the rest of the country had contributed to political instability, so
particular attention was paid to this issue by targeting the areas around Lubumbashi and
Gemena (under Component C), which remained isolated. Investments for Component A
would be selected during implementation through consultation with all key stakeholders,
helping to ensure that resources would be spent wisely and benefits widely shared, and also
contributing to revitalizing municipal structures. The process to consult the population was
fully developed during appraisal. The cities were selected based on urgency of needs, security
conditions (allowing development activities), and access conditions (including for
contractors, as moving equipment to sites was highly challenging in many isolated cities and
areas). Component B activities were selected during appraisal through consultations
facilitated by a government technical team that visited each city. Component C focused on
reconnecting isolated regions, as spelled out in the PMPTR.

22.     Operation and maintenance arrangements have historically proven to be difficult to
assure in emergency operations, especially where none existed before the conflict. The
project did, however, include provision for maintenance for all investments (Components A,
B, and C according to the TA, although only Component C maintenance is part of the DGA)
for a three year period. A planning element, not part of the EESRSP, was added to the
emergency response via the signing of city contracts between the government and city
authorities, specifying (for Components A and B) the investments to be financed, the
expected development objectives and the corresponding measurable performance indicators,
and the arrangements devised by the authorities for operation and maintenance, including
financing arrangements and individuals in charge. The city contracts further had the
advantage of providing assurance that investments to be financed by the project would
actually occur, correcting a situation where local authorities had previously planned the same
investments twice with the hope that at least one donor would eventually finance the
investment. The contracts also engaged the cities to lodge the on-site engineer and secure the
sites and had clauses on continuity in case of change of local administration. Further, it was
foreseen that sector ministries and specialized agencies relevant for the types of
infrastructures financed by the project would be associated, providing an opportunity for
capacity strengthening critical for the continued operation and maintenance of rehabilitated
infrastructure.


                                              5
23.     Implementation arrangements took into account the existing capacity constraints in
the public administration. UCoP was charged with overall project implementation and
reporting. The Bureau Central de Coordination (BCECO, an autonomously functioning
government entity) was put in charge of implementing Component A and managing
procurement for Component C, as it had some experiences from previous projects, and an
engineer was seconded to each of the 18 Component A cities. The Urban Rehabilitation
Management Firm (URMF, private sector) would manage activities under Components B and
D, also due to its good track record. The use of tested implementation mechanisms was a
practical way to ensure quick wins and rapid, visible results. The project also relied on
private contractors rather than NGOs, as restarting private sector activity was a priority.

Quality at entry
24.     A quality at entry assessment rated quality satisfactory, confirmed by the evaluation
in this ICR. The project had a relevant PDO and components were designed to flexibly
address the most urgent needs in a relatively participatory manner. Design built on emerging
good practices. The project was ready for implementation at effectiveness, with procurement
of key contracts already underway. With hindsight some shortcomings on Components C and
D become apparent. Given the lack of technical studies for Component C, the project could
have set aside more unallocated funds to cover any cost increases. However, appraisal did
rely on prices coming out of competitive bidding at that time (which, however later had to be
revised upwards), so this is not considered a significant appraisal shortcoming. Neither are
shortcomings on Component D feasibility; the component was considered as less urgent and
took time to start. Since many activities were taken over by other projects before it could start
up under the ELCISP, it was eventually cancelled.

2.2 Implementation
25.     In spite of good experience with ELCISP implementing agencies under ongoing
Bank-funded projects, the project encountered problems early on due to the inability of the
implementing agencies to scale up their work and limited capacity of contractors, combined
with the geographic spread of activities. Delegated contract management also took some time
for the parties to fully grasp as a concept, which was new in DRC. The delegated contract
managers (BCECO and URMF) had experience in World Bank procurement procedures but
not in works supervision, a shortcoming given the weak capacity of contractors, and were not
used to monitoring and reporting on project indicators. BCECO further did not focus enough
on the sustainability of investments proposed, which resulted in many Component A projects
being rejected early on, further delaying implementation.

26.     Component A had experienced about one year delay due to the time taken to recruit
on-site engineers, the geographic spread of sites and the limited capacity of the construction
industry. Component B was delayed due to the late recruitment of URMF and the time taken
to mobilize staff, including on-site engineers, as well as developing an adequate management
system. Component C encountered persistent delays due to the lack of capacity of the
contractors and the isolated locations, which made access to sites extremely difficult. During
contract negotiations, the contractors for road works had accepted a reduction of their bid
against reduction in the scope of work (focusing only on the most critical road sections to
reopen, since the bids were too high compared to estimates), but this resulted in opening
many sites for minor works, which the contractors did not have sufficient capacity to do.
Given the limited capacity of URMF to deal with problems under Component B, priority was
given to solving these issues and getting the reconstruction part of the project on track,


                                               6
therefore Component D activities did not start up under the ELCISP, as they were considered
less urgent.

27.    The Mid-Term Review (MTR) was held in November 2008 (disbursement rate was 43
percent), and was used to find solutions to the above-mentioned problems. Component
progress was as follows:

   •   Component A was now progressing well, with 78 percent of component allocations
       disbursed. The city contracts were proving useful to assure that all actors played their
       part.
   •   For Component B, the low performance of the implementing agency meant that it was
       not until the MTR that tenders worth US$6.5 million (30 percent of the component
       envelope) were ready to be launched.
   •   Component C also encountered problems. Work to reopen the Akula-Zongo road
       (RN6) was progressing slowly. The work of one of the two contractors (working on
       the Mbari-Zongo section of RN6) had been at a halt for three months, but the
       contractor was allowed more flexibility to organize work. The contractor for the other
       section (Akula-Mbari) had encountered delays, but work was progressing. A
       component cost overrun of US$4 million (or 12.5 percent of appraised component
       cost) was however estimated.
   •   Due to the cost overruns, it was agreed to close Component D and reallocate the funds
       to Component C, since most of the activities were already financed by the government
       and the provinces, and the remaining activities, which were less urgent but still
       relevant to longer term institutional development, would be financed by other donors.

28.    The MTR was further used to ensure that selected investments under Component B
were not already planned for inclusion in other sector projects. As a result, water sub-projects
in Matadi and Lubumbashi were dropped from the ELCISP (as they would be financed by the
Urban Water Project, then under preparation and approved on December 18, 2008) and
replaced with other investments within the allocated budget.

29.    In spite of the solutions sought, the contractor for the Mbari-Zongo section of RN6
was not able to restart work, mainly due to lack of funds to supply the site. The contract
eventually had to be terminated. It took some time to find an adequate solution to finalize the
works, given cost overruns, but it was finally agreed to transfer the works to an Additional
Financing being prepared for the ongoing Bank-funded PROROUTES.

30.    The restructuring agreed at the MTR finally took place on June 26, 2010,
(disbursement rate 68 percent) to modify the scope and design of the project by closing
Component C, with a disbursement rate of 92 percent and Component D, which remained
undisbursed. As it was found that the balance from Component D would not be sufficient to
finance the remaining works to consolidate achievements on Component C, and the roads
were already passable, in line with the PDO, the unused funds were reallocated for use under
Components A and B to ensure that these components’ contribution to PDO would be scaled
up and achieved by the new completion date of September 30, 2011.

31.     The proposed changes would not have a major effect on the original economic and
social aspects of the project and the PDO did not change since key project activities were
already included in Components A and B. Component C had already disbursed 92 percent of
the allocated funds and met the target of increasing the average speed on the roads

                                               7
rehabilitated (at 30km/h compared to the target of 25km/h), by treating the most critical road
sections. Further, Component D was designed to be additional to Components A, B, and C
with focus on longer term development, so closing it would not impact the PDO, also taking
into consideration that most of the activities of Component D had been implemented by the
borrower and the remaining activities would be financed through other projects.

32.     A second restructuring became necessary on March 30, 2011 (at the time the
disbursement rate was 77 percent). The restructuring was used to drop some activities under
Components A and B, notably urban roads in Matadi, water supply in Mbuji-Mayi, and
supply of IT equipment in some rehabilitated schools, which were no longer considered as a
priority because these had already benefited from critical investments from the project. The
restructuring was further used to transfer some EESRSP activities that faced a financing to
ELCISP: (i) implementation of the RAP (US$3 million) for RN2, (ii) works related to water
supply in Goma, Bukavu and Kindu and power supply in Kindu (US$2 million), (iii) audits
and studies for the implementation completion report of the EESRSP (US$290,000), and (v)
remaining project implementation costs (US$350,000). An additional financing to the
EESRSP was considered but rejected due to the overage nature of the project (8 years). The
results frameworks of the two projects were revised in consequence.

33.     A third restructuring became necessary on February 22, 2012, to complete activities
anticipated in the RAP of RN2 and very limited number of activities under Components A
and B which were experiencing implementation delays (works related to water supply in Goma,
Bukavu, Kindu, Mbandaka, Kikwit). The closing date was extended from February 29, 2012 to
June 30, 2012. All activities were ongoing and expected to be completed before the closing
date. At the time of restructuring about 93 percent (US$76.31 million) of the Grant had been
disbursed.

34.     At the time of ICR, all activities have been completed; except for the RAP of RN2
(see section 2.4).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design
35.     The structure of the M&E framework was fully developed at appraisal, but not all
indicators were known, due to the demand-driven nature of the investments under
Components A and B. However, this should not have prevented the project team from
developing indicators with adequate baselines for Component C, for which specific
investments were known, but also for Component D, which was based on a known package
of investments per province. UCoP was made responsible for regular tracking of indicators
and organizing meetings with implementing partners and key stakeholders and direct
beneficiaries.

Implementation
36.     It was not until the MTR in November 2008 that the M&E framework was fully
developed as the Component A and B investments became known and specific sector
indicators with baselines were added for both outputs and outcomes. It was also agreed to
hire specific M&E capacity to UCoP to assure regular follow-up on results and socio-
economic aspects of the project, and UCoP staff received targeted M&E training. The
changes were formalized in the June 2010 restructuring, which also included the addition of


                                              8
core indicators. Further minor adjustments were made during the second restructuring to
targets in line with the revisions.

Utilization
37.     Following the MTR, M&E data was actively used to make sure the project was on
track. When it became obvious that contractors for Component C were not performing, the
project was restructured once an adequate solution had been found to assure implementation
of necessary activities. The indicators were further used to keep regular track of impacts on
beneficiaries.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
38.    The project was rated category B as no major environmental impacts were identified.
Safeguard policies triggered include: Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural Habitats
(OP 4.04), Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11), Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10), and
Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12. The Environmental Impact Assessment for Component C
and the Environmental and Social management Framework for Components A, B and D
required by OP 4.01, the Resettlement Policy Framework required by OP 4.12, and the
Indigenous Peoples Plan required by OP 4.10 were prepared and were disclosed in DRC.
Copies were disseminated to NGOs, academics, Pygmy associations, and news agencies.

39.     The MTR revealed that project affected persons resettled due to the road construction
were not adequately compensated, that the works contracts did not, as foreseen, include
funding to mitigate environmental aspects, and that the problem of medical wastes from
health facilities funded by the project was not fully taken into account. An international
environmental and social consulting firm was hired to assist and train UCoP staff, contractors
and the BCECO on environmental and social impact and management, as well as on Bank
safeguards procedures and requirements. The UCoP developed a plan to address the issues,
and the balance of Component A was used to finance activities to address the situation. RAPs
and Environmental Management Plans have been prepared for each 30 kilometer segment of
the roads. A total of 627 project affected persons were compensated. However, at project
closing, the beneficiary satisfaction survey revealed that no adequate solution has been found
to the problem of medical waste. There were no other significant problems encountered.

40.     The RN2 had been rehabilitated under EESRSP. No displacement or asset losses
occurred, but the road shoulders were reduced, leaving practically no space between the road
and neighboring buildings, increasing the risk of traffic accidents. To correct the situation, the
recipient prepared an ex-post RAP (final amount US$262,090), which was to be implemented
under the restructured ELCISP. However, subsequent changes to Bank procedures do no
longer allow for cash compensation to be paid on Bank funds, so the government is
implementing the RAP as funds become available and has currently paid 61 percent of the
adjusted amount of US$ 262,090 due to 35 project affected persons.

Fiduciary compliance
41.    UCoP took longer than expected to recruit internal and external auditors and until the
MTR, the Unit had insufficient staffing in the financial department. This was corrected
however. Financial management is rated moderately unsatisfactory, as a contract signed for
road works was canceled in 2010 but the balance of the advance payment made, estimated at
US$1,365,430, is still not reimbursed. The advance guarantee approved by the Minister of

                                                9
Finance turned out to be worthless when the contract (for part of the Akula-Zongo road) was
terminated due to non-performance. However, the government has committed itself to
reimburse this amount. Audit reports and interim financial reports (IFRs) were submitted to
the Bank on time and there were no overdue external audit reports and IFRs at the time of the
project closing date. All audit reports and IFRs were reviewed by the Bank and comments
provided to the government. The latest audit report was qualified, although no accountability
issues were flagged.

42.     Procurement is rated satisfactory, as the project complied with the Bank procurement
procedures. Post procurement reviews did not reveal any irregularities. A technical audit
carried out in May 2012 confirmed that procurement methods and thresholds in the delegated
contract management agreements have been respected.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
43.     For infrastructure built or rehabilitated under Components A and B, the beneficiaries
had participated in selecting the priority projects and, in 90 percent of the cases they had
participated in the hand-over. The institutional anchoring is clear, with personnel on the
government payroll, although some health centers and schools are still not fully staffed. Most
of the schools and health facilities rehabilitated by the project have committees to ensure
regular maintenance. Latrines facilities also have management committees and are assuring
regular maintenance. The new facilities attract more users than their planned capacity
(according to the beneficiary satisfaction survey and due to the quality of services provided),
resulting in overload, especially of health facilities. The Emergency Urban and Social
Rehabilitation Project financed operating expenses for 26,000 schools giving some respite.
However, the expected financing for maintenance to be provided by the government may be
problematic, since the beneficiary satisfaction survey revealed that 68 percent beneficiary
structures do not dispose of a budget line for maintenance and revenues generally do not
cover expenses. This is a serious issue that should be monitored to ensure that built facilities
are maintained and provide the expected services over time.

44.     Road maintenance represents a problem due to the current inability of the Road
Maintenance Fund (RMF) to cover all the needs, although a road sector study and linked
long-term maintenance strategy is being developed, and the RMF’s resources are increasing
substantially year by year. The Bank will finance, through the PROROUTES, the completion
of the rehabilitation works and the current maintenance of the RN6 up to 2016. During this
time, road fund resources are expected to increase substantially enough to support road
maintenance programs and maintain the effective operation of the RMF. The tar surfacing of
the Lubumbashi-Kasomeno road (a dirt road funded by the ELCISP but upgraded to asphalt
on government funds) contributed to better preserving the investment and making the
opening up of the isolated areas around Lubumbashi-Kasenga more sustainable.

45.     In addition, it is worth noting that the government and the Bank have decided to move
from emergency projects to sector projects, to pave the way for sustained access to basic
services and address the sustainability requirements of basic services. The ongoing Urban
Water Supply Project is targeting water reforms, the Education Project has contributed to
registering teachers and automating payments as well as preparing sector strategies, and the
Governance Capacity Enhancement Project focuses on the development of administrative and
financial management capacity in provincial governments. The Urban Development Project
(UDP), under preparation, will further focus on introducing performance elements in urban
management, which will support the maintenance of urban infrastructure overall.

                                              10
46.     The technical audit carried out in May 2012 covered six of the 18 Component A cities
(23 works contracts reviewed), and four of seven Component B cities (18 works contracts
reviewed). The audit confirmed the overall acceptable technical quality of works, with some
minor shortcomings on works in isolated areas due to the difficulties supplying sites (e.g.
some locks and toilet flushes of poor quality) and the small contract envelopes not always
attracting the most qualified firms.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
47.      The objectives remain highly relevant and reflect proper diagnosis of development
priorities. The project objectives and design were consistent with the 2004 TSS. Further, the
design was overall relevant to the situation prevailing at appraisal, and although parts of the
project were not implemented (Component C was scaled down and Component D was
dropped from the project, as it was implemented on other funds), the 2010 restructuring
ensured continued relevance of the project to the prevailing environment. Essential
infrastructures have been rehabilitated in the Southern and Western provinces, but demand
for infrastructures and service are still huge. Improving living conditions and economic
recovery continue to be relevant in a country where 70 percent of the population lives in
poverty. Some 9,000 kilometers of high priority earth roads are still closed to motorized
traffic and access to basic services such as water is among the lowest in Sub-Sahara Africa:
22 percent compared to 60 percent on average in Sub-Saharan African countries.

48.     The PDO remains relevant to DRC’s development needs, as the 2011-2015 PRSP
explicitly considers cities as anchors to the development of growth poles. The operation
further created the basic knowledge on implementing urban management tools and improving
access to services, which is feeding into preparation of the UDP. In terms of decentralization,
the PRSP aims to move the administration closer to the electorate and implement
mechanisms for increased public participation, which the proposed operation will also
support. This is endorsed by the latest draft CAS (2012-2015), which is derived from the
PRSP.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
49.     The PDO was to assist the government in improving living conditions by
strengthening the socio-economic situation in key urban centers and in two isolated areas.
This was clearly achieved, as the project directly benefited about 2.9 million people in the
targeted areas, as well as 12.5 million indirect beneficiaries in the affected provinces. The
detailed evaluation in the ICR is carried out along the lines of the two sub-PDOs and five
PDO indicators.

PDO(i)1: Improving delivery of basic services in provincial capitals and key medium urban centers
50.     Despite the very difficult implementation environment of the project, its impact is
visible on the ground and the indicators on access to services were achieved:

  (i)     32,688 additional pupils got access to education against a target of 20,000.
  (ii)    730,000 people got access to a basic package of health against 740,000 foreseen.
  (iii)   239,000 people got access to water against 70,000 targeted.
  (iv)    Further, 75,000 persons got access to latrines (not a project indicator).


                                                11
51.     This has resulted in increasing the number of pupils in rehabilitated schools by
between 17 and 114 percent and health centers have seen the number of consultations
increase substantially (by more than 200 percent in many cases) and assisted deliveries have
also increased. Thanks to the equipment provided by the project, many clinics are now able to
perform caesarian sections. The IT equipment provided to schools means that students now
have the possibility to use the internet in 6 urban centers. The markets constructed have
resulted in additional resources for the beneficiary cities. However, due to the “unicité de
caisse? principle, the money is deposited directly in the government accounts and not
necessarily returned to the city. On top of these results, an estimated 19,227 people live along
the urban roads rehabilitated in Matadi saw their revenues increase by an estimated 48
percent compared to the situation before the rehabilitation.

52.      The beneficiary satisfaction survey further confirms the adequacy of infrastructures
(see section 3.6). Component A sub-projects were selected with the participation of local
populations facilitated by BCECO, as confirmed by the independent technical audit. The
priorities identified for Component B prior to appraisal were reconfirmed by the city
authorities before implementation of works and recorded in city contracts. Although these
contracts were quite basic, they laid the groundwork for a contractual working relationship
between different layers of government, which has proven useful in other countries as a good
way to support a gradual decentralization process, and which has laid the groundwork for
new urban projects to take over where the ELCISP left off. They also succeeded in securing
continued engagement of city authorities in cases where administrators were replaced,
overcoming a problem other projects had encountered due to lack of continuity.

PDO (ii): Restoring key transport links to reconnect two isolated regions
53.     Despite the fact that the road component was closed following the project
restructuring due mainly to the poor performance of contractors, the reopening of roads in the
Kasai and Equateur Provinces contributed to facilitating the transportation of goods and
passengers. The PDO indicators were achieved:

   (i) Travel time was reduced from 60 to 3 hours along the rehabilitated parts of RN5, as
         foreseen. The travel time by truck to Gemena from both sides (by RN6 from either
         Akula or Zongo) has been reduced from about one week before to 1-2 days after the
         project. Average speeds for a truck reached 30km/h after the roads were rehabilitated,
         in line with design specifications.
   (ii) The share of the rural population in targeted areas with access to an all-season road
         increased by 22 percent, from no population having access.
   (iii) An estimated 1.9 million additional people who were secluded for several years now
         have better access to the rest of the country, as targeted (almost 400,000 for the RN5
         and 1.5 million for the RN6).
   (iv) Reduction of 50 to 57 percent in transport cost along the two roads, against 25 to 30
         percent targeted at appraisal.

54.     The Lubumbashi-Kasomeno-Kasenga section was previously not fully open to traffic,
but following rehabilitation, traffic now flows freely. On the Lubumbashi-Kasomeno section
(which was opened by the ELCISP) traffic increased from about 1,000 vehicles in July 2006
to 12,000 in July 2007 upon completion of the works funded by the World Bank. The
Kasomeno-Kasenga section was opened through works funded by the government. The
rehabilitation and opening of these roads laid the groundwork for sector projects, which are
more appropriate for longer term sustainability of investments. Private passenger transport

                                                 12
companies are now established in Kasenga, which is linked with Lubumbashi by a 3 hour
drive, whereas before the reopening of the road, it was necessary to pass through Zambia
during periods of the year. For the Lubumbashi-Kasomeno-Kasenga road it can be considered
that the objective has been achieved, with combined ELCISP and government own funds.
The beneficiary area, previously isolated, is now connected to the provincial capital. As an
indicator of economic impact, the socio-economic study carried out along the RN5 showed an
increase of 177 percent in household revenue due to increased agricultural production for
export.

55.    For the RN6, the city of Gemena (population of the city and the surrounding territory:
1.1 million inhabitants) was previously isolated with very difficult access from both sides
(Akula and Zongo). Special trucks were needed to bring fuel to the city from the main supply
port of Akula, until the project rehabilitated the most critical section, an 8 kilometer dike
through marshland around Akula. Travel time to reach Gemena from either side has been
reduced from a week to 1-2 days and transport cost has been cut in half to reach Gemena
from Akula, the main provision port. The PROROUTES will finance all initially foreseen
works for the RN6 to assure sustainability of investments.

3.3 Efficiency
56.     No economic analysis was carried out at appraisal due to the emergency nature of the
project. For the ICR, cost-benefit and unit-cost comparison were carried out for road
investments, unit-cost comparisons were used for classroom rehabilitation/construction and
water fountain construction, multi-criteria analysis was applied to the RN6, and operating
costs were considered. The full analysis, including assumptions, is presented in Annex 3.

57.     A cost-benefit analysis was carried out for RN5 (from Lubumbashi to Kasomeno,
financed by the ELCISP) and the urban roads in Matadi, based on “without? and “with?
project scenarios established through a socio-economic survey and traffic counting. The
analysis quantifies reduction to vehicle operating cost, value of time savings and economic
activity induced by the road rehabilitation. The results confirm that roads were profitable
from an economic point of view. The analysis covers 23 percent of project investment costs.

 Table 1: Result of economic analysis of road investments

58.    Unit cost comparisons for roads, classroom rehabilitation and water fountain
construction are presented in the table below and confirm the relatively satisfactory efficiency
of investments. The analysis covers US$42.8 million or 61 percent of total project
investments.

Rural road rehabilitation US$92,000 (*)     US$81,815     This is for roads implemented under

59.     Further, multi-criteria analysis on the RN6 (24 percent of investment cost) shows
there were no alternatives to the opening up of the road and that technical design was least-
cost. Finally, the operating cost of the UCoP, at 6 percent of total project cost, was quite
reasonable compared to the generally accepted norm of 5 percent, and given that field
supervision had to be carried out by plane due to the geographic circumstances of the
country.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.     The project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory overall, since the project did
succeed in achieving the PDO indicators and most of the intermediate indicators, with only
minor shortcomings. Achievement of PDO is rated satisfactory. Living conditions were
improved according to the indicator targets set at the first restructuring, with minor
adjustments during the second restructuring. Service delivery clearly improved (sub-PDO i),
and at a relatively satisfactory level of efficiency. The two regions were reconnected to the
rest of the country as foreseen (sub-PDO ii), and with satisfactory efficiency. The project
further remains highly relevant to current government and Bank priorities, but there were
minor design shortcomings, justifying a substantial relevance. The analysis of project
efficiency shows good results, with minor shortcomings on unit costs, in spite of the fact that
the project was an emergency operation and activities were not selected based on efficiency.
Efficiency is rated substantial.

61.      The fact that the full component program foreseen at appraisal was not implemented,
with cancellation of Components C (after 92 percent disbursement) and D (0 percent
disbursement) did not impact the overall result. Component C achieved the sub-PDO (ii) of
decreasing the transportation costs and restoring key transport links to reconnect two isolated
region, and albeit sustainability concerns, the areas remain open at project closing and the
PROROUTES project will consolidate the works and take over maintenance. Component D
would have contributed to institutional capacity building, but as an additional extra, not as
direct contribution to the PDO. Overall, the PDO was achieved as judged by the indicators
(and in spite of design shortcomings), the efficiency was substantial, but given that some
activities were dropped from the project, which would have contributed to better
sustainability and longer-term institutional impact, a “Moderately Satisfactory? rating is
warranted.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
62.      With ELCISP investments in targeted provinces, local populations have felt, for the
first time since the end of the conflict, the presence of the government, which is an important
factor in the reconstruction process. The project improved access to maternal and neonatal
care through the rehabilitation of health centers and hospitals. There was no system to keep
track of employment generation, but it is estimated that the project generated about 3.5
million man-days of work, based on 20 percent labor content of US$70 million investments
and daily salary of US$4.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
63.     One important contribution of the project at the government level is the development
of a solid national expertise in the areas of social and environmental assessment and analysis.

                                              14
Through ELCISP and other WB-funded projects, and thanks to continual training and
association of its staff in the Bank’s reviews and supervision activities, UCoP has become a
multi-disciplinary agency with remarkable expertise in implementing development projects
and in social and environmental safeguards assessment.

64.     It is important to underscore that the Office des Routes (public rural roads agency)
and the Office de Voirie et Drainage (OVD, public urban roads agency) had not done any
work during the fifteen years of conflict. By providing some basic equipment to these
agencies and associating their staff to road design and construction as well as works
supervision and environmental monitoring during the implementation of EESRSP and then
ELCISP, their capacity has been reinforced to manage similar investments in the future. OVD
is being retained for road design for the UDP under preparation. Municipal technical staff
further benefited from participating in project implementation in the beneficiary cities, not
least through the presence of outside expertise seconded by the implementing agencies.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
65.      The US$81 million invested by the project benefited 79 national enterprises through
the signature of 201 works and goods contracts amounting to US$70 million. Many of these
companies and suppliers are located in urban centers involved in the project and have
reinvested part of their profits locally. For works, even though the share of imported products
is still significant (equipment, cement, iron sheets, diesel, etc.), the use of local materials
(sand, gravel, wood, etc.) has enabled many local artisans to increase their income. Most
furniture supplied to schools and health centers are wooden (desks, tables, chairs, etc.) for
which raw materials and production were largely domestic and even local.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
66.      A beneficiary satisfaction survey was carried out and shows that all (100 percent)
beneficiaries find that the choice of infrastructures correspond to needs in their respective
communities. At closing, 87 percent of beneficiaries of health facilities find that services
delivered continue to respond to their expectations, while 13 percent mention overload of
facilities as a problem. 80 percent of beneficiaries find the quality of construction satisfactory
(with minor problems mentioned by 20 percent, principally for water, health, and sanitation).
85 percent of beneficiaries consider that such problems do not compromise the advantages of
the project but that it would be necessary to take them into account to improve results. See
the full details of the survey results in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

67.    At appraisal, sustainability was made part of the selection criteria for sub-projects,
and it was foreseen to include a provision for maintenance in all Component A, B, and C
contracts. This, however, did not happen, due to the cost overruns. In any case, the provision
would have been a temporary solution to overcome systemic shortcomings and would not
have supported sustainable maintenance of investments. The risks to the development
outcome derive primarily from: (i) the current overall political and economic situation in
DRC with the central government weakened due to recrudescent rebellion in the East, (ii)
lack of dedicated funds for maintenance of rehabilitated infrastructures, (iii) slow
improvement in institutional and community capacity, and (iv) uncertain direction of the
decentralization process.


                                               15
68.    It is likely that the RN6 investments under Component C will be sustainable as
completion of rehabilitation and regular maintenance of will be assured under the
PROROUTES in the medium term, but having the resources and ensuring the maintenance
will have to be monitored over time. The existence of a Road Maintenance Fund is not a
guarantee that maintenance works will be carried out on a regular basis, including for RN5.

69.     All infrastructures rehabilitated under the project are operational and have been
transferred to sector ministries or decentralized administration. The quality of works was
generally assessed as acceptable in technical audits. The beneficiary survey has shown that
the majority of infrastructures of Components A and B continue to operate several years after
having been rehabilitated and sustainability was part of selection criteria for sub-projects.

70.    In spite of some assurance that infrastructures and services will be maintained, the
macro-risks from continued fragility of the country, lack of funds and technical capacity are
reasons to conclude that risks should be rated as “High?.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

71.     The Bank delivered a strong and multifaceted response to the urgent rehabilitation and
reconstruction needs, building on emerging lessons from ongoing projects and incorporating
additional longer term sustainability considerations through a contractual approach. The
project was prepared in nine months as an emergency operation. The rationale for Bank
involvement was well-developed and the needs were well-identified, building on the
experience of the EESRSP. The institutional strengthening component was to complement
infrastructure rehabilitation, and was relevant as testified by the fact that activities were
implemented on other funding. However, the project design had some minor weaknesses
regarding especially: (i) the underestimation of rehabilitation costs of infrastructures, due to
unreliable data, the absence of technical studies, security concerns and difficult access to sites;
and (ii) the capacity of implementing agencies and delegated contract managers to mobilize.
These issues could not realistically be anticipated at the time of project design. The M&E
framework was developed and the lack of some specific indicators is also considered a minor
shortcoming, so overall the ICR maintains the QAG rating of “Satisfactory? Bank
performance.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.     Overall, the Bank provided good continuity both in team composition throughout the
implementation period and in regular interactions with the client, carrying out regular
supervision missions during the entire project implementation. The Borrower noted that the
change of Task Team Leader (TTL) in 2006 and other changes in the management team did
not noticeably impact institutional memory. On the contrary, the new TTL based in the region
close to the project provided continuous support to the client and helped move the project
forward in the very difficult post-conflict environment.




                                                16
73.     The Bank demonstrated the flexibility to work proactively with the government to
find solutions and responses to the requests made for project restructuring, extensions, and
reallocations during implementation. It took quite a long time to restructure the project
following the MTR, due to the need to assure that activities could be completed, even if not
in the context of the ELCISP. The restructuring substantially contributed to keeping the
project on track towards reaching the main targets as restructured, and achieving the PDO.
The flexible use of the whole Bank-funded project portfolio for DRC contributed to this
result as the Bank was also able to solve problems linked with environmental and social
safeguards, although the issue of medical waste remains. In addition to the implementation of
ELCISP, the Bank organized training sessions to strengthen UCoP’s capacity, particularly in
monitoring and evaluation and safeguards. The use of surveys to gauge the impact of the project
on beneficiaries has been an excellent development supported by the Bank. Overall, the
Bank’s focus on development impact, adequacy of supervision inputs and role in ensuring
adequate transition arrangements, with moderate shortcomings on supervision of fiduciary
and safeguard aspects (relating to medical waste) justify a “Moderately Satisfactory? rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.     The overall rating is justified by the satisfactory outcome rating and the fact that
active supervision and restructuring compensated for appraisal shortcomings on cost and
insufficient amounts of unallocated funds.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     The Government was actively involved in project preparation and agreed to use
existing project structures for the EESRSP (UCoP, BCECO, URMF) with autonomy in the
financial management and administrative capacities necessary for the proper execution of the
project, marking a commitment to efficiency. The government proactively requested (on
December 20, 2007) restructuring of the project to take place during the MTR to address
problems faced by Components C and D, and also financed rehabilitation of the Kasomeno-
Kasenga part of RN5 on its own funds. On the negative side, the project suffered from high
turnover of ministerial-designated focal points which occurred as a result of government
reshuffles. Also, the government has committed to reimbursing the ineligible expenditures
due to a non-valid contractor guarantee, although this has not happened by the time of ICR.
Office des Routes, a government agency, did not correctly estimate costs for rehabilitation of
roads, which turned out to be a major contributing factor to cost overruns and project
extensions.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Unité de Coordination des projets
76.     Satisfactory. Despite the difficult implementation environment, UCoP assured
completion of project activities. UCoP was able to limit its operating costs to 6 percent of
total project funds, quite reasonable compared to the 5 percent normally accepted, despite the
fact that all supervision had to be done by plane. UCoP also implemented ELCISP activities
without recruiting the additional staff foreseen at appraisal, albeit at a cost. Supervision
would have been done better by recruiting field officers. UCoP’s performance is a major

                                              17
contributing factor to the successful implementation of several Bank-funded emergency
projects. UCoP ensured that infrastructure investments were transferred to sector ministries or
decentralized administration as relevant. One case of ineligible expenditures (the void bank
guarantee) meant that financial management is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Despite these
issues, UCoP performed satisfactorily.

Bureau Central de Coordination
77.      Moderately Satisfactory. BCECO, acting as a procurement agent for all contracts for
Components A and C helped to achieve project objectives. The designation of a focal point
within BCECO to monitor ELCISP activities greatly facilitated the management of project
activities, although there were shortcomings related to delegated contract management for
Component A, works supervision and reporting on indicators. The work carried out for urban
rehabilitation was broadly satisfactory. BCECO could also have assured more regular site
visits from the main office, which could have contributed to better quality of works.

Urban Rehabilitation Management Firm
78.     Moderately Unsatisfactory. The URMF was slow to mobilize personnel, resulting in
slow start-up of activities under Component B. Contract management suffered from lack of
application of contractual clauses (in terms of payment and reimbursement of advances and
retention of guarantees). As with UCoP and BCECO, URMF could also have conducted
more regular site visits from the main office.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     The overall borrower performance rating is justified by the ability to implement the
project under extremely difficult circumstances, with all site supervision taking place by
planes with reduced timetables, which meant visiting one site could take up to a week, and at
a time when plane crashes were frequent (two BCECO staff who were travelling to a project
site actually died in a plane crash). There were minor to significant shortcomings noted on
both the government side and for all implementing agencies, but overall, the project was
implemented with a satisfactory result, which especially the increasing expertise of UCoP
contributed to.

6. Lessons Learned
80.    Design of an emergency project needs to balance many competing and sometimes
opposed objectives in an unpredictable environment with shortage of information, and
hence flexibility underpins success. The compressed preparation period does not always
allow to adequately balance quick wins and longer term impacts. The ELCISP struck a
somewhat successful balance by launching essential road works right after effectiveness
while developing a participatory approach to select sub-projects under sustainability criteria.
Scope is a related issue, and by targeting six provinces and 25 cities to maximize impact.
Likely cost overruns and delays mean that strong contingency planning can be a great
asset. Using scalable sub-project components is one way to achieve flexibility, leveraging
the overall portfolio is another way.

81.    Capacity constraints should be addressed up-front and from many angles. There
was a pervasive lack of capacity in the public administration in DRC at appraisal, and one
way to mitigate this was to use delegated contract management as a tool to deliver services
and infrastructure. The approach had advantages when dealing with remote sites, and can

                                              18
help extend the project’s operating radius, although it took time to get started under the
project. Prior training on monitoring of indicators to prospective delegated contract managers
would have mitigated some of the problems, and could have helped establish baselines earlier
in the project. A parallel training program for contractors on site organization and technical
aspects could have been useful to build capacity and potentially avoid some of the delays.

82.      Sustainability should be built in from the design phase, but addressed on an
ongoing basis. Transition to full regular operation will be difficult in a context where state
institutions have been absent or inoperative for longer periods of time. Delegated contract
managers were more capable of appraising sub-projects that existing state institutions, but
still had shortcomings. The project addressed sustainability of sub-projects by making clear
maintenance arrangements and responsibilities selection criteria, to be reviewed by UCoP,
and involving users in maintenance committees, but could not fully address financing of
operation and maintenance, especially for roads. Establishing links to sector operations as the
country gradually recovered from the conflict contributed to sustainability of ELCISP
outcomes.

83.     Restructuring should be pro-actively used to mitigate design shortcomings that
are likely to surface during implementation given appraisal difficulties, and to adapt to
changing circumstances. In the ELCISP, the M&E framework was first improved to
mitigate the shortage of data at appraisal, then kept in line with the subsequently restructured
components. The cost overruns were taken into account and the overall portfolio of Bank-
funded projects was used flexibly to transfer activities between projects with similar
emergency reconstruction objectives. Adaptive restructuring was used to keep sub-projects in
line with interventions of project in the water sector as the country emerged from conflict
status.

and IT equipment as well as limited transport equipment (motorcycles) to OVD to allow the
agency to carry out studies for urban roads.

Component C: Connectivity to isolated areas
(Appraisal/actual cost: US$32.00 million/US$29.95 million)

89.    The works carried out as follows:

90.     Equateur Province (RN6): Akula-Gemena-Mbari-Libenge-Zongo (390 km total). The
rehabilitation was split into two works contracts (Akula-Gemena-Mbari and Mbari-Libenge-
Zongo) won by different bidders.

       (i)     Clearance and earthworks on 242 km (62% of the total length) to reopen the
               road and treat hotspots.
       (ii)    Akula-Gemena-Mbari section (165 km): Reopening of 81 km corresponding
               to 48 percent but only surfacing on 1.5 km (70% executed by funding
               allocation).
       (iii)   On the Akula-Gemena section (115 km), 42 km of drainage works and 57 km
               of reshaping or surfacing (14.5% execution).
       (iv)    Mbari-Zongo (220 km): Opening on 102 km (53% executed by funding
               allocation).

91.    Additional financing for the PROROUTES will finance the remainder of both
sections plus a 5 year maintenance program.

92.   Kasai Province (RN5): Lubumbashi-Kasomeno-Kasenga (208 km total). One contract
was awarded for the entire Lubumbashi-Kasenga section.

       (i)     Lubumbashi-Kasomeno section (137 km) opened with base layers constructed.
               This laid the groundwork for the government financing the surfacing of the
               road in 2009, a minor investment compared to the total.
       (ii)    Government financed opening Kasomeno-Kasenga (71 km) and assured tar
               surfacing of Lubumbashi-Kasomeno on own funds (not counted as co-
               financing as co-financing was not part of the DGA).

93.     The component further funded office, topographic, and IT equipment as well as
limited transport equipment (motorcycles) to Office des Routes to allow the agency to
participate to supervising road rehabilitation for Component C.

Component D: Support to provincial institutions
(Appraisal/actual cost: US$7 million/US$0.01 million)

94.     The component did not complete any activities before it was closed during the June
26, 2010 restructuring. All activities foreseen were financed using government’s own funds
or by other donors.

Component E: Project management
(Appraisal/actual cost: US$3 million/US$5.03 million, including PPF reimbursement)

                                            23
95.   Component E did, as foreseen, finance all costs related to project management.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

96.     An economic analysis was not mandated at appraisal and was not carried out due to
the emergency nature of the project. However, several considerations were made to keep cost
down, and included: (i) priority to rehabilitation rather than construction of new infrastructure
would contribute to keeping cost down under Components A and B, and (ii) use of lower cost
technical solutions for Component C with specification of minimum level of services.
Selection of investments under Component A was to be based on local participatory
approaches, providing a measure of assurance that the most pressing needs would be
addressed.

97.     For the ICR, an ex-post cost-benefit analysis was carried out on the rural road
investments in Katanga Province (RN5, from Lubumbashi to Kasomeno, the section financed
by the ELCISP), and for the urban roads in Matadi as these investments lend themselves to
actual cost-benefit analysis. For the other major road-opening financed by the project (RN6 in
Equateur Province) as well as classroom rehabilitation and water fountain construction unit-
cost considerations are applied. The analysis is complemented by a multi-criteria analysis for
the RN6 and efficiency of project management arrangements.

Approach used for the economic analysis
98.     The road cost-benefit analysis considers scenarios “with? and “without? project to
determine net incremental costs and benefits of the RN5. This is based on traffic counting and
a socio-economic survey along the RN5 to determine the net incremental benefits accruing to
the population and the broader economy. On the basis of these scenarios, the net incremental
benefits and actual costs of investment programs were assessed. Cash flows are discounted
using a discount rate of 12 percent. Costs include capital costs, operation and maintenance
costs (2 percent of investment cost annually), and rehabilitation costs (10 percent of
investment cost every 5 years).

99.     Benefits of provision of urban services improved the quality of life of the poorest
residents of the targeted areas. The economic rates of return calculated for the project
understate some of these social and environmental benefits gained along the RN5 and in
Matadi. However, some of the following socio-economic quantifiable and non-quantifiable
benefits are included in the overall evaluation of project outcomes (see main text, Sections
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and 3.5 Overarching Themes, Other
Outcomes and Impacts).

   •   Improvement in the quality of life through improved physical living conditions and
       environmental management.
   •   Increased productivity and efficiency arising from reduced flooding and avoided flood
       damages to economic property.
   •   Increase in property value due to improved overall amenities.
   •   Enhanced investment climate due to improved service delivery.
   •   Improved health with reduction in waterborne disease and reduced medical costs.
   •   Enhanced local government capacity to fulfill their service delivery mandate.
   •   Reduction in accidents.
   •   Employment generation, market creation, promotion of increased private sector
       participation in the provision of services.
   •   By using labor-intensive construction techniques, the project created employment
       opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled labor.
                                               26
100. From a macro-economic perspective, by targeting isolated areas in DRC and
secondary and primary urban centers, the project had positive impacts linked to the
following:

   •   Economic growth: The project investments contributed directly to delivering
       economic growth, in particular through the provision of economic infrastructure
       (particularly roads).
   •   Employment generation: The project generated a considerable amount of short-term
       employment since labor (mainly unskilled labor) accounted for 20 percent of
       construction cost and 17 of total project costs, with US$14 million distributed in
       salaries to low-skilled laborers.

101. Given that interventions in rural and urban roads differ, as the access to services and
physical characteristics are not homogenous, an overall Economic Rate of Return and Net
Present Value are not calculated for the different road investments. However, the analysis
will show that the program overall is economically viable as the analysis of the two major
components have positive results.

Economic Analysis of Roads
102. A full economic analysis was performed on the RN5 and urban roads in Matadi. The
road investments have been assessed with an evaluation period limited to 15 years for the
RN5 and 20 years for urban roads. The ICR analysis is conservative as many benefits have
not been quantified (i.e. increase in property value, enhanced investment climate due to
improved service delivery, improved health with reduction in waterborne disease and reduced
medical costs, reduction in accidents).

103. Economic unit costs for vehicle operation were collected during an economic impact
evaluation study carried out for the project in October 2012. The survey also quantified
increases in household income compared to the before project situation, which were found to
be 177 percent along the RN5 (owing to increased agricultural production for sale) and 48
percent in the three neighborhoods in Matadi (from small-scale sales and services, including
transport). Figures are in constant 2012 prices, and this is set in relation to DRC revenue per
capita of US$190 in 2011. The beneficiary population is 19,227 in Matadi and 378,413 in the
catchment area of the RN5 (although only the population of 67,550 directly bordering the
RN5 is used in the analysis).

104. NVPs and IRRs are calculated based on actual investment costs for each road section,
traffic counting carried out in October 2012, time savings observed, and benefits accruing to
the wider economy from increase in household income. For the RN5, the opening of a quarry
was made possible by the reopening of the road, and the economic surplus of this activity is
also attributed to the project. Traffic along the RN5 is considered as almost exclusively
generated (as opposed to normal or diverted traffic).

105. All roads are economically justified, with Net Present Values (NPVs) of US$21.8
million and US$16.8 million for RN5 (Component C) and Matadi roads (Component B)
respectively and IRRs of 18 percent and 41 percent. The road investments analyzed amount
to US$15.9 million, corresponding to 23 percent of investment costs or 19 percent of total
project cost. Table 2 below summarizes the results compared to investments. The results for


                                              27
the Matadi roads are similar to results obtained for other urban road rehabilitation in the
region (e.g. IRR of 29 to 120 percent in Rwanda).

Unit cost considerations for RN6, water fountains and classrooms
106.    Unit cost comparisons confirm the relatively satisfactory efficiency of investments:
Road works under the ELCISP vary from US$57,391 to US$81,815 per kilometer against
US$92,000 per kilometer for the EESRSP. For works implemented under directly
comparable conditions, the cost is still substantially lower for the ELCSIP (US$81,815
against US$92,000). The average cost of constructing a water fountain under the Emergency
Urban and Social Rehabilitation Project was US$1,634 against US$2,500 for the ELCISP.
The former however operates in Kinshasa, where sites are easily accessible, so conditions are
not comparable, justifying a higher cost for the ELCISP. The average cost of rehabilitating a
classroom under the Emergency Urban and Social Rehabilitation Project was US$8,500
against US$12,127 for the ELCISP. The former however operated in Goma, where sites are
easily accessible, so conditions are not comparable, justifying a higher cost for the ELCISP.
The cost was lower than for the investments on government own funds, at US$16,000. Unit
cost comparison covers 61 percent of project investments (roads: 41 percent, schools: 14
percent, water fountains: 6 percent). Comparison was not made for health centers, hospitals,
protection against erosion, training centers, administrative buildings, etc. as these are
designed to individual standards and not comparable.

Multi-criteria analysis of the RN6
107. For the RN6 (US$16.9 million, 24 percent of investment cost), the above analysis is
complemented with a multi-criteria analysis of alternatives to achieve the objective and least-
cost option. Regarding alternatives, there were none. Prior to the conflict, the city had been
connected to the rest of the country, but due to the conflict, the road, including critical civil
works, had not been maintained and was in a very advanced state of degradation, which only
allowed passage of specially designed transport vehicles (equipment normally used in large-
scale mining operations) to get fuel to Gemena. In 2004, Gemena was isolated from the main
provision port of Akula, with the access form the secondary port of Zongo also being
extremely difficult. Opening up the existing road through rehabilitation of the most critical
sections was the only feasible way to get this area of the Equator Province reconnected to the
rest of the country to assure regular administrative oversight and provisioning of the area
along the RN6 (population 1,513,519, of which the city of Gemena and the surrounding
territory constitute 1,130,347 people).

108. The project assured that the least-cost option was used by launching a competitive
bidding process combined with tough negotiations with the bid winner to keep the contract
amount within the available envelope. This assured that the project would only finance the
most critical sections, while still attaining the objective of opening up the road to regular
traffic. Instead of rehabilitating the whole stretch Akula-Gemena-Zongo, the contractor was
asked to rehabilitate the dikes and drainage system along 8 kilometers in the area around

                                                  28
Akula and open up the critical section linking Gemena with Zongo, also mainly through
drainage works to allow transport. This way the project assured that Gemena would be
reconnected with the rest of the country, in line with the emergency nature of the project and
the PDO. The Akula-Zongo road remains open at the time of ICR, although further works are
needed to assure full sustainability and adequate maintenance. These are being implemented
under the Bank-funded PROROUTES project.

Operating cost
109. Despite the difficult implementation environment, UCoP assured completion of
project activities. UCoP was able to limit its operating costs to 6 percent of total project
funds, quite reasonable compared to the 5 percent normally accepted, despite the fact that all
supervision had to be done by plane. UCoP also implemented ELCISP activities without
recruiting the additional staff foreseen at appraisal.

Conclusion
110. The considerations foreseen at appraisal to keep cost down, including priority to
rehabilitation actually contributed to keeping cost down. Out of the total 523 classrooms
provided by the project, 423 were rehabilitated and 100 were new constructions. The
rehabilitation cost per classroom (US$12,127) compares favorably to the construction cost
(US$15,420). For Component C, the considerations were not fully respected in the design of
roads. As it turned out, the roads were designed to too high a standard, taking into
consideration the objective of opening up the isolated regions. This is demonstrated by the
fact that the roads as actually rehabilitated, which was to lower standards than in the initial
contracts, was sufficient to fulfill the objective of opening up the isolated areas, and thus the
actual implementation of the roads proved to be sufficiently cost-effective.

111. Overall, the cost-benefit analysis of 23 percent of investment cost shows satisfactory
rate of return, the unit-cost considerations of 61 percent of investment costs substantiates that
costs of ELCISP investments were contained within reasonable intervals, the multi-criteria
analysis (24 percent of investment cost) shows satisfactory results, and the operating cost was
quite reasonable given generally accepted norms for project implementation and the specific,
quite difficult, circumstances under which the ELCISP was implemented. The overall
conclusion is of a satisfactory rate of return, in spite of this not being an objective for an
emergency operation.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

112. The present Annex is a summary of the beneficiary satisfaction survey conducted in
June 2012 on a sample of the project activities and sites.

Scope and methodology
113. The survey was carried out by questionnaire 3 and beneficiary satisfaction was
assessed on parameters of relevance, expectations, changes induced, and sustainability.
Subjects were the beneficiaries, users, service providers and institutional beneficiaries of all
ELCISP components. The survey was conducted on 57 sub-projects out of 125, with a
representative sample of cities, sectors and components.

Survey Results

Relevance
114. The survey found that 95 percent of ELCISP activities answered problems identified
during participative consultations in the context of the PRSP. Furthermore, 100 percent of
beneficiaries acknowledged that the choice of ELCISP activities met the needs expressed in
their respective communities.

Expectations
115. Beneficiaries generally noticed in ELCISP advantages and opportunities that matched
their expectations, with 90 percent of beneficiaries responding that their expectations were
met at the time of project reception.

Changes induced
116. It was generally found that activities produced positive outcomes in the beneficiaries’
lives. In each sector of intervention, beneficiaries acknowledged and mentioned at least two
advantages or opportunities that show positive change caused by the project.

117. The beneficiary population expressed their relief in seeing their land and property
secured and even value-added through main sewer rehabilitation and the prevention of
erosion? anti-erosive fight.

118. Improvement in sanitation, living conditions and rehabilitation of beneficiaries’
dignity through public latrines is observed as compared to the situation before the project.

119. Beneficiaries of rehabilitated markets are sheltered from the elements and can remain
open for business in bad weather. The cleaning of market areas has been facilitated, and the
absence of mud, dust, direct sunshine and other discomfort was cited as benefits. Food
products are sold from clean stands, there is generally free passage in the markets with larger
flow of people and thereby an increase in clientele.

    And therefore is based on subjective perceptions and contains limited quantitative data.

                                                         32
120. Rehabilitated urban roads stopped isolation and facilitated access to formerly
inaccessible neighborhoods. Living conditions have been improved, with limitation of dust,
stagnant water and waste accumulation on roads.

121. Rehabilitated schools and health structures have a higher rate of visits due to the
improvement of service quality and working conditions. There has been an increase in
passing rates in all rehabilitated schools.

122. The study indicates that the range of perceived advantages is higher than expectations,
which is an indication that expectations have been over-met.

Sustainability
123. In 85 percent of cases the respondents confirmed that achievements continue to meet
the needs. However, the implementation quality was not as high as expected for some sub-
projects, as flaws can be observed on sanitation structures, on treatment of medical waste,
and the operation of some equipment.

124. Threats to the beneficiary satisfaction in the longer term are mostly related to
financial capacities to maintain infrastructures. For all sub-projects surveyed, income does
not cover operating expenses. Nearly 68 percent of structures do not have a maintenance
budget line, which explains that in case of deficit, maintenance is sacrificed.

125. Other threats on sustainability are related to over-demand on rehabilitated structures.
Rehabilitated health and school structures attract more users than their designed service
capacity for acceptable standards. Therefore, service providers may no longer meet demand
and the quality of services could become an adjustment parameter, especially as service
capacity is limited as compared to demand and as the rate of coverage of charges is low. Due
to this high demand, 13 percent of beneficiaries say that project results no longer meet their
expectations due to over-stretched capacity.

Related results: additional support

126. The beneficiary satisfaction survey further found that ELCISP facilitated and even
reinforced support from other actors on project achievements and that for some activities,
such support was essential for the reinforcement and sustainability of results. Especially the
education sector benefited from Bank-funded sector projects (Emergency Urban and Social
Rehabilitation Project, Emergency Project to Mitigate the Impact of the Financial Crisis,
Education Sector Project).

comments sent by UCoP to the Bank following a working session to discuss the draft Bank
ICR during the ICR mission, on November 15.

(a) Summary of government’s ICR

1. Introduction

129. The ELCISP was the object of Development Grant Agreement No. H 164 DRC in the
amount of SDR 53,890,000, signed on 28 June 2005 with IDA, approved by the Government
of the Democratic Republic of Congo Decree n ° 05/078 of September 9, 2005 and entered
into force on September 23, 2005. It was closed on 30 June 2012.

2. Context

130. At the time of the preparation of the Project, the government of national unity had
been in place since June 2003, in line with the Global and Inclusive Agreement of December
2002, and a favorable environment for economic and social reunification was created. The
government had implemented satisfactorily since 2001 an ambitious economic reform
program supported by the Bretton Woods Institutions through various instruments.

131. The significant results in the areas of political unification and economic reforms,
however, could not be sustainable if appropriate responses were not made to the emergency
social crisis raging across the country and particularly in cities which were home to over a
third of the population. Indeed, urbanization had accelerated during the crisis, and the
situation in the cities was mainly characterized by an economy in ruins and deteriorating
living conditions, particularly in terms of access to basic social services of adequate quality.

132. It is in the context that ELCISP was identified to assist the government in its
commitment to meet the challenges of the political transition, social consolidation and
economic recovery. The project was part of the actions to implement the strategy of the
World Bank in DRC. It was designed with a status of emergency project to extend to the
whole territory of the DRC activities undertaken and implemented successfully in the East in
the EESRSP and complete the Social Actions Support Project. The project was thus part of a
comprehensive response to social emergencies in large parts of the country (other than
Kinshasa) and preparing for future sector projects in the fields of education, health, transport,
energy and water.

3. Objectives of the project

133. The Grant Agreement defines the development objective of the project as "to assist
the DRC government to improve the living conditions of the population by strengthening the
socio-economic situation in key urban centers and in two isolated areas." To achieve this
development objective, the following specific objectives were identified: (i) facilitate the
recovery and access to basic social services in urban centers means (18 centers selected by
the Government and approved by the Bank were retained); (ii) stabilize and strengthen the
socio-economic development and contribute to the recovery of economic activity in the cities

                                               35
of Bandundu, Kananga, Lubumbashi, Matadi, Mbandaka, Mbuji Mayi and Kikwit; (iii)
rehabilitate and maintain the Lubumbashi-axis and the axis Kasenga-Zongo Akula for a total
length estimated at 600 kilometers to allow traffic and transportation of goods in
economically acceptable conditions; and (iv) support and strengthen key provincial
institutions through activities defined in the list of Priority Activities to Support Institutions.

4. Changes in objectives

134. The mid-term review was held from November 5 to 19, 2008 and resulted in a
revision of the results framework and the setting of new indicators for each part. The project
was then restructured in July 2010 and the Development Grant Agreement amended to: (i)
amend the wording of the specific objective of Part C by deleting the target total length of
600 kilometers of roads to deliver and maintain in adequate state; (ii) terminate Part C whose
financial implementation rate was 92 percent, but two of the three works contracts were
terminated due to the inability of firms to fulfill their contractual obligations; (iii) remove
from Part A a number of activities which had already been funded by the Government and the
Provinces included in other projects financed by the World Bank and other donors; (iv)
reallocate resources in favor of Parts A and B, to ensure better conditions for the realization
of development objectives; and (v) extend the closing date by one year from September 30,
2010 to September 30, 2011.

135. With the closing of Part C, the implementation of environmental safeguards (activities
for pygmies) was transferred to the PROROUTES which had more resources to implement
measures more meaningfully.

136. The Grant Agreement has been further amended as follows: (i) a second amendment
dated March 30, 2011 that on the one hand, integrates in Parts A and B of the project,
unfinished activities of EESRSP in the towns of Bukavu, Goma and Kindu of the same nature
as those of ELCISP and the unfinished RAP of RN2 and secondly, extend the closing date to
30 March 2012; and (ii) a third amendment occurred on February 22, 2012 extending the
closing date to June 30, 2012.

5. Project components and activities

The initial components and activities of the project were:

Part A: Support to medium urban centers

137. The component concerned selection, based on a multi-criteria analysis, of the 18
following centers, made by the Government and approved by the World Bank, in six
provinces outside Kinshasa and the three eastern provinces, at three per province: (i) Mbanza
Ngungu Luozi, Moanda (Bas-Congo Province); (ii) Inongo, Kenge, Bulungu (Bandundu
Province); (iii) Lisala, Ingenge, Bikoro (Equator Province); (iv) Tshikapa, Luiza, Mweka
(Western Kasai Province); (v) Mwene-Ditu, Kabeya-Kamwanga, Tshilenge (Eastern Kasai
Province); and (vi) Kasenga, Kamina, Kolwezi (Katanga Province). Every urban center was
granted with an initial budget of US$500,000 to fund activities within different categories of
equipment and basic social infrastructures (education, health, transport, sanitation, water
supply, markets, etc.). Priority activities should be identified in a participatory manner with
local government institutions, the private sector and civil society in each urban center. The


                                                36
implementation of activities approved by UCoP and the World Bank would then be captured
in a city contract signed by UCoP and the head of the city.

Part B: Support the chief towns of provinces

138. The component involved seven cities: Bandundu, Kananga, Lubumbashi, Matadi,
Mbandaka, Mbuji-Mayi, and Kikwit. These were the capitals of six provinces (plus Kikwit)
other than Kinshasa and the four eastern provinces which were already benefiting from the
EESRSP. Priority activities were identified during the preparation of the project with an
initial budget of US$3 million per city. They received the non-objection of IDA after
approval by the Inter-ministerial Steering Committee. They also focused on the different
types of equipment and basic social infrastructures (education, health, transport, sanitation,
water supply, markets, etc). Activities finally selected after coordinated review with local
authorities would then be captured in a city contract signed by the UMRF and the mayor.

Part C: Opening up remote areas

139. Two major roads were concerned: Lubumbashi-Kasenga (RN5/R35) in the Province
of Katanga and Akula-Zongo (RN6/R23) in Equateur Province, identified during project
preparation to open up two areas particularly isolated. Activities related to studies,
rehabilitation services and supervision.

Part D: Support to provincial institutions

140. The component involved seven provincial capitals: Bandundu, Bukavu, Kananga,
Kindu, Kisangani, Mbandaka, Mbuji-Mayi. Priority activities were identified during the
preparation of the project on the basis of defined budgets. They had received the non-
objection of IDA after approval by the ISC. They were: (i) rehabilitation of administrative
buildings, (ii) provision of furniture and miscellaneous equipment (office equipment, etc.) to
provincial institutions, (iii) training of staff of the provincial administration.

141. Changes in definitions of components and activities are taken into account in the
above-mentioned restructurings of the project.

6. Evaluation of objectives

142. Despite some weaknesses, the objectives were, in general, important for the country
and consistent with the socio-economic situation prevailing at the time of the preparation of
the project. Selected activities that aimed to improve access to basic social services
(education, health, transport infrastructure, etc.) perfectly matched the needs of communities,
expressed by the populations through participatory consultations conducted in 2004/2005 in
all territories in the context of the PRSP.

7. Objectives and outcomes that the project

143. The project results are very satisfactory. Generally, the objectives have been achieved
to a large extent. During the satisfaction survey conducted in July 2012, based on surveys of
beneficiaries of a sample of 57 realizations of 123 (46.3 percent) in 12 of the 25 centers
involved (48 percent) people surveyed all responded that the activities financed by the


                                               37
ELCISP correspond to needs felt in the community and 95 percent of the activities address
the problems identified during participatory consultations conducted as part of the PRSP.

144. The following table summarizes the performance indicators of the development
objectives of the project.

145. Indirect beneficiaries are estimated at 12,500,000 persons (of which 52 percent
female).

Achievement of the objective of Part A is rated very satisfactory
146. Investments funded under Part A of the project really helped restore and increase
access to basic social services (education, health, drinking water, etc.) in the 18 medium
urban centers targeted. The primary effects of the achievements of Part A are already being
felt in some urban centers where compared to situation before the project: (i) the number of
schools rehabilitated rose sharply (17 to 114 percent growth rate); (ii) consultations in the
health centers have greatly increased (over 200 percent in many centers) as well as assisted
deliveries. Medical procedures such as caesarean sections are now performed; (iii) computer
courses are given at a larger scale in six urban centers where certain schools have been
equipped with computer rooms.

Achieving the objective of Part B is less satisfactory
147. As for Part A, access to social services has been improved in general in the cities
concerned and achievements begin to have very positive effects, but nothing suggests that
achievements have really helped stabilize and boost economic activity.

Achieving the objective of Part C is moderately satisfactory
148. None of the two axes targeted was fully rehabilitated. The axis Lubumbashi-
Kasomeno-Kasenga was rehabilitated up to 62 percent (137 of 220 kilometers) stretch of the

 Does not include the additional beneficiaries in Kikwit, Mbandaka and Bandundu, where the ELCISP funded
expansion of the water network and installation of water points, activity taken over from the EESRSP.

                                                   38
Lubumbashi-Kasomeno axis, which was fully surfaced in 2009. ELCISP investments have
helped open up the area. Although the Kasomeno-Kasenga section is still in earth, private
companies currently provide a regular passenger transport service by bus between Kasenga
and Lubumbashi. On the other hand, the Akula-Gemena-Zongo axis was partially opened
with draining along marsh areas for 42 kilometers (4 percent) of the length, with limited
practicability for almost hundred kilometers.

8. Main factors affecting the project

149. The most significant factors were independent of the government, UCoP and
delegated contract managers. These included: (i) the isolation of some urban centers, which
did not facilitate participatory identification of Part A activities, and disrupted the supply of
work sites with materials; (ii) recurrent shortages of construction materials in some urban
centers; (iii) weak technical and financial capacity of companies and the lack of support of
the banking sector, which remains fragile; (iv) difficulties in recruiting some project
personnel, due to a limited supply of qualified candidates; (v) the splitting of roadwork bids
into a firm tranche financed by the project and a conditional unfunded tranche has been a
source of complication for the procurement and implementation of Part C.

9. Sustainability of results

150. Conditions for sustainability investments and services are not yet met. The schools
and health facilities do not collect sufficient resources to cover their expenses, and receive
little public financial support. Sustainability of road and water supply investments depends on
the sustainable capacity of the OVD, the Office des routes and REGIDESO 5.

10. Performance of the World Bank

151. The World Bank’s performance is highly satisfactory for identification and
preparation and satisfactory for supervision of implementation. The Bank conducted regular
supervision missions supported by field visits. The Bank was sensitive to the problems that
arose during the project and worked positively to solve them, the project manager has
changed once, which is an important factor of continuity. The Bank has, however, its share of
responsibility for the delays that have marked the selection of the URMF and the primary
contractors responsible for monitoring road works, as well as the attribution of some
contracts.

152. Only a few weeks before the end of the project, the Bank informed the Government
that its procedures did not allow it to finance the RAP of RN2. It has not been possible in the
short time remaining before the closing to affect allocations to the RAP to other activities.
Thus, a total of nearly a million dollars could not be committed before closing.

11. Government performance

153. The government performance is highly satisfactory for both the identification and
preparation and for implementation. The Inter-ministerial Steering Committee has fulfilled its

                                                         39
tasks efficiently to select urban centers for Part A and approval of priority programs for
targeted cities of Part B of the project, and the provincial capitals targeted by Part D. The
Government has completed before the deadline, the effectiveness conditions of the Grant
Agreement. The Government has further committed financing of the RN2 RAP transferred to
ELCISP after closing of the EESRSP, to supplement the Bank's procedures which no longer
allow cash payment of resettlement activities. The Government further agreed with the Bank
on a process to reimburse ineligible expenditures.

12. Performance of the Coordination Unit and public institutions

154. Performance is satisfactory. UCoP has been heavily involved in the identification and
preparation of ELCISP, while the execution of EESRSP had started. FMRs and financial
audits were submitted to the Bank within the time prescribed by the Development Grant
Agreement and are satisfactory. Studies on environmental safeguards have been carried out,
validated and published before the deadline prescribed. With the exception of the Office des
Routes, performance of public institutions involved in the project (including REGIDESO and
OVD) are moderately satisfactory.

13. Performance delegated contract managers

155. Performance is moderately satisfactory. With the exception of some unfinished works
for Part B, the DCMs successfully implemented all investments for which management was
delegated to them. The technical audit, however, identified the main weaknesses: (i) poor
quality of studies in general, which had among other consequences the need for numerous
amendments to works contracts; (ii) the insufficient quality of the bid evaluation reports with
resulting extended time to procure of works and consultants; (iii) inadequate monitoring of
environmental and social aspects during construction; (iv) the lack of attention to monitoring
and evaluation of projects.

14. Performance of contractors, suppliers and consultants

156. Performance is moderately satisfactory. Many works have been carried out with
significant delays. In some very critical cases, delay penalties have been applied and
contracts terminated. In general, companies have had difficulties to fulfill their contractual
obligations due to weak technical and financial capacity.

157. Regarding furniture for schools and health centers, the quality is in some cases
considered insufficient in the technical audit report on achievements of parts A and B,
conducted in May 2012.

158. In general, the quality of consultant studies is not satisfactory. Many amendments
have been made to amend contracts for additional or omitted or omitted. Consultants
responsible for works supervision have not followed sites sufficiently close.

15. The most significant positive lessons

159. The participatory process of identifying priority activities allowed for a strong
community involvement.



                                              40
160. Formalizing support to cities and municipalities in a contract with the signing of
contracts city contracts has contributed to enhancing the functions of mayors and chiefs of the
urban centers concerned, who felt very involved in the project and gave great attention to
works implementation and reception. It is thanks to the contractual approach that many works
sites have been secured and made readily available to contractors, thus avoiding delays in
starting work.

161. Communication on the identification and implementation of activities in French and
local languages, through local media, helped to strengthen the process of transparency, which
was one of the basic principles of project.

16. The most significant negative lessons

162. Delegated contract management is a quite specific job which remains underdeveloped
at the international level, not to be confused with project management. This is not always an
option that ensures greater efficiency in the implementation of projects.

163. Particular emphasis was placed on a quick pace of investment, while detailed studies
are necessary to avoid inaccuracies and unforeseen work that required the execution of many
riders.

(b) Translation into English of comments on draft ICR sent by the UCoP

164. Overall, the ICR could mention, the fact that the damage following the conflict had
touched everyone, beyond the areas covered by the EESRSP, making the ELCISP necessary
to reach populations not covered by other projects. Moreover, the cities of Lubumbashi and
Gemena remained isolated.

165. The completion report of the World Bank could also put more emphasis on the
improvements made to the EESRSP concept for mounting ELCISP, including the
introduction of engineers to support secondary cities and the use of city contracts. These last
two have demonstrated their usefulness in terms of projects ownership by beneficiaries, site
reservation, continuity of government commitment, and sustainability of investments.

166. In section 2.2 regarding the implementation of the project, it is important to put an
emphasis on the difficulties the innovative delegated contract management approach
proposed to BCECO for the URMF, partly due to the fact that these agencies had limited
experience in site supervision and monitoring of project indicators. Many investment projects
proposed by the delegated contract managers did not adequately ensure sustainability and
UCoP was obliged to reject these proposals.

167. On post-completion operation (section 2.5) technical audit deficiencies reported some
minor work deficiencies (locks, flush, etc....). It would be useful to mention that the project
was subject to conditions that do not favor the supply of quality products, the amounts of
contracts were often not incentives to attract the best contractors, but despite this the quality
of work is considered satisfactory.

168. Regarding the results of Component C, they were achieved at the time of completion
of work judging from the speed and cost of transport, although concerns remain about the


                                               41
sustainability of investments. Fortunately, this issue is taken into account by the
PROROUTES project.

169. In the section on institutional changes UCOP suggests the report mentions that the
staff of the Office de Voirie and OVD were trained on the job by being associated with
supervision tasks and the development of specifications. Both structures have also received
equipment essential to their mission.

170. UCOP in general agrees with the lessons learned as presented in the completion report
of the Bank. It would be useful to qualify the usefulness of delegated contract managers with
a comment on the difficulties in starting up and the training necessary to achieve cruising
speed for both agencies. The lesson on city contracts could incorporate the comments made
above.
