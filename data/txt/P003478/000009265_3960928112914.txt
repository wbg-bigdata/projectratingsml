MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 92.9 MILLION
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A KEY STUDIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The fo?lowing memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 92.9 million
(US$131.2 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
project would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and would
help finance a key studies development project. The project is expected to
be cofinanced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with a
grant of US$1.6 million.
2.        Background.  Racognizing the importance of science and
technology (S&T) to economic development, and the concomitant requirement
to strengthen the pool of skilled S&T personnel, China in ;985 issued a
decision on Reform of the Science and Technology Management System, which
calls for vigorously promoting technology development; redoubling efforts
in applied research; ensuring steady, continuous progress in basic
research; strengthening programs to train scientific researchers; and
reforming S&T personnel administration. The decision grants increased
decision-making power and financial responsibility to research units and
their directors; announces the formation of Science Foundations to support
basic and some applied research and the awarding of research, grants through
peer review; advocates promoting S&T personnel on the basis of performance;
encourages labor mobility of scientists and engineers; and strengthens
links between researchers and production units. In short, the decision
lays the groundwork for a reformed and revitalized S&T sector in China,
thus providing a strong base for the research-to-technology-to-production
continuum necessary for accelerated economic growth.
3.        In the early 1980s the State Planning Commission initiated the
State Key Laboratories (SKL) program, which concentrates scarce resources
on existing laboratories affiliated with universities and institutes of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) that: (a) work on priority specialties of
economic and social relevance; (b) excel in research output, staff and
facilities; (c) demonstrate links with industry; (d) play a significant
role in educating graduate students; and (e) as open laboratories, provide
opportunities for Chinese researchers from other labs as well as foreign
researchers to work collaboratively on projects of national and
international importance. China has now begun to bring to bear on SKLs the
directives announced in the 1985 decision, a process which is the central
focus of the proposed project.
4.        Rationale for IBRD/IDA Involvement.  The changing economy of
China requires a corresponding strengthening in the country's science and
technology capacity. The proposed project contributes towards this
purpose. A key to this effort is strengthening the institutional
mechanisms through which scientific research and training of future
scientists are conducted. The Bank has been involved in projects in such
countries as China, Brazil and Korea, assisting governments in improving



- 2 -
their higher education subsectors, :n particular the science and
engineering disciplines. This is particularly the case in China where the
proposed project would continue the support for development in science
education begun under several previous projects. More than half of the
laboratories to be strengthened by the present project are in universities
that were earlier recipients of support through two Bank/IDA-financed
higher education projects. There are now large ntumbers of Chinese science
and engineering graduates who are well qualified to undertake postgraduate
education, and significant numbers of young PhDs trained overseas, ready to
propel scientific R&D in China to a worldwide level.
5.        Project Objectives:  The objectives of the project are: (i) to
improve the output of scientific researchers trained to international
standards through master, doctoral and post-doctoral programs; (ii) to
enhance the quality and productivity of research in selected areas relevant
to long-term economic and social development; (iii) to strengthen the
management of scientific research at both the national and laboratory
level; (iv) to provide a modern scientific infrastructure for scientists
trained at home and abroad; and (v) to encourage scientific cooperation
across institutional and national boundaries.
6.        Project Description:  To achieve its objectives, the project
would support the following components:
(a) Research and Training in State Key Laboratories (,KL) and
Special Laboratories (SL).
(i) Establishment or expansion of about 133 SKLs and SLs, all
with appropriate management structures and equipment.
(ii) Provision of facilities, equipment, books and educational
materials, training and specialist services and funding for
other direct costs of research and graduate education to
SKLs and SLs.
(b) Pilot Laboratory Management Program.
(i)  Provision of support to seven SKLs and SLs in undertaking
experimental initiatives in the management and
administration of scientific research and graduate
education, including technology transfer, internal and
external communications, personnel management as well as
financial and laboratory safety management.
(ii) Provision of technical assistance and training by means of
workshops, study tours, specialist services and equipment
for laboratory management.
(c)  National Scientific Computer and Network Facility NCFC).
Establishment of a national educational and scientific computer
center located at Zhongguancun, Beijing, and a network facility



- 3 -
equipped with a communications system linking said center to CAS
institutes, Qinghua and Beijing Universities.
(d) rrogram Advisory Mechanism. Provision of assistance in Project
advisory activities through support to a Project Advisory Group
and other technical assistance.
7.        The proposed project would be carried out over five years.  The
total project cost is estimated at US$238.5 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchan:ge cumponent of US$132.8 million (56%). A breakdown of costs
and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  There is a provision for
retroaccive financing. Amounts and methods of procurement and a
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map (IBRD No. 21935) showing
the location of project laboratories is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, dated January 29, 1991, is being distributed separately.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following:
(a) proceeds of the credit would be made available to project laboratories
through the State Education Commission (SEdC) or CAS on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Association; (b) the availability of
research funds would be monitored throughout the life of the project and,
in the case of shortfalls, the causes would be identified and remedied by
the implementing agencies; (c) the Foreign Investment Loan Office of SEdC
and the External Financing Office of CAS will be designated and maintained
as the project implementation units throughout project implementation;
(d) the PAG will be established and ma:ntained throughout project
implementation according to selection procedures and terms of reference
agreed with the Association; (e) a mid-term review of implementation
progress will be conducted in mid-1993 with representatives of the
Association, UNDP, SPC, SEdC, CAS, NSFC, PAG and NCFC; and (f) an annual
audit report, including separate opinions on the SOEs, will be furnished to
the Association within eight months of the end of each fiscal year.
9.        Benefits.  By the end of the project completion in 1995, it is
expected that: (a) the physical infrastructure of 133 major scientific
laboratories around China will have been significantly upgraded through thp
acquisition of state-of-the-art scientific equipment, updated lib,aries and
other infrastructure improvements; (b) practical low-cost approaches to the
improvement of research management and laboratory administrition will have
been developed and tested in seven key laboratories and a significant start
made in introducing similar measures in other SKL and SI laboratories;
(c) an advanced scientific computing facility will be functioning and a
prototype computer network will connect leading scientific research centers
in Beijing, providing greatly enhanced computational capacity and expanded
opportunities for cooperative research and exchange of data among the three
institutions; and (d) a large number of Chinese scientists will have been
provided with additional education and research experience in China and
abroad, and international contacts will have expanded through study tours
and international exchange programs. The beneficiaries of the project will



- 4 -
be Chinese science students and researchers at the masters, doctoral and
post-doctoral levels, who will be provided with the necessary inputs to
utilize their talents fully and upgrade the quality of their research. The
research laboratories included in the project will benefit through better
equipment and better managed research programs.
10.       Risks.  The project faces two risks.  First, difficulties ir.
managing the project may arise, given its complexity. The project includes
a large number of laboratories which conduct research in many diverse
fields, and several different implementing agencies. However, this risk
can be mitigated by means of strong leadership and coordination, which the
Government recognizes and has agreed to furnish. Staffing and structure of
the major implementing agencies have been greed and a project steering
co;nmittee has been appointed to provide oversight. The second risk arises
because the competitive mechanisms that will be used to allocate research
funds to individu-Al laboratories is newly established, and may not function
as expected to provide sufficient research funds to project laboratories.
This risk would be mitigated by the project's proposed improvement of the
mechanism for monitoring the availability of research funds, and by the
agreement of the Government to take appropriate action when necessary.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asscciation and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed ced&.t.
