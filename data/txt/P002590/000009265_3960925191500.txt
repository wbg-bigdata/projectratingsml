THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDITS 1451-SU AND SF 11-SU)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Third Education
Project in Democratic Republic of Sudan, for which IDA Credits 1451-SU and
SF 11-SU in the amounts of US$10 million (SDR 9.6 million equivalent) and
US$5.4 million (SDR 5.2 million equivalent), respectively, were approved on
March 20, 1984.  The Credits were closed on schedule, on June 30, 1988,
although disbursements continued until December 31, 1988, at which time a
balance of US$150,000 was cancelled.
This PCR is based on a UNESCO report which has been finalized by
the Population and Human Resources Operations Division, Eastern Africa
Department of the Africa Regional Office. This PCR reflects, inter alia, (i)
the findings of the UNSECO project completion mission to Sudan during
November 1-15, 1988; (ii) discussion with IDA staff knowledgeable about the
project; and (iii) data from project files at Bank headquarters in
Washington.
In February 1989, the Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III of the
draft PCR with a request to prepare Part II. A reply has not been received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDITS 1451-SD AND SF 11-SU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction. Obiectives and Components
i.      Drawing from the implementation experience gained during the two
previous IDA-assisted education projects, the Third Education Project (Credits
1451-SU and SF 11-SU 1/) concentrated on rehabilitation of existing
institutions in order to address the country's most pressing needs for trained
manpower and for improving its primary and adult education system in rural
areas. The Credit, while providing mostly equipment, technical assistance,
and fellowships, de-emphasized civil works which had been problematic in the
two earlier projects.
ii.     The Project was prepared by a Unesco mission in 1982 under the
auspices of the UnescolWorld Bank Cooperative Program. Appraisal took place
in May 1983. The Credit Agreement, equivalent to US$15.4 million, was signed
in April 1984 and became effective in January 1985.
iii.    The Project comprised the following components:
(a) Rehabilitation and extension of the workshops of Khartoum
Polytechnic's College of Engineering and six Vocational
Training Centers (VTCs), through provision of equipment,
textbooks, and curriculum/program development.
(b) Provision of about 369 man-months of specialist services and
39 =an-months of fellowships to assist in the above and for
institutional support to: (i) two teacher training
institutions (TTIs); (ii) the Labor Department of the
Ministry of Labor (MOL); (iii) the Department of Planning of
the Ministry of Education and Guidance (MOE); aid (iv) a pre-
investment study to review and evaluate the operations of 15
Higher Technical Secondary Schools (HTSSs) and the eight
Vocational Artisan Training Centers (VATCs).
I/ SF 11-SU is a Special Fund Credit.

.mDlementation Experience
iv.     On the whole and taking into consideration difficult country
conditions, implementation of the Project within time and credit allocations
was a remarkable achievement, attributable to the combined factors of:
competence and continuity in project direction on the part of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU); and professional assistance provided by ILO in the
procurement of equipment and in training through a team of international
technical specialists.
v.      Certain aspects of the Project were not fully implemented, for
example, those components located in the south of the country. Other changes
during the implementation phase related to the Government's inability to
finance certain components. These were subsequently financed using the
favorable exchange rate movements between the SDR and the US dollar.
vi.          With equipment representing 70 percent and technical assistance
20 percent of the proceeds of the Credit, implementation was clearly focussed
on equipment delivery and training. The modest construction program planned at
appraisal was further reduced during implementation to the point of providing
mostly marginal rehabilitation and improvement of physical facilities.
vii.    By the end of the Project, all equipment procured in five distinct
phases were delivered and installed, and the technical assistance program
provided 404 man-months of specialist services and 52 man-months of
fellowships. ILO played a major role in meeting the objectives of the Project
by procuring equipment and providing technical assistance.
viii.     The total cost of the Project was US$18.25 million or US$0.4
million below appraisal estimates, including contingencies. Through the
provision of credit funds in SDRs and the gradual erosion of the US Dollar,
the Project benefited from approximately US$2.4 million equivalent in
additional funds due to the appreciation of the SDR. These funds were used to
increase the number of HTSSs and VATCs receiving equipment.
ix.     In retrospect, the Project appears to have been carefully and
realistically formulated. At appraisal, project components for the most part
were well defined and prepared, providing the framework for successful
implementation. While a few improvements in the appraisal and working
documents could have been made, these are minor when viewed against the
achievements of the Project in its entirety.
x.      During implementation, the performance of IDA, through regular
supervision as well as assistance from the disbursement section in Nairobi,
proved to be flexible and responsive, and a close working relationship was
established with the Borrower.



_ iv -
Results
xi.     The Project has, by and large, achieved its objectives in that: (1)
Khartoum Polytechnic surpassed its enrollment target and attained a desirable
level of studentsteacher ratio; (ii) the enrollment forecast for the six VTCs
has been surpassed by the five VTCs which benefited from the Project and
practical training was in evidence; (iii) the Status Studies of HTSS and VATC
resulted in seven instead of the two originally planned pilot schools; and,
(iv)    the Vocational Training Administration (VTA) has been established and
target sections of MOE and MOL strengthened.
Sustainabilitv
xii.    Sustainability of project benefits depends both on adequate funds to
cover the operational expenditures of project institutions and on satisfactory
continuing enrollments. Issues of sustainability of this Project must be
viewed in an environment of substantial migration to the Gulf States. The
emigration of tra'-ned manpower clearly undermines the benefits of such a
project.
Findints and Lessons
xiii.   Lessons of earlier projects have been reinforced by the Third
Education Project, in terms of minimizing demands for recurrent expenditure
and rehabilitating existing facilities rather than investing in new ones. In
addition, this project points up:
(i)      the need to insure more effective intra-agency
coordination by spelling out the duties and terms
of reference of agency representatives in the
lending documents;
(ii)      the need to insure that facilities are provided
that are adequate and appropriate to the equipment;
and
(iii)     the need to insure that equipment delivery and
technical assistance aspects are synchronized to
maximize the effectiveness of both.

2. Backgru
2.1 Sector Develooment Obiectives
In 1977 the Government formulated an ambitious long-term policy and
development strategy for the education sector. In this, extending
opportunities in basic general education was given top priority, together with
the universalization of primary education (UPE) in 15 years. Eventually
limiting access to lower secondary to not more than 25 percent of primary
school leavers was another long-term objective. At the upper secondary level,
admission was to be limited to 50 percent of lower secondary leavers. This
group would be divided equally between academic and technical/vocational
streams, implying a significant increase in the proportion of enrollments in
Higher Technical Secondary Schools (HTSS), especially those for industrial
technical education, from the current share of 10 percent. By alleviating
shortages of technically trained manpower, the education sector would be
supportive of the broader Economic Recovery Program (ERP) launched in 1983.
In line with the ERP, it was crucial that meeting education sector objectives
did not generate nev budget outlays. As a consequence, it was imperative for
the sector to make o?timal use of facilities that already existed.
2.2 Policy Context
The most immediate problem facing Sudan at the time of appraisal was
the critical balance of payments situation. The crisis was largely the
consequence of inadequate economic policies and management, further compounded
by external factors, notably the sharp increase in petroleum prices.   At the
same time, export earnings declined by nearly 50 percent between 1972/73 and
1981/82 because of falling yields and a shift from cotton to other crops. The
Government initially tried to sustain development efforts by external
borrowing and drawing down reserves. By 1983 it had adopted an economic



- 2 -
recovery program which focussed on alleviating the balance of payments
situation through import substitution and rehabilitation of the export sector.
2.3 Linkages between Project. Segtor. and Macro-policy Obiectiveas
The principal thrust of the Bank's strategy for Sudan was to improve
the country's balance of payments situation through rehabilitation of existing
capital investments, increasirg resource mobilization, and preparing the way
for longer term r...velopment activities. That strategy identified shortages of
trained manpower as a serious constraint, and consequently included human
resources development as a necessary part of a longer process to redress the
shortage. The institutions selected for the Project were in the field of
engineering and technician training and in _.he vocational training of skilled
workers. At the same time, the country's serious financial constraints
required that education projects be relatively modest in size and support
recurrent expenditures. Reduction of investment expenditures was also an
important consideration. The Project was consistent with and supportive of
that strategy.
3. F:oiect Objectives and DescriDtion
3.1 Project Objectives
The objectives of the Project were to:
(a) assist in rieeting the country's most pressing needs for
trained mautpower by: (i) increasing output and improving
quality of vocational and post-secondary training
institutions; (ii) expanding the training of technical
instructors; and (iii) improving education management and
strengthening education planning.
(b) improve primary and adult education in rural areas by
assisting new programs and teacher training.
3.2 Project Comoronents
The project components, as recommended by the appraisal mission and
agreed upon by the Government were as follows:
(a) rehabilitation and strengthening of Khartoum Polytechnic
(enrollment increase of 700 eay students) including teacher
training for the technical education sector (civil works,
training, equipment, technical assistance);



. 3 -
(b) rehabilitation and expansion of six Vocational Training
Centers (VTCs) increasing enrollment gradually from 3,000 to
about 7,000 in various trades (civil works, training,
equipment, vehicles, technical assistance);
(c) assistance tv Bakht-er-Ruda and Haridi Teacher Training
Institutes for the Integrated Rural Education Centers (IREC)
program (vehicles, training, technical assistance);
(d) support to the Department of Labor, Khartoum for the VTC
program (vehicles, training, technical assistance);
(e) support to the Department of Labor, Juba for the VTC program
(vehicles, training, technical assistance);
(f) assistance to the Department of Planning, Ministry of
Education and Guidance (fellowships, equipment);
(g) pre-investment study to review the Higher Technical Seconda-,
School (HTSS) system and the Vocational Artisan Training
Centers (VATCs) including funds for initial implementation of
study recommendations (equipment, technical assistance);
(h)  support project administration by strengthening the Project
_mplementation Unit (PIU) in the Ministry of Education
(equipment, technical assistance).
4. Proiect Design and Organization
4.1 Project DesigM
A first attempt to formulate a third education project was undertaken
in 1976. The main policy objectives then were similar to those of the project
eventually appraised, but huge differences existed with regard to scope and
geographical spread (see Annex 1). The project as proposed would have covered
a wide geographical area and divergent educational activities. These
features, coupled with implementation difficulties experienced with the first
two education projects, resulted in a cautious approach on the part of the
Bank. The Bank proposed to the Government to postpone further processing of
the project. With the accent an rehabilitation of existing institutions,
reformulation of the project proceeded in February 1982. Preparation was
carried out between November 1982 and February 1983. The Project was
appraised in May 1983 and received Board approval in March 1984.



- 4 -
The project working papers contained details about a small and
scattered civil works program, but assumptions were made that the expenditures
needed for the installation and reorganization of workshops and labs would be
covered by institutional budgets. This proved to be incorrect because of the
very limited operating budgets of the VTCs as well as that of the Polytechnic,
with the result that some machines were not installed and an entire facility
(the welding shop at the Polytechnic) was not built. In some cases, the
necessary costs were covered by Credit proceeds from exchange rate movements.
4.2 Project Ciganization
The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) In the Ministry of Education
which had been established to implement the two previous education projects
was responsible for administration and financial control, including
coordination with the various ministries and departments, and liaison with the
Bank Group. The Project Director had by the time of the Third Education
Project acquired much valuable experience and his continued presence
throughout the Project was one of the key factors in its successful
implementation.
Despite timely nominations of representativos from the Ministries and
Departments involved in the Project, coordination between the PIU and those
identified was not very effective because of frequent changes in key people, a
lack of clear terms of reference of duties and the fact that these tasks were
assigned in addition to normal duties.
5. Project Implementation
The Project was implemented according to the schedule established at
appraisal, namely over a four year period from January 23, 1985 to the Closing
Date on June 30, 1988, plus an additional six month period to December 31,
1988 for final disbursements of Credit expenditures. This achievement,
despite adverse conditions, can be attributed to several factors: (i)
administrative continuity; (ii) a realistic assessment at appraisal to
minimize civil works; and (iii) reliance on an international agency--the
International Labor Organization (ILD)--to provide under one umbrella a high
caliber technical assistance team, insure all aspects of equipment procurement
and delivery, and provide support logistics where necessary.
5.1 Variances between designed and imnlemented proiect
Despite the timely completion of the Project, several changes were
made during its implementation. These are presented in Table 1. In several
instances, changes were made necessary by the worsening situation in the south
of the country which resulted in a breakdown of communications and the
imposition of travel restrictions. Such alterations were not foreseeable



during appraisal. Other changes arose from omission Jr lack of clarity during
project design, and thus pctentially could have been avoided.  Nevertheless,
the Bank and the Government cooperated well in bringing about the needed
modifications, and overall the Project was implemented withir. budget.
5.2 ImoLpmentation of Procurement Component
The lists of equipment to be procured for the Project were prepared
by IIO experts in the field. Subsequent tendering was sub-contracted to ILO's
EQUIPRO which grouped equipment in such a way that it was delivered directly
to the receiving institution in suitable storage containers until ready for
installation.  Thus, handling of equipment procurement by ILO resulted in
gains in delivery time. Nevertheless, difficulties remained. For example,
while the delivery of the first batch of equipment coincided with the arrival
of the training experts, the physical facilities were not ready in all cases
to receive the equipment, so that experts were unable to train Sudanese
counterparts immediately in the use of the equipment. The responsibility for
preparing facilities was not clearly spelled out in the project documents, and
as a result delays were incurred because the operational budgets of the
receiving institutions proved insufficient to complete facility preparation.
For example, a special contract had to be awarded for the electrical work (see
Table 1). All this took up considerable time and in some cases experts had
already left when the machinery was finally operational.

6. Proiect Results
Designed to assist Sudan to overcome its most acute shortage of
trained manpower, the Project at its completion increased the quantity and
improved the quality of vocational and post-secondary technical training as
intended.
6.1 Khartoum Polvtechnic
At appraisal it was envisaged that the enrollment at the Polytech.lic
would rise from 700 to 1,400 students with an annual output of about 450
technicians from the three year diploma program. The actual student
population at completion of the Project was 1,907 surpassing the numaber
foreseen at appraisal.
Training to be provided by the Polytechnic for the instructors of
VTCs was identified by the ILO instructor training specialist and a proposal
approved. Training material was translated into Arabic where necessary.
6.2 Vocational Training Centers (VTCs)
Out of six VTCs originally planned to benefit from the Project,
assistance has actually been provided for five: Khartoum I and II, Wad-
Medani, Kosti, and Port Sudan. Because of security reasons in the south, the
work in Juba stopped almost as soon as it began and could not be picked up
again before completion of the Project. In quantitative terms, enrollment of
3,103 in 1982/83 was forecast to grow to 4,169 by project completion. In fact
it surpassed this target by 581 students. The quality of training in the VTCs
was also enhanced by the Project. Although it is too early to judge, visits
to the vocational centers have verified that a great deal of practical
training is now taking place in workshops.
Out of five fellowships allocated for VTC instructors, only four were
carried out. One candidate withdrew at the last minute, and the VTA could not
nominate a replacement in time. Seven additional fellowships (representing 12
fellowship months) were provided instead.
6.3 Teacher Training Institutes
Technical assistance services were allocated for the IREC Program
initiated under the Second Education Project at Bakht-er-Ruda and Maridi.
Forty-eight man-months of technical assistance to Maridi were withdrawn due to
travel restrictions, but another 48 man-months were fully utilized by Bakht-
er-Ruda with 12 more spent on women's education in the Ministry of Education.

Extensive studies of the IREG program were undertaken in the White
Nile Province and wherever travel was not restricted. Two reports identified
and highlighted the problems affecting the IRECs and provided corrective
recomendations along with future actions for further growth and expansion of
the program. This study was presented to the Ministry of Education for
consideration and action.
Based on another report presented to the Ministry of Education on
education for adult rural women through IRECs, a model curriculum was
developed and assistance was given to 90 women at El Mileh IREC.
Progress of the IREC was impaired by several limitations, chief of
which was lack of sufficient financial support to sustain its programs
adequately. This was further complicated by a series of school closures
during 1987/88. IRECs have progressed steadily, considering the
circumstances.
6.4 Department of Labor (DOL). Khartoum and Juba
To strengthen planning, coordination and monitoring of vocational
training, the Project provided assistance to the Vocational Training Branch of
Khartoum and the Vocational Training Section of Juba, though the latter was
not fully carried out because of security reasons. The assistance: (i)
established and helped the initial operation of the new Vocational Training
Administration (VTA); (ii) developed and strengthened a competency-based
certification system; (iii) installed a computer service with relevant
software for management information systems both in English and Arabic; (iv)
helped in planning and administration of training for VTC instructors; and (v)
strengthened the material and supply section of the DOL in Khartoum.
6.5 Ministry of Education and Guidance (MOE)
The provision of computer specialist services was used to develop the
computer management competence of the Department of Planning and Strategy,
involving data and information analysis, and projections of budget and
financial data. Computer hardware and software were also supplied to the
Department of Planning and the Department of Examinations.
6.6 Pre-Investment Study and Pilot Scheme
A study of the 15 Higher Technical Secondary Schools (HTSSs) and the
eight Vocational Artisan Training Centers (VATCs) reviewed their curriculum,
staff development and setting of minimum standards of qualifications for
graduation. It also evaluated the existing system, recommended changes, and
offered a detailed strategy for the implementation of pilot schemes to test



the recommendations for restructuring the training programs. Based on the
study, the Ministry of Education decided to increase the number of pilot
institutions from two to seven.
7. Sustainability
Sustainability of project benefits depends both on adequate funds to
cover the operational expenditures of project institutions and on satisfactory
continuing enrollments. Issues of sustainability of this Project must be
viewed in an environment of substantial migration to the Gulf States. The
emigration of trained manpower clearly undermines the benefits of such a
project.
7.1 Financial Sustainability
The Polytechnic will have the least difficulties in meeting future
financial requirements because it can rely on its own resources and external
links. Considerable more saving- could be made at the Polytechnic if
bursaries were given to needy students only, rather than to all students as is
currently the case.
7.2 Ooerational Sustainability
Sustainability in terms of enrollment would appear to be satisfactory
in the case of the HTSSs, given that demand is great for places leading to
possible university level training. Demand for VTC and VATC places is also
high and since both institutions emphasize production work as part of their
regular training activities, there is also potentially some revenue
generation. The idea of linking training with production to generate funds was
developed successfully at the VTC in Wad Medani. Apart from the additional
income gained, this may have been a motivating factor to students and could be
copied to other VTCs.
Another crucial issue is instructor training. Training has been
attempted by the Polytechnic without much success because students are less
encouraged to pursue teacher training when they could instead go on to become
engineers. The Government will at some point have to consider other
instructor training schemes.
7.3 IREC Sustainability
A continuing issue relates to the IRECs established during the Second
Education Project. The IREC program would benefit from the creation of a
centralized authority to coordinate and manage it, and from stronger financial
and institutional support.

8. Bank Performance
8.1 Progect Design
During the inordinately long period of formulation, including two
distinct appraisals, particular consideration was given to implementation
problems encountered in the First and Second Education Projects.    Looking
back, the thrust of the Project towards rehabilitation and the expansion of
the country's technical manpower base appears fully justified. However, the
appraisal report did not state clearly the specific reciprocal inputs and
resources to be provided by each institution resulting in delays and lack of
budgetary planning.
8.2 Proiect Implementation
During the 4.5 years of project execution, there were nine
supervision missions averaging about two per year, with higher frequency in
the initial stages. Communication between the PIU and IDA was efficient and
resulted in problem solving without undue delay. The flexibility shown by IDA
on issues such as amendments to technical assistance, reallocation of proceeds
among Credit categories and modifications in scope or due to a changing
country situation, contributed to the Project being completed on schedule and
within budget. The PIU also felt grateful to the disbursement section of the
Bank in Nairobi for helping resolve difficulties of late payments with the
Bank of Sudan. The overall performance of IDA can therefore be summarized as
good and responsive, with an excellent working relationship being established
with country officials.
9. Borrower Performance
The economic and political difficulties which the country experienced
during project implementation could not fail to have an effect on the
borrower's project related performance. Shortage of local funds and lack of
spare parts and fuel were an unavoidable consequence of the overall situation.
More seriously, however, borrower performance was impaired by the fact that
the Project was executed in the Ministry of Labor, but was implemented by the
PIU which was in the Ministry of Education. On a person-to-person basis
coordination was good, but at the institutional level such cooperation was
difficult to achieve. Whether these difficulties could have been avoided if
the appraisal report had been more specific with regard to inter-ministerial
coordination seems doubtful. In any case, the advantages of continuing to
have the experienced PIU as the implementing agency outweighed the drawbacks.
In spite of the above-mentioned difficulties, the overall performance of the
borrower must be considered positive. Although there were some changes in
staff, the PIU facilitated the work of the team of international experts,
negotiated with the Bank over amendments, and saw the Project through to
completion.

10.     Other services
10.1 Consulting Services: IL0
IL0's services made an important contribution to the success of the
Project. The limited duration of experts' contracts did not in all cases
allow enough time for the commissioning of equipment, but by the time the
electrical contractor had completed his work in July 1988, all equipment
supplied to the VTCs was installed and operational.
10.2 Contractors
Construction contracts were awarded to private contractors except for the
Port Sudan VTC where construction was done by local labor under supervision of
the local Ministry of Construction and Public Works (MCPW) branch. With one
exception, work was completed in time and satisfactorily. The one exception
was the Polytechnic's Metrology Lab which was left unfinished by the original
contractor and a second contract had to be awarded. The work of the
contractor for the electrical installation program in VTCs was executed
swiftly and efficiently.
11.     Lessons Learned
Earlier lessons are reinforced by the Third Education Project.
Building on experience gained in the first two projects, it was confirmed that
projects in this sector should minimize demands for recurrent expenditure, and
that rehabilitation of existing facilities should take precedence over new
physical investment.
Several issues which are more specific to this Project have also
emerged. First, coordination between the PIU and the various agencies
involved in the Project was not very effective, since duties and terms of
reference of agency representatives were not clearly spelled out in lending
documents. Frequent changes in these responsible staff, added duties, and
lack of incentives were further drawbacks which should be taken into
consideration when establishing such interministerial links in the future.
Second, the appraisal working papers concentrated on providing
facilities at the VTCs and the Polytechnic which in retrospect were not
matched to the equipment which was finally provided. For example,
sophisticated equipment was installed below ground (subsequently flooded) in
deficient facilities at the Polytechnic.
Thirdly, coordination between delivery of equipment and the arrival
of technical experts responsible for its commissioning could have been
synchronized more effectively. In several cases, experts were fielded too



- 12 -
early, and consequently, when the equipment arrived, their assignments were
drawing to an end. It should be mentioned, in addition, that an average 18
month procurement cycle was longer than the average stays of the experts and
the Project would have benefited from coordinating these two inp4cs more
precisely.
On the whole and taking into consideration difficult country
conditions, implementation of the Project within time and credit allocations
was a remarkable achievement, attributable to the combined factors of:
competence and continuity in project direction on the part of the PIU; and
professional assistance provided by ILO in the procurement of equipment and in
training through a team of international technical specialists.

Comments:  The total Project cost wes US$0.4 million below Appraisal estimates.  Through the
provision of Credit funds in SORs and the gradual erosion of the US dollar
values, the Project benefited from approximately USS2.4 million equivalent in
additional funds arfsing from the increasfng value of SOR dkring Project
ioplementation.
The table shows that the major proportion of the total cost has been attributed
to Equipment and Furniture (70 per cent) and Technical Assistance (20 per cent).

OMmentss  Allocations in the Credit Agreements were made In SR.  When the Credit
Agreements were signed in April 1984, SDR14.80 million was equivalent of USS15.40

M3 value, the rate of exchange of t#SC fluctuated beteen 1.20 and 1.39 to the

instructors avallable for upgrading in order to cope with
changes in the area of technology and the new equipment supplied
by the project.    In collaboration with ILO specialists, VTA
planned a three-phase short course (basic, fntermediate and
advanced) that might help a VTC Instructor to be qualified,
hence certified.   The advanced level was also designed as an
Induction course for any potential VTC instructor studying
abroad (presently there are nine in Germany and four In Japan).
Already the basic course of five-week duration has been given to
107 existing VTC instructors, 53 of whom have additionally
undergone the Intermediate phase whtie the remaining 54 are
belng planned.   These initial courses were conducted in Wad
Nedani VTC and financed by the project.
In addition a serles of training seminars/workshops were held on
topics enging from concepts of the WES approach to training and

As of iu st 1988 eight such courses had been conducted for a

A.    The diptoma progrs_n which requires completion of 2,700 students hours takes a day-time student
three years to diplomate campored to four years for an evening student Aho gets six hours less
training a week.
The mafn difference between the day-time and evening students is that the former receive
bursaries from the Government while the tatter do not.  This difference so far has not been an
issue and instead, evening students consider themselves privileged to have even been given the
opportunity to follow the courses under the Polytechnic's requirements. This should in fact be
encouraged fn order to phase out bursary grants. Nostels may, as a result, be used for expansion
or to raise additional operating fuwds from the rents.
Delays and obstacles were initially experienced with the inspection of existing facilities at all
three campuses (Worth, South and Yest) to determine equipment instaltation.  There was reluctance
on the part of the national staff to identify areas for installation of new equipment as well as
storage of the old equipment which may be kept.  The location of the welding workshop at the West
Capus and the electrical machines lab at the South Capas were confirmed only in December 1987.
Although all the etectrical connections have been completed, the installation of the vetding
mchines are still smiting civil works rehabilitation by the Polytechnic, which presently does not
have the necessary funds, thus delaying the use of the equipment for training purposes.  The
workshops in the South Caorpus are smaller in size resulting in overcrowding of the equipment
fnstalled, whfch fs not conducive for demonstration instruction, and may even be dangerous fn case
of accident.
As regards equipment provided by the project, user instructors are criticat about the non
umiforvmty of the equipment delivered. For fnstanee, equipment for machine shops uas delivered
from Sain, Germany and Pakistan, for labs from the United Kingdom and Italy, and for metrology
fom Jiin, the United Kirngdn, Germany and Sweden. These ites differ in various ws  and it is
believed that these differences create a fair anount of copUication for uniform teaching,
mfnttenace etc.  instructional mals and schematic diagrams were lost through careless handling
by fnsructors. A seco;d set is nw being made awvalable by the various caqanies free of charge.
The ILO International specialists working with thefr national counterparts at the Polytechnic
revised the curriculum reflecting the introdiction of the now equipment and changes that have taken
place in the area of technoLogy.
Training needs for the instructors of VTCs were identiffed bV the ILO fnstructor training
seialist and a proposal approved.  To this effect, training material was translated into rabic
as necessary and others adapted from ILO's IIES Staff Development Learning Elements. These were
sugptemented with additional materials prepared in Arabic tanguage from the IW training facility
In Turin, Italy.  Howver, the Polytechnic was unable to find the required nuurber of trainers to
begin the training In January 1987 and this objective has not been fulfilled to date.
B.    With respect to fellowships (see Amex 5), out of the five originally foreseen, only four wer
carried out as one candidate withdrew at the last minute ard the VTA could not nominate a
replacement on time.   Seven additional fetlowships (representing  12 fellouship-month) wre
provided in the areas of Data Processing, Nonitoring and Evaluation, MES Docaent Production, and
Training of Trainers.
C.    Bakcht-er-Ruda TTI was provided with sophisticated audio and video equipment and other hardware of
instructional technology costing US$217,223, which eculd not be used for lack of electricity. The
only supply to the institution is one-phase line of Inadequate power turned on onty in the evenings
frm 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. Thus, Bakht-er-Ruds should have also been supplied with a generator, not
only to use Its equipment prodectively but also to prevent if from untimely deterioration.
D.    Owdng to the  rnefficient and ineffective training system  of the 15 NTSSs and the 8 VATCs,
assistance was provided by the Project for a pro-investment study to review the curricula, staff
developwnt, setting of minimm standads of qualiffeation for graduation etc. Actually a thorough
analysis of needs was carried out on the physical structures, training facilities, programms as
well as the imat of the graduates within indestry. Two separate reports: sPre-invstment Study
an ITSSs (Industrial)" and M*-inwsament Study of VATCsn were produced.  Eac  rept evaluated
the existing sytem, recomended changes and offered a detailed strategy for the fiplementation of
pilot shemes to test the recammendatios for restructuring of training progres.
