MEMORANDUM AND RECOIIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed develop-
ment loan to the Government of Indonesia (GOI) for US$140.3 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 5 years grace, at the standard variable interest rate, and would
finance a three-year time slice of the higher education expenditure program,
excluding previously committed foreign-assisted and purely COI-financed
projects.
2.        Background.  A major national objective is to expand and improve
higher education so that the university system can assist in relieving the in-
adequacies of higher level malipower which are a major constraint to Indonesian
economic development. Presently, there are 45 public and 665 private univer-
sities with enrollments of about 535,000 and 750,000 students respectively.
Recent sector work, conducted jointly by the Bank and GOI, identified the
following main issues in the higher education subsector: (a) low educational
quality and internal efficiency at public and private higher education
institutions; (b) declining government budgetary resources combined with
rapidly growing enrollments in state universities; (c) need to improve
quality, relevance, and accreditation standards in private universities while
stimulating overall growth; (d) deficie~ncies in planning and management in the
Directorate General for Higher 7ducation (DGHE) and in higher education
institutions; (e) imbalances between higher level manpower requirements and
the composition of graduates from higher education institutions; and (f)
shortcomings in project implementation.
3.        Government Subsector Strategy.  Public and private university en-
rollments grew at an average rate of 15Z during the last decade, and will
probably continue to grow fast to cover the strong demand for higher educa-
tion. Budgetary constraints will limit the growth of the public sector, and
the private sector, which now enrolls about half the tertiary education stu-
dents, will play an increasingly important role. The GOI intends to spend
about US$927 million on higher education during the next three years. It has
prepared a development strategy to deal with the key sectoral issues, which
gives priority to improvements in quality and efficiency, instead of relying
on capital expansion. The following are the major elements of this strategy:
(a) Quality and Efficiency: Establishing a semester credit system to
accelerate student graduation rates, terminating study programs that no longer
serve national manpower requirements, raising teacher qualifications through
overseas and domestic staff development programs, enhancing operational
support for priority academic and research programs, and reforming academic
accreditation procedures; (b) Rescurce Mobilization: Increasing student fees,
allowing universities to increase their income from services to the community,
and stimulating the development of the private sector in priority fields;
(c) Planning and Management: Developing management information (MIS) and mo-
nitoring and evaluation systems (MES), analyzing costs by fields of study,
gearing future public enrollment expansion to resource availability, and
designing new training programs for university managers; (d) Manpower Needs



-2-
and Regional Development: Establishing nov study programs in priority fields
of study, with increased operational supports (e) Im.leoentationI Establishing
a new Higher Education Project Implementation Monitarin! Tea TRT) to provide
technical assistance to central and local project implementation units and
monitor progress in implementation for all foreign-assisted higher education
projects.
4.        Student fees are becoming an increasingly important source of fi-
nancing for higher education in Indonesia. They are used to finance recurrent
expenditures such as academic equipfnt and materials, research, community
service, honoraria, student activities, and general campus maintenance. The
average contribution per student is about Rp 85,000 (about US$50) per year, or
a total of Rp 36 billion (US$21.8 million) in FY87/88, representing about a
fifth of the operational budget per student at public universities. Student
fees are expected to reach about Rp 80 billion (US$48 million) by FY90/91.
Student fees in public universities are low in relation to total costs.
Students in private universities pay substantially higher tuition and
admissions fees, even though there is little differnce in the income
distribution of families of students in public vs. private institutions.
Tuition fees are only 10Z of students' total reported monthly expenditures
(including room and board) in public universities and less than 20X of the
total for private university students. Given the current fee structure and
the socioeconomic distribution of university students, there is sLill scope
for higher fees. Coupled with scholarship or loan assistance for needy
students, these would not have negative equity effects.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Six previous Bank projects in
higher education supported quality improvements and expansion in selected
priority areas such as polytechnics, engineering, economics, agriculture,
postgraduate education and teacher training. Although there were implemen-
tation problems during 1983 to 1985, especially due to inadequate project
management, after a joint GOI-Bank review of these problems in 1985, the GOI
undertook reforms such as budget decentralization and strengthening of project
management capabilities at universities. These measures helped reverse the
slowdown, and implementation of higher education projects improved sLbstan-
tially in the last two years. The improvement resulted from policy and insti-
tutional changes adopted at both the national and DGHE levels, and indicate a
high level of commitment to institutional development. The Bank projects
resulted in tangible improvements in quality and efficiency, as shown by
several indicators, but these benefits were limited to a few well-established
universities which were the focus of Bank support. Building upon the experi-
ence gained to date and in an effort to make the benefits of improved quality,
efficiency, and management widespread throughout the subsector, Bank lending
strategy would shift, starting with the proposed project, from support for
heavy capital investment for specific fields of study at selected universities
to support for the more efficient operation of the higher education system as
a whole, and from implementation through ad-hoc central project implementation
units to implementation through the universities' and DGHE's administrative
structures. The proposed project would thus lay the foundation for transition
from project to sector-type lending operations for higher education in
Indonesia. It is expected to be followed up by at least two other time-slice
operations to help GOI achieve its sector objectives satisfactorily. The Bank
ias been the major source of capital for the development of higher education
in Indonesia, and is thus best suited to help the GOI design and implement a
comprehensive subsectoral development strategy.



-3-
6.        Project Objectives.  Consistent with this strategy, the objectives
of the proposed project would be to assist the government in implementing its
higher education program through: (a) improving sectoral planning;
(b) improving both sectoral and institutional management in higher education;
(c) increasing resource mobilization, including reinforcing the role of
private higher education institutions; (d) improving educational quality and
efficiency; (e) strengthening selected fields of study reflecting manpower
needs; and (f) increasing the contribution of universities to regional
development, particularly in the Eastern Islands.
7.        Project Description.  The proposed Bank loan would support selected
activities in the higher education program, based on GOI's medium-term subsec-
toral strategy and action plan, which have been agreed upon with the Bank.
The Bank will play a catalyst role in assuring implementation of the agreed
expenditure program to help achieve the stated objectives. The project
includes the following components:
8.        In order to improve planning, management and implementation capabi-
lities, the project would finance (a) the development and delivery of a train-
ing program in university management and finance for selected DGHE and univer-
sity staff; (b) expansion of the MIS and MES; (c) a series of higher education
planning and management studies and evaluations; and (d) operational costs for
carrying out the proposed project.
9.        In order to improve quality and efficiency, the project would fi-
nance: (a) overseas and in-country postgraduate university staff development
programs; (b) quality and efficiency improvements for priority undergraduate
study programs; (c) research programs at public higher education institutions;
(d) development of a national university library network; and (e) provision of
equipment, educational materials, and maintenance of laboratories.
10.       In order to promote the further development of private higher edu-
cation, the project would (a) support regional coordination and quality super-
vision of private institutions; (b) provide fellowships for academic staff and
management training for institutional administrators; (c) stlpport the estab-
lishment of common-use facilities to be shared by private universities on a
charge-back basis; and (d) strengthen institutional and academic accreditation
procedures.
11.       The project would assist in selected physical development by sup-
porting: (a) the development of fishery (at Riau University) and agriculture
facilities (at Tadulako and Cenderawasih Universities); (b) the development of
the campuses of the universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas;
(c) the construction of science laboratories and libraries at,the universities
of Cenderawasih and Mataram and IKIP Malang; and (d) equipment for 11 poly-
technics located at the universities of Syah Kuala, Andalas, Institut
Teknologi Surabaya, Hasanuddin, San Ratulangi, Pattimura, Lambung Mangkurat,
Tanjungpura, Mulawarman, Udayana and Nusa Cendana, as well as for the
Polytechnic Education Development Center (PEDC).
12.       The project would also ensure the provision of adequate levels of
operation and maintenance of higher education institutions, including incre-
mental staffing and operating budgets.



-4-
13.       The project is estimated to cost a total of US$257.3 million, of
which US$70.7 million is expected to be in foreign exchange. Retroactive
financing will be provided for project activities occuring after April 1 1988
and not exceedirg US$5 million. Cost estimates and the financing plan aro
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procuremnt and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule S. The timetable of key
events of project processing is sumarized in Schedule C. The status of Sank
Group operations in Indonesia is shown in 3chedule D. A map of Indonesia is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report is being distributed separately.
14.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations the Government agreed on the
following  ctions:Ta  confirmation of the Higher Education Program Guide-
lines, Action Plan, and higher education studies to be undertaken over the
next three years; (b) confirmation of the three year expenditure program
composition and costs; (c) dassurances that an annual review will be undertaken
with the Bank of the current and forthcoming year's expeiditure programs;
(d) confirmation of the establishment of the Library Planning and Management
Unit (LPMU) and the Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU); and (e) assur-
ances that qualified and experienced officers will be maintained at all times
as full-time directors for all ongoing Bank-financed projects in Higher
Education and as senior staff for the higher education project implementation
Monitoring Team,
15.       Benefits.  The benefits of Bank assistance under this project would
be widespread throughout the subsector, and would lead to better cost recovery
through increased student fees and university income from services, improved
planning and management, better educational quality, and improved project
implementation. Implementation of the specific time-bound actions to support
subsectoral strategy would lead to the development of a more efficient and
financially self-sustaining higher education system.
16.       Risks.  The mait risks are that some of the universities which have
not had prior implementation experience may perform at a slower pace than what
is required to implement the project on schedule. These risks are being
addressed by providing technical assistance for planning and management,
planning to undertake intensive project supervision, supporting the Monitoring
Team, and training managers at all univerrities.
17.       Reconmendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreeement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
