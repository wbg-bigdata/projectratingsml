                     TROPICAL ANDES PROJECT

                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY
1.      The Mid Term Review (MTR) of the Adaptation to the Impact of Rapid Glacier
Retreat in the Tropical Andes Project (P098248) identified the need to restructure the Project.
This Paper presents the proposed restructuring, which entails: (i) creation of a Component 5
to enhance the regional knowledge sharing among the Beneficiaries (Plurinational State of
Bolivia, Republic of Ecuador, and Republic of Peru)1; (ii) reorganization of Project
components, (iii) adjustment of some pilot adaptation measures, without changing the
objective; (iv) adjustment of the Results Framework; (v) reallocation of proceeds to fit the
revised Project structure; and (vi) updating the Project cost estimates and financing plan. A
work plan outlining the activities to be completed by Project closure has been agreed upon by
the Implementing Agency and the Beneficiaries.

2.       The Project Development Objective (PDO), which is to contribute to strengthening
the resilience of local ecosystems and economies to the impacts of glacier retreat in the
Tropical Andes, through the implementation of specific pilot adaptation activities that
illustrate the costs and benefits of adaptation, as well as the scope of the Project, remains
unchanged. The team believes that the PDO remains relevant and will be achieved by Project
closure. No new safeguards are triggered as a consequence of the above-mentioned
modifications.

3.      In October 2010 the MTR of the Project took place, during which the Beneficiaries
reaffirmed their commitment to the Project. At the same time, the MTR recognized the need
to enhance the regional dimension of the Project (e.g. systematization and sharing of country
experiences on design and implementation of adaptation activities, glacier monitoring, etc.)
and to adjust some of the pilot adaptation measures, considering the time left before Project
closure (September 30, 2012). The request for restructuring was agreed upon by the Project
Steering Committee (composed by Vice-Ministers and alternates from the Ministry of
Environment of the Beneficiary Countries) and submitted by the Implementing Agency
(General Secretariat of the Andean Community, SGCA) to the Bank on June 21, 2011.




PROJECT STATUS
4.     The progress towards the development objective of the Project varies by participating
country.


1
 Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru are participating countries in the GEF TF Grant TF091712. Bolivia, Colombia,
Ecuador and Peru are participating countries in the PHRD TF090328 grant that is linked to the GEF TF091712
Grant. Bolivia has a GFDRR TF091497 Grant to finance its third pilot activity.
                                                     4
5.      Good progress has been achieved overall in the generation of scientific knowledge
and capacity strengthening on climate change and glacier monitoring (Components 1 and 3).
Climate change scenarios have been generated in Peru and Ecuador, and are being elaborated
in Bolivia, and models have been developed to assess impacts on the water and agricultural
sectors in selected areas of the participating countries. Countries have advanced in the
interpretation of satellite imagery (ALOS images) to monitor changes in glacier surface. The
Project (through a PHRD grant that also includes Colombia) purchased eight high-altitude
glacier monitoring stations, six of which are already installed and functioning (the two in
Bolivia will be installed by August 2011). Operation and maintenance arrangements have
been secured for their long-term sustainability in all four countries.

6.     Progress on the design and implementation of pilot adaptation measures in selected
communities and sectors vulnerable to the effects of glacier retreat (Component 2) is as
follows:

   a. Peru has advanced well and started implementation of most pilot adaptation measures
      as foreseen in the original Project design (i.e. reforestation, conservation of
      grasslands, water-saving irrigation methods).

   b. In Ecuador, activities to help increase climate resilience of the water supply system to
      Quito are underway, although so far limited to setting up a monitoring system for
      water availability and climate change impacts, and a vulnerability assessment in the
      Pita-Puengasí river basin. The second pilot, focusing on the high-mountain
      ecosystems in the Antisana region, identified several adaptation measures through a
      participatory process, of which some have started implementation, and the remaining
      are at final design stage.

   c. Bolivia has experienced a number of administrative and legal issues that held up
      Project implementation until late 2010. Those issues have been mostly resolved, and
      some activities are starting to be implemented. Coordination among community,
      municipal, regional and national level is improving. Final designs for pilot activities
      in one of the two municipalities involved in the project, Batallas, are ready, and a
      bidding process for a key strategic analysis of water losses for the water supply entity
      of La Paz and El Alto is underway.

7.    Disbursement is low (21%) but is accelerating, and committed projections up to
September 2011 bring disbursements up to 51%.



PROPOSED CHANGES
8.      The proposed changes do not affect the scope of the Project or its PDO. They are
intended to better reflect the nature of the Project, which is innovative and unique in many
aspects. It is not a traditional infrastructure or agriculture or water project, although it
involves all those sectors. As such, the importance of the whole process carried out
throughout the life of the Project is being stressed. This process comprises the preparation of
the pilots (the time estimate in the original Project design was unrealistic), the engagement of
all relevant sectors and institutions, community consultation and participatory prioritization,

                                               5
country ownership and finally implementation, monitoring and evaluation. All these
important steps have to be stressed and given prominence over actual achieved outputs in
terms of water supplied or hectares covered.

9.       Changes include reorganization of Components and grouping together of some
activities formerly distributed in different Components into a new Component, adjustment of
some pilot adaptation measures, adjustment of the Results Framework to reflect the inclusion
of a new Component and the adjustment of some pilot activities (Annex 1), reallocation of
proceeds, and updates to the financing plan, as described below. These changes aim to ensure
resources are spent rationally in the remaining life of the Project. With this objective in mind,
some of the civil works (such as the new water supply project for Quito, the water
impounding structures in Bolivia) have been adjusted towards strengthening of knowledge
and capacity building on adaptation to glacier retreat and to climate change of the key
institutions involved.

•   Components

Reorganization of activities to create a new Component

10.      A fifth Component focused on the development of regional knowledge and learning
activities on adaptation to climate change and glacier retreat is added to the Project. This was
requested by the governments of the Beneficiary countries and the Implementing Agency,
based on the following observations: (i) although the Project has a regional coverage (the
Tropical Andes is a regional hotspot), its original design does not foresee any joint regional
activities, i.e. it is limited to a juxtaposition of activities at the country level, and (ii) the
Project is generating scientific knowledge, methodological approaches and operational
expertise in each of the participating countries that could be better systematized, utilized and
disseminated by the other participants. This Component will promote South-South
cooperation among country agencies on a topic of regional importance, i.e. glacier retreat, at
the scientific and operational level. It will also bring worldwide cutting edge research
institutions to the region to support the process of adaptation to climate change in high
mountain ecosystems. This Component will better align the Project with the mandate of the
SGCA, whose mission is to promote integration among their member countries on topics
relevant at the regional level.



Reorganization of Components

11.     The Components are reorganized (i.e. some Components renamed, some sub-
components and activities rearranged) in order to better reflect the logic and interventions of
the Project (see Table 1). In the original Project, Component 1 included both scientific
research and the design of the pilot adaptation measures, while Component 2 involved the
implementation of the pilots. During the life of the Project, however, it has become clear that
the design of adaptation measures cannot be accomplished independently, but it has to be an
integral part of the process of identification, prioritization and implementation of activities.
Sub-component 1.2 (detailed design of specific adaptation measures) is therefore
incorporated into Component 2 (which is therefore renamed as Design and Implementation
of Pilot Adaptation Measures). Sub-component 1.3 (public outreach and dissemination of
                                                6
information) and Sub-Components 3.3 b and c are included under the new Component 5 to
enhance the regional character of dissemination activities.

12.     In this way, all Project activities are more clearly laid out, with Component 1 having
a strengthened scientific focus on the development of climate change scenarios, modeling
and impact maps for the selected river basins; Component 2 reflecting the interrelated nature
of design and implementation of adaptation measures; Component 3 focusing on scientific
equipment and approaches to increase the capacity of countries to assess glacier dynamics;
Component 4 remains project management; and the newly created Component 5 includes all
the activities with a regional character. The table below presents the titles of the current and
proposed Components.

Adjustment of pilot adaptation measures

13.      The proposed Restructuring Paper updates the description of pilot adaptation
measures in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, reflecting the progress made in the identification,
prioritization and design of the pilots during Project implementation (Table 2). For some
pilots, the target is adjusted, to take into account the request of the Implementing Agency to
limit the number of civil works under the Project. It also takes into account that the design of
several pilots has taken longer than anticipated in the original Project design, because they
are complex interventions that require contributions from many institutions, sectors and
actors. In those cases, preference is being given to knowledge and strategic planning
activities, as well as strategic equipment, trying to optimize activities in the remaining life of
the Project. None of the proposed modifications changes the objectives of the pilot adaptation
measures or the scope of the Project.

14.     Modifications proposed for Peru’s adaptation pilots do not imply any substantive
change. Activities will be carried out as planned, however the pilots will be re-organized to
focus on two regional areas (Shullcas and Santa Teresa) instead of type of activities (e.g.,
agriculture, and water management).2 This change is justified considering that each pilot
consists of a set of adaptation activities, which as a group, are intended to contribute to more
resilience against climate change and strengthened integrated water resources management in
each of these two selected sub-basins. This regrouping of activities around areas and not
themes will reduce the number of pilots from the original three to two (one in Shullcas, one
in Santa Teresa) that will include the same activities foreseen formerly.

15.     In Ecuador, the Project is promoting activities in two different locations with different
partners, divided into two pilot projects (details on Table 2). The objective of pilot project 1
remains to increase the climate resilience of the water supply to Quito; the initial intention
was to support EPMAPS, Quito water authority, to mainstream climate change concerns into
a new water supply system that the utility was going to build (envisioned at first as the
Mindo Bajo system and later on as the Atacazo Bajo system). Due to several issues, the water
authority did not build a new water system, and thus the Project focused its efforts on the
development of knowledge activities to increase the resilience of an existing water supply
system (Pita-Puengasí), as well as small scale interventions to protect the higher areas of the
catchment from anthropogenic activities. The pilot will also contribute to the development of
a water resources and climate monitoring system and support the generation of data needed
for water resources planning in the corresponding Pita river basin. The content of pilot 2
remains largely unchanged.

16.    In Bolivia, the objectives of the three pilots remain largely identical: increase the
climate resilience of the water supply system to the cities of La Paz and El Alto (pilot 1),
increase the water resources planning capacity in the river basins affected by glacier retreat in
the Bolivian plateau and high valleys (pilot 2), and reduce the vulnerability of riverine
communities of Huayhuasi and El Palomar against floods (pilot 3). Original design and

2
  The current project documents describe a wide variety of activities to be undertaken under each pilot. The
proposal focuses on developing a set of activities that as a group, aim at the same objectives of the current pilot
descriptions, organized by geographical location instead, rather than by topics.

2 further description is provided. In the case of pilot project 3 that is being financed with a
Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery Grant (GFDRR TF091497), its
description has also been updated in line with the changes approved by GFDRR to that grant.

•   Adjustment of the Results Framework

17.     The MTR carefully reviewed the Results Framework and agreed on the necessity to:
(i) include new indicators for the new Component 5 (regional activities), (ii) revise the
targets in function of the Project pace of implementation so far and the work plan for the
remaining life of the Project, and (iii) put more emphasis on the quality of the processes
involved in the identification, prioritization, design and implementation of pilot adaptation
measures; as well as the ownership by key agencies and institutions. The restructuring has
also strived to put in place, or enhance, the monitoring system for each pilot to elaborate a
baseline and evaluate quantifiable indicators beyond Project closure.

18.    In order to improve the results framework and transform it into a useful tool to assess
progress and achievement of objectives, an updated description of indicators, including the
addition of one new output indicator under components 1, 2 and 3, is proposed. The aim of

                                                       13
these changes is to: (i) establish a clear link between Project’s objectives and outcomes; and
(ii) establish a clear link between outputs and outcomes. The revised Results Framework is
presented in Annex 1.

•   Safeguards

19.      The proposed restructuring does not trigger any additional safeguard policies. During
the MTR it was identified that some safeguards aspects, mainly related to proper
documentation of processes and plans, were not being handled adequately by the
Implementing Agency. The Bank team undertook specific actions to address the situation: (i)
dedicated training for the national technical experts (ETNs) through a safeguards workshop
in November 2010; (ii) preparation and implementation of an updated Environmental
Management Framework which provides clarity to identify applicable safeguards
requirements for each pilot activity, and to formalize the documentation of all safeguards
procedures; (iii) close guidance offered by the Bank team (which includes country office
staff) to the ETNs to guide them in the completion of required documentation.

20.    All consultations and participatory processes so far have been formalized, reviewed
and approved by the Bank and summaries of all these processes are available. The updated
Pest Management Plans for Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru have been finalized. The Indigenous
People’s Plan in Ecuador has been updated. Peru has submitted all its Environmental
Management Plans for the different activities, which are currently being revised by the Bank.

•   Institutional arrangements

21.    The proposed restructuring does not introduce any changes to the institutional
arrangements.

•   Financing

22.     A number of adjustments have been made to the financing plan of the project. The
GEF proceeds are being reallocated among Components in line with the reorganization of
Components described above (Table 1). Sources of co-financing are being updated to reflect
the reality of Project implementation. Table 3 summarizes the changes in costs and sources
of funding that are described below:

23.     Component 1: The updated cost of this component considers only the activities
related to the development of climate change scenarios and glacier-fed basin impact maps
and models, and associated studies. The total cost of this component is slightly higher than
originally foreseen (US$ 1.23 compared to 1.1 million), and the difference has been covered
by specialized governmental agencies. Given the proposed relocation of the design (Sub-
component 1.2) and dissemination (Sub-component 1.3) activities to Components 2 and 5,
respectively, the total amount of GEF resources allocated to this Component is slightly less
than original (US$ 0.33 million compared to 0.40 million), and the balance is reallocated to
fund regional activities under the new Component 5.

24.    Component 2: The project cost for Component 2 to be covered by GEF resources is in
line with the original financing plan (US$ 5.81 million compared to the original US$ 5.94
million). The overall expected co-financing contribution for Component 2 is also close to
                                             14
what was originally planned (US$ 21.41 compared to the original 19.61 million). Firstly,
several of the co-financing resources foreseen in the initial financial package have
materialized or are likely to be exceeded. These include: (i) the World Bank financed Peru
Agricultural Research and Extension APL (US$ 6.26 million), (ii) CARE (US$ 1.8 million),
and (iii) AGRORURAL3 (US$3.1 million). Secondly, since its inception the Project has
leveraged additional resources that have contributed to achieving the project’s global
objective. These co-financing resources originate from: (i) in Peru, the World Bank financed
the Sierra Irrigation Sub-sector Project (US$ 2.75 million), and the World Bank financed
Water Resources Management Modernization Project (US$ 2.24 million), and (ii) the Bolivia
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience Phase 1 (US$ 1.5 million), a grant provided under the
Strategic Climate Investment Funds. Finally, some co-financing resources that were foreseen
originally will not fully materialize. This is the case of EPMAPS (Quito’s water utility)4
which was expected to contribute US$ 7 million for a new water supply system to Quito.
Due to land tenure issues, however, EPMAPS has had to abandon the foreseen new water
supply system in Mindo Bajo; its revised expected co-financing, for planning and monitoring
activities under pilot 1 in Ecuador, amounts to US$1.6 million. FAO’s originally estimated
contribution to the project was US$1 million, but did not materialize during the life of the
Project.

25.     Component 3: Changes in the cost of Component 3 are minimal. The activities that
were included under 3.3b and c are re-allocated to Component 5 because of their regional
nature and their cost is covered by an additional GEF Grant that was provided to the Project
(P119725) and approved in early 2011. The only change in availability of co-financing
resources with a minor impact on this Component corresponds to the lack of NOAA’s
participation, with a foreseen contribution of US$ 0.24 million, which was intended to
support the satellite collection and storage of data from the eight high-mountain monitoring
stations, which is nevertheless already taking place in-country and financed in great part by
government contributions.

26.     Component 4: Costs for this Component were originally overestimated. The MTR
estimated that Government counterparts funding amount to US$0.56 million (compared to
US$ 2.75 million) based on disbursements so far, which have allowed for efficient execution
of this Component (e.g., preparation for and participation in Steering Committee meetings,
supervision missions, etc.).

27.    Component 5: The reallocation of activities among components generates savings on
GEF resources from the first three components, which are being used to finance half of the
cost of Component 5. The other half corresponds to the reallocation of activities from
Component 3 (Sub-component 3.3.b-c).

 •    Financial Management and Procurement

 29.     The financial management and procurement arrangements for the Project continue
 the same. The SGCA is the sole responsible entity that manages the funds of the Project
 and does all contracting under the Project. The financial management and procurement
 performance of the Implementing Agency has been rated satisfactory. The last financial
 audit report was submitted on time and auditors issued unqualified (clean) opinion.

 •    Implementation schedule

 30.     The adjusted disbursement scheduled based on the 2011-2012 Annual Operational
 Plan is presented below:

 APPRAISAL SUMMARY
 31.     Although the proposed changes do not have an impact on the original appraisal
 summary, as a benefit of this restructuring there is more clarity on the type of activities to
 be developed (during appraisal, activities were still at a stage of being defined with no
 clear indication of their design).

 •    Economic and financial analysis

 32.     At the time of appraisal, activities were pre-identified but their designs were not
 yet available. The Project has finalized most of the designs, and the approach adopted to
 perform the economic and financial analysis is based on the use of cost effectiveness
 analysis. This responds to the assumption that the economic impacts of climate change
 are considerable and therefore, once a specific adaptation activity has been selected, the
 focus is to achieve the planned objective at the minimum financial cost (this assumes that
 the replication of any future interventions might need and would therefore only work,
 with the availability of public funding). Government and communities have selected
 specific activities on the basis of the expected benefits of becoming more resilient to the
                                                            19
impacts of climate change, and then, provided the small size of all interventions, design
specifications based on budget considerations.

33.      Further, because of the pilot nature of the interventions, information about
financial costs and benefits is part of the lessons expected to be gained from the
implementation of the adaptation activities. Generating and collecting financial data is
one of the objectives to be achieved as part of the implementation of tailored monitoring
and evaluation systems in all activities. However, because of implementation delays,
most of this type of data will only start to be gathered after Project closure. Financial data
would then allow determining whether any type of subsidies would be required for
activities to be replicated.



•   Social and Environment

34.    No new safeguards have been triggered and the assessment of social and
environmental impacts of the type of activities being implemented has not changed. The
Environmental Management Framework has been updated and improved to address
considerations that had been overlooked by the implementing unit (see paragraphs 19 and
20).

•   Risk

35.     The additional risks to those originally identified in the Project documents, reflect
the problems faced and lessons learnt during implementation. The mitigation measures
identified, on the other hand, explain some of the proposed changes presented in this
document.
