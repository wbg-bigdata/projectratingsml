NISPERO POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 1629-HO)
PREFACE
The project consisted of the Nispero hydorelectric plant (22.5 NW),
diesel units at Puerto Cortes (4x7.5 MW) and associated double-circuit
transmission lines (at 69 kV; 4 km) to a neighboring substation, consultant
services (engineering, management and organization, and various studies), and a
distribution expansion program. To support this Project, the Bank made loan
1629-HO (US$30.5 million) in November 1978 to the national power company, Empresa
Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE). Loan 1629-HO was the seventh of eight Bank
loans and two Bank credits which benefitted the power sector in Honduras. The
Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) also supported the Project
with a small loan (US$0.6 million) to cover some engineering costs.   Contrary to
expectations, CABEI did not provide a loan (US$2.9 million) to help to finance the
distribution component of the Project.
The Bank Loan Agreement became effective in April 1979; the final
closing date was June 1984, twenty-one months after the original closing date.
The delay was primarily due to late completion of the Nispero hydro plant because
of the difficult geology at the plant site. Another factor contributing to
delayed project completion was ENEE's slow action in signing a contract for a
hydro-inventory study.
The Latin American and Caribbean Region/Energy 1 prepared the Project
Completion Report (PCR), based on the Appraisal and President's reports,
supervision and consultant's reports, other documents in the Bank's files, an
incomplete final project report prepared by ENEE, and conversations with ENEE and
Bank staff. The PCR sets forth the main points with respect to the preparation,
appraisal, and implementation of the Bank-financed portion of the Project, which
was completed successfully, notwithstanding certain delays.  With   respect to the
distribution component, it is difficult to make comparisons between actually
completed and expected distribution works for the period 1980-1981.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance ar'dit
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)   but
the Project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of the draft report to the
Government, ENEE, and CABEI for comments. lowever, no comments were received
from them.

HONDURAS
NISPERO POWER PROJECT
LOAN 1629-HO
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 1629-HO (US$30.5 million) helped to finance construction of the
Nispero hydroelectric plant (22.5 MW) and the Puerto Cortes diesel plant (4 x 7.5
MW), various consultant services, and training. Credits from suppliers (US$7.5
million) helped to finance the diesel units at Puerto Cortes; and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) provided a small loan (US$0.6
million) to help cover the costs of engineering services.
Because the Project helped to meet forecast demand increases, its
achievements can be rated an overall success. Because of difficult geological
conditions at the Nispero plant (para. 3.2.1), completion of this Project,
however, required more time and financing requirements than expected. The time
overrun amounted to eighteen months and the cost overrun amounted to US$15.4
million on project components forecast at appraisal and actually completed. That
is, excluding the distribution component, the actu'al and forecast costs of the
Nispero hydro plant, the Puerto Cortes diesel plant, studies, and training were,
respectively, US$65.1 million and US$49.7 million (para. 3.5.2).
Contrary to expectations, CABEI did not provide expected financing of
US$2.9 million for the 1980-1981 distribution component of the Project (para.
3.4.1). Through self-imposed time constraints, Bank staff omitted proper
supervision of the distribution component; and ENEE did not provide information in
the project progress reports on works which the Bank was not financing. Because
of these factors, it is not possible to compare actually completed and forecast
distribution works. However, as the actual and forecast increases of electricity
sales and numbers of customers in 1980-1981 were close, much of ENEE's actual
distribution investment probably corresponded to what was expected at appraisal
(paras. 3.4.1 - 3).
Between 1979 and 1981, ENEE's financial performance was satisfactory
as measured by levels of sales and the return on net fixed assets, debt-service
coverage ratio, operating ratio, and contribution to expansion; hut in 1982 ENEE's
performace suffered some deterioration. In 1983, ENEE's rate of return recovered
almost to the level stipulated by the revenue covenant (9%). The Bank was
generally satisfied with ENEE's tariff levels and financial performance (para.
5.2.3) during implementation of the Project.
As expected at appraisal, the institutional performance of ENEE
improved slowly. ENEE has delayed implementation of consultant recommendations
for reorganizing and upgrading inventory-management and financial functions
(para. 6.2.2) because of budget and staffing problems.



HONDURAS
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (ENEE)
NISPERO POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1629-H0)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1 Bank Lending to the Sector
1.1.1    Since 1959, the Bank has made eight loans and three credits
amounting to US$235.6 million equivalent to the power sector of Honduras
(Annex 1.1). The seventh loan, 1629-1O, helped to finance the Nispero Power
Project, which is the subject of this report. Six previous loans and two
credits helped to finance the first six projects which were completed
successfully with some delays and cost overruns. The eighth loan and the
third credit, 1805-HO and 989-RO (1980: US$105.0 million and US$20.0
million) are helping to finance the Cajon project (292 MW), which is the
largest hydroelectric project in Central America.
1.2 Electric Power Sector Organization
1.2.1    ENEE is an autonomous public utility owned by the Republic of
Honduras. ENEE is the only power company in the country. No other entity
takes part in new service extensions, planning for the sector, or regulation
of the sector. ENEE's Board is composed of representatives of various
Ministries (Finance, Public Works, National Resources, and Planning), the
President of the Central Bank, and a representative of the private sector.
The Board sets policy and appoints a General Manager, who is assisted by
four Deputy Managers and the Director of the Cajon Project Unit. After
informal discussions with the highest levels of political leadership, ENEE
sets its tariff levels.
1.3 Investment Plans
1.3.1    The Cajon project and related transmission facilities are expected
to absorb the bulk of ENEE's financial resources through 1985. The current
tariff levels of ENEE are not generating adequate resources to cover fully
the financial needs of the company in 1984 or to permit ENEE to earn its
covenanted rate of return. As a partial remedy, the Bank is urging tariff
increases. Because the Government is also having fiscal problems, the
balance of ENEE's financial gap would have to be provided by new borrowings;
and ENEE is experiencing difficulties in obtaining access to new
borrowings. Financing constraints have required ENEE to defer portions of
its ongoing expansion program for transmission and distribution works.

2.1 Oriigin and Preparation of the Nispero Power Project
2.1.1         Preparation  for  Lhe  Nispero  power project began  in  1977, taking
into  account  the  findings  ot a system-optimization  study  (financed  by  the
lnterAmerican  Development Bank --  IDB) which  developed  a  least-cost sequence
of generationi additions. The study showed that, based on a comparison of
three  large  hydro  projects  (Cajon, Pemolino, and  Naranjito) and  ian
all-thermaII   a ltertiaive , th- CajonI project  (para. 1.1.1) would  bt  the  mist

the Project, ENEE's compliance was satisfactory, although the pre-feasibility
study has not yet been completed (see chapter 3 for details). With respect
to the distribution component, (capacitors, transformers, about 80 km. of
lines, etc), which CABEI, contrary to expectations, did not help to finance,
it is difficult to make a comparison between actually completed and expected
distribution works. Chapter 3 sets forth additional information on ENEE's
unsuccessful efforts to obtain the CABEI loan.
2.3.2     In 1980, the revenue covenant of the Nispero Loan Agreement was
amended to conform to the revenue covenant of the Cajon Loan Agreement
(1805-HO) which required a return of 9% rather than 8%. Because the higher
return and various related key indicators of performance governed ENEE's
tariff levels during most of the years of project execution, the actual
financial data of ENEE are compared against that which was expected at
appraisal of the Cajon Project. Except in 1982, ENEE complied with the
revenue covenant of the Cajon Power Project Loan Agreement.   Details of
ENEE's financial performance are set forth in Chapter 5.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.1 Timetable
3.1.1     Annex 3.1 sets forth actual and expected timetables for the various
project components. The timetables for the generation component are
discussed below; the timetables for the other components are discussed later
in the chapter.
3.1.2.    Construction of the generation component of the Project began in
early 1979, just about as schieduled, with mobilization at the site of Puerto
Cortes diesel units. The diesel supplier completed (September 1980) the
installation of the diesel units at Puerto Cortes about a year later than
expected due to the need to redesign the foundation footings to piles. The
redesign was required because data obtained from the initial foundation
investigations had led to the adoption of a solution (footings) which was
later found to be inappropriate for actual soil conditions.
3.1.3     Construction of the generation component ended with successful
completion of the Nispero hydro plant in September 1982, about 18 months
later than expected mainly because of construction delays resulting from
difficalt geological conditions. For example, the faulting, solution voids,
cavities, and finely crushed rock in the vicinity of the tunnel were a major



-6- -
source of delay, as extra time was needed to install extra reinforcing
materials. Further, the tunnel, for different reasons, was twice flooded
(March and June 1981), resulting in some damage and construction delays.
AdditTohiai details on the difficulties of constructing the power tunnel are
provided later in this chapter.
3.1.4     Other factors contributing to the delay were flood-caused damage to
the powerhouse (June 1981) and ENEE's slow coordination of the efforts of the
contractor and the consulting engineer to find and execute efficient
solutions to the construction  problems of the power tunnel (November 1980                       S
- June 1-981). To avoid further delay, a Bank supervision mission (August -
Septembe:r 1981) obtained ENEE's agreement to instructions to the consultant
engineering firm to improve construction supervision; and to the setting of a
target date (mid-January 1982) for the completion of certain works. Bank
dtaff carried out additional supervision (February 1982) to ensure continued
special efforts by the contractor and the consultant engineering firm to
complete the hydro plant as soon as possible. The delay in completing the
Nispero project contributed to the shortfall of sales experienced in 1982.
3.1.5     The difficult geological conditions at the Nispero plant led to
changes to the hydro plant in the form of greater amounts of materials and
excavation than expected at appraisal. These changes to the Nispero plant
are discussed below.
3.2 Increases in Amounts of Materials Used and Excavation at Nispero
3.2.1     Geological conditions at the Nispero plant site proved to be
worse than expected at appraisal -- that is, the actual solutions to
difficult geological conditions required more quantities of excavation and
materials (concrete, rock bolts, steel reinforcements, etc.) than expected.
For example, in order to prepare the power tunnel for the water pressure it
would experience during operations, the contractor, having excavated
(November 1980) about 72% of the originally expected tunnel length (2,100 m),
had had to install 243,235 Kgs. of steel supports (or 486% of the originally
expected volume of steel supports). The installation of these extra
materials delayed construction and increased the cost of the Project.
3.2.2     To help limit the rising cost and time overruns on the power
tunnel, ENEE accepted (November-December 1980) the advice of a new
engineering specialist, who recommended relocating the vertical shaft of the
power tunnel.  This change of design led to an overall increase of 100 m in
the length of the tunnel. The contractor completed excavation of the tunnel
in June 1981, after which a second vertical access shaft was completed
(August - September 1981) to assist in the placement of concrete and steel
reinforcements.    Work on the power tunnel was completed in the spring of
1982.
3.2.3     Other changes to the Nispero plant required because of geological
conditions included additional excavation works and foundation fill materials
for the closure dikes and the power house, as follows:

1/ Source:  Project progress reports provided by ENEE during the course of
project execution.
The above data provide partial answers to questions on the orders of
magnitude of material and excavation increases due to geological difficulties
at the Nispero plant site. Further, the same data indicate partially the
sources of the increases of the Project cost (which is discussed later in
this Chapter). More precise data on the effect of increased quantities of
excavation and materials, plus unit costs, are not available, as ENEE has not
responded to the Bank's repeated requests for such information. Changes to
other components of the Project are discussed below.
3.3 The Energ" Sector Organization Study
3.3.1     The studies component of the Project was changed by the deletion of
the study of the organizational needs of the Government to carry out planning
for the energy sector (para. 2.1.4). The Bank agreed (August 1982) to the
deletion because an internal advisory group of the Planning Secretariat
achieved the objectives expected of the study (which was to have been
financed by the loan). At the same time, the Bank agreed to a re-allocation
of the proceeds of the Loan to help finance the cost overrun on the Nispero
power plant. The following paragraphs provide details on CABEI's not
providing financing for the distribution component of the Project.
3.4 The Distribution Component and the Lack of CABEI Financing
3.4.1     After the signing of the Nispero Loan Agreement (December 1978),
Bank staff expected that CABEI and ENEE would successfully complete
negotiations for a loan of about US$2.9 million to help finance a
distribution program costing about US$5.1 million to be implemented during
the years 1980-1981. Following effectiveness of the Bank loan agreement
(April 1979), ENEE and CABEI held conversations over a period of several
years. These conversarions ultimately proved to be unfruitful due to CABEI's
slowly developing shortage of funds. ENEE never reported a failure of
negotiations during the years 1979-1981 as CABEI never rejected the loan
application: it simply did not complete processing of the loan application.



-8-
3.4.2     During the years 1980-1981, the expected period of implementation
for this component, ENEE increased its investment in distribution works by
US$6.2 million (as compared with US$5.1 million, the appraisal forecast).
ENEE planned, executed, and self-financed this component with its own
resources. In project progress reports sent to tin Bank, ENEE did not
include information comparing actually completed distribution works
(capacitors, transformers, and lines) with those expected at appraisal. It
is likely that ENEE saw no reason to report on the progress of works which
the Bank did not help to finance. Much of ENEE's actual distribution
investment probably corresponded to what was expected at appraisal (para.
2.1.4), as the actual and forecast increases of sales and numbers of customers
wPre close.
3.4.3     Bank staff neglected to mDnitor closely the progress of
negotiations for the expected CABEI loan and the implementation of the
expected distribution component. In 1979, because Bank staff were directing
all but a small portion of their time toward appraising the Cajon project,
they prepared no supervision report on the Nispero project. In 1980 and
1981, Bank staff supervised the Nispero and Cajon projects, paying special
attention to the technical problems of the former and the financial problems
of the latter. Consideration of these problems dominated the allowable time
for field investigation and resulted in the omission of proper supervision of
the distribution component.
3.5  Project Costs
3.5.1     Including all changes to the Project--the addition of materials and
excavation at the Nispero plant site and the deletion of the energy sector
organization study (paras. 3.2.1.-3; and para. 3.3.1)--but excluding any
actual investment for distribution (para. 3.3.3), Annex 3.2 shows that the
final cost of the Project in current prices was US$65.1 million as compared
with the appraisal forecast of US$53.0 million (excluding interest during
construction). Actual and forecast sources of financing were:
Financing
Agencies        Actual      Forecast
- ______-(in millions of USs)
IBRD             27.6         27.2
CABEI             0.6          3.5
Suppliers         7.5          6.7
ENEE             29.4         15.6
Total            65.1         53.0
3.5.2     Because of the changes to the Project, the only meaningful
comparison is between actual and forecast costs of components defined at
appraisal and subsequently completed (or contracted). As shown in the table
below, which includes no data on the distribution component of the Project,
actual and forecast costs in current prices of these elements were,
respectively, US$65.1 million and US$49.7 million-- a difference of 31.0%.
In constant 1978 prices, the actual diract cost (US$54.7 million) was about



-9-
29.9% greater than the appraisal forecast. The actual and forecast costs of
most individual Project items were close, but the poor geological conditions
at the Nispero plant site led to a substantial increase of quantities of
excavation and materials and a cost overrun on that component of US$13.7
million (in constant 1978 prices). The increase of local costs (US$11.0
million, in constant prices) constituted the overwhelming part of the cost
overrun on the Nispero plant. After allowing for the greater-than-expected
volume of excavation and materials used in the construction of the plant, it
appears that the price contingencies were reasonably forecast at appraisal:
respectively, US$10.5 million vs. US$7.7 million. The allowance for physical
contingencies was rendered inadequate because of poor geological conditions
at the Nispero project site.

3.6 Other Studies
3.6.1     Consultants completed satisfactorily the national master-plan study
for electrification and the study of ENEE's management and organization in
1980, a few months later than expected. ENEE created a Cajon Project Unit,
as recommended; but implementation of consultant recommendations for
improving the financial and administrative functions has been deferred until
completion of the Cajon Project (1805-HO) because of ENEE's budgetary and
staff constraints. The Bank agreed to this deferral.
3.6.2     In 1980 and 1981, Bank staff reviewed and approved the terms of
reference, selected engineering consultant (other than the consultant working
on the Nispero plant), and draft contract for the hydro survey and
pre-feasibility study. ENEE, however, preoccupied with the mounting cost of
the Nispero hydro plant, deferred signing the final contract. Later
(August-September 1982), the Bank agreed to ENEE's request to extend the
closing date of the Loan Agreement (to June 1983) and to re-allocate the
proceeds of the Loan. The reallocation would assist ENEE to cover the cost
of the Nispero power plant by eliminating from financing under the Loan the
hydro survey, the pre-fesibility study, and the sector-organization study
(para. 3.3.1). At that time, Bank staff understood that CABEI had declared
the hydro survey and the pre-feasibility study as        eligible for financing
under a future loan. Subsequently, CABEI did not complete loan processing
because of its own financial problem.   Faced with this new development, ENEE
successfully sought (February 1984) Bank agreement to a second extension of
the closing date (June 30, 1984) and a second re-allocation of the loan
proceeds to cover the cost of the hydro survey (Annex 3.5).
3.6.3     Engineering consultants (other than those working on the Nispero
plant) have completed the hydro inventory study, a copy of which the Bank has
requested from ENEE. Completion of the pre-feasibility study will depend
upon ENEE securing new funding. Following review by Bank staff, these
studies are expected to provide the rationale for future hydro generation
expansion after completion of the Cajon Project.
3.7 Operation of the Nispero Power Plant and the Diesel Units at Puerto
Cortes
3.7.1     After solving initial problems of operation, ENEE obtained
satisfactory performance from the Nispero power plant. The high vanadium
content of the fuel used by the Puerto Cortes diesels has caused damage to
exhaust valves, reducing the reliability of the diesel units. ENEE is
seeking to obtain compensation from the supplier who did not adequately
provide in the design for the high vanadium content.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1 Load Growth
4.1.1     The main objective of the investment Drogram, of which the Project
formed a part (para. 2.1.4), was to provide ENEE with the most economic
solution to meet its load growth between 1980 and 1983. The program was
successful in meeting this objective.
I          4.1.2      On the basis of a forecast of load growth prepared by ENEE in
connection with the Cajon project, the Bank expected total sales during the
period 1979 - 1982 of 3,320.5 GWh. Actual sales for the period amounted to
3,151.9 GWh, only 5.1Z below the appraisal forecast (Annex 4.1). Most of the
shortfall in actual sales in 1982 reflected the severe impact of world-wide
recession on the Honduran economy. The delayed completion of the Nispero
plant also contributed to the shortfall in sales (para. 3.1.4).
4.2 Least-Cost Solution
4.2.1      The staff appraisal report stated that the generation component of
the Project was the least-cost "next step" of the most economic generation
sequence. A consultant considered fifteen (15) generation installation
sequences to find the optimum hydro-thermal generation mix. These sequences
included the installation of the Cajon project (at various dam heights and
capacities), the Naranjito project (168 kW), the Remolino project (133 MW),
plus thermal units -    all in accordance with their feasible implementation
schedules. The appraisal report stated that all sequences were found to be
more costly than the one based on completion of Cajon (with about 300 XW) by
the mid-1980's which would be preceded by the installation of the diesels and
the Nispero plant. Notwithstanding the substantial cost overrun on the
Nispero hydro plant (US$1430/kW as compared with US$819/kW in 1978 prices),
the Project contributes to the least-cost solution for meeting the growing
power needs of Honduras, as the price of fuel has more than doubled in real
terms since 1978: US$170.21 per metric ton in 1983 as compared with US$78.36
per metric ton in 1978.
4.3 Rate of Return on Investment
4.3.1     The staff appraisal report included an estimated rate of return
(9%) based on the investment costs of the generation component and the costs
of associated transmission and distribution facilities. The actual rate was
about 4.6% (Annex 4.2). This low rate reflects the impact of the cost
increase of the Nispero hydro project. Tariff levels, however, have been
maintained in real terms; and have been sufficient for ENEE to comply with
the revenue covenant, except in 1982, as explained in Chapter 5.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1 Actual and Appraisal Forecast Financial Data, 1979-1982
5.1.1     Annexes 5.1 to 5.4 compare actual and appraisal forecast financial
data for the years 1979-1982 in the areas of: key financial ratios, income



-12-
statements, sources and applications of funds statements, and balance
sheets. Forecast financial data have been taken from the staff appraisal
report for the Cajon Project (dated Febrary 21, 1980; Report No. 2388-HO).
5.2 Actual and Appraisal Forecast Financial Performance, 1979-1982
5.2.1     Aided by strong sales growth and appropriate tariff increases in
1979 and 1980, ENEE's financial performance was satisfactory during the years
1979-1981, as measured by the usual indicators of financlal performance-
rate of return, debt-service coverage, operating ratio, and contribution to
expansion (Annex 5.1); but in 1982, ENEE's financial performance deteriorated
as recession and delayed completion of th- Nispero power plant adversely
affected sales and political considerations led the Government to delay
implementation of needed tariff increases with adverse results for revenues,
net operating income and internal cash generation.
5.2.2     In 19B2, ENEE's rate of return was only 6.8%, as compared with
9.2% in the previous year; and the debt-service coverage ratio declined to
1.7 (x) as compared with the expected level of 1.9 (x) and the actual ratio
of 2.2 (x) in 1981. The contribution-to-expansion ratio also declined to 13%
as compared with the expected level of 17% dnd the actual ratio of 16% in
1981. A further indication of the funding problems experienced by ENEE was
the deterioration of its current ratio (0.6 vs. 1.5) and the increase in the
average collection period (86 days vs. 54 days). This latter problem
reflected the Government's difficulties in making timely payments to ENEE for
electricity service. In 1983, a partial recovery of sales growth combined
with tariff increases permitted ENEE to earn a return of 8.8% on net average
assets revalued.
5.2.3     The table below summarizes sales, operating results, and sources
and applications of funds. Actual sales (3,151.9 GWh) were only 5.1% less
than the expected level (3,320.5). Almost the entire shortfall of sales
occurred in 1982 because of reduced demaud and delayed completion of the
Nispero power plant. Actual and forecast average revenue per kWh sold were
practically identical: Lps 0.135 vs. Lps 0.132. The decline in sales led to
a corresponding decline in operating revenues: Lps 424.8 million vs. Lps
437.2 million. Because of delays and deferrals of other parts of ENEE's
investment program (such as additional interim diesel units and the rural
electification program for the Aguan Valley), construction expenditures were
Lps 16.2 million less than expected and total funding requirements were Lps
20.2 million less than required. ENEE engaged in a larger volume of
short-term borrowing (Lps 20.9 million) than expected at appraisal mainly
because access to long-term funding became increasingly difficult. The Bank
was generally satisfied with ENEE's financial performance.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1 ENEE's Non-Financial Indicators of Performance
6.1.1     By comparing actual and forecast non-financial indicators of
performance, Annex 6.1 shows that ENEE's actual operating performance was
close to that forecast at appraisal. By 1982, actual and forecast numbers of
customers (167,442 vs. 165,966) were close, although the actual percentage of
the population with access to electricity (27%) was less than that expected
at appraisal (29%). The lower access ratio may reflect an increase of
population growth.  Actual and forecast employee/customer ratios were also
close after 1979.
6.2 Performance of Bank and ENEE Staff
6.2.1     The collaboration of Bank and ENEE staff was professional and
satisfactory. ENEE enjoyed the benefits of good top management during
preparation and implementation of this Project. ENEE staff could have
co-ordinated the efforts of the contractor and consulting engineer with
greater effectiveness during construction of the Nispero hydro plant
(para.3.1.4).
6.2.2     Improvements in administrative efficiency have come slowly.
Internal reports have been delayed from tine to time because of inadequate
computer capacity.   With the prompting of Bank staff, ENEE is planning to
acquire additional computer capacity. Inventories have consistently exceeded
appraisal forecasts. ENEE has delayed implementation of consultant
recommendations for re-organizing and upgrading administrative functions
(especially inventory management) because of budgetary and staff
considerations. Primarily because the Government has been a slow payer of
its electricity bills, levels of accounts receivable have been higher than
expected at appraisal. Significant progress in reducing overdue receivables
would require Government cooperation in the formulation and enforcement of a
payments plan as applied to itself and its entities. Government cooperation
would also be required to speed up collections from public and large private
enterprises which enjoy Government support and which are facing financing
problems.
6.2.3     During appraisal, Bank staff did not seek the opinion of an
independent second power geologist to assess the geological conditions for
the Nispero plant (para.2.1.2). With the benefit of hindsight, such
assistance might have helped to anticipate more fully the problems which
subsequently materialized. Bank staff made a contribution to help to reduce
the delays to constructing the Nispero plant (para.3.1.4); and showed
flexibility with respect to arranging financing for the hydro survey (para.
3. k. 2).
6.2.4     A combination of factors resulted in the omission of proper
supervision of the distribution component of the Project: ENEE's not
reporting on this component in project progress reports; and preoccupation



-15-
with more pressing problems on the part of Bank staff who were operating
under self-imposed time constraints during appraisal and supervision
missions. Bank staff should have supervised more closely ENEE's progress in
obtaining the proposed CABEI loan and in implementing the distribution
component. This omission of proper supervision did not have obvious adverse
consequences, as ENEE planned, executed, and financed with its own resources
a distribution expansion program which permitted growth in sales and numbers
of customers at levels very close to what was expected at appraisal (para.
3.4.2 - 3).
6.3 Performance of Consultant Staff and Suppliers
6.3.1     Except for the performance of the staff of the consulting engineer
at the Nispero plant, ENEE was satisfied with the performance of consultants.
Because of cost and time overruns, the project engineering and construction
supervision by the consulting engineer for the Nispero plant (para.3.3.1)
were judged by ENEE and Bank staff to have been less than fully
satisfactory. Except for the performance of the supplier of the Nispero
diesels, the performance of suppliers was generally satisfactory.  ENEE was
less than fully satisfied with the performance of the supplier of the Nispero
diesels because of completion delays and because of the reduced reliability
of the diesels (para. 3.1.2 and 3.7.1).
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1 Improved Project Preparation
7.1.1     Even though Bank staff had raised the physical contingencies for
the Nispero plant above the recommendations of the consulting engineer,
the cost of the project was underestimated during appraisal. This
underestimation was revealed when, due to worse-than-expected geological
conditions, substantial time and cost overruns materialized during project
execution. To avoid future underestimations of construction costs for
tunnels or dams, Bank staff should consider including a power geologist in
the appraisal team and requiring the borrower to engage an independent power
geologist or a consulting board to review the consultant's assessment of
geological/geotechnical issues before the project is appraised.
7.2 Improved Project Supervision
7.2.1     The omission by Bank staff of proper supervision of the
distribution component oF the Project resulted from self-imposed time
constraints and the consideration of more pressing problems during appraisal
and supervision missions. To avoid such omissions in the future, Bank staff
should allow adequate time in the field for a careful and through checking of
the implementation of all Project components.

Major Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
1.       Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement required ENEE to execute the
Project (except for the energy sector organization study) with due
diligence.  With reslect to the Bank-financed portion of the Project, ENEE's
complianlce with this covenant WAs satisfactory, although consultants have
not yet completed two studies. With respect to the distributlon component,
which CABEI was supposed to finance, there are questions about the degree of
compliance, sincc ENEE has nor maintained records in a manner which would
permit comparison between actual and forecast distribution investment.
P;ans. 2.3.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3 provide details on the distribution component
of thle Project.
2.       Section 4.01 of the Loan Agreement required ENEE to manage its
atfairs, maintain its financial position, plan its future expansion, and
carry on its operation in accordance with sound public utility practices
tinder the supervision of experienced and competent management and staff.
ENEE's compliance with this covenant was generally satisfactory.
3.       Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement required ENEE to seek Bank
agreement before incurring any debt, together than for money borrowed for
financing the Project, if net revenues for the year immediately preceeding
rhe incurrence of such borrowing did not exceed future debt service
requirements by 1.4 times. ENEE's compliance with this covenant was
satisfactory.
4.       Section 5.06 of the Loan Agreement required ENEE to earn at least
8-t annually on average net current assets in operation. This rate of return
was increased to 92 under the Cajon Project Loan Agreement.  ENEE's
compliance was satisfactory, except in 1982. Paras. 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 set
forth details on ENEE's low rate of rerurn in 1982.
5.       Section 5.07 of the Loan Agreement required ENEE to consult with
the Bank on any capital expenditure in  cxcess of two (2) parcent of gross
tixed assets in operation. ENEE's compliance with this covenant was
satisfactory.
b.       Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement required the Government to
take .ill actions as required to permit ENEE to comply with Sections 5.06 and
5.07 of the Loan :greement. Except for ENEE's rate-of-return shortfall in
1982, thc Government's compliance with this covenant was satisfactorv.
