1.   THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The existence of Honduran fuel resources in commercial quantities
has yet to be proven. Government and private efforts have recently focussed
on searching for coal in the departments of Francisco Morazan, Yoro, El Paraiso
and Ocotepeque 1/ and for petroleum and gas off-shore in the Caribbean. 2/
1.02      In mid-1977, ENEE retained Geonomics Inc. (USA), under the Fifth
Power Project, to evaluate the major geothermal areas of the country near
Pavana, San Ignacio, Jutiapa, La Masica, and Valle de Comayagua. The study
suffered a setback after Geonomics declared bankruptcy in December 1977.
Subsequently, ENEE contracted UN experts to continue the work, and preliminary
results are now expected for early 1979.
1.03      The country's forests represent a resource which has not yet been
fully tapped. Corporacion Hondurena de Desarrollo Forestal (COHDEFOR) is
expected to accelerate its use. This would, of course, increase production
of woodwaste, mainly at the scattered sawmills. To find a useful role for
the waste ENEE has contracted a comprehensive study by a Honduran and a USA
consulting firm (Gabinete Tecnico and Charles T. Main). ENEE expects that
modern methods of pelletizing woodwaste would make steam electric power plants
economically feasible. These plants would be mainly in rural areas and would
help to provide earlier access to electricity in such areas (para. 1.25). The
Bank is financing part of the cost of the study under Loan 1081-HO.
1.04      The major source of energy developed commercially from Honduran
resources is hydraulic. It has been used since 1909. The theoretical energy
potential was estimated by the Economic Comission for Latin America (ECLA)
at about 35,000 GWh annually based on total runoff and average head to sea
level. Two inventory studies carried out by Harza (USA) with Bank financing,
have identified sites with a potential of approximately 10,000 GWh. The first
was carried out in western Honduras in 1967. Seven sites warranting further
study were found with an average annual energy as follows: Naranjito-465 GWh,
Guacamaya-270 GWh, El Cajon-1,300 GWh, Remolino-475 GWh, Cerro Malin-1,350
GWh, Nispero-70 GWh and Cangrejal-1O0 GWh. Of these, Cerro Malin and
Cangrejal were the least attractive. The other five sites have been studied
at prefeasibility level, with Guacamaya being discarded due to adverse
I/   Coal deposits have been identified in Yoro (about one million tons of
the sub-bituminous type) and Ocotepeque (about 20 million tons). On the
basis of samples, the heat value of the coal is low and the ash content
more than 50%, making it unsuitable even for electric power generation.
2/   Petroleum prospecting has recently been resumed by foreign private
interests. Earlier investigations have given indications of petroleum
and gas deposits in non-commercial quantities in the Mosquitia region.



geological conditions. Harza has prepared a feasibility study for Nispero and
has undertaken geologic studies for Remolino. Motor Columbus (Switzerland) has
completed feasibility studies for Naranjito and El Cajon. The second inven-
tory study by Harza, 1974, covered eastern Honduras. Seven attractive sites
have been identified as follows:
Average
Project     Annual Energy
River            Site            (GWh)
Patuca          P - 1            1,110
Patuca          P - 2           2,670
Patuca          P - 3              810

Wampu           W - 3              160
Sico            s - 1              290
Sico            S - 2             360
Total                    5,590
ENEE has agreed to update these inventory studies under the proposed project
(para. 4.20). The updating would consider the effects of the six-fold increase
of fuel oil costs since 1972, the results of flood control and other hydro
project studies, and would include the preparation of a priority ranking for
the development of identified hydropower sites.
1.05      The Bank is financing, under the Sixth Project, technical assistance
by the Taiwan Power Company for a feasibility study of small hydroelectric
projects.
1.06      As a consequence of hurricane Fifi (September 1974) a master plan
study for providing flood protection for the Sula Valley is currently being
completed by Harza. The study is under the overall direction of the Ministry
of Public Works, Transportation, and Communication. Several sites for flood
control reservoirs have been identified. Use of these sites for hydroelectric
generation may also prove feasible. Recommendations are expected in early
1979.
Energy Use
1.07      Historically, Honduras has used four primary energy resources:
wood/charcoal, bagasse, petroleum and hydro power of which petroleum is
imported. Commercial energy, in 1976, was estimated to amount to about
466,000 tons of petroleum equivalent (TPE), of which about 22% was provided by
hydro power plants and the balance by petroleum products. The table below
shows the historic change in consumption pattern and the substantial relative
recent increase in hydro power use.

1.08      Honduras has the lowest primary energy consumption of the five Central
American Republics. In thousand TPE, Guatemala used 2,076, El Salvador-1,472,
Nicaragua-1,136 and Costa Rica-1,825, during 1975. As shown, the wood/charcoal
consumption continues to be high as, according to the 1974 census, about 60% of
households used this fuel. The relative use of bagasse, mainly in the sugar
mills, has decreased in favor of higher petroleum and hydro power consumption.
The higher cost after 1972 has slowed the growth of petroleum's share in the
energy supply.
1.09      The consumption pattern of the main commercial secondary energy
sources--hydro electricity, fuel oil, diesel oil, gasoline, kerosene and
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)--is shown below:

1.10      Statistics on energy use by sectors of the economy are not available.
This lack of information continues to hamper national energy policy making and
planning of energy use. The proposed energy sector organization study (para.
1.18) is expected to help develop the information base required for energy
sector planning.
Bank Group Involvement with Sector
1.11      The Bank Group has made six loans and two credits to the electric
power sector, totalling more than US$80 million, and providing a substantial
part of ENEE's financing requirements. Two projects--the fifth and sixth--
are currently in execution. The last loan (1081-HO)--US$35 million--of
January 1975, for the Sixth Power Project is financing the 46 MW extension
of the Rio Lindo hydroelectric plant, distribution system improvements, rural
electrification, studies, and training. The plant extension was placed into
full operation in March 1978, about 4 months ahead of appraisal schedule. The
rapid plant completion reflects the good cooperation of ENEE, its consultants
and the various contractors and is noteworthy considering that the large
general contract was awarded about six months later than assumed at appraisal
because only one bid was received. The CABEI-financed distribution works have
been delayed by about two years and should be completed during 1981. The
Bank-financed part of the project, as originally defined, is now estimated to
cost US$43.6 million which would be about US$3.9 million less than estimated
at appraisal, mainly because the penstock and pipeline were constructed in a
period of falling steel prices (resulting in a foreign cost reduction of about
US$2.0 million compared with appraisal estimate) and actual price escalation
was lower than assumed (6% for equipment and 4% on civil works, vs an average



of 9' and 12%, respectively). After retaining funds in the loan for contrac-
tors' claims for the Rio Lindo works, there will remain an unassigned balance
of about US$2.5 million.  The Bank has agreed that this be used by ENEE to
finance the extension of 35 kV lines (additional to those already built under
the Sixth Project) to serve areas without electricity west of the Mochito mine.
Two 35 kV lines would extend (under the Sixth Project) the inter 2onnected
system from Mochito to a new 35 kV switchyard, at the Nispero hydro site, to
which the future hydroelectric plant would be connected under the proposed
Nispero project.  Single 35 kV lines would be extended from Nispero to SaLita
Rosa de Copan and to several villages withii economic reach of the line f:rom
Mochito to Santa Rosa de Copan.  With the additioTis to the Bank-financed rural
electrificatioTn component of the Project (para. 1.28) to provide electricity
to the Santa Rosa de Copan area from ENEE's interconnected system, the Sixth
Project is expected to be completed by 1981, two years later than estimated at
appraisal. CABEI's parallel financed part of the Sixth Project has been
amended to provide for ENEE's transmission system aeeds through 1981.
1.12      About 90% of the Fifth Power Project (Loan 841-HO)--providiag funds
for 26 tW of diesels, an interconnection line to Nicaragua, a load dispatch
system, studies and training--has been successfully completed. Prolonged
discussions with Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF) of Nicaragua did
not result, as hoped, in jointly contracting a consulting firm to design the
load dispatch systems for the Honduran and Nicaraguan power companies. ENEE
has, therefore, contracted independently for the study and design of an
expanded load dispatch and communication component to provide for the system
control needs through the 1980s. For the expansion, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Special Fund is providing US$1.7 million
of the cost of the component. The 138 kV lines for the supply of the Aguan
Valley have been deleted from the Fifth Project, since the United States
Agency for InternatioTIal Development (USAID) has signed a loan agreement
to finance a comprehensive rural electrification project for the Valley (para.
1.27).
1.13      The four earlier projects have been successfully completed.  Together
they provided for (a) 94 MW thermal and hydro generation additions, including
the first two stages of the Lake Yojoa-Rio Lindo hydroelectric development (30
MW at Canaveral and 46 MW at Rio Lindo); (b) transmission expansion (particu-
larly under the Fourth Project); and (c) distribution expansions. The Project
Performauce Audit Reports for ENEE's Third and Fourth Power Projects (Sec.
M75-411 of May 30, 1975 and Sec. M78-489 of June 5, 1978, respectively)
indicate that both projects were implemented without noteworthy problems and
that the purposes of both projects were fully achieved. Weaknesses encountered
during implementation, such as ENEE's need to improve load forecasting,
continue training programs, improve administrative efficiency and reduce
accounts receivable are addressed in paragraphs 2.06, 2.08, 2.13 and 3.04 of
this report.
1.14      Purther participation by the Bank Group in helping power develop-
ment would have the following objectives: (a) improve the organization and
planning capability in the energy sector; (b) further strengthen the effi-
ciency and programs of ENEE; and relate its investments in power to projects



in other sectors (water management, agriculture, industry); (c) promote
regional international integration of the power systems; and (d) reduce the
dependency of tbe economy on imported fuel, mainly through the construction
of the proposed 300 MW El Cajon hydroelectric development.
1.15      Other international and bilateral lenders and technical assistance
agencies are cooperating with the Bank in assisting the development of the
Honduran power sector. USAID is lending to ENEE for rural electrification;
the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) is lending for
distribution; and the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB), the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) and CABEI are expected to co-finance
the El Cajon hydro power project. ECLA is preparing a regional interconnec-
tion study (para. 1.31) with the assistance of consultants (Montreal Engineering
Co. -- MONENCO -- of Canada).
Energy Sector Organization
1.16      There is no central decision-making body in Honduras to plan, make,
direct and control energy policy. The Government agencies active in the
sector are the Ministry of Natural Resources (overseeing the refinery),
Ministry of Economy (petroleum product distribution, and pricing), Ministry
of Public Works and Communications (transport companies), Corporacion
Hondurena de Desarrollo Forestal - COHDEFOR (wood/charcoal producers), and
ENEE (electricity supply).
1.17      While ENEE has cooperated well with the ininistries and government
agencies and they seem to agree with ENEE's plans and priorities, overall
energy and water resource planning and development, handled by several Government
entities, is not well organized and coordination on these matters needs to be
improved. ENEE has, in the past, viewed water resources mainly from a hydro-
electric perspective, while responsibilities for irrigation and flood control
are divided among ministries. Also, Government and ENEE staff need to increase
their knowledge and expertise in analysis, planning and implementation in
order to improve legislation, programming, project preparation, financing,
pricing, flood control, irrigation and related areas in the energy and water
sector.
1.18      The Government is aware of the need to strengthen the sector and has
agreed with the Bank to contract a consulting firm for carrying out a sector
organization review and study under agreed draft terms of reference. The study
would focus on the above problems and propose structural changes, legislation
and steps to modernize the sector and eliminate existing weaknesses, and may
lead to recommending the creation of a National Energy Commission which has
been contemplated.
Electric Power Sector
1.19      The Honduran power sector is the responsibility of Empresa Nacional
de Energia Electrica (ENEE) with no other institution either sharing that
responsibility or regulating ENEE. ENEE is a Government-owned, autonomous
institute and provides almost 100% of all public electricity service in the
country. This dominant role has been obtained through continuous acquisition



- 7 -
of privately-owned and municipal systems. Only a few small rural, municipally-
owned installations remain to be absorbed.
1.20      The Bank agrees with ENEE that the following are the priority objec-
tives in the power sector:
(a)  early and optimum use of national hydro power resources
to substitute for fuel imports by developing large projects
for the interconnected system in Honduras and regionally and
installing small hydro stations in isolated areas to reduce
or eliminate the use of small, high-cost diesels;
(b)  rehabilitation of systems in areas recently incorporated
into ENEE's main interconnected system; and
(c)  extension of the main system and creation of regional sub-
transmission systems to bring electricity to the countryside
as soon as economically feasible.
ENEE is preparing to meet these objectives through technical, economic and
management studies and training of staff for carrying out the resulting
projects.

Even though power generation is growing rapidly (it doubled in the past
five years) electricity is available only in the more densely populated
part of the country to about 21% of the population. Annual net generation
of about 168 kWh per capita (in 1975) remained low in comparison with other
Central American countries. Honduras ranked slightly above Guatemala
(155 kWh per capita) but below the other four countries in the region,
where generation per capita ranged from 239 kWh (El Salvador) to 717 kWh
(Costa Rica).
1.22      The average number of customers and energy sales for ENEE are shown
below. Annex 3, Table 3-1 shows details for ENEE's interconnected system.
Industrial sales are expected to remain about 52% of total sales; similarly,
no major changes are foreseen for the share of the other categories.

1.23      Including supply to Nicaragua, the energy generated by ENEE during
1977 amounted to 622 GWh--an increase of 11.3X over the 1976 total. About
70% of ENEE's load is industrial-commercial which contributes to the high
system load factor of about 65% annually.
Existing Facilities
1.24      In addition to about 191 MW in 2 hydro, 3 diesel and 2 gas turbine
power plants in its main system, ENEE has approximately 10 MW installed in
isolated diesel stations. ENEE's generating plant is described as follows:

The two hydro power plants are downstream from Lake Yojoa which provides annual
storage. The main system has 564 km of 138 kV and 200 km of 69 kV lines. The
line linking the ENEE and the ENALUF power systems has been built for future
230 kV operation. There are 10 major transmission substations with a total
installed capacity of about 562 MVA; 221 MVA to transform to subtransmission
level (at 69 kV and 34.5 kV) and 202 MVA to distribution level (34.5, 13.8,
4.16, 2.4 kV). Annex 4, Attachment 4-1 provides further details about the
transmission and distribution system.
Access to Service
1.25      ENEE presently provides electricity mainly in cities, via its
interconnected system. Overall, ENEE is supplying electricity to about
0.6 million people or about 75% of the inhabitants of the areas served.
Only 5 out of 26 towns served have a higher percentage of population served:



- 11 -
San Pedro Sula (96%), Puerto Cortes (85%), Santa Barbara (83%), La Ceiba
(77%), and Tegucigalpa (76%). ENEE currently serves about 21% of the total
population of the country, a considerable improvement over the 11% it served
in 1968. Since most of the population lives in small population centers
in remote areas, it will be difficult and costly to serve them with electricity
in the near future. Despite this difficulty, ENEE expects to serve about 30%
of the total population by 1983. The number of consumers is expected to
increase to about 172,000 as a result of the distribution facilities and rural
extensions being built and those included in the Project. Average annual kWh
sales per retail connection (excluding bulk sales to large customers) are
expected to grow from about 4,250 in 1978 to about 5,170 in 1983. Expected
annual goals are shown in Annex 5, Table 5-11.

1.26      To increase the number of electricity users ENEE has implemented
the following measures:
(a) A low monthly minimum bill of US$1.25 has been established,
which gives the customer the right to use up to 20 kWh.
This price makes electricity competitive with other sources
of lighting.
(b) A connection policy is being applied under which new customers
will not be charged a connection fee whenever the cost of connection
is less than US$150. When this amount is exceeded the customer
may amortize, without interest, the excess over a 24-month period.



- 12 -
(c)  Based on the policy described in (b) above, new population
centers which request a connection are not charged if the
cost of the connection averages less than US$150 per consumer
connected. Otherwise, the excess may be amortized over a
24-month period.
(d)  For the areas where potential customers exist, but have not
asked for service due to their lack of funds, ENEE has financed
the cost of interior wiring, to be recovered without interest
over a period of 18 months.
Rural Electrification
1.27      ENEE concentrated in its early years on taking over the supply
of urban areas in order to obtain the financially sound position necessary
for later absorbing the marginal rural areas. Out of 23 areas considered,
its 1971 rural electrification program established the six zones with the
best potential market and location close to ENEE's interconnected facilities.
ENEE has built about 270 km of 35 kV rural lines and has completed distri-
bution facilities in the Comayagua, Tamara and Chamelecon Valleys and in and
around La Ceiba, Tela, Puerto Cortes, Talanga, San Juan de Flores, Juticalpa,
Catacamas and in the southern zone. Most of the rural lines have been financed
by the Bank under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Projects. Beginning in 1978,
ENEE plans to undertake the electrification of the Aguan Valley, where the
Government is presently implementing an extensive program for the development
of the area. In addition to agro-industry and sawmills, the Aguan Valley
Rural Electrification Project will benefit 25,000 low-income families, for
which it will be necessary to install about 610 km of primary 35 kV and 550 km
of secondary distribution lines, 200 km of 138 kV transmission lines, five
138/35 kv substations totalling about 26 MVA and 20,000 meters. These items
will be financed with the help of a US$10 million USAID loan, with ENEE/Govern-
ment counterpart funds of US$5.6 million.
1.28      Construction of the Nispero Project will make it possible to
extend ENEE's interconnected system under the Sixth Project into western
rural areas partly supplied by isolated systems. The largest of these
systems is at Santa Rosa de Copan (950 kW capacity, about 650 kW load).
Extension of interconnected service to this town would make it possible to
serve about 17 small towns and villages en route from Mochito. Some 94 km
of three-phase and 38 km of single-phase 35 kV lines would supply about 5,500
households initially (about 25,000 people out of a population of 40,000).
Power Sector Expansion Program
1.29      Honduras' large hydro power resources are most economically
developed in plants of over 100 MW. The most economical hydro site would
be El Cajon with about 300 MW initial (and possibly 600 MW final) capacity.
Phased development of the first stage for the Honduran market alone has
been found to be uneconomical. ENEE contracted an Optimization and Tariff
Study with Ebasco Services Inc. (EBASCO-USA), under a technical assistance
loan from IDB. The study recommended the most economical pattern of system



- 13 -
expansion and determined the costs of producing electricity for development
with, and without, pooling of facilities through an interconnection with
ENALUF. The study provides a suitable basis for a decision which major hydro
power project should follow Rio Lindo and for the prices to be charged for
international power and energy interchanges. The study confirmed that El
Cajon would be the most economical next project for the interconnected ENEE-
ENALUF system expansion and that it should be built as soon as possible.
Due to the substantial savings from coordinated system expansion (US$6.2
million annually on a levelized basis) ENEE has been discussing with ENALUF
the needed revision of the existing interconnection contract.
1.30      The Optimization and Tariff Study showed that El Cajon would also be
the most economical large hydro project for the isolated Honduran market in
1985-1988. With an estimated total cost of about US$490 million, the first
stage of El Cajon will have a substantial impact on the public sector invest-
ment program. In view of slow progress in making arrangements for sale of
initial El Cajon excess capacity and energy, El Cajon appraisal has been
postponed to October 1978; this would allow for a start of major civil works
in 1979. Appraisal in late 1978 should enable financial arrangements to be
completed by the time ENEE would have to undertake substantial commitments for
the project. The proposed Nispero project would cover system requirements
through 1983; while El Cajon is being built, additional thermal generation
will be required to provide for the growth in demand in 1984-1985.
1.31      ECLA is carrying out a Central American regional interconnection
study to the year 2000 with the financial assistance of the United Nations,
IDB and CABEI. This study would provide a basis for planning the long-term
power development of the six republics on the isthmus. The national utilities
of the six countries (including ENEE) participated actively in the first stage
of the study through full-time secondment of their system planning personnel.
Completion of the second stage of the ECLA study is expected in late 1979.
The first stage indicated substantial benefits to the region from interconnected
system expansion.
Tariff Levels and Structure
1.32      The law establishing ENEE gives it the right to set its own tariffs.
At the end of 1974, R.W. Beck & Associates (USA) completed a tariff study based
on accounting costs which covered ENEE's construction and operations forecasts
up to 1978. This study recommended substantial increases in the tariffs for
various service categories (particularly the large consumers, at that time
with fixed-price contracts) and a general increase in basic tariff levels,
averaging 25%. It also recommended the application of a fuel-cost adjustment
clause designed to compensate for changes in the cost of fuel. As a condition
for Loan 1081-HO the proposed increase was put into effect in February 1975.
As discussed in para 5.02, the increase did not produce sufficient revenue to
allow ENEE to achieve the 10% rate of return agreed under prior Bank loans.



- 14 -
Present tariffs (as increased in June 1978) are shown in Annex 1, Tables 1-1
and 1-2. The following figures show ENEE's average revenues (in centavos per
kWh sold) over the last five years: 1973 - 7.445; 1974 - 7.179; 1975 - 8.984;
1976 - 9.191; and 1977 - 9.973.
1.33      The price per kWh sold stayed about constant between February 1975
and April 1977 since the fuel-cost adjustment was not applied in the inter-
connected system during that period. On balance, the adjustment would not
have been significant prior to 1977. In ENEE's interconnected system the
fuel-cost adjustment clause was put into effect in May 1977 as a consequence
of the sharp increase in fuel prices during the first quarter (Bunker C
increased 15.1% and diesel oil 8.3%) and the relative increase of thermal
generation expected for the year. The result was to raise overall receipts
per kWh sold by 8.5% over 1976 and by 11% over 1975.
1.34      In June 1978, the basic tariffs and fuel cost adjustment clause were
modified, resulting in an increase in basic tariffs of 10% and leaving the
total price to the consumer unchanged for 1978. Most of ENEE's tariffs fall
presently within Central American averages. However, for large industrial
consumers (average monthly consumption above 100,000 kWh or 195 kW with a load
factor higher than 70%), ENEE's tariffs are about the lowest in the region.
1.35      The Sixth Power Project includes a study of ENEE's tariff structure
to identify changes required to promote the most economic pattern of consump-
tion. After initial delays, Societe Francaise d'Etudes et de Realizations
d'Equipements Electriques (SOFRELEC - France) was engaged early in 1978 and
has studied the characteristics of the power market for the next five years.
SOFRELEC will base its tariff proposals on the long-term marginal cost criter-
ion, on the basis of terms of reference agreed upon with the Bank. The
proposed loan includes funds for the purchase of portable metering equipment
for sampling load characteristics of consumer categories. SOFRELEC's draft
report is expected to be ready for the appraisal of El Cajon.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.36      At the energy sector level, the major constraints are the lack of
coordination and of expertise in policy making. The Energy Sector Organization
Study (para. 1.18) included in the proposed project would identify the actions
required to address these problems.
1.37      Within the power sector, ENEE will have to continue its efforts to
strengthen its staff in order to undertake its very large expansion program.
The management and organization study (para. 4.19) and the training (para. 2.04)
components of the proposed project would assist these efforts.

2.   THE BORROWER
Legal Structure
2.01      The borrower would be the Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica
(ENEE), an autonomous public utility owned by the Government of Honduras.
ENEE was created by Decree No. 48 in 1957, as a result of the merger of
several utilities which operated isolated systems. The substance of the
Decree has not been amended in ENEE's over 20 years of existence. A
modernization of power sector legislation should be coordinated with any
energy sector legislation which may result from the Energy Sector Organiza-
tion Study (paras. 1.18 and 4.18).
2.02      ENEE is directed by a five-member board, consisting of the Ministers
of Public Works, Communications and Transport, of Natural Resources and of
Planning (CONSUPLANE) and representatives of the National Development Bank
and of the Chamber of Industries and Commerce (on behalf of the private sector).
Organization and Management
2.03      ENEE's management is entrusted to a General Manager, assisted by
three Deputy Managers and the heads of seven line divisions which are respon-
sible for Engineering, Construction, Operation of the Interconnected Generation
System, Central Distribution System, Northern Distribution System, Finances
and Accounting, and General Services. The Planning (staff) Division is respon-
sible for system expansion plans, financial forecasts, basic studies, tariff
studies and project control.
2.04      ENEE's General Manager was appointed in August 1978; he was previously
the deputy manager for construction and special projects. Most deputy managers
and division chiefs have been with ENEE for ten or more years. Further
strengthening of upper ENEE management is needed, and the proposed Organization
Study (para 2.08) would define the means and measures required. Until the
results of this study become available, ENEE is expected to engage outside
experts to provide support, as required, to management. ENEE's organization
(Annex 2, Figure 2-1) is well structured and functional; however, to improve
the efficiency of its operations and undertake its ambitious construction
program, ENEE must devote additional efforts to training of its staff, at all
levels. The proposed loan includes funds for training programs for ENEE's
middle management and professional staff.
2.05      At the beginning of 1978, ENEE had about 1,500 employees in opera-
tions and 350 in implementation of new construction, with a ratio of one
operating employee per 67 customers served (which is reasonable considering
the extent and nature of the areas served and ENEE's stage of development).
ENEE has followed the policy to maintain higher level staff salaries competi-
tive with the market. It has been able to monitor this through reports from
its external auditors, Price Waterhouse and Co.



- 16 -
Training
2.06      ENEE has given considerable attention to training its staff.  It has
sent approximately 100 technical and administrative staff abroad for training
and has also received technical assistance from utilities in Europe, Taiwan,
and North and South America. The foreign cost of these training programs was
and is mainly financed by Loans 841-HO and 1081-HO. Training would be further
supported by a US$0.30 million component in the proposed loan (para. 4.19).
To establish current training needs, a survey of ENEE's occupational structure
and a proposed training program were completed in November 1977 by the Instituto
Nacional de Formacion Profesional (INFOP) with assistance from the International
Labor Organization. The survey included a job evaluation in all ENEE depart-
ments and identified areas where training is required. ENEE is currently
implementing the recommendations of the Instituto while setting up a training
center in Tegucigalpa and organizing two programs with financial assistance
from above loans, to train staff to serve as assistant electricians and to
provide literacy training for all ENEE employees who have not completed
primary school.
2.07      Several institutions are assisting ENEE's training efforts.  ENEE
places middle level technical and office staff in special training courses
offered by INFOP. ENEE's staff receives training in design and construction
of transmission lines, maintenance and operation of hydroelectric plants and
hydrological and geotechnical techniques at the United States Bureau of
Reclamation. Comision Federal de Electricidad (Mexico) trains ENEE's staff in
operations and maintenance techniques, especially hot line maintenance of
transmission and distribution lines and safety procedures. The Honduran
Government has arranged a technical assistance with Taiwan. The Taiwan Power
Company has sent a group of specialists to Honduras for training ENEE staff
in the following areas: (a) small hydroelectric and multipurpose projects;
(b) power system planning; (c) power system operation; (d) diesel unit main-
tenance; (e) gas turbine maintenance; and (f) hydroelectric unit maintenance.
Management Systems
2.08      ENEE's management systems have been improved with the assistance of
management consultants (R.W. Beck and Associates - USA) financed under prior
Bank loans. Computer systems have been developed covering billing, collections,
inventory management and payroll. These systems are operating adequately.
Since 1975 ENEE has been using a computer model for financial planning; it has
been developed with the assistance of Motor Columbus (Switzerland). Starting
in 1976, ENEE has introduced Management by Objectives in order to achieve
greater operational efficiency. There is, however, need for improvement in
the content and timeliness of ENEE's periodic technical and financial reports,
and also in procurement, in system expansion planning, and in the organization
for project planning, programming, execution and control. In view of the
major impact that the El Cajon project will have on the organization, ENEE has
agreed to promptly engage management consultants for comprehensive organization
studies, to be focused on those areas where further strengthening is required.
A draft report of these consultants, which would particularly refer to the



- 17 -
organization arrangements needed for the execution of the El Cajon project,
would be submitted to the Bank by March 31, 1979, while a full report would be
presented by June 30, 1979. The recommendations would be reviewed with the
Bank and a schedule would be agreed for their implementation, as appropriate.
Accounting and Audit
2.09      ENEE's accounts are kept in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and provide a satisfactory basis for preparing finan-
cial statements. Internal control is carried out by an internal audit group
which reports directly to the Board of Directors and also provides services
to the General Manager. ENEE is restructuring this group with the assistance
of its external auditors (Price Waterhouse and Co.) in order to provide for
the increasing complexity of operations. An internal auditing manual is being
prepared and Price Waterhouse will help oversee the implementation of the new
procedures.
2.10      The work of ENEE's external auditors has been satisfactory, and ENEE
has agreed to continue presenting financial statements, audited by independ-
ent auditors acceptable to the Bank, within four months after the end of each
fiscal year.
2.11      The Comptroller General of the Honduran Government carries out an
additional audit of ENEE's operations which includes an annual review of
administrative management.
Billing and Collections
2.12      Implementing Section 3.04 of the Guarantee Agreement for Loan 1081-HO,
ENEE has signed an agreement with Servicio Autonomo Nacional de Acueductos y
Alcantarillados (SANAA) for the payment of SANAA's overdue accounts. This
agreement is being complied with satisfactorily.
2.13      Bills for electricity are distributed by ENEE's employees on a monthly
basis. The bills must be paid within 15 days from the date they are issued.
Accounts receivable and outstanding for 79 days at the end of 1977 amounted to
L 12.0 million (21.7% of 1977 sales revenue). This percentage includes L 8.4
million of overdue accounts, of which Government accounts amount to L 1.6
million. ENEE's information system does not produce adequate and timely data
for management of accounts receivable. ENEE is consequently developing
improved documentation and is encouraging greater use of commercial banks for
payment of bills, in order to speed collections. However, ENEE should further
improve the speed and reliability of reporting on billings, collections and
accounts receivable by customer category and the length of outstanding accounts,
so as to reduce its present collection period by 10 days over a 5-year period
as agreed in the proposed Performance Indicators (Annex 5, Table 5-11). To
achieve this objective, ENEE has engaged consultants (R.W. Beck - USA) to
review its commercial function and during negotiations has further agreed to
extend the purpose of the study to cover the handling of overdue accounts.
Beck's report would be submitted to the Bank by March 31, 1979.



- 18 -
Insurance
2.14      ENEE has insured its fixed assets against various risks.  However,
present coverage is insufficient and amounted, as of the end of 1977, to only
L 36.5 million which represents about 11% of the revalued cost of net fixed
assets; normally the figure would be between 25% and 40%. ENEE is aware of
the need for improved coverage and has agreed on terms of reference and
engaging consultants to review its insurance policy. The review will take
into account the possible risks ENEE faces and will recommend action needed.
The consultants will analyze the type of commercial arrangement and appropriate
level of coverage in each case. ENEE has agreed to implement resulting
recommendations (to be previously discussed with the Bank) by September 30,
1979.



- 19 -
3. MARKET AND MEANS TO MEET IT
Market History
3.01      Until 1975, ENEE's sales increased very rapidly, in large part as a
result of incorporation of new areas.  ENEE's interconnected system sales now
represent over 90% of the total electricity consumed in Honduras. ENEE's
service area comprises all of Honduras withi a population of about 3 million
(growing at about 2.7% annually). Approximately 32% of the population is
urban, and this percentage has been increasing in recent years.
3.02      From 1963 to 1973 the Honduran economy expanded by an average of
about 4% annually in real terms, followed by no growth in 1974-1975 because of
the damage from hurricane Fifi to agricultural production capacity and a
drought in mid-1975. The economy rebounded sharply in 1976-1977, when the GDP
growth rate was about 7%. During these periods, ENEE electricity sales grew
by 23% 1/ (1963-1973), 15% 1/ (1974-1975), and 13% (1976-1977). Annual
electricity sales growth by major service area during 1965-1977 is shown in
para. 3.05. The trend of sales for the interconnected system by major consumer
category is given in Annex 3, Table 3-1. Five-year averages of sales growth
have ranged from 13% in 1973 to 15% in 1977 over the previous five years.
Over the same period, five-year averages of growth in the numnber of customers
have ranged from 10% in 1973 to 12% in 1976.
Forecast of Requirements
3.03      The mid- and long-term outlook for economic growth in Honduras is
favorable. Basic agricultural and related production capabilities are
expanding rapidly and increase in export volume can be expected. Honduras
has a relatively low foreign debt ratio compared with other Latin American
countries. Continuing heavy inflows of development capital and an improving
export trade balance have strengthened the foreign exchar3ge reserve position.
A relatively high level of ecoaomic growth is expected during 1978-1982.
3.04      The basis for the load forecast used for the appraisal of the
Project was prepared by mtid-1976 by EBASCO (USA) as part of and to provide a
basis for the System Optimization and Tariff Study (para. 1.29). The forecast
has been revised and updated in July 1978 by MONENCO in connection with the
ECLA study (para. 1.15); it is reasonable. EBASCO's and MONENCO's forecast3
included the analysis of economic and social factors which can be expected
to influence thae country's electricity requirements.  The factors included
historical-rates of economnic development, plans for future developm!lent and
general economic outlook for Honduras and its iadustries. In particular,
EBASCO's sales forecast attempted to take into account (a) the elasticity of
1/   These high growth rates are tie result of ENEE absorbing areas previously
served by others.



- 20 -
the use of electric energy as a function of price, (b) the possible application
of incremental (marginal) rates, and (c) the impact of irrigation loads; it
analyzed in detail ENEE's sales records for 1966 through early 1976 together
withl econornic and demographic data and held discussions kith knowledgeable
Government and industry ofEicials, other economic and business inforiaatioti
sources and major ENEE customers. In addition, relationships between the
growth of the country's economy and ENEE's energy sales were correlated by
EBASCO and MONENCO and econometric forecasts made based on available economic
data and assumed future economic growth rates. The resulting sales forecast
is shown in Annex 3, Table 3-2.
3.05      MONENCO forecasted an average annual increase in total ENEE sales
of 11.2% during 1978-1990. Past and predicted ENEE annual sales growth, in
percent per annum, by major areas is as follows:
Area                       1965-1975             1976-1985
Tegucigalpa/Comayaguela              12.9                  11.6

/b   Not available as La Ceiba became part of ENEE's system in 1974.
/c   The expected increase in the growth rate is largely due to accelerating
regional agro-industrial actitvity (sugar mills, food processing) and
completion of the port at San Lorenzo.



- 21 -
Power and Energy Balance
3.06      The forecast of power and energy requirements of the ENEE total
system from 1976 through 1995 is shown in Annex 3, Table 3-3. ENEE generating
facilities supplying the Interconnected System are given above in para. 1.24.
A load-resource balance for the period 1974-1988 is shown in Annex 3, Tables
3-4 and 3-5 and indicating that acceptable reserve margins will be achieved
during 1979-1983. Though El Cajon full commissioning was assumed by June 30,
1984, the program beyond 1982 will be reviewed in connection with the appraisal
of that project (see para. 1.30).



- 22 -
4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background and Objectives
4.01      ENEE expects a rapid growth in electricity demand in existing
service areas and through incorporation of new areas presently without
public electricity supply. Its construction program through 1983--of -Which
the proposed project is a part and which includes the completion of the
expanded Fifth and Sixth Power Projects and the bulk of the construction of
the El Cajon Project--would provide the facilities required to supply the
expected demand. Failure to construct the facilities would lead to curtail-
ments of supply which would be costly to the economy and reduce industrial
growth. The program, summarized in Annex 5, Table 5-6 provides for substan-
tial construction to make public service electricity available to low-income
areas (a) in the western part of Honduras under the Sixth Project Expansion
resulting from the Nispero hydro plant which is part of the proposed project,
and (b) through the large Aguan Valley project with USAID financing. The
program shows the heavy impact on expenditures of El Cajon construction. The
program's costs were estimated by ENEE and its consultants on the basis of
generally prevailing prices as of mid-1977 and adjusted for projected infla-
tion in line with the rates given in para. 4.11.  The program's financing is
discussed in para. 5.07.
4.02      The proposed loan would be the seventh Bank operation with ENEE.
The project as shown in detail in para. 4.06 was prepared by ENEE with
the assistance of Harza and R.W. Beck. Harza's draft final report, sub-
mitted to the Bank in February 1978, supplied the basis for the field
appraisal in February 1978 by Messrs. Helmut Wieseman and Jose Lorenzo Vietti
(consultant). After negotiations, costs of the Nispero hydro power plant
and the Puerto Cortes diesel plant were updated on the basis of bid level
design estimaates.
Generation
4.03      ENEE will need further generating capacity by 1980.  The addition
under the proposed project of 30 MW of diesels by 1980 and 22.5 MU of hydro-
power by 1982 would cover requirements economnically. During the period
through 1982 ENEE intends to undertake the bulk of El Cajon construction.
If the first El Cajon unit is not completed in September 1983 (see para. 1.30)
additional capacity would be needed at that time which could be additional
diesel units, a gas turbine, or purchases from ENALUF, or a combination of all
three alternatives.  The amounts would depend on the date of the commissioning
of the hydroelectric units at El Cajon.
Transmission and Distribution
4.04      Since the early 1970s, ENEE has completed a large transmission and
distribution prograra to rehabilitate existing supply systeias. It has
extended its main 138 kV system (San Pedro Sula-Rio Lindo/Canaveral-
Tegucigalpa) to La Ceiba in the east and the Nicaraguan border ii the south
and has substantially improved the primary distribution systems in San Pedro
Sula and Tegucigalpa by conversions of existtLa  installations to 13.8 kV.



- 23 -
4.05      In addition to (a) the USAID financed 138 kV Aguan Valley line
and the associated 35 kV rural distribution and subtransmission lines and
(b) 35 kV lines west of the Mochito Mine to Nispero and Santa Rosa de Copan
areas, comparatively little reinforcements will be needed through 1983. Ttie
program provides for the 1980-1981 distribution expansion, included in the
project, and further investments in 1982-1983; CABEI is expected to finance
this expansion. Also included are the connections to the system of the Puerto
Cortes diesel plant and the Nispero hydroelectric station (with Bank financing).
ENEE has agreed to revise its substation addition program (Annex 6, Table 6-4)
in light of the results of the National Electrification Masterplan (para. 4.20).
The Project
4.06      The project would consist of the following items.
(a) Nispero 22.5 MW hydroelectric plant and its connection at the
substation (which would be built together with 35 kV line
extensions frotm Mochito via Nispero to Santa Rosa de Copan
area to be financed under the Sixth Power Project).
(b) Puerto Cortes 30 MW diesel plant and its 69 kV connection of
about 4 km of double circuit at the Puerto Cortes existing
69/13.8 kV substation into the existing 42 km 69 kV line to
the Bermejo substation near San Pedro Sula.
(c) Extension of ENEE's primary distribution system consisting
of about 80 km of 35 kV and 13.8 kV lines and about 50,000 kVA
distribution transformers in new areas in Tegucigalpa,
San Pedro Sula, La Ceiba, Tela, El Progreso and Puerto
Cortes. Installation of about 20 MVAR of capacitors to
ceduce transmission and distribution losses. Purchase of
portable metering equipment for samqpling load characteristics.
(d) Studies of: energy sector organization; ENEE manageieient,
organization and training; national electrification master
plan; hydropower inventory updating; prefeasibility of Piedras
Amarillas (P-3) hydro project in eastern Honduras.
(e) Training of ENEE management and staff.
4.07      The main objectives of the project would be to maintain the
reliability of power supply and to strengthen ENEE's function as the natiolial
electricity supplier through extensions into new service areas and improve-
ment of energy sector organization and power sector planning and training.
Nispero Hydroelectric Project
4.08      The 22.5 MW Nispero hydroelectric plant would be located on the
Palaja River near the town of Nispero, about 25 km southwest of Santa Barbara.
It would produce about 40 GWh per year of primary and 31 GWh per year of
secondary energy. Nispero would be connected to the national transmission



- 24 -
network by the two 35 kV circuits from its substation to the Mochito substation,
about 40 km northeast of Nispero. The essentially run-of-river Nispero plant
will develop about 174 m of head by diverting the river around a fall and a
series of rapids using a low earthfill dam, a 300 m canal, shaft, and 2.2 km
pressure tuaael to control the hydraulic head.  The diversion dam will Porm a
small pond, with a depth of about 5.0 m with a surface of about 0.33 km  at
elevation 599 m 3above sea level. The active storage volume would be small,
about 365,000 m , to regulate inflow during the dry season for weekday peaking
production. A gated spillway with a stilling basin will be provided at the
right end of the diversion data to protect the structures against a 100-year
flood. The power waterway would comprise a concrete-lined power canal, a
concrete intake, a concrete-lined pressure shaft and tunnel with1 a surge tank
near its downstream end, and a steel-lined tunnel and penstock leading to
the powerhouse. The overall length of the water conductor from the operating
pool to the powerhouse would be about 2.5 km. The powerplant site would be
about 1.5 km downstream of the fall on the left bank of the Palaja River.
The generating unit installed in the powerhouse would be a vertical shaft
type, directly connected to the Francis turbine, and would produce 22.5 MW
of power at design discharge.  The turbine would produce 30,150 3horsepower
under the net head of 152 m and a full gate discharge of 17.0 m /s.
Puerto Cortes Diesel Electric Plant
4.09      The 4 x 7.5 MW medium-speed diesels at Puerto Cortes would run on
heavy oil (Bunker C) to provide economical energy generation. Operating at
80 percent plant factor, the plant can produce about 210 GWh per year of firm
energy. The diesel plant, to be constructed adjacent to the Texaco Refinery,
would be connected to the existing Puerto Cortes substation by a 69 kV double
circuit transmission line of about 4 km. The generators will be connected to
a 13.8 kV bus via individual circuit breakers, and their total output would
be stepped up to 69 kV by a 35 MVA transformer. The step-up transformer
would be connected to the existing system through 3 x 69 kV circuit breaker
ring-bus substation and the above 69 kV line.
Project Cost and Financing
4.10      The project cost estimate (excluding interest during construction
and based on mid-1978 prices) is stated below. ENEE is not subject to taxes
or custom duties, which are consequently excluded.

4.11      These costs were calculated on the same basis as those for the
construction program (para. 4.01) by Harza (Item 1 and partly 7), R.W. Beck
Associates (Items 2, 3, 5 and partly 7), and ENEE (Item 4) and updated
after negotiations. They are reasonable. For reasons given in para. 4.34,
a special contingency amounting to US$1.90 million has been included in the
project cost estimate. Provisions for Nispero's physical contingencies are
15% for civil works, 25% for water conductor, 3% for electromechanical equip-
ment and transmission lines; the physical contingency allowance for the Puerto
Cortes plant and transmission is 10% of the base cost (see para. 4.33). The
engineering and administrative manpower required to execute the project have
been estimated by ENEE's consultants to aggregate 458 staffmonths of expatriate,
and 2,010 staffmonths of local engineering and administrative overhead. The
average consultant base cost was estimated at US$5,400/staffmonth. The costs
shown in above table are based on bids received for the turbine and generator
of the Nispero hydro plant and on the actual contract (para. 4.25) for the
Puerto Cortes diesel plant; the costs of other items are based on prices of
September 1977, which have been adjusted to mid-1978 levels. Price contin-
gencies were calculated using the following percentages:

1980 and after         6.0               7.0
4.12       The proposed project would be financed by a Bank loan of US$30.5 mil-
lion (which includes US$1.35 million as the special foreign cost contingency and
US$3.3 million for financial charges on the Bank loan during construction), CABEI
loans of US$3.5 million, export credits of US$6.7 million, and internal cash
generation by ENEE. Details of project financing are discussed in paragraph 5.10.
Implementation
4.13       The project implementation schedule (Annex 4, Table 4-1) envisages
that the major project components will be completed by April 1981; this is
reasonable. ENEE is currently reviewing the implementation schedule for the
studies included in the project; agreement on this schedule is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan. The schedule will be used to monitor
progress during project execution.
4.14       For the Nispero plant, the manufacture, delivery and installation
of the turbine and generator unit are on the critical path of implementation.
ENEE has contracted with a local firm the design of the improvement of the
access road to Nispero and would contract these works locally. The improvement
of the road is also a critical item. The cost of the improvement is included
in the project estimate. Maintenance expenses will be small and will be borne
by ENEE. The projected rapid construction of the Nispero plant (expected to
be commissioned in March 1981) will require the services of an international
contractor experienced in large construction projects. Participation of local
contractors is expected to be limited to subcontracts.
4.15       The implementation of the diesel plant and switchyard and its con-
struction would be under a design, supply, erect and commission contract. The
contractor would be expected to subcontract the civil works with a regionally
experienced contracting firm. Local contractors would be invited to participate
as subcontractors as applicable and after approval of ENEE. Total diesel plant
fabrication, erection and testing is estimated to be completed by late 1979.
Engineering
4.16       ENEE has engaged Harza for (a) the design, evaluation of bids, engineer-
ing and construction supervision of the Nispero plant and its connection to the
main system; and (b) is engaging it for the review of design and construction
supervision of the Puerto Cortes diesel plant. For the supervision of the



- 27 -
erection and initial operation of the diesels ENEE will use its staff which
gained experience in the installation of similar units at La Ceiba. ENEE
is also planning to engage a diesel expert from Taiwan under the technical
assistance provided to Honduras. ENEE has confirmed that it will continue
to retain satisfactory consultants for (a) and (b) above.
4.17      ENEE's own staff will carry out the engineering and supervision of
construction for the transmission and distribution expansion during 1980-1981.
This is acceptable because ENEE has proven experience in similar works
recently completed or now under construction. As is present practice, ENEE
personnel would install the substation and distribution equipment and build
the transmission and distribution lines at 69 kV and lower voltages.
Studies
4.18      The Government of Honduras has approved the draft terms of reference
prepared by the Bank for the Energy Sector Organization Study which would be
prepared under the overall direction of CONSUPLANE. A Bank energy sector
expert is scheduled to discuss in Honduras the terms of reference and help
with arrangements for contracting the respective consulting services, setting
up the Honduran working group and selection of experts to be contracted. The
study is estimated to require about 12 staffmonths at a cost of about US$75,000.
4.19      Based on terms of reference already agreed with the Bank, ENEE plans
to contract a Management and Organization Study to prepare itself for its large
expansion program and the construction of the El Cajon project. The study would
recommend applicable methods and procedures for organization and management
and estimate annual manpower and recruitment requirements for the medium term.
The study would also identify staff training needs and include recommendations
for a training program and its implementation. Disbursements for training
would not be made before the Bank and ENEE have agreed on the detailed training
program. The study would also cover the improvement of ENEE's information and
control systems, and the organizational arrangements for the execution of El
Cajon (para. 2.08). Improvement of ENEE procurement regulations would be a
priority item of the study. About 30 staffmonths of consultant tilne would be
needed at a cost of study of about US$200,000.
4.20      Realizing the need for the preparation of a comprehensive updating
of its transmission and distribution system planning for the mid and long
term, ENEE has agreed to prepare, as part of the proposed project, a
National Electrification Masterplan. This plan would use as a basis the
results of the Optimization and Tariff Study (para. 1.30). Another input
would be provided by the review and updating study of the Hydro Power
Inventory included in the proposed project. The studies would require
116 and 90 staffmonths at an estimated cost of US$0.51 million and US$0.45
million, respectively.
4.21      The most attractive hydroproject in eastern Honduras has been
identified to be near Piedras Amarillas (site P-3) on the Patuca River. Upon
ENEE's request to accommodate increased capacity needs after the commissioning
of El Cajon, the proposed project includes the financing of foreign consulting



- 28 -
services for a prefeasibility study of a hydro development at this site,
estimated to require about 80 staffmonths and to cost about US$0.4 million.
4.22      The proposed loan would also finance the foreign cost of equipment
for load surveys and load management anticipated to be required as a result of
the ongoing tariff study based on long-term marginal costs, amounting to about
US$50,000 (para. 1.35).
Procurement
4.23      Except for consultants, all equipment, materials and services
financed by the proposed loan would be procured after international competi-
tive bidding, following the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
4.24      Purchases under the CABEI parallel loan (para. 5.10(c)) would be
through competitive bidding in accordance with CABEI regulations. Honduras
is presently not a member of the Central American Common Market, therefore,
regional preferences will not apply. Locally produced wood poles for trans-
mission and distribution lines are expected to be competitive. Consequently,
local suppliers would be given a margin of preference of 15%, or the applicable
import duty, whichever is lower. The cost of the poles to be financed by the
Bank is estimated at about US$50,000.
4.25      To avoid delaying the installation of the Puerto Cortes diesels,
the Bank agreed in mid-1977 that ENEE could initiate their procurement. A
contract was placed with Alsthom (France) in August 1978 after international
competitive bidding. The bid evaluation for the Nispero turbine and generator
is in progress and the bids for the Nispero civil works have been invited.
Disbursements
4.26      Disbursements from the loan account will finance:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and
materials (including installation and supervision) for Puerto
Cortes diesel plant.
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and
materials or 85% of the ex-factory cost (i.e., excluding
local taxes) of locally manufactured equipment and materials
for other project elements.
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for civil works and installation
for the Nispero and Puerto Cortes plants and the 69 kV line
to the Puerto Cortes Plant.
(d)  100% of total expenditures for consultant's services.
(e) 100% of foreign expenditures for the training program.
(f) Interest and other charges on the Bank loan accrued to
September 14, 1981.



- 29 -
Disbursements would be made against standard documentation. Retroactive
financing of US$2.4 million is recommended:
(i) for financing of down and progress payments made after
August 1, 1978 for equipment purchases for the Puerto
Cortes Plant (about US$2.2 million); and
(ii) for payments for design and consulting engineering
services made after February 15, 1978 (about US$0.2
million).
To have the diesel plant in operation as needed, ENEE has awarded the order
for the diesel units, using bridge financing for foreign currency costs not
provided by suppliers' credit.
4.27      It has been agreed that, prior to disbursements for consultants'
services for the Energy Sector Organization Study, ENEE will submit proposals
acceptable to the Bank for the disbursement and repayment arrangements with
CONSUPLANE.

4.29      The closing date for the proposed loan would be September 30, 1982.

Environment
4.30      There are no major environmental risks resulting from the proposed
project.  The Nispero reservoir is very small (para. 4.08); only about 10
families will need to be relocated and ENEE has agreed to provide a program
satisfactory to the Bank for implementing resettlement and compensation and
for preventing new settlements in the area to be flooded. ENEE agreed to
carry out the project with due regard to ecological and environmental factors,
including implementation of (a) erosion control and watershed protection
measures, and (b) the vaccination program required in connection with Nispero
access road construction. During negotiations the following agreements for
environmental and related actions listed in the consultants' recommendations
were reached:

control                                     Jan.  1980       Dec.  1981 /1
(ii) construction of personnel

(v)  study of possible subsistence fishery    Jan.  1980          June  1980
/1   This work will need to be periodically repeated during project life.
4.31      The diesel plant will be located next to thie Texaco refinery,
remote from the population centers of Puerto Cortes. The diesels will have
silencers since there are some houses along the road passing the plant site.
Fuel is expected to be piped from the refinery to small, daily storage fuel
tanks; this would reduce the fire hazard. Overall air quality should not
be notably affected since prevailing northeasterly breezes will carry any
plant emission (of the diesel plant) away from the town and out to sea.
4.32      The loan documents provide for appropriate undertakings on popula-
tion relocation, and periodic inspection of reservoirs and related works.
Project Risks and Uncertainties
4.33      The physical contingencies should be adequate to cover the project
risks associated with the proposed project. Harza claims to have sufficient
drilling data on the geology of Nispero to reduce to 15% the physical contingency
for the 2.5 km power tunnel to the powerhouse; however, the appraisal is based



- 31 -
on a 25% physical contingency to provide for complex geology and zones of
potential natural gas and high water inflows. Nispero dam, dikes, intake canal,
and other structures are relatively small and should not give rise to concern
about their safety. Any leakage from the small reservoir due to karst should
be minor and the physical contingencies of 15% should provide sufficient
margin for controlling it. The physical contingencies of 10% for the diesels
would provide sufficient funds for piled foundations.
4.34      The major risk for Nispero plant implementation, because of the
plant's small size, would be a possibly low interest of international contrac-
tors to bid on the civil and erection works. If ICB does not produce acceptable
bids, delay of project completion could result as a contractor may have to be
engaged by invitation and negotiation of a contract. In view of the upcoming
construction of El Cajon (for which international contractors have been
prequalified) there may, however, be a greater interest in the contracting
community to obtain previous local experience through participation in the
Nispero construction. The special contingency allowance in the proposed loan
provides US$1.35 million to be used only if ENEE is not able to obtain respon-
sive bids within the Nispero cost estimate; it would be cancelled to the
extent to which it would not be required to cover this contingency.

5. FINANCE
Introduction
5.01      ENEE's financial history over the last five years has not been
totally satisfactory because tariff action did not keep up with costs which
rose rapidly, in large measure as a result of higher fuel costs. However,
there are no signs of deterioration in the current financial structure of the
enterprise, which was strengthened as a result of a revaluation of assets as
of December 31, 1977, carried out in the course of this appraisal. ENEE
investments for the period 1978-1981, when the bulk of expenditure on the
proposed Nispero project would take place, are forecast at L 627.5 million,
with that project accounting for 17% of the total. The principal component
(64%) of the ENEE investment program for the period would be El Cajon, assumed
to be commissioned in 1983-1984, while the balance is composed of the funds
required for completion of the Fifth and Sixth Power Projects and for other
investments. Current financial projections -- which will have to be revised
after the El Cajon appraisal to reflect the updated increased cost and
construction schedule and final decision on the date of commissioning of El
Cajon -- are based on tariffs designed to achieve an 8% return on net revalued
assets in operation. ENEE's actual and forecast financial statements are
shown in Annex 5. (Table references in this chapter relate to that Annex.)
Earnings History
5.02      In recent years, ENEE's financial performance has shown a gradual
decline. Forecasts made during appraisal of the Sixth Power Project (which
covered the period 1974-1977) were not met fully. Energy sales were 6.8%
below expectations. Operating revenues were also lower than estimated,
although, owing to application of the fuel adjustment clause, the gap was
smaller. The greatest difference was in the area of operating income, 38%
lower on the average than projected. The reduction in income can be attri-
buted to the fact that, in 1972-1977, sales revenue rose by 160%, less than
operating costs (excluding depreciation) which increased by 251%. Half the
increase in operating costs was the result of a very sharp rise in ENEE's
fuel costs, from US$0.4 million in 1972 to US$6.2 million in 1977. A rise
in revenue in 1975, following a tariff increase of 25%, was not sufficient
to correct the problem. In consequence, ENEE failed to achieve the 10%
rate of return agreed upon under previous Bank loans, and its rate of return
was 7.7% in 1975, 7.5% in 1976, and 8.9% in 1977 (Tables 5-1 and 5-2). On
annually revalued assets, however, the rates of return would have been about
7.2% in 1975, 5.9% in 1976, and 5.5% in 1977.
5.03      As a result of the situation described in the foregoing paragraph,
debt service coverage achieved during the period 1974-1977 was less than
projected, averaging 1.3 times compared to the 1.8 times expected at appraisal.
Lower than expected internal cash generation led to the need for additional
borrowing, which increased debt service obligations further.
5.04      After revaluing its assets as of December 31, 1973 in 1975, ENEE
failed to do so again until late 1977. For purposes of appraisal, assets
have been revalued annually for the period 1974-1976.  Estimated data for the



- 33 -
1977 revaluation were prepared by the appraisal mission. ENEE has now agreed
to the principle of annual asset revaluation, which is incorporated in the
proposed loan agreement. ENEE has also agreed to incorporate the results of
the revaluation into the accounting records, following approval by its external
auditors, starting with the 1978 financial statements.
Financial Structure
5.05      The asset revaluation carried out for purposes of appraisal,
significantly strengthened ENEE's financial structure by establishing the
actual investment in ENEE's facilities on which its future revenues will be
based. As of December 31, 1977, the situation was as follows (for details see
also Table 5-4):

Total                            388.2                 100
5.06      ENEE's principal creditor is the Bank; in 1977, the Bank's five
loans amounted to L 111.9 million (66% of total gross long-term debt and
equivalent to 29% of total assets). The second largest creditor is the
Government, with L 17.9 million consisting of relent proceeds of IDA credits
(11%) followed by the Central Bank of Honduras with L 15.4 million (9% of
total gross long-term debt), and CABEI with L 13.8 million (8%) -- see Table
5-7.
Investment and Financing Plans
5.07      Investments making up the program planned for 1978-1981, which
include interest during construction and an estimated increase in working
capital needs, amount to L 643 million, of which L 107.6 million, or 17%,
correspond to the Nispero Power Project. El Cajon is the largest component
of the program (based on commissioning in 1983-1984), calling for an invest-
ment of L 400.1 million or 62% of the total. The investment program and
proposed financing plan for the 1978-1981 period (detailed in Table 5-3) is
summarized as follows:

- 35 -
5.08      ENEE's net internal cash generation would finance L 89 million
or 14% of total requirements. While low, this contribution is acceptable
in view of the size of ENEE's investment program during this period (particu-
larly the expenditures on El Cajon) which will satisfy capacity requirements
through the late 1980s. If ENEE had opted for the second best alternative to
El Cajon (construction of diesel plants), it would have been able to finance
more than 30% of its investment requirements with net internal cash generation.
Government contributions for El Cajon, and to a small extent resources from
the Rural Electrification Fund, would amount to L 99 million, or 15% of
requirements.
5.09      The remaining 71% of the 1978-1981 program will be covered by loans
amounting to L 455 million (US$227 million). Of this figure, US$31 million
will come from the undisbursed proceeds of loans for the Fifth and Sixth
Power Projects. Loans for the proposed project would total US$41 million,
of which US$39 million will be disbursed during the 1978-1981 period. The
initial El Cajon works and other investments would require loan disbursements
totalling US$156 million. Recent ENEE contacts with various banks, develop-
ment agencies, other financial institutions and suppliers show that there
is interest in providing financing for El Cajon.
5.10      Total financial requirements for the Nispero Power Project are put
at L 115.9 million;l/ L 34.5 million of this will be financed by ENEE from
internally generated funds. It is proposed to finance the balance of L 81.4
million (US$40.7 million), which will be 95% of the foreign exchange require-
ments, as follows:
(a)  The proposed US$30.5 million Bank loan, which would would have a
maturity of 20 years, including a five-year grace period; these are
standard terms for Honduras. For projection purposes, an annual
interest rate of 7.35% has been assumed;
(b)  ENEE has obtained a suppliers' credit from Banque Nationale de Paris
(to partially cover the foreign exchange cost of four diesel engines
and generators) amounting to US$6.7 million with a maturity of 8
years, including a 2 year grace period, at a fixed annual interest
rate of 7.5%; and
(c)  CABEI would make two loans covering the foreign exchange costs:
(1) of engineering and design for the Nispero hydroelectric power
station (L 1.2 million); and (2) of works during the period 1980-1981
to expand distribution facilities and continue rural electrification
(L 5.8 million). Both loans would be granted on similar terms --
maturity of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period, at an expected
8% interest rate. ENEE has advised the Bank that the first of the
loans has been approved, that the second has been declared eligible
for financing by CABEI and that the latter is expected to be approved
during November 1978.
1/   L 106 million (as shown in para. 4.10, line 12); plus interest during
construction on the Bank loan (L 6.6 million) and the CABEI loan and
suppliers' credits (L 3.3 million).



- 36 -
Financing of interest during construction by the proposed Bank loan is
justified in view of ENEE's large investment program. As a condition of
effectiveness, ENEE should provide the Bank the documentary evidence showing
that the first CABEI loan has been approved, and that the second CABEI loan
has been declared eligible or, alternatively, that other satisfactory arrange-
ments have been made to provide equivalent financing. Documentary evidence
for the arrangements for ENEE's additional foreign exchange needs should also
be provided prior to loan effectiveness.
5.11      The main unresolved issue in connection with the 1978-1981 program
is the timing of El Cajon. Because alternative investments would be less
capital intensive, ENEE's financing plan should become more manageable if
commissioning of El Cajon is delayed beyond the assumed date of 1983-1984.
The assumed timing was used for purposes of appraising the Nispero project;
but, as noted in para 1.30, a somewhat later date now appears probable. In
view of ENEE's large expansion program, ENEE has agreed that during project
execution it will inform the Bank on its proposals for capital expenditures
involving aggregate expenditures in excess of 2% of its gross fixed assets and
provide the Bank with a report showing that such capital expenditures are
economically justified and financially sound; the Government has agreed that
it will ensure that the power expansion programs will be economically justified
and soundly financed so as not to adversely affect ENEE's operations.
5.12      The US$156 million future borrowings in the financing plan include
modest medium-term loans in 1979 of L 3.4 million (US$1.7 million), to cover
local currency requirements for completion of the Fifth and Sixth Power
Projects, and for the transmission and distribution project in the Aguan
Valley. Given the net cash generation projected after 1980, ENEE should
have no difficulty in securing these loans, which are expected to be provided
by local banks. For 1978, the plan includes a loan of L 8.8 million (US$4.4
million), which has already been granted by the Central Bank of Honduras and
which would provide bridge financing for the Puerto Cortes diesel plant until
the Bank loan becomes effective.
Future Finances
5.13      As agreed during negotiations, present financial projections are
based on the assumption that ENEE tariffs will be adjusted to achieve an 8%
return on average net revalued assets in operation. This level of tariffs
would be reasonably close to the marginal cost of supply (para. 6.11) and
would enable ENEE to make an acceptable contribution to the 1978-1981 invest-
ment program and to maintain a balanced financial situation as reflected in
debt service coverage, debt/equity and current ratios throughout the period.
ENEE has also agreed to maintain tariffs sufficient to achieve an 8% return on
its average annually revalued net assets in operation starting with 1979. 1/
1/   This would amend the existing covenant on Loan 1081-HO, which establishes
a 10% rate of return on revalued assets without specifying the periodicity
of the revaluation.



- 37 -
Effective June 1, 1978, tariffs were increased 10%, fully offsetting loss of
fuel adjustment clause revenues. In 1979, modest tariff increases (averaging
about 3%) will be required; and the Government has confirmed that it plans to
implement them.
5.14      As under previous loans, ENEE has agreed to retain all earnings
for investment in its facilities. ENEE has also agreed to repeat the covenant
under previous loans which requires it to obtain the Bank's concurrence before
borrowing if its internal cash generation is less than 1.4 times its maximum
future debt service requirement.
5.15      The financial position as measured by the debt/equity ratio (46/54
in 1977) is maintained at safe levels throughout the project period (see
Table 5-1); despite the heavy borrowing required for construction of El Cajon
it would not exceed 55/45. Debt-service coverage would average 1.3 over the
period 1978-1983 (see Table 5-3) which, given the size of ENEE's investment
efforts, may be considered acceptable. This would imply that the Bank's
concurrence will have to be obtained on the financial arrangements for the El
Cajon project (para. 5.14). The current position would be tight, but is
expected to improve significantly over the projection period.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      The power and energy balances (para. 3.06) indicate that additional
generating capacity is needed to meet the increasing demand for electricity
after 1980. Studies by ENEE and its consultants have shown that the expected
load growth from 1980 to 1983 would be met at least cost by adding 30 MW of
diesel power at Puerto Cortes for operation in early 1980, and 22.5 MW of
hydroelectric power at Nispero for operation by mid-1981. As a result of
Nispero's favorable location in western Honduras, 35 kV transmission facilities
can economically be extended to serve many towns west of Nispero. The recom-
mended program also serves the long range objectives of system development, as
the diesel plant in Puerto Cortes will provide reserve capacity for the
northern area in the future.
6.02      The Optimization and Tariff Study (para. 1.30) for the development
of the ENEE main system during 1982-1995, considered some 15 generation
installation sequences, to find the optimum hydro-thermal generation mix.
These sequences included, in addition to El Cajon--at various dam heights--
the installation of other hydro electric projects in accordance with their
then feasible implementation schedule (Naranjito with 168 MW for commissioning
not sooner than 1982 and Remolino with 133 MW for 1986). All sequences
were found to be more costly than the one based on completion of El Cajon
(with 300 MW) by the mid-1980s which would be preceded by the installation
of Nispero and diesels. The second best sequence would consist exclusively
of thermal plants in the 1978-1988 period.
6.03      The only identified hydroelectric project of significant size in
Honduras, other than Nispero, that could be built in time for operation prior
to 1982, would be a third unit at the Canaveral hydroelectric power plant.
It could add 15 MW of capacity but would not provide any additional energy
while construction costs would be similar to those of Nispero. The expansion
of the Canaveral powerplant was therefore not deemed as attractive as Nispero.
For the Nispero hydroelectric project several layouts were studied and the
proposed layout chosen as the least-cost alternative.
6.04      The thermal alternatives considered included a 33 MW oil-fired
steam electric unit, which could not be in operation before 1982 and was
found to be more costly than 33 MW of diesels while providing less avail-
able capacity. The recommended expansion program (diesels/Nispero) would
also be lower in cost than alternative programs consisting of a combination
of gas turbines or medium-speed diesels for discount rates up to 11.4%.
6.05      Substitution of the proposed ENEE addition of diesels and the
Nispero plant by imports of power and energy from ENALUF over the existing
interconnection in the required amounts would not be feasible during 1980-
1983, since ENALUF will not have capacity and energy for sale to Honduras on
a firm basis.



- 39 -
6.06      The basic assumptions for the least-cost analysis are stated in
Annex 6, Tables 6-1 to 6-3. An analysis of the sensitivity of the least-cost
solution to changes in the major elements of uncertainty affecting the choice
of investments (construction and fuel costs) shows that an increase in the
construction costs of Nispero of 8% (about equal to the proposed special
contingency) would reduce the equalizing discount rate between the proposed
program and the next best alternative from 11.4% to 10.0%. A reduction of
2% annually in real terms in the cost of fuel over the life of the project
would reduce the equalizing discount rate to 9.7%. The analysis of the
sensitivity of the least-cost solution with regard to other changes is
summarized in Annex 6, Figures 6-1 and 6-2.
6.07      Analysis of the sensitivity of the equalizing discount rate for the
proposed expansion program, compared with the next best alternative, to a long-
term increase in fuel costs showed the following results:
Annual Relative Rate
of Increase of       Equalizing Dis-
Fuel Costs, %        count Rate, %
-2                    9.7
0                   11.4
2                   13.3
4                   15.4
6                   17.6
As real fuel costs are expected to increase over the long term, Nispero--
if appearing marginally economical at present fuel prices--is likely to be
the most economical alternative even without considering the reduction in
the cost of the electrification of villages in western Honduras, due to
Nispero's location.
6.08      No reasonable alternative exists for most of the transmission
and distribution lines included in the construction program and the Project.
ENEE has or will select the location of substation additions (Annex 6, Table
6-4) and routing of lines on the basis of load requirements and least-cost,
consistent with standard transformer sizes and use of released smaller trans-
formers to serve smaller loads.
6.09      The opportunity cost of capital for Honduras is estimated to be
between 9 and 11%, in real terms. The above sensitivity analysis consequently
shows that the project elements are chosen on an economically sound basis.



- 40 -
Return on Investment
6.10      The rate of return has been calculated as the discount rate which
equates the streams of costs and benefits associated with the Project over
its useful life. The costs include investment and operating costs of the
additional generation facilities (Nispero and diesels), transmission facili-
ties to connect this generation to the interconnected system (including
Nispero 35 kV connection to be financed under the Sixth Project) and the
associated distribution. The benefits were measured in terms of revenues
at the average 1982 tariffs (L 0.135/kWh) used in the financial projections
(Annex 5, Table 5-2) deflated at the 8% annual inflation rate of local costs
(assumed in the projections) to mid-1978 (L 0.0992/kWh). Details are given
in Annex 6, Table 6-5. The rate of return would be, on respective generation,
transmission and distribution investment in connection with (a) Puerto Cortes
diesels 8%; (b) Nispero hydro plant 10%; and (c) both projects combined
(the Project equivalent) 9%. If the Nispero investment costs increase by 10%
(about the amount of the special contingency) the return on the Nispero plant
would decrease to 9% and for both plants combined to 8%. Higher costs would
affect the economic viability of the Project much less than a 10% reduction in
average tariffs (to L 0.0902/kWh), as shown below:
Rates of Return based on Deflated 1982 avg. ENEE Tariffs

(b) Revenue                                  8.8    10.0    11.2
Puerto Cortes Diesels and Nispero Hydro Plant, Combined
(a) Investment Cost      11.4      10.7     10.0      9.0     8.0      7.6      7.2
(b) Revenue                                  6.9      9.0    10.9
6.11      The above confirms that ENEE will need to periodically increase its
tariffs to achieve a somewhat higher return on annually revalued assets then
8% in order to cover, on the average, the marginal cost of supply. The size



- 41 -
of such increases would be based on a longer-term financing plan to be
developed in the course of the appraisal of the El Cajon project. It should
be noted that the above returns understate to some degree the economic rate
of return as revenues from the sales of electricity may not fully measure
some of the social benefits to residential and public users or the indirect
benefits to the economy through the multiplier effect on industry and commerce,
whose production and employment of workers depend on readily available elec-
tricity supply.

7.  SUMMARY OF PROPOSED AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with Government and
ENEE, as applicable, on the following principal points:
(a)  The Government, through CONSUPLANE, will carry out an Energy
Sector Organization Study and will review with the Bank the
resulting recommendations (paras. 1.18 and 4.18).
(b)  ENEE will engage management consultants for a comprehensive Manage-
ment and Organization Study, which will inter alia cover the organi-
zational arrangements for the construction of the El Cajon project,
as well as procurement, information systems, management staffing and
training. A partial draft report, focussing on the organizational
arrangements for El Cajon, is to be submitted by March 31, 1979,
and a full draft report by June 30, 1979 (paras. 2.08 and 4.19).
(c)  ENEE will continue to engage independent external auditors and
submit to the Bank its audited financial statements within four
months after the end of its fiscal year (para. 2.10).
(d)  ENEE will complete the ongoing study of its billing, collection
and related commercial functions and submit the consultant's report
on these matters by March 31, 1979 (para. 2.13).
(e)  ENEE will review--under terms of reference already agreed--its
insurance policy and implement the recommendations, to be agreed
with the Bank, by September 30, 1979 (para. 2.14).
(f)  ENEE will continue to engage satisfactory consultants for the
design, engineering, evaluation of bids, construction super-
vision and carrying out of the major project components
(para. 4.16).
(g)  ENEE will prepare, as part of the proposed project, a National
Electrification Masterplan, a study updating the hydropower
inventory, and a prefeasibility study of the Piedras Amarillas
hydro power development on the Patuca River (paras. 4.20 and 4.21).
(h)  ENEE and the Government, as applicable, will implement--according
to an agreed timetable--the consultant's recommendations contained
in the Nispero Project Feasibility Report on environmental and
related actions, such as erosion protection, vaccination program,
sediment reduction, mosquito and snail vector control, resettle-
ment and adequate compensation for families to be relocated, and
study of possible subsistence fishery (para. 4.30).
(i)  ENEE will cause its dams, reservoirs margins, associated
structures, earthworks and waterways to be periodically
inspected and, by December 31, 1978, will present a program
for this undertaking (para. 4.32).



- 43 -
(j) ENEE will revalue its fixed assets annually, and incorporate
the results of said revaluation to its financial statements,
starting with those corresponding to 1978 (para. 5.04).
(k) ENEE will inform the Bank prior to any major capital expenditure
and furnish a report showing that such project is economically
justified, and that adequate financing is available (para. 5.11).
(1) The Government shall coordinate power expansion in the sector
and ensure that it is based on economically justified programs,
that financing will be available on terms that will not adversely
affect ENEE's financial condition, and that the project is within
ENEE's managerial and technical capacity (para. 5.11).
(m)  Starting in 1979, ENEE and the Government will take all tariff
actions necessary to achieve a rate of return of 8% on ENEE's
revalued net assets in operation (para. 5.13).
(n) ENEE will not incur any long-term debt without consulting the
Bank unless the ratio of its gross internal cash generation
to maximum debt service (exclusive of interest during construc-
tion financed by the proceeds of any loan under which said
interest was accrued) exceeds 1.4 (para. 5.14).
(o) ENEE will retain all earnings for investment in its facilities
(para. 5.14).
7.02      Before declaring the loan effective, the Bank should:
(a) reach agreement with ENEE on a timetable for the studies
which it is to perform (para. 4.13).
(b) receive evidence that the proposed loan for the Nispero engineering
consultant services has been approved by CABEI, and also that CABEI
has declared eligible the proposed second loan for ENEE's 1980-1981
distribution program or, alternative to the latter, that other
satisfactory financing arrangements have been made (para. 5.10).
(c) receive evidence that satisfactory arrangements have been made to
provide ENEE with other external financing requirements (para.
5.10).
7.03      The following are conditions for disbursement for the respective
portions of the loan:
(a) in relation to the training program: agreement with the Bank on the
program's content based on the results of the Management and Organi-
zation Study (para. 4.19).



- 44 -
(b) in relation to the Sector Organization Study: acceptable contractual
arrangements between ENEE and the Government for the transfer of the
corresponding loan proceeds and their repayment (para. 4.27).
7.04      Retroactive financing of US$2.4 million is recommended for progress
payments made after August 1, 1978 for equipment purchases for the Puerto Cortes
plant (about US$2.2 million) and consulting engineering services after February
15, 1978 (about US$0.2 million) (para. 4.26).
7.05      With the above agreements, the project constitutes a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$30.5 million equivalent. The loan would be repaid over
a period of 20 years, including 5 years of grace.

ENEE's
Transmission and Distribution Facilities
1.        ENEE's transmission system configuration is radial, except for loops
in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa areas. The total length of the 138 kV trans-
mission system is 564 km including the 60 km interconnection line from Pavana
to the Nicaraguan border. There are ten major transmission substations:
Pavana in the south; Santa Fe and Suyapa in Tegucigalpa; Canaveral and Rio
Lindo at the hydro plants; La Puerta, Progreso and Bermejo in San Pedro Sula
area; Tela and La Ceiba in the north-west. Two distribution substations are tap-
ped from the 138 kV line between Santa Fe and Canaveral to serve Comayagua and
Siguatepeque. Two 69 kV subtransmission systems, in San Pedro Sula area
and at Tegucigalpa, have a total length of about 200 km. A new substation
will be built in 1978, tapping the 138 kV line Rio Lindo-La Puerta to supply
industrial and irrigation load south of San Pedro Sula at 35 kV.
2.        ENEE has distribution systems in twelve principal areas of the inter-
connected system. Tegucigalpa is served from a 69 kV loop which is fed from
Santa Fe and Suyapa transmission substations. The loop provides power to the
Miraflores, La Leona and El Centro substations supplying primary 13.8 and 4 kV
feeders; El Centro's 4 kV feeders will be changed to 13.8 kV in 1978. Santa
Fe substation has three 35 kV feeders to serve rural loads. San Pedro Sula
is presently supplied from La Puerta and Bermejo substations. Both substations
step down from 138 kV to 69 kV to supply the northern 69 kV system, and from
69 kV to 13.8 kV for primary distribution. In 1978 a new substation will be
built to step down from 138 to 13.8 kV to supply central San Pedro Sula. At
present La Ceiba has one substation with 4 kV feeders; another similar one to
be installed in 1978. Tela is fed by a substation using 35 kV for rural and
suburban areas and 4 kV for the town. La Lima and Progreso are fed from a
radial 69 kV line from La Puerta. La Lima has a 2.4 kV and Progreso a 13.8 kV
system. A 138/69 kV transformer will be added in 1978 at Progreso substation
to supply a 69 kV line to connect with the line from La Puerta to form a loop,
and another to serve irrigation loads in the area. Puerto Cortes is fed from
a 69 kV loop originating at Bermejo and has a 69/13.8 kV transformation.
Siguatepegue and Comayagua are both fed from step-down substations tapped from
the 138 kV line between Canaveral and Santa Fe. Siguatepeque uses 13.8 kV
and Comayagua 35 kV to supply the towns and surrounding rural areas.
San Lorenzo and Choluteca are fed from Pavana substation with a 35 kV radial
line. Each town will have one 35 kV feeder for rural and suburban areas and
two 4 kV feeders for the town. Nacaome is a small town fed by a 4 kV feeder
from the San Lorenzo substation. The feeder will be converted to 35 kV to
supply nearby small towns also.
3.        ENEE isolated systems are generally at 2.4 kV and fed from diesel
plants in Danli, El Paraiso, Amapala, Juticalpa, Catacamas, Marcala, La
Esperanza, Ocotepeque, Santa Rosa de Copan, Corquin, San Marcos de Colon,
and Trujillo.

1.         This annex provides details on the recent and prospective financial
performance of ENEE, which support the summary analysis presented in chapter 5
of the text. Thie annex includes the following tables.

2.         The 1978/83 financial forecasts included in this annex were prepared
by-Bank staff based on forecasts prepared in February 1978 by ENEE and on
supplementary information received through September 1978. It should be noted
that the El Cajon project is assumed to come into operation in 1983, and that
this project's cost and construction schedule are based on Motor Columbus
revised feasibility study of December 1977. These assumptions are expected
to be revised after the  appraisal   of   the El Cajon project.

8/ Forecast on the basis of a gradual reduction of the number of days' sales receivable from 77 in 1978 to 67 in 1983.
e/ Inventories as of the end of 1977 exceeded operational requirements due to the fact that ENEE had to purchase spare parts in large lots to obtain delivery.
In 1980 and 1981 spares for the Puerto Cortes plant are assumed to be purchased.  Thereafter, inventories are assumed to remain approximately
constant.
/ This account is assumed to decrease as expansion studies and training are charged to fixed assets. Forecast data assume that only prepaid expenses would
be included in this account.
