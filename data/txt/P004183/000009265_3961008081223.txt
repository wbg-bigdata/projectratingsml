SOUTHERN PROVINCES ELECTRIFICATION PRO.JECT
[Credit No. 1826-LAJ
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Southern Provinces
Electrification Project (SPE) in the Lao PDR, for which Credit 1826-LA in the amount of
SDR 19.8 million (US$26.15 million equivalent) was approved on June 23, 1987 and
made effective on March 16, 1988.
The Credit was closed, after two extensions, on December 31, 1994. The original
Closing Date was June 30, 1993. The first extension date was March 31, 1994. Final
disbursement took place on August 28, 1995 at which time a balance of SDR 512,993.27
was canceled. There was no cofinancier for the Project.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Paul Rabe, consultant under the supervision of John
Irving, Senior Power Engineer in the Infrastructure Operations Division of Country
Department I, East Asia and Pacific Region. It was reviewed by J. Shivakumar, Division
Chief, Infrastructure Operations Division, and Mohammad Farhandi, Project Advisor.
The Borrower provided comments that are included as appendices to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun in March, 1994 with a request to the Borrower
for a project evaluation report. In May 1995 the Electricite do Laos (EDL), with the
assistance of Tata Consulting Engineers submitted its own ICR providing a summary of
the project. A Bank completion mission comprising Messrs. Nielson and Smith visited
Laos in July, 1995 to discuss the draft ICR with EDL. This final ICR is based on
material in the project file and information from the Borrower's evaluation report and
was cleared by EDL for submission to the BoarJ on October 26., 1995.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN PROVINCES ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
[Credit No. 1826-LA]
Evaluation Summary
Inrduction
1.          Since the late 1960s, the Bank Group has had sporadic involvement in the
Lao power sector, beginning with its administration of a development fund to construct
the first phase of the Nam Ngum Hydroelectric Project, which was completed in 1971.
In 1982, the Bank provided US$15 million (Credit 1197-LA) for construction of the third
and final phase of the Nam Ngum plant. As part of the Bank's Agricultural Rural
Development Phase III Project (Credit 1021-LA), approved in 1980, a consultant
conducted feasibility studies to determine electricity demand and assess the least cost
alternatives for the development of future electricity supplies in the southem provinces.
Based on these studies, the Government requested that the Bank finance the foreign
exchange portion of the Southern Provinces Electrification Project (SPE).
Project Objectives
2.          The original objectives of the SPE were to: 1) create an infrastructure for
electricity supply in the southem provinces of Savannakhet, Champassak and Saravane;
2) support the further economic development of these provinces, together with other
intemational financial institutions; 3) provide electricity to households, schools,
cooperatives, hospitals, etc. in these areas to improve the quality of life; and 4) strengthen
the institutions functioning in the power subsector, particularly Electricite du Laos (EdL)
and, through EdL, the southern provincial electric power authorities.
3.           Project components included:
1) an interconnection to the Thai grid at Sirindhorn by a 11 5kV transmission line
from Xeset hydro station in Saravane province. The line would serve as the
source to supply electricity to the areas being electrified in Champassak and
Saravane provinces and also to evacuate to Thailand residual power from
Xeset hydro station;



2) a l l5kV/22kV substation at Pakse, a new 22 kV substation at Saravane, and
modification of the existing 22 kV substation at Savannakhet;
3) electrification of rural and urban areas in all three southern provinces, using
22kV  medium  voltage lines and 400V/230V  distribution lines.  Four
warehouses, one factory to produce concrete pre-stressed poles, and one
wooden pole treatment factory would be constructed for this purpose;
4) a prefeasibility/feasibility study for a future hydroelectric project development
in the southern provinces;
5) a detailed feasibility study for the upgrading and extension of the existing
Selabam hydro station by about 2 MW and the implementation of that
extension if proven feasible, and if so, engineering and preparation of the
hydroelectric development determined by the study to be the most feasible
altemative;
6) an institutional development technical assistance program for EdL and the
provincial electric power authorities, including an Organization and
Management Study (O&M Study), and equipment for communications,
metering and loss reduction, and billing and office equipment; and
7) consultant services for detailed engineering and construction supervision for
the implementation of the aforementioned projects.
4.           The following loan covenants were agreed to promote achievement of
Project objectives:
a) The Governuent/EdL shall maintain sound accounting records for all
disbursements under the Credit, including those of special accounts, and such
records shall be made available for IDA review;
b) EdL shall adequately prepare and maintain records and accounts to reflect its
operation and financial condition. These shall be audited, and the certified
copies furnished to IDA. EdL shall also follow sound administrative,
financial and engineering practices in its operations as in public sector
organizations of similar nature;
c) EdL shall generate in each fiscal year funds from its intemal sources
equivalent to not less than 20% of the annual average of EdL's capital
expenditures;



iv
d) EdL shall not incur any debt without IDA's concurrence unless reasonable
forecasts of revenues and expenditures show that net revenue of the fiscal year
is at least 1. I times the estimated debt service requirements.
5.           SPE's objectives were highly relevant to both the development needs of
the southern provinces and the Government's development priorities as specified in its
Second Five-Year Plan (1986-1990), which were to improve the electricity infrastructure
of the South. Project objectives were clear as well as realistic.
Implementation Experience and Results
6.           The Project substantially achieved its main objectives of creating an
infrastructure for electricity supply in the three southern provinces and strengthening the
institutions functioning in the power sector, particularly EdL. It also contributed to its
two other objectives, of improving the local quality of life through widespread provision
of electricity and of supporting indirectly the further economic development of the three
southem provinces. Historical statistics for the project area are given in Table 5c.
7.           SPE's electrification component provides a strong base for future
development in the Lao power sector, and is likely to be sustainable. The EIRR of 21.9%
obtained for the electrification of Savannakhet province and is satisfactory and exceeds
appraisal estimates. The EIRR of 9.3% for the Champassak and Saravane provinces
component, as against the appraisal estimate of 11%, is due to circumstances not
anticipated at appraisal, but is likely to increase in the future so long as the Xeset power
plant in Saravane province is able to generate the full 181 GWh envisaged at appraisal,
and so long as there is growth of the conmnercial and industrial sectors in the two
provinces. The sustainability of SPE's institutional achievements is also likely. Project
achievements enjoy the strong, ongoing comnnitment of the Government and EdL. SPE's
institutional development program has helped to strengthen EdL's accounting and finance
capacity, and information and organizational systems, and lays the basis for EdL's
financial viability. EdL's purchase in 1991 of the assets, liabilities and businesses of the
five provincial electricity authorities, moreover, ensures the operational and commercial
efficiency of power supply in the southern provinces.  Further progress is needed,
however, in strengthening EdL's capacity. The institutional development component,
therefore, is being continued under the Provincial Grid Integration Project (Cr. 2425-LA),
which covers the central and southern provinces.
8.           The Project was completed after two extensions, first to allow  for
contingencies relating to the 3 MW extension works for the Selabam plant, and second to
enable EdL to complete payments covering the final variation orders for the extension of
Selabam. However, there were no major difficulties during implementation, and the
Project proceeded smoothly from beginning to end. The Project was completed within
project cost estimates: SAR estimates put total Project cost at US$32.3 million, and
actual cost amounted to US$30.4 million. Total foreign exchange cost amounted to



v
US$25.88 million as against US$26.15 estimated at appraisal. Credit disbursements were
somewhat slower in the first two years but picked up during the remaining three years.
The date of final disbursement was November 1, 1994.
9.           Factors that had an adverse affect on the outcome of the Project's
objectives included: 1) the failure of the Sedone river development study to yield a
feasible future hydroelectric project for the southern provinces, without which the further
expansion of the Selabam plant beyond the addition of a 3MW unit was not deemed
desirable; and 2) the cancellation of the communications program from the Project due to
a shortage of funds. Provision has been made in the Provincial Grid Integration Project
for EdL to acquire a telecom-munications system to improve its communications with the
southern provincial power branches.
10.         One and a half years after starting the operation of the Selabam
hydroelectric power station, EdL is experiencing operational problems due to debris and
sediments being deposited in the inlet channel. This seems to be caused by the absence
of a log-boom in front of the inlet. EdL is also concemed that the bottom gabions are
breaking up. It appears important that protective measures be introduced as soon as
possible to avoid further deterioration and protracted shut-downs and to clear and repair
the inlet channel.
11.         Bank performance was satisfactory, as was the perforrnance of the
Borrower and consultants involved with the Project. Bank advice on EdL's financial and
accounting systems contributed to streamlined recording and reporting procedures and
helped EdL to effectively handle credit disbursements and monitor the retums on its
investments. The working relationship between IDA and EdL staff at all levels was
always very cordial and conducive to cooperation. EdL staff initially had limited
experience, but gained considerable experience in fieldwork. A number of EdL engineers
were trained in construction supervision and management. Consultants were closely
associated with the Project from project formulation to evaluation stage, and provided
important supervisory, training and technical assistance.
12.         SPE's achievements have been highly satisfactory. All Project objectives
were substantially met, and Project outcomes are likely to be sustainable, particularly as
three of its major components, southem region electrification, improving system
efficiency and EdL's institutional development, are being further developed in the
Provincial Grid Integration Project.
Key Lessons Learned and Future Operations
12.         The most important findings of SPE's implementation experience were
that: 1) EdL's relatively inexperienced staff needs to be supplemented with technical
assistance; 2) EdL needs control over the development, implementation, and operation of
the systems being developed under intemationally-financed projects; and 3) that EdL's



vi
past informal practices for managing operations and implementing projects need to be
supplemented with more formal systems and procedures, modem  technology, and
commnunications facilities.
13.         The follow-up project, the Provincial Grid Integration Project, builds on
the infrastructure and institutional achievements of SPE. It acknowledges SPE's lessons
by incorporating the following arrangements in its structure: 1) a project management
consultancy; 2) a provision that EdL acquire those provincial utilities which it does not
already own and which will receive benefits from the Provincial Grid Integration Project;
and 3) a far-reaching institutional development program that builds on the efforts made
under SPE and has a special emphasis on developing skills and capabilities at the
provincial level.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN PROVINCES ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
[Credit No. 1826-LAl
Part I: Project Implementation Assessment
1.    Project Objectives and Description
1.1         Project Objectives: The objectives of the Project, as stated in the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR), were to:
1) create an infrastructure for electricity supply in the southemn provinces of
Savannakhet, Champassak and Saravane;
2) support the further economic development of these provinces, together with
other international financial institutions;
3) provide electricity to households, schools, cooperatives, hospitals, etc. in these
areas to improve the quality of life; and
4) strengthen the institutions functioning in the power subsector, particularly
Electricite du Laos (EdL) and, through EdL, the southem provincial electric
power authorities, by formalizing institutional arrangements for management
and cost recovery of the expanding system, and by developing formal
managerial and operational systems and procedures.
1.2         In light of the fact that the shortage of reliable power and its distribution,
and the finance required to provide it, have been major obstacles to the development of
the southern provinces, SPE's objectives were highly relevant to both the Lao PDR and
the Government's development priorities (para. 2.1). The Project's rationale was that it
would: 1) provide much needed capital in a Project consistent with the Lao PDR's
economic development strategy; and 2) strengthen the institutions engaged in the power
sector through a comprehensive organization, management and finance study and an
action program for implementing the study's recommendations. The clarity and direct
relevance of the Project objectives ensured that they could be easily met.



2
1.3         Project Description: The Project comprised:
1) an interconnection to the Thai grid at Sirindhorn by a II 5kV transmission line
from Xeset hydro station in Saravane province. The Xeset power project was
jointly financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Swedish
International Development Authority (SIDA) and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP). The line would serve as the source to supply
electricity to the areas being electrified in Champassak and Saravane
provinces and also to export to Thailand residual power from Xeset hydro
station;
2) a I15kV/22kV substation at Pakse, a new 22 kV substation at Saravane, and
modification of the existing 22 kV substation at Savannakhet;
3) electrification of rural and urban areas in all three southern provinces, using
22kV  medium  voltage lines and 400V/230V  distribution lines.  Four
warehouses, one factory to produce concrete pre-stressed poles, and one
wooden pole treatment factory would be constructed for this purpose;
4) a prefeasibility/feasibility study for a future hydroelectric project development
in the southern provinces;
5) a detailed feasibility study for the upgrading and extension of the existing
Selabam hydro station by about 2 MW and the implementation of that
extension if proven feasible, and if so, engineering and preparation of the
hydroelectric development determined by the study to be the most feasible
altemative;
6) an institutional development technical assistance program for EdL and the
provincial electric power authorities, including an Organization and
Management Study (O&M Study), and equipment for communications,
metering and loss reduction, and billing and office equipment; and
7) consultant services for detailed engineering and construction supervision for
the implementation of the aforementioned projects.
1.4         The primary risk identified at appraisal was delay caused by acquisition of
land. No other unusual or inherent risks were cited.
2.    Project Background
2.1          Since the late 1960s, the Bank Group has had sporadic involvement in the
Lao power sector. Assistance began with the Bank's administration of a development



3
fund, financed by eight countries, to construct the first phase of the Nam Ngum
Hydroelectric Project, which was completed in 1971. In 1982, the Bank provided US$15
million (Cr. 1197-LA) for construction of the third and final phase of the Nam Ngum
plant. As part of the Bank-'s Agricultural Rehabilitation and Development Phase III
Project (Cr. 1021-LA), approved in 1980, a consultant conducted feasibility studies to
determine electricity demand and assess the least cost alternatives for the development of
future electricity supplies in the southern provinces.
2.2          The demand forecasts under the Southern Provinces of Laos Rural
Electrification Study conducted for EdL (at that time called the Department of Electrical
Energy) between August 1981 and April 1983 concluded that electrification of the
southern provinces was sparse and insufficient to meet growing demand, due to limited
local facility for generating electrical energy. One of the only main sources of power in
the region was the Selabam hydro station near Pakse, whose output was restricted to
1,500kW because of faulty design and siltation. Greater availability of electricity is a
necessary requirement for further economic development of the southern provinces.
Under its Second Five-Year Plan (1986-1990), the Govenmment gave high priority to
improving the electricity infrastructure of the South, with the aim of achieving the
following objectives: 1) developing small and medium sized power stations to reduce
dependence on imported energy supplies for remote areas; 2) exporting surplus power to
Thailand to earn additional foreign exchange; 3) replacing imported kerosene and diesel
fuel with electricity to achieve cost reductions and savings in foreign exchange; 4)
increasing food production with electric pump irrigation schemes; and 5) permitting
development of agro-based industries, such as rice mills, coffee processing industries, and
saw mills. Based on these aforementioned studies, the Govemment requested that the
Bank finance the foreign exchange portion of the SPE.
3.    Achievement of Project Objectives
3.1          Objective: Creating an Infrastructure for Electricity SupplY. The SPE
substantially achieved its major objective of creating an infrastructure for electricity
supply in the three southern provinces.
•  A 115kV transmission line between Xeset and Chong Mek on the Thai grid was
completed, after a delay of six months to obtain environmental clearances for the 12
km section of the line connecting the Xeset plant with the EGAT regional grid in
Thailand.
.  Three 22kV  medium  voltage transmission lines, one each in Savannakhet,
Champassak and Saravane, were built along with three 400V/230V distribution lines
in each of the provinces.
*  Five sub-stations, at Pakse (115/22kV), Xeset (l15kV), Selabam (22kV), Saravane
(22kV), and Savannakhet (22kV) were constructed.



4
. Two pole factories (one for concrete poles and one for wood poles) and four
warehouses (at Pakse, Saravane, Selabam, and Savannakhet) were completed.
*  The existing Selabam hydropower station on the Sedone river was expanded by one
3MW generating unit. The expanded plant came on line in December, 1993.
*  When it became clear that some US$450,000 would remain unspent under the Project
after all expenditures and commitments were accounted for, EdL suggested that some
of these savings be used to reinforce an access road for the Selabam plant that was
damaged in adverse weather. EdL also requested funds for the backfilling of an area
in the vicinity of the plant and for the reinforcement of the transmission linkage to the
Champassak network. The Bank agreed that these three additional works were
consistent with the Project's objectives and would enable more efficient operation of
facilities built under the Project, and it therefore consented to EdL's request. The
additional works were begun in October, 1993 by the same consultant responsible for
the Selabarn plant and cost approximately US$350,000. They were completed in
December, 1993.
3.2           _Jective: Supporting the Further Economic Development of the Southem
Provinces.  Electrification of the southern provinces through the SPE Project has
contributed to increased conmmercial activity in local markets. The growth in the number
of power connections and revenues from consumption outstrips population growth by a
factor of 3 to 8 in the provinces. Revenues from domestic consumption accounted for 41-
43% of total revenues, while revenues from commercial consumers account for 22-33%
of total revenues. Industrial consumption accounts for 6-10% of total revenues.
Consumption and revenues from the agriculture sector are negligible at less than 1% of
the total. The 115kV interconnection of Xeset to the Thai grid has made possible the
export of power to Thailand, and the consequent foreign exchange and savings in import
costs of fuel will stimulate overall development in the Lao PDR.
3.3         Objective: Improving the Local Quality of Life through Provision of
Electricity to Households. Schools. Cooperatives and Hospitals. etc. As a result of SPE,
electrification was brought to 147 villages and 8,354 households, which is substantially
along the lines of electrification targets at appraisal (Appendix 4). A socio-economic
survey was undertaken during the preparation of the Project in 1983. In light of the
Project largely meeting its targets and growth in the number of connections and in
consumption outstripping population growth by a factor of 3 to 8, EdL did not consider it
necessary to follow up with a post-project socio-economic survey to verify the socio-
economic impact. Actual electricity consumption by residences, businesses, public
services and industry in the three southern provinces in 1994 has substantially grown
during the last few years and has on the whole greatly surpassed appraisal estimates
(Appendices 5-6). The only exception, consumption for agriculture, has been lower than
at appraisal.



3.4          Objective: Strengthening Institutions Functioning in the Power Sector.
The institutional development component of the Project had substantial success in
helping to strengthen EdL, particularly, and made a valuable contribution to helping EdL
control its growth in a period when its scope was broadening rapidly.  The
implementation of this component of SPE was awarded to two different consultants.
As part of the financial accounting. budget and controls program of the institutional
development component, the first consultant codified accounting practices and
procedures at EdL through the preparation of operational manuals covering financial
accounting, project accounting, budgets and financial forecasts. EdL operations and
management staff were given a comprehensive training program in Vientiane and the
provinces. A team of senior accountants was given six-weeks of on-the-job training
in the consultant's home country on the subject of electric power utilities. EdL
received a financial projection model to review present performance and formulate
future plans.   Although EdL's accounting function has become marginally
satisfactory, considerable further technical issistance is needed to enable upgrading at
the provincial subsidiaries, and to improve headquarters staff understanding of the
techniques involved in consolidating the accounts of disaggregated units. Therefore,
training in finance and accounting is being continued under the Provincial Grid
Integration Project.
* As part of the technical program, the first consultant evaluated EdL's communications
system with regard to areas for technical improvement. The consultant also studied
EdL's metering and billing practices. The third area covered under this component
was EdL's distribution system. EdL created a loss reduction unit headed by a Deputy
General Manager and including 22 technical staff responsible for implementing an
action plan and coordinating with billing services. A new meter testing facility was
installed in early 1990. EdL agreed with the ADB on a scheduled implementation of
measures with regard to improving the condition of meters. With the consultant's
assistance, EdL analyzed distribution networks in order to identify technical losses in
the system and the adequacy of networks in future years. Following improved
consumer metering, distribution losses in 1991 have stabilized to around 16%
compared with 23% in 1985, which is still considered too high, however. The loss
reduction program is therefore being continued under the Provincial Grid Integration
Project (para. 5.1), and will be extended to other provinces in the Lao PDR. In
addition, the Governnent adopted reasonable rates for domestic consumption, as well
as an appropriate approach to future increases. As of July 1, 1992, EdL's domestic
rates were raised to an average of about US¢3.61kWh, which amnounted to a 15%
increase in EdL's export earnings and was enough to assure compliance with the
revenue covenants in 1992 and 1993.
* A Computer Software Applications program was added to the Project's institutional
development component in 1990. The first consultant augmented EdL's computer



6
systems, and provided EdL with several new or modified commercial and managerial
software programs to handle billing and collection, general ledger, fixed assets,
purchases, personnel information, payroll, and accounts payable. EdL acquired a
micro-computer and a number of personal computers and was provided training by
the consultant. The Provincial Grid Integration Project provides for additional
purchases of equipment and software once EdL clearly defines its future
requirements.
An Q&M Study was implemented by the second consultant starting in June, 1990,
and focused on developing EdL's policies, regulations, systems, procedures, and
guidelines needed to enable it to function as a decentralized national utility. The
O&M Study paid particular attention to EdL's management infornation systems;
administrative and operating procedures; organizational structure; human resources;
and planning. The Study will be continued under the Provincial Grid Integration
Project.   Following  a dialogue  with  EdL  management, the  consultant's
recomrnendations have started to be incorporated in EdL's procedures.
-  With regard to strengthening the southem provincial electric power authorities, EdL
surpassed expectations expressed under the Project's loan conditions. Instead of
merely taking functional control over the provincial distribution utilities, as agreed at
appraisal, in early 1991 EdL acquired outright the assets, liabilities and businesses of
those five utilities within the agreed timeframe.
4.    Imllementation Record and Ma*or Factors Affecting the Pro*ect
4.1          There were no major difficulties during implementation, and the Project
proceeded smoothly from beginning to end. EdL implemented the Project satisfactorily
and reasonably close to schedule. The institutional development component was also
implemented successfully, despite EdL's initial delay in recruiting full-time financial
accounting staff and consultants to train them. The Project's power networks were
constructed within project cost estimates. The Project's first extension, to March 31,
1994, was to allow for contingencies relating to the extension works for Selabam, such as
the delays in obtaining critically needed cement (see below). But due to component
failure, regular operation of the Selabam plant was possible only after June, 1994. The
second extension, to December 31, 1994, was approved to enable EdL to complete
payments covering the final variation orders for the 3MW extension of the Selabarn plant.
Other factors which affected implementation included the following:
Factors subject to government control:
* The agreement between the Thai and Lao governments to open the border at
Chongmek to move Project-related equipment and materials for Xeset and SPE
projects took more time than expected and became effective after January 26, 1989.



7
*  The opening of the letter of credit for the various supply contracts took about 2-3
months due to procedural delays in EdL, the Government and the Lao Bank, resulting
in extensions of deliveries. EdL has since streamlined its procedures in order to effect
letters of credit more quick-ly for future projects.
Factors not subject to govemment control:
*  EGAT experienced a six-month delay in obtaining right of way clearances for the 12
km stretch of the transmission line within Thailand.
*  The supply package for insulators and hardware was delayed, mainly because the
transportation of materials from India and other countries was inefficiently managed
by the supplier. This affected completion of the construction program of 22kV lines
and village electrification.
* The Thai company responsible for the turnkey contracts for the PSC pole factory,
wood pole treatment factory and warehouses underwent a major reorganization that
resulted in a total change of personnel halfway through the contract. This affected
progress on the work site and delayed completion until December, 1992. Minor
unfinished work on certain items was completed by EdL.
*  Thai companies (who were awarded most of the contracts to supply materials and for
turnkey construction) were not able to fully appreciate ICB procedures. This resulted
in delays with bid analyses and order placements, and necessitated additional efforts
to make sure specific requirements were adhered to, especially with regard to
expediting and vendor drawing reviews.
.  Construction of concrete poles was delayed due to the original Thai supplier's
inability to supply the necessary materials because of market price fluctuations and
due to an unanticipated Thai Govenmment ban on the export of cement, as a result of
which the supplier could only supply 5% of the total contracted amount. The ICB
contract for cement had to be terminated halfway through, and procurement of the
additional 3,000 tons of cement required was finally handled through international
shopping at market rates and at regular intervals.
4.2          Major factors that affected the outcome of the Project included the
following:
* The Sedone river development study failed to yield a feasible future hydroelectric
project for the southem provinces. Based on a ranking study reviewed by a Bank
mission in February, 1990, the Bank- estimated that Sedone 2, upstream on the Sedone
river from Selabam, would be the most promising site for the development of a future
medium-sized hydroelectric project to further extend capacity in the southern
provinces.  However, the consultants who were commissioned to undertake a



8
feasibility study concluded in a Project Formulation Report issued in October, 1990
that the developmeTt ot the Sedone 2 site was unlikely to be economically or
financially feasible, and the hydroelectric project was abandoned until further notice.
With the abandonment of the Sedone 2 site as an option, the further expansion of the
Selabam plant beyond the addition of a 3MW unit was not deemed desirable.
*  The addition, towards the end of the Project, of two components to the Selabam hydro
station not envisaged at appraisal: the construction of an access road to the plant and
the reinforcement of the transmission linkage to the Champassak network (para. 3. 1).
*  The communications component called for the provision of radio facilities to improve
communication between EdL and the southern provincial power authorities. But the
scope of this component was in'iiaiLy scaled down and finally dropped from the
Project altogether due to a shortage of funds after making allowances for the Selabam
extension. The communications program is now being incorporated in the follow-up
Provincial Grid Integration Project (Cr. 2425-LA), where US$2.3 million has been
allotted for EdL to acquire telecommunications equipment to improve system
efficiency.
5.    Project Sustainabilitv
5.1          The infrastructure set up under SPE for the electrification of the southern
provinces provides a strong base for future development in the Lao power sector, and is
likely to be sustainable. EdL is already implementing the next phase in this area, with the
Provincial Grid Integration Project. The EIRR of 21.9% obtained for the electrification
of Savannakhet province (Table 5) exceeds appraisal estimates and is satisfactory. The
EIRR of 9.3% for the Champassak and Saravane provinces component, which is below
the appraisal estimate of 11%, is due to circumstances not anticipated at appraisal,
including: 1) the higher than expected capital cost of the ADB/SIDA/UNDP-financed
Xeset power project in Saravane province, which increased from US$27.8 million at
appraisal to US$52.7 million; 2) the smaller than expected generating output from Xeset
(142 Gwh against 181 Gwh at appraisal) as a result of diversion of upstream water for
irrigation purposes; and 3) the extension of Selabam by 3 MW instead of the 2 MW
estimated at appraisal, and the ensuing higher capital costs involved (US$5.9 million
instead of US$3.74). However, the EIRR for the Champassak and Saravane works is
likely to improve in the future as a result of Lao government measures to arrange for
alternative water sources for irrigation. If Xeset is able to generate the full 181 Gwh
envisaged at appraisal, then the two provinces' EIRR is estimated to increase to 10. 124%,
which is considered reasonable for this sub-project. With the growth of the commercial
and industrial sectors in the next few years, the EIRR for these two provinces is expected
to increase further.
5.2          As far as technical viability, EdL inspectors have expressed some concern
about the operational capability of the Selabam hydro plant, and have reservations about
*a 



9
the hydrology assumptions in light of the low river flows to date. There is also some
question about whether 1) the measures taken to prevent floating material are adequate,
and 2) the intake design is sufficient to meet siltation build-up. The design of the inlet
was, after simulation modeling, designed to deposit silt in the special channel
downstream of the inlet and to pass debris and logs to the west of this silt channel. The
experience during the last one and a half years of operation, however, has been that large
volumes of debris and logs and some silt are being channeled into the inlet channel with
the result that the plant has been shut down for more than a month to clear the debris and
silt. In addition, the gabion bottom lining has started to decompose. It appears that debris
gets stuck in spaces between the rocks and pressure from water and other debris pries
blocks out from the gabions. Construction of a log-boom was discussed during the
construction of the plant but no conclusion was reached while thie contractor was still on
site. It is desirable that a log-boom be constructed urgently, possibly funded by the
Provincial Grid Integration Project.
5.3          The sustainability of SPE's institutional achievements is also likely.
Project achievements enjoy the strong, ongoing commitment of the Government and EdL.
SPE's institutional development program helped to strengthen EdL's accounting and
finance capacity, and information and organizational systems, at a time when its activities
became increasingly complex and geographically dispersed. The Project's assistance in
preventing distribution losses and in adjusting domestic tariffs helped to lay the basis for
EdL's financial viability. EdL's purchase in 1991 of the assets, liabilities and businesses
of the five provincial electricity authorities, moreover, ensures the operational and
commercial efficiency of power supply in the southern provinces. EdL has been using
the experience gained in working successfully with the Bank on SPE to assist
implementing agencies with other IDA-financed projects in the Lao PDR. The Provincial
Grid Integration Project is furthering the SPE's key objectives of electrifying the southem
region and improving system efficiency, and will continue EdL's institutional
development in the areas of equipment, material and services, technical assistance for
upgrading the skills of EdL staff and its training capabilities.
6.    Bank Performance
6.1          Bank performance was satisfactory. Periodic IDA missions assisted EdL
throughout all stages of the Project. Bank advice on EdL's financial and accounting
systems has contributed to streamlined recording and reporting procedures and has helped
EdL to effectively handle credit disbursements and monitor the returns on its investments.
IDA staff maintained very cordial relations with EdL and Government officials during
missions.
7.    Borrower and Consultants' Performance
7.1          Overall Borrower performance was satisfactory, considering the limited
experience of EdL staff. EdL staff at all levels, including those in the provinces, always



10
cooperated fully with visiting IDA  missions and consultants.  EdL staff gained
considerable experience in fieldwork, and a number of enoineers were trained in
construction supervision and management.
7.2          Consultant performance was satisfactory. Consultants were closely
associated with the Project from project formulation stage until evaluation. Consultants
participated in all important IDA review missions of the Project; supervised construction
and commissioned work; provided EdL with essential training and guidance, as well as
technical and administrative assistance; and assisted EdL with the preparation of the
Borrower's ICR.
8.    Assessment of Outcome
8. I         SPE's achievements have been highly satisfactory. All Project objectives
were substantially met, and Project outcomes are likely to be sustainable, particularly as
three of its major components, southern region electrification, improving system
efficiency and EdL's institutional development, are being further developed in the
Provincial Grid Integration Project.
9.    Future Operations
9.1          The Provincial Grid Integration Project (Cr. 2425-LA) was approved in
1992 and became effective in July, 1993. It builds on the progress made by SPE by
extending electricity supply to consumers in both the southem and central Lao provinces;
improving the quality of the power supply; developing additional power export prospects
for the Lao PDR; and continuing EdL's institutional development and system efficiency
improvement efforts.
9.2          During a 1994 Bank mission it was agreed that the next IDA lending
operation should include components to 1) extend the scope of EdU's distribution
networks; 2) construct the first stage of EdL's future EHV transmission system; and 3)
provide institutional support to: a) review EdL's role in promoting and managing the
development of hydroelectric capacity and develop an investment plan to meet its needs;
b) further strengthen EdL's distribution operations to provide EdL staff with resources to
meet their local needs; and c) improve efficiency on the demand side.
10.   Key Lessons Learned
10.1        The most significant lessons learned from the Project's implementation are
the following:
1) While EdL is effective at implementing IDA-financed projects, its relatively
inexperienced staff needs to be supplemented with technical assistance and
continuous training;



11
2) EdL, as the repository of the power sector's technical expertise, needs control
over the development, implementation, and operation of the systems being
developed under internationally-financed projects;
3) To enable EdL to cope with the growing complexity, its increasing role as
regulator and supervisor, partner in large-scale joint venture projects, and the
geographical dispersion of its business, past informal practices for managing
operations and implementing projects need to be supplemented with more
formal systems and procedures, modern technology, and communications
facilities.
10.2         These lessons from SPE are reflected in the successor Provincial Grid
Integration Project, with the incorporation of the following arrangements in that project:
1) a project management consultancy; 2) a provision that EdL acquire those provincial
utilities which it does not already own and which will receive benefits from the
Provincial Grid Integration Project; and 3) a far-reaching institutional development
program that builds on the efforts made under SPE and has a special emphasis on
developing skills and capabilities at the provincial level.

APPENDIX A
LAOS
SOUTHERN PROVINCES ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT (Cr. 1826-LA)
AID MEEMOIRE
1.    A World Bank mission comprising Messrs. Williarn Smith and Finn Nielsen visited Lao
PDR from July 3 to 8, 1995 with the view to review the draft Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) for the Southern Provinces Electrification Project (SPE) with Electricite du Laos (EDL)
staff and to discuss potential future projects for Bank financing. This Aide Memoire deals only
with the SPE. The mission wishes to thank the staff and management of EDL for the excellent
assistance given to the mission
2.     The Bank had based the ICR draft on the Implementation Completion Report prepared by
TATA Consulting Engineers, May 1995, for EDL. Further clarification was sought in the
following areas which were not covered in detail by the TATA report:
* the extent to which the project had met the socio-economic objectives, and
* the sustainability of the project
Findings and Recommendations of the Mission
3.     For the project preparation TATA, which had been the consultant for the project
preparation study, had undertaken a socio-economic survey which established the underlying
demand for the project and made proposals for electrification of the provinces. No socio-
economic survey had been undertaken in the provinces following the completion of the project.
4.     Comprehensive data was available regarding consumers and the consumption within the
various categories of consumers which indicated that the project had physically met the targets
and that the growth in the number of consumers and consumption had exceeded the targets in all
areas except agriculture. Agricultural consumption is negligible in comparison with domestic,
commercial and industrial consumption and contributes less than half a percent of total revenues
in the provinces. Based on the general growth of the economy, consumption growth outstripping
population growth by factors of 3 to 8, and global experience, the mission found that no socio-
economical survey would be necessary to establish that the socio-economic objectives of the
project had been met.
5.     Assessment of the sustainability could not be finalized during the mission as EDL's
financial staff was engaged in EDL's annual meeting. The mission identified the information
desired for undertaking this assessment and EDL promised to forward the information by the
second week of July.



6.    EDL and the mission reviewed the draft ICR and agreed on changes to those sections of
the report which deal wit- hie physical and socio-econimical aspects of the project while revision
of the sections deanng with sustainabilty will be completed upon receipt of the data from EDL
during the second week of July. The mission will be able to discuss these sections during a
forthcoming visit in connection with another project scheduled for July 25 to 30, 1995.
Recmmendatin
7.    EDL had in the spring 1994 reported operational difficulties at the Selabam Hydro Power
Station due to siltation in the intake. During the ensuing year the problem had reoccurred and
been aggravated further as the gabions lining the bottom of the intake had started to disintegrate
due to debris getting entangled in the crevices in the gabions and the water pressure. The mission
recommends that remedial action be implemented as soon as possible and that financing for the
design and construction of a log boom be financed from the Provincial Grid Integration Project
(CR 2425-LA)
Next Steps
8.    EDL to submit data on financial performance for the three provinces by the end of the
second week of July 1995. Suggested data are outlined in the attached table.
9.    The Bank will upon receipt of the data revise the draft ICR.
10.   EDL will send an official request for financing of the remedial measures for the
Selabam Hydro Power Plant under the Provincial Grid Integration Project (Cr. 2452-LA).
The request should include draft terms of reference for the work to be undertaken
assessment of input required and cost estimate by mid-August 1995.
