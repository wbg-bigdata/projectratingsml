TO TUE EXECUTIm DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF )OZUMBIQUE
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL RERABILITATIOW AND    LOPENT PROJECT
The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
Credit to Mozambique for SDR 11.9 million (USP 15.4 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval.   Part I of the document discusses Mo-ambique's
development problems and prospects, the key priorities of the economic reform
program at the macroeconomic and sector levels, and the Bank Group's
assistance strategy.   It draws upon the fourth Policy Framework Paper
covering the period 1990 to 1992, which was considered by the Comittee of
the 'Whole on May 22, 1990. Part II of the document describes the proposed
Credit.
I. Country Policies and Bank Group Assistance Strateaw
Background
1.01         The economic and social development of Mozambique will be one
of the most significant challenges for the Batk in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Despite good economic potential in agriculture, transport services,
fisheries, energy and minerals, Mozambique is one of the poorest countries
in the world, with an annual per capita income of around USD 100. Infant
mortality rates and life expectancy are among the worst in sub-Saharan
Africa. About 402 of the population is displaced or affected by the ongoing
war, and the country is almost totally dependent on food aid to meet its
foodgrain requirements.   Many of Mozambique's economic problems can be
attributed to structural weaknesses left by colonial rule, and to the
instability within the country and in the Southern Africa region.   In
particular, the lack of security in the countryside led to serious
disruptions in production and marketing, and widespread destruction of
essential social and economic infrastructure.   Inappropriate government
policies also contributed to Mozambique's poor economic performance since
Independence in 1975. Direct controls on prices and marxieting, combined with
a concentration of resources on the state sector, severely constrained
agricultural and industrial production.   The state also became heavily
involved in external trade and in the administrative allocation of foreign
exchange, while maintaining the exchange rate at a level which greatly
undervalued foreign resources.  The increasing role of central planning,
together with the extreme scarcity of skilled manpower, led to much
inefficiency in the use of resources. By 1985, real GDP had fallen to around
two-thirds of the pre-Independence level, which represented a 50 percent
decline in per capita terms.
1.02         In early 1987 the Government of Mozambique (GOM) launched an
Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP) consisting of a comprehensive set of
reforms to deal with the structural problems and widespread distortions in
the economy. The main objectives were to reverse the decline in production,
reduce domestic and external financial Imbalances, enhance efficiency and
establish the conditions for a return to higher economic growth. Since 1986,
the Bank, together with the IMF, has carried out an intensive policy dialogue
with the Government on the design and implementation of the ERP.   The
specific policy measures and strategies were first set out in a Policy



- 2 -
Framework Paper (PFP) for 1987-89, and have been reaffirmed in Second. Third
and Fourth PFPs which, in turn, have received the support of the Bank through
adjustment and investment credits, and the IMF through SARs and the ESAF.
The Adiustment Process
1.03         Economic Rehabilitation Program. 1987-1989.  A major objective
of the ERP was to reverse the decline in production through restoration of
financial incentives for producers. To this end, the metical was devalued
substantially - from Mt. 39 per US dollar at the beginning of 1987 to Mt.
830 per US dollar by end-1989. Exchange rate adjustment was accompanied by
major reforms in pricing and marketirg policy, aimed at diminishing the
degree of administrative control over economic activity and creating a more
market-based economy. By end 1989 products subject to fixed prices accounted
for less than 30 percent of GDP, compared to about 70 percent in 1987. The
Government also opened up domestic trade, permitting private enterprises to
participate in most trading activities previously reserved to public
corporations. A second key objective of the ERP was to reduce the existing
financial imbalances.   Therefore,  tax reforms and improvements  in tax
administration were introduced to strengthen revenues, recurrent expenditure
was contained and steps were initiated to improve the financial discipline
of public enterprises.   Monetary and credit aggregates were kept within
strictly programmed ranges, and interest rates were raised sharply, although
they remained negative in real terms.   Despite the continuing security
problems in the countryside, these measures had a significant impact on the
economy in 1987-89.   The 1982-85 decline in GDP was reversed, with GDP
increasing by 4.4 percent p.a. on average from 1987 to 1989. As a result of
the exchange rate adjustments and price reform, consumer prices increased by
over 160 percent in 1987.   Thereafter, however,  the rate of inflation
decelerated considerably, to 55 percent in 1988 and 42 percent in 1989.
Budgetary revenues rose from 13 percent of GDP in 1987 to 24 percent in 1989,
while the current budget deficit fell from 12 percent of GDP in 1986 to
around 1 percent of GDP in 1989.
1.04          Notwithstanding the significant progress made since 1987,
Mozambique continues to face a number of structural problems and constraints
to growth. Agricultural production remains far below the level achieved in
1682, due to the continued rural dislocation and insecurity and remaining
pricing rigidities. Massive rural migration is threatening the f-^lwood,
soil and water resources as the population resettles in the limited  secure,
areas in densities beyond their carrying capacity. Industrial facilities and
basic infrastructure need rehabilitation and financial restructuring, and
enterprise operations suffer from shortage of managerial and technical
skills. Shortages of freely available foreign exchange, in conjunction with
the growing demand for imports, are leading to continuous pressures on the
exchange rate.  These factors, together with the security situation, mean
that the economy continues to exhibit serious macro-economic distortions,
manifested in an extremely high dependence on foreign aid. Between 1987 and
1989 imports of capital and consumer goods (which are essential to the
success of the ERP) rose substantially, and, despite some recovery in
exports,  the  current  account  deteriorated sharply.    By  1989,  imports
represented over 70 percent of GDP, while the current account deficit (before
grants) was equivalent to almost 60Z of GDP.   This extraordinarily high
resource deficit was only possible due to impressive progress in mobilizing
external  assistance.    Aggregate  grants  and  loan  inflows  on  highly
concessional terms totalled USD 671 million in 1989 - an increase of 35



-3-
percent over 1986. These increased aid flows made possible an increase in
both per capita consumption and in investment which reached over 302 of GDP
in 1989, despite domestic savings at minus 24Z of GDP.
1.05         Economic and Social Rehabilitation Program, 1990-92.  The main
elements for the adjustment program over the next three years are set out in
the fourth Policy Framework Paper. The program continues to aim at reducing
financial imbalances and establishing the basis for sustained growth, with
priority given to broad-based rural development and increased focus on
poverty  alleviation.    In  recognition  of  the  importance  of  poverty
alleviation, the Government has indicated that the program would be renamed
the Economic and Social Rehabilitation Program (ESRP). On the macroeconomic
management side, the Government recognizes that continuing devaluation of the
metical will be central to restoring adequate economic incentives and
strengthening the external accounts. In addition to active management of the
exchange rate, the Government is gradually reducing the degree of
administrative control in the allocation of foreign exchange.  In October
1989, a program called SNAAD was initiated to allow specific inputs in a
number of key industries to be imported without administrative restriction,
and it is anticipated that the value of eligible products will be doubled
during 1990. Furthermore, in early 1991 tLe Government plans to introduce
a secondary market for foreign exchange at a market-determined exchange rate.
Throughout the 1990-92 period, the Government will continue to adopt
stringent monetary and credit policies. On the fiscal side, measures will
concentrate on reducing the growth rate of expenditures below that of GDP and
prioritizing expenditures.   Key measures to improve public expenditure
management include the preparation of a three-year investment program and
financial plan, taking into account all available resources md proposed
expenditures.
1.06         In order to lay the basis for efficient and equitable rural
development, the Government has begun to shift its strategy and priorities
for both the agricultural and transport sectors. In the agricultural sector,
the main focus of Government activities will be on increasing production and
yields in the smallholder sector, through continued price reform to increase
producer incentives, together with provision o! improved support services
and rural infrastructure.   As the bulk of the population derives its
livelihood from small family farms (many of which are headed by women),
increasing their productivity should contribute directly to poverty
alleviation and improvements in household food security. The Government has
also begun to implement its strategy for restructuring unprofitable state
farms in order to make them commercially viable, including formation of joint
ventures with private foreign investors, and redistribution or sale of land
and other assets to family and private farmers.   The Government is also
developing a program for resettlement of the displaced rural population who
are currently placing severe stress on the environment in the over-populated
nsecuren areas. In the transport sector, the Government's strategy includes
continued rehabilitation of the rail/port corridors, which have received
considerable  resources  in the past.   In order to eliminate transport
bottlenecks that limit agricultural production and exports, rural feeder
roads, road maintenance and coastal shipping will receive increased emphasis.
The Government is also encouraging increased private sector participation in
road transport through a number of measures including reform of the transport
tariff structure.
1.07         In addressing the specific concerns of the two-thirds of the
population which are estimated to live in absolute poverty, the Government



-4-
has  identified  three priorities  for poverty  reduction:    (a) creating
employment opportunities for the poorest, through a combination of assistance
to labor-intensive micro-enterprises in the private sector, training programr
for the unemployed, and public employment programs focused on development of
basic economic and social infrastructure; (b) providing a 'safety net' of
direct and indirect income -transfers (suIh as self-targeting consumer
subsidies on inferior foods) for those poor households which remain beyond
the scope of strategies designed to stimulate growth; and (c) establishing
a comprehensive and prioritized expenditure program which would integrate all
poverty reduction programs.  In both the education and health sectors, given
the very tight budgetary situation, the Governmunt has recognized that
improvements in the efficiency of resource allocation and more efficient
mobilization of counterpart funds generated by external aid, complemented by
some degree of cost recovery through user charges, are essential to support
expansion of coverage of basic social services and improvements in their
quality.
1.08         The prospectiv  impact of the reform program on economic growth
is difficult to predict give. Mozambique's special circumstance of continuing
widespread insecur!ty. In the projections prepared for the Fourth PFP, GDP
growth is expected to average around 5.9 percent per annum in 1990-92, with
a strong production response coming from those agricultural areas where the
security problems zre minor. The principal effect of the ERP will be seen
in the reactivation of the rural economy, where substantial increases in
income are anticipatad as production increases and as the agricultural terms
of trade improve. The balance of payments projr tions reflect a substantial
recovery of exports, but only to levels that    the end of 1992 will still
be well below those of the early 1980s.  Iv   rticular, cashew, copra and
seafood exports are assumed to increase sl.  .cantly, while tea and sugar
will remain at very low levels because of secarity problems.  Overall, the
dollar value of exports is projected to grow rapidly, averaging around 14
percent p.a. over the 1990-92 period (but, af course, starting from an
extremely low base).   The growth in the dollar value of imports, by an
average of 7.7 percent p.a. over the 1990-92 period, is considered to be the
minimum necessary to support economic recovery by providing consumer goods
as incentives for agricultural production, by meeting the emergency food
requirements, and by facilitating the required rehabilitation expenditures.
Although import values are assumed to grow at only about half the rate for
exports, the trade deficit in absolute dollar terms will grow throughout the
period.
1.09         Although the Government is carrying out the reform program in
a thorough and timely way, the difficult security situation, together with
the magnitude of existing distortions, mean that the current account deficit
before grants is forecast to decline only gradually over the next decade,
falling from about 59 percent of GDP in 1989 to around 26 percent by 2000.
Consequently, Mozambique will continue to rely heavily on foreign assistance
for a number of years to come.  The Consultative Group held in Paris in
November 1989 provided broad support for the ERP program, and pledges
suggested that the required external resource inflows for 1990 would be met.
Furthermore, in view of the country's exceptional circumstances, several of
Mozambique's creditors have either cancelled part of the debt owed by
Mozambique or are providing grants to cover debt service payments. In June
1990, the Government reached agreement with the Paris Club to reschedule its
debt and is seeking to reach agreement on a commercial debt buyback with the
London Club.   Taking these into account, Mozambique's external financing
requirements, including debt relief for the elimination of arrears, would



amount to USD 1.8 billion in 1990 and decline to around USD 1.2 billion per
annum in 1991 and 1992.
Bank GrouP Operations
1.10         The Bank has played and will continue to play an important role
in the design and implementation of Mozambique's economic reform program and
in the mobilization of the needed financial resources to support the program.
The Policy Framework Paper, prepared annually by the Government, the Bank,
and the IMF establishes an appropriate policy umbrella for Bank adjustment
and investment operations. The Bank's basic strategy has been to support the
objectives of the ERP by: (a) carrying out analyses of key components of the
ERP through economic and sector work (ESW); (b) designing and implementing
a lending program which can deliver substantial financing for the ERP through
both adjustment operations and investment lending to increase economic growth
and efficiency and strengthen the performance of the social sectors;
(c) initiating the development of a longer term strategy for capacity
building and poverty alleviation; (d) improving aid coordination to ensure
adequate overall funding of the ERP; and (e) improving the delivery of
technical assistance to key institutions.
1.11         Composition of Lending Operations through end FY90.   Since
Mozambique Joined the World Bank in 1984, 12 projects involving IDA Credits
of USD 511.6 million have been approved (see Table 1). About 44X of Bank
assist.uce has been provided in support of the economic reform program
through three quick disbursing adjustment operations which provide finance
for the balance of payments. This relatively high percentage of assistance
in the form of adjustment lending reflects both the rapid pace of economic
reform and critical need for imports in Mozambique, and also the difficulties
of implementing investment operations in a situation of war. The scope and
location of investment projects have necessarily been constrained by the
uncertain security situation in the countryside.   The main focus of the
initial investment projects has been on rehabilitation of essential economic
and social infrastructure, predominantly in urban areas. Operations in
support of the energy sector account for around USD 42 million (82). in the
urban and transportation sectors for about USD 100 million (20Z) and in the
social sectors for around USD 43 million (8Z). More recently, assistance
totalling about USD 82.1 million (162) has been approved to assist in the
restructuring of the industrial enterprise sector and USD 21 million (4X) for
strengthening  public  sector  management.    Direct  investments  in  the
agricultural sector (albeit a sector with enormous potential for economic
growth, export generation and poverty alleviation) have so far not been
possible because of the difficult security situation in the countryside,
although the sector has benefitted indirectly from imports financed by the
adjustment operations. However, it is anticipated that, over the next few
years, Bank assistance to the agricultural sector in safe areas of high
agricultural potential will increase, although the scope and location of
investments will necessarily be more limited than would be the case if peace
were restored.

1.12         Future Country Lending OPerations.  The overall level and pace
of Bank assistance for Hozambique will take into account the progress made
in the implementation of the ERP as well as the feasibility of specific
operations in light of the security situation. The planned volume of lending
for the FY91-95 period will remain at around the level of the FY86-90 period,
with about two new lending operations programmed per year. The primary goal
of the Bank's country assistance strategy is to broaden the economic recovery
initiated over the past three years, through: (a) deepening the process of
economic reform, in particular in the exchange and trade system and public
expenditure  management;  (b)  rehabilitation  of  social  and  economic
infrastructure, especially in rural areas; (c) reducing poverty, especially
through expansion of employment, investment in human resources, and targeted
assistance to the most vulnerable population groups; and (d) developing
Mozambican management capacity to gradually reduce reliance on foreign
technical assistance and to increase the efficiency of the private and public
sector.
1.13          During the FY91-95 period, the lending program will gradually
shift towards a greater reliance on investment operations. However, fast-
disbursing adjustment operations will likely constitute about 25Z of total
lending volume for Mozambique in view of the neec .o maintain an appropriate
level of resource transfer in support of policy %e trm and growth. A planned
Economic Adjustment Credit would provide suppor- f;r essential imports based



- 7 -
upon the continued satisfactory implementation of the raform program.
Criteria by which performance would be judged include further progress in the
foreign exchange and trade system (expansion of SNAAD), and improved public
expenditure management, including issues of investment composition and
adequacy of recurrent expenditure, civil service pay and employment reform,
and restructuring/privatization of state enterprises.   While maintaining
support for general economic adjustment, lending work will increasingly be
focussed on infrastructure rehabilitation linked to :estoration of rural
production and trade, and on human resource development. Poverty reduction
and greater participation by the private sector will be important objectives
for all proposed investment operations. Ensuring adequate implementation
capacity and sufficient provision fcr future recurrent expenditures will also
be critical considerations in the design of all projects.
1.14          Specific  issues in sectoral management will be addressed
through the orientation of Bank lending.   In the agricultural sector,
proposed investment operations aim to support increased and more efficient
agricultural production, especially by the family sector, through provision
of improved agricultural services such as extension, research, credit, land
management and titling, and basic rural infrastructure, particularly
marketing facilities and water supply.   Lending would also support the
Government's efforts in the agricultural sector to decentrali2e investment
decision-making and budget allocation and control to the provincial and
district levels. The proposed project would support rehabilitation of the
cashew sub-sector, which is a key export and the principal source of cash
income for the family sector, thereby strengthening tha trade balance as well
as directly reducing poverty and improving food security at the household
level.    It would  also  provide  technical  assistance  to  support  the
Government's strategy for restructuring of agricultural state enterprises,
including privatization and formation of joint ventures with direct private
foreign investors.
1.15          In  the  transport  sector,  Bank assistance  aims  to lower
transportation  cost   and  reduce bottlenecks  to agricultural  trade by
improving basic ru. al infrastructure, with special emphasis on the
development of the rural feeder road network and the rehabilitation of small
coastal ports. The development of feeder roads in particular is expected to
generate substantial employment due to its labor intensive characteristics
and therefore contribute directly to poverty reduction. Operations will also
focus on developing the human resources and institutional capacity necessary
for maintaining the road and cabotage network. Lending in the urban sector
would support rehabilitation of essential urban infrastructure in smaller
urban centers, including provincial capitals, other secondary cities and
market   towns,   and  in  addition  would   support  the   institutional
decentralization required to finance and implement local rural development
programs. Given the extremely high rate of illiteracy and infant mortality,
social sector lending will be geared towards rehabilitating, improving
quality and eventually expanding the coverage of basic health and education
services. Given the strict limits on the recurrent budget under the ERP,
improving the efficiency with which scarce resources are utilized -including
reallocation of resources within the sector - and developing alternative
financing mechanisms are major issues to be addressed. The other main focus
of lending in the human resources area will be on building local management
capacity of the private and public sector, through assistance to improve the
quality of vocational technical education, upgrade the effectiveness of
higher education and strengthen the management and financing of non-formal
training activities.

1.16          Provision of technical assistance is an important element of
the Bank's program in Mozambique. In general, technical assistance support
would first be sought from grant  sources,  mainly bilateral agencies.
However, technical assistance for economic and financial management would
also be provided by separate credits designed to support key policy-making
entities of the Government, including the Ministry of Finance, Bank of
Mozambique and the National Planning Commission. The first such operation
- the Economir and Financial Management Technical Assistance Credit - was
approved in October 1989. In addition, a wide range of technical assistance
and training activities is being supported by sector operations which also
serve as a vehicle for coordination of other donors' activities. Finally,
a debt reduction operation for Mozambique was recently initiated, which would
be among the first to be assisted by IDA's Debt Reduction Facility, and
technical assistance is being provided to the Government in the preparation
of proposals and negotiations with commercial banks.
1.17         Economic and Sector Work. A key objective of ESW is to support
the policy dialogue with the Government on the reforms that would lay the
basis for financially viable and equitable growth. ESW also provides the
basis for Bank lending operations, and facilitates aid coordination by
providing a framework for other donors. On the macro-economic side, in 1989
a Public Expenditure Review (PER) was carried out which assessed the size and
compo'sition of investment and other expenditures in four principal sectors,
and recommended improvements in the planning, budgeting, and monitoring of
public expenditures. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) initiated in FY89
will be completed in Fall 1990. The CEM reviews the accomplishments of the
ERP, examines the constraints to further development and provides an agenda
for subsequent years. Over the last few years a series of sector reports
have been prepared - in ggriculture, food security, population, health and
nutrition, industry and transport.  The objectives of these reports are,
first, to consolidate existing information and provide reference documents
for Bank staff and others working in the sector, and second, to identify the
principal constraints and outline a broad strategy for development, including
a policy framework and priority areas for future Bank lending. Finally, a
Poverty Framework Paper which is being prepared will set out a strategy for
poverty reduction and indicates how the various ongoing programs are
contributing to that goal.
1.18         Over the coming years ESW will be carried out in those areas
where policy and institutional reform will be part of the growth process.
In particular, institutional deficiencies have constrained implementation of
the ERP and affected the Government's capacity to der;.ve maximum benefits
from Mozambique's large external resource inflows. Therefore, a major focus
of future ESW is capacity building to strengthen policy analysis, economic
management and project implementation in Mozambique. Specific attention will
be devoted to the size and composition of employment and the level and
structure of earnings in the public sector, given the need to attract and
retain skilled personnel and the constraints on the public sector wage bill.
Another important issue for analysis concerns ways to decentralize decision
making from central to provincial and district levels, while strengthening
expenditure control and revenue mobilization at the local level. Work also
will address ways to expand Mozambique's limited pool of trained manpower and
strengthen economic management skills, including analyzing a nsaber of issues
in higher education such as the high unit cost per graduate, deficiencies in
the mechanisms linking training with labor market needs and the merits of
alternative financing mechanisms. A second area of focus for ESW will be



- 9 -
public expenditure management.   As a result of the improved data base
following the first PER, it will be possible to deepen the dialogue on
expenditure priorities, including the composition and phasing of the overall
investment budget, the balance between recurrent and investment expenditure
and the impact on poverty reduction. In addition, the performance of publiz
enterprises ,'il1 be reviewed in order to develop a strategy for
privatization.   A final area for analysis will aim at developing the
policies, regulations, and institutional capacity to deal with the nation's
environmental issues.
1.19         Cooperation with the 1MFP.  The Bank has worked closely with the
IMF in the design avd monitoring of the Economic Rehabilitation Program.
Since 1987, the Bank and IMF have carried out joint missions annually to
develop with the Government the three year Policy Framework Papers. There
has also been frequent cross-mission support. e.g. Bank staff participated
in the 1989 IMF Article IV Consultation mission and Fund staff recently
joined the Public Expenditure Review mission and the supervision mission for
the Third Rehabilitation Credit.
1.20         Aid Coordination and Co-Financing.   The Bank has been very
active in aid coordination in Mozambique over the last few years, with
efforts directed at helping ensure that both the amount and composition of
donor  assistance  are  appropriate  to Mozambique's  circumstances.    In
particular, annual Consultative Group meetings have become an effective
mechanism for donor coordination and consultation, as well as for aid
mobilization to fill the financing gap.   The third Consultative Group
meeting, which took place in November 1989, was successful not only in
mobilizing needed external resources but also in discussing key issues
related to poverty alleviation, food security, and the management of public
expenditure. In addition, the need to integrate emergency assistance with
the Government's regular progiam, specifically within the budget and balance
of payments, was widely endorsed. Finally, agreement was reached by a number
of major donors  as the harmonization of procurement procedures.  Specific
issues for discussion at the fourth Consultative Group meeting (tcheduled for
early December 1990) include external debt, donor support for expansion of
the system for the non-administrative allocation of foreign exchange (SNAAD),
and development of common donor procedures with respect to the valuation,
payment, accounting and utilization of counterpart funds resulting from sale
of food aid.
1.21         Bank  lending  operations,  especially  the  fast  disbursing
Rehabilitation Credits, have attracted a large volume of co-financing and
this trend is expected to continue. Sector operations in education, urban
rehabilitation and the Beira Corridor, in particular, have been effective in
coordinating the efforts of various donors active in those sectors.   In
addition, the various sector studies in agriculture, food security, energy,
transport, industry and population/health/nutrition, together with the Public
Expenditure Review, have facilitated improved aid coordination by providing
a policv framework and sector strategy which can be drawn on by other donors.
Indeed, there has been active participation by specific multi-lateral and
bilateral agencies in carrying out several of these studies and it is
anticipated that this type of cooperation will continue to occur in the
future.
1.22         Summary Assessment.   Hozambique  is  in a period of rapid
economic, social and political evolution. The main elements of change are:
first, the restructuring of the economy through the ERP; second, a peace



- 10 -
initiative designed to bring the war with REMAMO to an end; and third, a
procass of constitutional reform which is underway. Given the uncertainties
associated with these changes, together with the recent emergence of
institutional and management bottlenecks constraining timely project
implementation, a period of consolidation seems warranted. Therefore, Bank
strategy for the next few years emphasizes portfolio management, with
particular attention devoted to supervision of ongoing operations, and to
training local staff in a number of basic project implementation areas such
as disbursements,  procurement,  accounting and auditing.   In addition,
significant resources will be devoted to ESW in the areas of capacity
building and public expenditure management, as well as continuing to deepen
the policy dialogue at the sectoral level.   New lending ope.ations are
planned at cne relatively modest level of two per year   However, if the
peace negotiations and constitutional reform and elections proceed as planned
during 1990 and 1991, and the security situation improves significantly, an
increase in the volume and scope of Bank lending could then be considered.
Of course, continued or expanded Bank lending presupposes continued progress
by the Government in implementing the economic adjustment program. To date,
progress by the Government in carrying out the comprehensive set of
macroeconomic and sectoral reforms set out in the Policy Framework Papers has
been satisfactory.   Nevertheless, it must be recognized that, given the
magnitude of existing imbalances and the current very low levels of
production in Mozambique, adjustment will be a long term process. For the
next decade at least the country will continue to depend heavily on external
assistance to finance imports that are essential for restoring the capital
structure and providing consumer goods that are necessary complements to the
reform of financial incentives.
I1. The Proposed Credit
2.01         The proposed credit would be issued on standard IDA terms with
40 years maturity and would help to finance an Agricultural Rehabilitation
and Development Project. The principal implementing agencies would be the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Bank of Mozambique, the Participating Financial
Institutions, antd project beneficiaries.
2.02         BackRround.  Agriculture is the most important sector of the
Mozambican economy, providing about 40-502 of GDP and 80 of both employment
and export earnings.  Since Independence and until 1987, the agricultural
sector performed poorly.    Between 1981 and 1986 overall  agricultural
production fell by about 30? and exports by nearly 75X. The poor performance
of the agricultural sector can be attributed to inadequate pricing,
marketing, and resource allocation policies, natural calamities, the ongoing
war which has impeded agricultural production and marketing, and the lack of
long-term strategies and experienced government staff. Donors such as UNDP,
FA0, IFAD, AfDB, EEC and bilaterals including the Nordic countries, Italy,
the United States, and many others, and NGOs provide assistance to the
agricultural sector in Mozambique. However, their support needs to be better
coordinated and focused, and ba^ed on long term strategies.
2.03         Production of the main export crop, cashewnuts, began to fall
gradually in the early seventies, and fell sharply in 1982 and 1983. Cashew
production has since recovered somewhat and in 1988 reached about 40,000
tons, 25? of its 1970 level of about 160,000 tons. This subsector suffers
from a lack of suitable planting material and poor husbandry, aging trees,
weak agricultural services (extension, research and marketing), and



- 11 -
inadequate  technical  and managerial  capacity.    Investment  credit  for
cashewnut production, marketing and processing is scarce and the cashew
processing industry needs rehabilitation. Most of the existing agricultural
enterprises, which include state farms, private commercial farms and small-
and medium-scale agricultural processing plants, were surveyed by the
Ministry of Agriculture. A large part of these enterprises were found to
lack trained managers and to be inefficient and unprofitable. Surface water
resources provide the possibility of irrigation and some two million ha offer
suitable irrigation potential. However, until recently, the development of
the irrigation subsector consisted of making substantial investments in the
initiation of large irrigation schemes and little effort was devoted to the
rehabilitation of existing irrigation infrastructure and to on-farm
development.
2.04         Reforms  introduced under the ERP are  gradually  restoring
macroeconomic and fiscal stability and appropriate growth incentives. In the
agricultural sector, pricing and marketing reforms were introduced to reverse
the decline in agricultural production. Recently a Program for Training in
Economic Management (PROFORGE) was set up to assist in the training of
agricultural enterprise personnel. Efforts also were initiated to strengthen
agricultural services, to plan the rehabilitation of key agricultural
subsectors such as cashew, irrigation and cotton, to support family farms,
and to revitalize the private sector.   Significant progress in reforming
agricultural policies has been made. The Government accepted the principle
of border pricing and put in place mechanisms to set and periodically review
minimum prices for a number of crops produced by the family sector, including
cashewnuts.   Marketing is being liberalized and state enterprises are
becoming more financially accountable and managerially autonomous.  As a
result, agricultural GDP per capita has grown by 6.42 p.a. between 1987 and
1989.
2.05         The Government's present strategy in the agricultural sector
draws on a series of IDA-financed subsector studies, an Agricultural Sector
Survey, and a Food Security Study. The strategy aims to direct the country's
limited resources to: (a) better focusing assistance to the family subsector
in order to increase production and rural incomes; (b) rehabilitating key
subsectors such as cashew, irrigation and cotton, by providing assistance to
projects and enterprises where returns are likely to be high and immediate
instead of initiating new investment projects; and (c) supporting
agricultural development in secure and accessible areas with high
agricultural potential.  In the financial sector, the GOM's strategy also
includes rationalization of interest rate structure, curtailment of lending
for enterprise deficit and expanding lending to the private sector.
2.06         The GOM has decided tot  (a) rehabilitate the cashew subsector,
its main export crop; (b) use the proposed project as the main avenue for
assisting the small-scale family producer, which is heavily involved in
cashewnut production; and (c) expand lending to the private sector. In this
context existing cashew areas will be rehabilitated and some new ones would
be planted, agricultural services will be strengthened, investment credit
will be provided, a long-term farm and factory gate pricing system will be
developed, resulting in incremental income from exports of cashewnuts. Key
units in the State Secretariat for Cashew (SEC) and the State Cashewraut
Enterprise (CM) will be strengthened in order to facilitate these efforts.
In addition, the cashew processing capacity will be gradually rehabilitated
and CM's performance will be evaluated. To enable the subsector to again
make a substantial contribution to export earnings, a National Cashew



- 12 -
Development Master Plan will be prepared.  G0O  also has decided to make
agricultu.ral enterprises more efficient and profitable through individual
restructlring and rehabilitation, introduction of appropriate management and
accounting  systems,  training of personnel,  and privatization.    Those
enterprises which continue to have large deficits will be closed and their
assets  turned over to more efficient producers.   As  for  irrigation,
investments in large-scale, capital-intensive irrigation schemes will be
evaluated carefully and compared tco small-scale irrigation schemes and
rainfed alternatives.    A  National  Irrigation Development Master  Plan
therefore also will be prepared to assess alternative options for medium-
term development of irrigation.
2.07         Rationale for IDA Support.  In the context of the ERP, the PEP,
and the agricultural sector work, IDA has assisted the GOM in reforming
agricultural and financial policies and in formulating strategies to
stimulate the economy.   The proposed project is consistent with these
strategies. IDA involvement would ensure that the policy environment needed
to help sustain the ongoing economic upturn is continued, that donor
assistance to the agricultural sector is better coordinated and focussed, and
that direct investment support is provided to the private sector and to
subsectors providing key foreign exchange earnings such as the cashew
subsector.
2.08         Proiect Obiectives. The project supports GOM's efforts to: Ca)
reverse the decline in production and marketing of cashewnuts and in the
medium term, restore exports to their levels of the seventies; (b) make small
and medium-scale state and commercial agricultural enterprises more efficient
and profitable; and (c) strengthen local capacity to formulate and implement
long-term growth strategies for the irrigation and cashew subsectors once the
security situation and other constraints have eased.
2.09         Project Description.   The project components includet   (a)
rehabilitation and development of the cashew subsector; (b) assistance to
state and commercial agricultural enterprises; and (c) specific subsectoral
studies and surveys. Under the first component, financing would be provided
for:    (a)  equipment,  incremental  costs  and  technical  assistance  to
agricultural extension, research, and cashewnut nurseries; (b) investment
credit (equipment and materials) to commercial farmers and traders and for
the rehabilitation of three cashew processing factories; and (c) technical
assistance, equipment and incremental costs to the State Secretariat for
Cashew and the State Cashewnut Enterprise. Because women play a dominant
role in agriculture in general and cashew marketing in particular, an
evaluative survey would be carried out to assess factors determining the
agricultural productivity of women and measures to be taken to enhance
benefits accruing to them.   Under the second component, financing for
technical assistance, incremental costs, and equipment would be provided in
order to develop a capacity within MOA to address the rehabilitation needs
of state and private agricultural enterprises and provide them with
managerial and planning assistance and training. Under the third component,
complementary studies and surveys such as a National Irrigation Development
Master Plan, a National Cashew Tree Population Survey and a National Cashew
Development Master Plan including new areas would be financed. Total project
costs are estimated at USD 17.8 million.
2.10         Agreements Reached.  IDA received commitments from GOM on the
following main actions: (a) selection of a Senior Pricing Policy Analysis
Officer to be posted in the SEC; and a Marketing Economist and an Economist



- 13 -
to be posted in the Sales and Trade Unit in CM by December 31, 1990; b)
completion of a National Irrigation Development Master Plan not later than
July 31, 1991, and a National Cashew Tree Population Survey by not later than
December 31, 1991; (c) initiation of an evaluation of CM's performance which
would spell out its long-term goals and duties by October 31, 1991; and (d)
initiation of a National Cashew Development Master Plan not later than July
31, 1992.   Signing of the contract to prepare the National Irrigation
Development Master Plan would be a Condition for Credit Effectiveness and
receipt of satisfactory Subsidiary Administration Agreement; Participation
Agreements; and a model of Subloan Agreement would be Conditions for
disbursement of the line of credit component.
2.11         Benefits.   The project would directly benefit some 50,000
cashewnut producers in terms of increased production of intercalated food
crops and cashewnuts (about 10,000 tons). This incremental production will
increase the country's potential earnings from import substitution and
foreign exchange by about USD 12.0 million a year.  The project also is
expected to offer some 2,600 new jobs, of which about 602 to women.
Strengthening existing institutions is expected to enhance services to
farmers.  Restructuring of agricultural enterprises would make them more
efficient and profitable.  Moreover, integrated pest management and farm
management practices to be introduced would help safeguard the environment.
Lastly, specific measures, to be determined early in the life of the project,
would be taken to enhance project benefits for women.
2.12         Risks.   The main risks include the unpredictable security
situation, borrower inexperience, and possible inadequate and untimely
funding of project activities.  To minimize these riskes  (a) the project
would be restricted to relatively secure areas; (b) multi-disciplinary
technical assistance to train and help local staff carry out the
rehabilitation process would be provided; and (c) assurances were obtained
that GOM budgetary provisions, which are consistent with the Public
Expenditure Review recommendations, would be made on time and would cover
planned incremental costs.
2.13         I am satisfied that the proposed Credit complies with the
Articles of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed Credit.
