fiver section          I
According to the monitoring results of Hg, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd, oils, BHC
and DDT in the fourteen bottom mud monitoring sections in the three
waterways and the Zhangjiagang Ship Lock to be built , those factors
meet Grade II of the SOIL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY STANDARD-
(GB1561 8-1 995)
In order to avoid secondary pollution by construction abandoned
soil of the waterways, exudate leaching test was made for the above-
mentioned samples, only the Cu content in one or two sections of Weiting
section  at the  Suliu  Line             exceeds  the    standard, other monitoring
factors in other sections donot exceed the standard. It is suggested that
45



the, abandoned soil at the Weiting section of the Suliu Line be not used as
refarming soil.
Soils of the lock sites satisfy Grade II of the  are basically
consistent with Grade II of the SOIL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY
STANDARD (GB15618-1995). The ship lock project belongs to a new
excavation one, no bottom mud will be involved and the abandoned soil
will not pollute soil environment.

4.   ENVIRONMENT  IMPACT  FORECAST  AND  POLLUTION
PREVENTION    AND MITIGATION MEASURES
4.1 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS
4.1.1 Environment impact identification
(1). The Project' s impacts on the environment are positive effect,
which are mainly as follows:
* The Project is a communications basic facility construction one, which
will serve the local economic development with a very obvious social
benefit.
* The Project will greatly change the positive situation of unsmooth
communication due to narrow channels and too long lock waiting time.
The waterway dredge and widening will improve the existing waterway
water pollution situation; the ship lock extension will shorten the lock
waiting time and reduce the pollutant accumulation pollution at the
lock area due to the ships waiting for lock; the improvement of water
body exchange conditions are good   for the dilution  and
decomposition of the pollutants.
* Local vegetation damage and soil erosion due to waterway widening
and lock room and channel approach dredge will be resumed and
improved by slope protection, revetment and greening and etc..
. The Project will not affect the historic spots and precious and rare
animals and plants of the Project area.
(2). The Project' s disadvantageous impacts on the environment
belong to short term action during the whole construction period, which
will disappear naturally along the completion of the construction. The main
impacts are as follows:
* Impacts on social environment due to the land requisition, house
remove and land covered with abandoned soil;
* Impacts on atmospheric environment due to the dust caused during
construction and abandoned soil transshipment;
* Impacts on water environment due to construction waters SS increase
by the waterway widening and lock room dredge;
* Impacts on the existing communications order during the construction
time period.
(3).  Indirect impacts
During the operation period of the Project, the indirect impacts are
ship flow increase, ship pollutants discharge, noise interference and
possible emergency bulk liquid chemicals overflow pollution.

4.2 ATMOSPHERE ENVIRONMENT IMPACT FORECAST AND
POLLUTION PREVENTION AND MITIGATION        MEASURES
4.2.1 Content and methods of atmosphere environment impact analysis
The atmosphere environment pollutants are dust caused by the
vehicles running on the road of the earth taking area, abandoned earth
area and between the earth taking area and the abandoned earth area for
transportation of the dredged soil of the lock pond , channel approach and
the Sunan channel, mud scattered on the road and dust caused by
building materials transport vehicles. The construction dust pollution is the
atmosphere impact assessment content. The assessment factor is TSP.
The existing TSP monitoring information of construction sites of the
communication projects and the existing mode are used to analyze the
TSP pollution impact of the Project
4.2.2 Atmosphere environment impact analysis
4.2.2.1   Atmosphere environment impact analysis
The road dust quantity of  transport vehicles between the earth
taking area and the abandoned earth area is 1.37kg/km.vehicle, the road
dust quantities of transport vehicles at the dredge area and abandoned
earth area are 7.2kglkm.vehicle and 10.42kglkm.vehicle respectively.
According to the analog analysis and estimation, under the
condition of no measures taken, the road dust of the abandoned earth
areas of The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-Hangzhou
Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock and the Sunan
Backbone Waterway Network Realignment Project will have impacts on
the downstream scopes of 80-120 m and 100 - 150 m . The road dust
between the earth taking area and the abandoned earth area will have
impacts only on a scope of 30 - 60m of either side of the road.
4.2.2.2    Analysis results
1).  The Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment
Project
The earth volume construction of the sites will have a certain
impact on the atmosphere environment of the Shengpu Central Primary
School, Weiting Hospital, Kuatan Hospital of the Suliu Line and the Dayi
Central Primary School, the Fenghuang Central Primary School,
Gangshang Primary School, Nansha Central Primary School of the
59



Shenzhang Line and the Beiguo Primary School of the Xibei Line and
the Changshan Textile Factory, the Administrative Office of the
Zhangjiagang Ship Lock, part of the residents areas of Changshan village
and the Changjiang village.
The dust caused by vehicles will have   impacts on part of
villagers within a scope of 100 - 150 m surrounding the abandoned earth
area.
2).  The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-
Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock
The abandoned earth areas of the Jietai No.2 Ship Lock, the
Huaiyin No.3 Ship Lock and the Yanguan Ship Lock are within 300 -
400m of both banks of the channel approaches. The dust pollution of
earth volume construction and transport is focused in the surrounding
areas of the sites.
The abandoned earth areas of the Suqian No.3 Ship Lock, the
Huai an No.3 Ship Lock and the Jianbi No.2 Ship Lock are far away from
the locks, the road dust by -abandoned earth transport vehicles will have
dust pollution on roads of the earth taking area, abandoned earth area
and  between the earth taking area and the abandoned earth area.
The protection objectives seriously polluted by the site dredge
and road dust by building materials and abandoned earth transport are
mainly focused in the Huaiyin No.3 Ship Lock, Jianbi No.2 Ship Lock and
Yanguan Ship Lock. The affected protection objectives are the residents
area of the Jianbi town, Groups 3, 7, 10 and 11 of Xinza village,
Mopangzhuan, Hancheng Group 8, Wuzhanghe Village and Houyaozhuan
and etc..
The dust caused by abandoned earth transport vehicles on the
abandoned earth area road of the Jianbi Ship Lock will affect a small
amount of villagers of Shangyuan village, Dianshang village, Xinzu village,
Qianjiawan village and Chenjiazhuan village of the Jianbi town. There is
no residents area within a scope of 250m in the abandoned earth area of
Huai' an and Suqian ship locks, no pollution will occur on the villagers due
to road dust by abandoned earth transport vehicles.
3).  The dust pollution caused during construction is short and it
happens mainly in the climate of dry and strong wind , if management is
enhanced and measures are taken, construction time period is controlled,
the pollution can be controlled in a  minimized scope. After the
completion of construction, the above-mention pollution will naturally
60



disappear. The atmosphere environment quality of each environment
protection objectives will be resumed to the original levels and can be
improved.
4.2.3 Atmosphere pollution prevention and treatment and impact
retardation measures
1).  Water will be sprayed periodically on the construction road of
the lock area and abandoned earth area in clear days. The abandoned
earth transport of the Jianbi Ship Lock will go through the city area, road
water spraying and cleaning measures shall be enhanced .
2).  When abandoned earth being loaded into trucks, abandoned
earth shall be lower than the baffle of the truck to reduce earth scattering
on the road.
3).  The speed of the transport vehicles in the lock area shall be
controlled less than 40km/h to reduce road secondary dust.
4).  The abandoned earth area after completion of abandoned
earth shall be covered with fermented soil on the surface and recovered in
order to reduce dispersion pollution of dust pressed and broken by
vehicles with wind .
5).  Cement must be piled in a special warehouse, broken bags
and cement scattered on road shall be cleaned timely

2).  The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-
Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock
To analyze water environment impact by the suspended
solids caused by underwater dredge and discharged water at the
abandoned earth area during construction
4.3.1.2   Forecast method

Project
(1),  Analog analysis method during construction
(2).  Water quantty and water quality models during operation
2).  The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-
Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock
(1).  The actually monitored information of water pollution of the
Huaiyin and Jianbi ship locks are used for analog impact analysis
(2).  One-dimensional direction maths mode is used to forecast
water pollution of the Yanguan Ship Lock.
4.3.2 Water environment impact analysis of the Sunan waterway network
4.3.2.1    Analysis of impact on water environment during waterway
construction
1).  Analysis of waterway dredge way impact on water quality
(1).  Waterway dredge way
The waterway dredge is navigation non-interruption construction.
The overwater earth volume construction of the Project is mainly dug be
excavators and transported by trucks. The underwater earth volume
construction of the Project is mainly dredged by dredgers, there are three
types of dredgers: cutter sucking type, chain bucket type and grab bucket
type. Cutter sucking dredgers are to cut underwater earth by head cutters
62



and pumped to the abandoned earth area by pipeline. The water
discharge quantity of this method is the biggest , but the pollution of the
construction area is smaller.
(2).  Dredge impact on water quality
The three dredge methods will cause SS increase and secondary
dispersion of the waterway waters. According to the monitored information
of the Wanyu River and the Taipu River during construction, the turbidity
during construction is 2.1 -7.0 times of that during operation, no big
change happens in COD, DO and NH3-N .
Turbidity increase of the water body will cause disadvantageous
impacts on water quality and aquatic organism of rivers and the drinking
water sources of the cities and towns along rivers and industrial water of
enterprises. Because the Project is constructed in stages and sections,
the SS increase happens only in local waters in a short period, after
dredge, the impact will disappear. For the whole waterway, the impact
time and scope are limited.
2).  Analysis of impacts on water quality by living sewage during
construction
According to the forecast results of the water quantity and water
quality modes, COD increase in the waterway water body by the living
sewage during construction is basically consistent with the actually
monitored value of the Wanyu River, no pollution impact happens on
water environment.

:__________   waterways     _ 
1).    Analysis of impact on the waterway water quality due to
water dynamic condition change after realignment
After realignment, the waterway water dynamic condition will be
changed, under the condition of no change of pollution sources of the
three waterways, CODmn content after excavation is lower than that
before excavation, which indicates that the waterway realignment is good
to improve water quality.
2).    Analysis of impact on the waterway water quality due to ship
living pollution sources after realignment
According to the mode forecast results, after realignment, under the
conditions of the existing pollution sources and forecast ship living
64



pollution sources in 2003 and in 2010, the calculation values of CODmn
content in each line during dry season have no change, which indicates
that the ship living pollution load change is very small and has not impact
on the waterway water quaiity after realignment.
3).   Analysis of impact on the water quality due to ship oil-
contained waste water
After completion of the waterways, though goods transport load will
be increased, motor boat proportion will be decreased, total pollutants
discharge quantity will be decreased, oil pollution degree will be better.
The oils content of the waterways meet Category IV of the water quality
standard.
4.3.2.3    Analysis of impact on total pollutants into the Tai Lake after
realignment
According to the forecast calculation, after realignment, the total
pollutants into and out of the Tail Lake are completely the same with those
before realignment. So there is no impact on the total pollutants into the
Tai Lake after realignment.
4.3.2.4    Analysis of impact on water level and anti-flood of the
drainage area after realignment
There are a great difference of water levels among the different
regions of the Tai Lake Drainage Area . But in the same region, the water
level of river network has a small change without grade difference, each
region is relatively independent. The following conclusions can be
obtained according to the calculation result:
1).  The realignment of the three waterways at the Hudong
region will have no impact on the water level at the Huxi region. The water
level increase of Danyang, Jingtan, Changzhou, Liyang and Yixin are zero.
2).   After realignment of the Zhangjiagang Port and the Xibei
Line at the Wuchengxiyu region, the monthly average water level of Wuxi,
Beiguo and Gangxia is decreased by 0.01-0.07m, the maximum
decrease of the daily average water level is 0.04m. So the waterway
realignment is good to the antiflood and discharge of the region.
3).   After realignment of the Shenzhang Line and the Suliu Line
at the Yangcheng region ,  the maximum increase of the monthly
average water level in Changsu is 1cm, the maximum increase of the
monthly average water level in Kunshan and Suzhou is 2cm. In general,
65



there is no big monthly average water level change at this region. So the
waterway realignment will have no great impact on the antiflood and
discharge of the region.
4).  After realignment of the Hudong waterway in the Tai Lake,
the water level will be decreased slightly. the monthly average water
level decrease is 0.001 - 0.003 m. So the waterway realignment will have
a very small impact on the Tai Lake level.
4.3.3 Water environment impact analysis of The Extension Project Of
Ship Locks At The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of
The Yanguan Ship Lock
4.3.3.1   Analysis of impact on water environment caused by SS
during construction
Cutter sucking dredgers will be used with an efficiency of 80m3/h
and a flow of 800m31h, mud is filled on the banks, one dredger will be
used at the upstream and downstream channel approaches separately,
the construction period is three to six months. The flow velocity of the
Canal is smaller, the quality of the  water beyond 200m  of the
downstream construction area can satisfy the Category IV of the water
quality standard. No pollution impact will happen on the water
environment protection objectives of the Jietai, Huaiyin, Huai' an and
Yanguan ship locks.
4.3.3.2    Analysis of lock passage ship discharged pollutants'
impacts on water environment during operation
1).  Ship locks of Jietai, Suqian, Huaiyin and Huai'an in the
Subei Canal and the Jianbi Ship Lock in the Sunan Canal
(1).  Ship living sewage impact analysis
According to the water quality monitoring information of the Huaiyin
and Jianbi ship locks in August 1996, the average CODcr content  of the
Huaiyin Ship Lock area is 9.25 mg/I and the average CODcr content
of the Jianbi Ship Lock  area is 10.1 mg/i , which satisfy Category
Ill of water quality standard. The average CODcr content in the
Jiaoshanwei section of the Yangtze River and in the Shanchahe section is
9.13mg/I. The actually monitored average CODcr content in the Jianbi
Ship Lock is 10.1 mg/I, the ship living sewage contribution value is
0.97mg/l. The ship living sewage quantity in 2002 will be 55.4% increase
compared with that in 1995, at that time, the ship living sewage
contribution value is 1 .50mg/l, together with 10.61 mg/I background value,
66



it can satisfy Category IlIl of water quality standard. The total ship living
sewage quantity is decreased with the level forecast years, no pollution
will happen on water environment protection objectives .
(2).  Ship cabin bottom oil- contained water impact analysis
The actually monitored oil content of the Huaiyin Ship Lock area
is 0.0 -1.78mg/I with an average value of 0.40 mg/I, the maximum value
exceeds the standard and the average does not exceed the standard.
The oil content  of the Jianbi Ship Lock area is 0.02 - 0.55 mgA with
an average value of 0.06 mg/I, the maximum oil content and the average
value  exceed  Category IlIl of water quality standard. Because large
ships are used , the total cabin bottom oil-contained waste water
quantity is decreased with the level forecast years, the cabin bottom oil-
contained waste water of the lock passage ships shall be treated to satisfy
the discharge standard with the oil/water separator equipped in ships and
then discharged, for the ships without treatment ability, the cabin bottom
oil-contained waste water shall be collected by the ports with treatment
capacity along the waterways for centralized treatment.  The oil content
is decreased by 90%. According to the actually monitored average oil
content of 0.40 mg/I, the decreased oil content is below 0.05mg/I, it can
satisfy Category IlIl of water quality standard, no pollution will happen on
water environment protection objectives and the water to be transferred to
the north of the Subei Canal.
3).   The goods transport load  of the ship locks of the Canal will
be increased with the level forecast years, the ship tonnage will be
increased and small boats and trailing motor boats will be eliminated, oil-
contained waste water and living sewage quantity has a decreasing
tendency, in addition, due to the operation of the new ship lock, the lock
waiting time will be greatly shortened, the living sewage, oil-contained
waste water and living garbage discharged into upstream and downstream
of the lock area will be reduced too, and  it will further reduce pollution
load and improve water quality.
2).   The Yanguan Ship Lock
(1).  Forecast of cabin oil-contained waste water impacts on
water environment of the Wuzhanghe River
According to the analysis results of Table 2.4.3-3, the oil-contained
waste water discharge quantity of the ships passing by the Yanguan Ship
Lock in 2002 is 3254 t, oil-contained waste water discharge content is
3000 mg/I, on the basis of 500 t tug and oil-contained waste water directly
discharged by pumps, the pollution discharge source strength is 4167
67



mg/s.
Because the Wuzhanghe River is greatly affected by tide, and oil
pollutants transport and dispersion direction is the same with the tide
direction, in the tide direction, one-dimensional direction maths mode is
established , it is assumed that pollution source discharge is treated as a
point source.
After forecast calculations : the content increase due to the ship
cabin bottom oil-contained waste water in the area within 50m satisfies
Category IV of the water quality standard, the content increase at the
place of 2000m is only 0.04mg/I, it has a smaller water environment
impact scope.
(2).  Analysis of ship living sewage impact on the Wuzhanghe
River
The living sewage discharge quantity of ships passing through the
lock in 2002 will be 98.1t, the Wuzhanghe River is slightly polluted by
organic matters with a larger environment capacity at present.  COD
discharged by ships has a very small impacts on water environment, the
present water situation can basically be maintained.
4.3.4 Water environment pollution prevention and treatment and impact
retardation measures
1).  The underwater earth volume of the river sections with water
intakes of water works shall be dredged by cutter sucking dredger, grab
bucket dredger shall be avoided as much as possible, chain bucket
dredger is not allowed in order to reduce the underwater suspended silts
dispersion quantity. In the river section with serious bottom mud pollution,
grab bucket dredger shall be used, mud barges are used to transport the
mud to the abandoned earth area in order to reduce secondary pollution.
2).    When construction at the water intakes, firstly in the
downstream, after the downstream section is increased, then the
upstream; secondly, the dike of the water intake shall be maintained in
order to avoid affecting the water quality of the water intakes during
construction; thirdly, when the dike is eliminated, the construction shall be
at night time in order to ensure no impact on the water supply of the water
works.The anti-pollution bands will be laid near water intakes when
channel sections near them are constructed in order to reduce the impact
of underwater suspended sands on water quality.
3).   The abandoned  earth  area water discharge  of the
68



underwater earth volume of the river sections with water intakes of water
works shall be over 1000m away from the water intakes and  in order to
minimize suspended silts impact on the water intakes.
4).   New types of tugs and barges shall be promoted , the motor
boats shall be gradually reduced and eliminated . For the motor boats still
running shall be equipped with an oil drop dish. It is to strictly manage and
supervise tugs and barges in the waterways and passing through the ship
locks. The cabin bottom oil-contained waste water shall be treated with
oil/water separator to less than 15 mg/l, then discharged. For the ships
without waste water treatment ability, their cabin bottom oil-contained
waste water shall be collected by themselves and treated by the port
where the ships arrive .
5).  The garbage of ships running in the waterway network shall
be packed in plastic bags and collected by garbage collection ship for
sending to the city garbage stack.
6).  The cabin bottom  oil-contained  waste water of the
construction ships shall be treated to satisfy the discharge standard with
the oil/water separator equipped in ships and then discharged, for the
ships without treatment ability, the cabin bottom oil-contained waste water
shall be collected in the oil collection box ( dish ) arnd sent to the nearby
ports with treatment capacity for centralized treatment.
7).   Temporary dry toilets shall be built and simple septic tanks
shall be set for the .living sewage of the constructors, which will be
periodically taken as fertilizer.
8).  The construction building garbage can be backfilled at the
site and the living garbage can be sent to be buried at the specified place
by the environment and hygiene department or collected and treated by
local environment and hygiene department.
4.4   ACOUSTIC  ENVIRONMENT  IMPACT  FORECAST    AND
POLLUTION PREVENTION AND MITIGATION MEASURES
4.4.1 Content and methods of acoustic environment impact forecast
The construction noise and ship noise impacts on the environment
protection objectives of the lock areas and within 200m outside the Sunan
waterways battery limits shall be forecasted. Construction noise impact
shall be analyzed with analog method, the lock passage ship noise shall
be analyzed with analog method and mode calculation.
69



4.4.2 Construction noise impact analysis and mitigation measures
4.4.2.1    Construction noise impact analysis
The noise of single construction machine will meet the noise
limits in the BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION SITE NOISE LIMITS
(GB12523-90) at the place beyond 8-28m at day time and 65 - 160m at
night time away from construction site.The noises accumulation impact
scope of variant construction machines operating at the same time and
communications noise at the construction site will be obviously larger than
that of the noise of single construction machine, which can meet the noise
limits in the BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION SITE NOISE LIMITS
(GB12523-90) at the place beyond 10-40m at day time and 100-225m
at night time away from construction site . Impacts on the surrounding
protection objectives happen in the night construction time, which can be
eliminated by adjusting work time and avoiding high noise machine
operating at night.
The construction period of the lock room and channel approach
dredge is four to six months, after completion of earth volume engineering,
the construction noise pollution degree and scope will be obviously
reduced.
4.4.2.2      Construction noise pollution impact retardation measures
1).  Construction period shall be reasonably arranged, rivers with
schools affected shall be constructed during vocation period.
2).  If the noise of bulldozers, earth scraper and   concrete
vibrator is higher than 98dB(A) or there is a resident' s area just 150m
away from the construction site, construction shall be stopped during
22:00 at night to 6:00 at next moming.
3).  The maintenance of the construction machines shall be
enhanced in order to avoid increasing machine noise due to the worse
performance.
4.4.3 Forecast of noise impact during operation and mitigation measures
4.4.3.1    Forecast of noise impact during operation
1).  Forecast method
According to the ship type proportion at different level years in the
Feasibility Study Report, it is to select all the lock passage ships as motor
70



boats and ship team with maximum power tug, the moving source mode
and point Acoustic source declination mode are used for calculation and
the analog survey information for forecasting communications noise
impacts of ships at waterway, in and out of ship locks.
2).    Mode forecasting
The following movable source mode is used to calculate the
communication noise produced by the trailing motor boats of the Sunan
waterways and by the ship team trailer and trailing motor boat at the
channel approach of the lock.
The ship noise forecast results of the Sunan waterways project are
shown in Table 4.4.3-1 and Table 4.4.3-2.

The actual monitoring has be carried out for the ship in and out of
the Jianbi First-line Ship Lock , the monitored results are used as analog
information to analyze the noise impact degrees of the above mentioned
75



six ship locks at similar conditions and to demonstrate the correctness of
the mode calculation results. Analog Monitored results are shown in Table
4.4.3-7 and Table 4.4.3-8.

From Table 4.4.3-7 and Table 4.4.3-8 we can see that the actually
monitored maximum noise pollution source of ships in and out the locks is
the trailing motor boat. When ships in and out of lock room, the noises at
places of 0-20m away from the bank are 77.4-74.9dB(A) and 65.3-
66.7dB(A) , which are basically the same with the noise impact forecast
calculation values of 71.4-82.2dB(A) and 63.6-70.4dB(A) of trailing motor
boat out of the lock room at upstream , 0-20m away from the bank. That
indicates the noise impact forecast calculation results of trailing motor
boats are consistent with the actual situation.
The noise monitored results of tug team are 71.1-71.8 dB(A) and
59.7-66.7 dB(A), 0-20m  away from  the bank,  the forecasted impact
values are 62.3-64.1  dB(A) and 56.1 - 59.4 dB(A), O-20m  away from
76



the bank, which are slightly smaller than the actually monitored values.

(4).  Results analysis
1.   The Suinan Waterway Network Realignment Project
Shenzhang Line
In the forecast years, beyond 50m of both sides of the waterway,
the ship noise value at day time meets the standard; beyond 70m of both
sides of the waterway, the ship noise value at night time meets the
standard; Among the noise sensitive points, the noise values meet the
standard.
The Zhangjiagang Ship Lock
Trailing motor boat noise out of the lock exceeds Category 2 of the
standard at the place of 70m away from the lock bank at day time and at
the place of 200 m away from the lock bank. The impacts of trailing
motor boat noise at the channel approach on part of the residents area
of both banks basically meet the assessment standard.
-The Xibei Line
In the forecast years, beyond 40m of both sides of the waterway,
the ship noise value at day time meets the standard; beyond 60m of both
sides of the waterway, the ship noise value at night time meets the
standard; Among the noise sensitive points, the noise values meet the
standard.
* The Suliu Line
In the forecast years, beyond 30m of both sides of the waterway,
the ship noise value at day time meets the standard; beyond 40m of both
sides of the waterway, the ship noise value at night time meets the
standard; Among the noise sensitive points, the noise values at the
Telecommunication Cadre School of the Ministry of Railway Industry at
day time and night time do not meet the standard; the noise values at the
Shengpu Central Primary School and the Quatan Hospital at day time,
caused mainly by higher noise background values.
II. The Ship Lock Project
. The Forecasted results show that the tug ship team noise basically
meets the assessment standard, the motor boats are the main source
of pollution. After greening measures are taken on both banks of the
78



ship locks, the impact of the ship noise at day on the environment
protection objectives do not exceed the assessment standard, the
impacts of the ship noise at night on the environment protection
objectives basically meet the assessment standard. Some environment
protection objectives are affected by the ship noise at different degrees,
the maximum standard exceeding value is about 10 dB(A).
*    Ship whistling noise
Ship whistling noise impact scope is bigger, the noise at the place
of 2000m away from the Acoustic source reaches 59.1dB(A), the standard
exceeding impact distances are about 500m at day time and about 3500m
at night time. It belongs to instantaneous pollution source with a short
continuous time.
4.4.3.2    Noise pollution control and mitigation measures during
operation
1).  The trailing motor boats shall be gradually eliminated due to
large ships application . For the trailing motor boats still in operation,
qualified silencers are installed strictly according to the specification of
Jiangsu Document No. (1993) 9, the complete machine' s noise shail be
less than and equal to 97 dB(A).
2).   Greening shall be carried out in the banks of the waterways
to be realigned, which will not only beautify environment and purify air,
but absorb ship noise to lower noise pollution on the bank residents.
3).  Ships  shall go through the channel centerline which is
farther away from banks as possible, at night whistling shall be minimized.
4).   A ship low speed running symbol shall be set at the channel
section with a larger residents' area at banks.
4.5  ECOLOGICAL  ENVIRONMENT  IMPACT  FORECAST   AND
POLLUTION PREVENTION AND MITIGATION MEASURES
4.5.1 Inland vegetation damage situation during construction and
analysis of land resource application
(1).  Vegetation damage and resumption
Altogether 140237 trees will be damaged due to the land
requisited area of the Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment
Project and The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-
Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock
79



including 31899 trees by the Sunan Backbone Waterway Network
Realignment Project and 108338 trees byThe Extension Project Of Ship
Locks At The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The
Yanguan Ship Lock.
The vegetation loss by the Project is not avoidable. 3.24 billion
yuan will be used for the resumption of vegetation. The administrative
offices of the existing ship locks are concemed about greening work very
much. The many-year tree planting activity has made each lock area to
form beautiful " Lock Garden". The green land area surrounding the lock
areas will be further increased. The lost vegetation by the Project will be
resumed to the maximum extent with greening of key regions, the lock
areas, waterways and abandoned areas.
(2).  Analysis on land resource application
The total permanently requisited land area of the Project is 559.25
ha. and the total rent land area is 892.29 ha.
The temporarily requisited land will be recovered for farming after
completion of construction, part of shallows and low-lying land covered
with abandoned earth can be changed into farmland. The site observation
of the abandoned earth area to be requisited by the Project shows that
part of abandoned earth can be used to fill up waste ponds, waste land,
shallows and low-lying land to form new land resource and 7.09 ha
farmland can be created.
4.5.2 Analysis of waters ecological environment impact during
construction
The total underwater dredge volume of the Projects is 12.52305
million m3 including 10.5357 million m3 for the Sunan Backbone
Waterway Network Realignment Project and 1.365 million m3 for The
Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal
And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock . Cutter sucking dredgers
shall be used for dredge, the dredged mud shall be directly filled or grab
bucket dredgers shall be used for dredge, the dredged mud shall be
transported by mud barge or filled by pipeline to the abandoned earth
area of the underwater earth volume. According to the actually monitored
fill - information about cutter sucking dredgers , the water content in the
mud slurry is 90% (75% in the hydraulic fill mud for Huaiyin No.3 Ship
Lock ), the SS is about 150mg/l at the discharge .
Mud discharged from each waterway and ship lock will result in a
SS increase at a local area of the river section in a short time and will
80



result in bank deposit at a small scope.
4.5.2.1    Impacts on fishery production during construction
(1).  SS impact on fishes
According to related information, SS content in water less than
25mg/I has no impact on fishery production output; SS content in water
between 25 and 80mg/l can maintain middle grade fishery production
output; SS content in water between 80 and 400mg/I, it is difficult to
maintain middle grade fishery production output; SS content in water of
400mg/l , the fishery production output is poor.
During waterway realignment, SS content change in the water body
will exceed or close the upper limit to maintain middle grade fishery
production output standard, so effective protection measures shall be
taken during the waterway widening. But during operation, SS content in
the water body will be greatly reduced , which can maintain the SS
content standard of good or middle grade fishery production output.
(2).  In the whole Sunan waterway network, at present, there are
a small amount of waters network circling fishes breeding area in the
Bacheng Lake and the Kuncheng Lake of the Shenzhang Line only, and
they are not within the waterway waters.
The waterways shall be constructed section by section without flow
blocking, this will have a certain disadvantageous impacts on the wild
fishes in the sections under construction and will have smaller impacts on
the wild fishers in the whole waterway. The waters breeding impact scope
of the Bacheng Lake 'and the Kuncheng Lake is 150-200 m beyond the
waterway boundary, it is to construct in Winter , basically no impacts will
happen.
There is basically no impacts on fishery production during the
construction of the ship lock project.
4.5.3 Abandoned earth area ecological impact analysis
4.5.3.1    Abandoned earth and the abandoned earth area
The total temporary requisited land of the Projects is 892.2 ha
( 577.7 ha. for the Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment
Project and 314.6 ha. .for The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The
Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship
Lock . The total abandoned earth pile volume is 26.4602 million m3
81



among which the abandoned earth pile volume of the Sunan Backbone
Waterway Network Realignment Project is 17.927 million m3, including
16.446 million m3 overwater volume and 1.481 million m3 underwater
volume and the abandoned earth pile volume of The Extension Project
Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of
The Yanguan Ship Lock is 8.53325 million m3, including 6.5459 million
m3 overwater volume and 1.98735 million m3 underwater volume.
4.5.3.2   Abandoned earth area ecological environment impact
1).  Land buried with abandoned earth: The total temporary
requisited land of the Projects is 892.2 ha. for two years.
2).  About 8 ha. waste pond will be buried, vegetation of fruit
garden and farmland will be damaged, the crops output will be reduced for
two to three years in the abandoned earth area.
4.5.3.3   Analysis of bottom mud impact on environment
(1).  The Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment
Project
The bottom mud monitoring results of each waterway are basically
consistent with AGRICULTURAL MUD POLLUTANT CONTROL
STANDARD . The Cu content in leaching solution for leaching test slightly
exceeds the fishery water quality standard.
If the abandoned earth is piled in riverside, silts enters waterways
with ground runoff to make the SS content in the water body to increase,
after being diluted and dispersed , the dissolved matter will basically have
no impact.
(2). The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-
Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock
Soils of the lock sites satisfy Grade II of the standard, the bottom
muds of the Zhenjiang Canal satisfy Grade II of the standard basically. In
the abandoned earth area of underwater earth volume , covered with
surface layer of soil , the soil and crops will not be polluted due to
leaching and penetration.
4.5.4 Ecological environment damage prevention and treatment and
mitigation measures
4.5.4.1    Same measures of the Sunan Backbone Waterway Network
82



Realignment Project and The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The
Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship
Lock
1).  The underwater earth volume of the river sections with water
intakes of water works shall be dredged by cutter sucking dredger, grab
bucket dredger shall be avoided as much as possible, chain bucket
dredger is not allowed in order to reduce the underwater suspended silts
dispersion quantity.
2).   An earth dike shall be built before fill of abandoned earth
area of underwater volume to avoid filled mud and mud overflowing, at the
extemal dike, grasses and bushes shall be planted or geotechnic clothes
shall be laid, SS content at discharge shall be controlled to reduce soil
erosion and to avoid mud entering the Canal and waterways.
3). * Before abandoning earth, 20 to 30cm thick surface
fermented soil is put aside, after the completion of the abandoned earth
construction, the fermented soil is to cover the abandoned earth in order
to shorten recovery time.
4).   The dredge abandoned earth shall be used as much as
possible. Firstly, it is to select waste pond to create field for increasing
farmland area , secondly, it is to send to the brick and tile factory for tile
fabrication, thirdly, it is used as road foundation earth.
5).   Vertical revetment shall be constructed in the sections of the
city area and town , combined with the city plan, riverside gardens shall be
built after revetment in order to not only beautify the city and to increase
tourism spots, but purify air and avoid soil erosion.
4.5.4.2    Special measures of the Sunan Backbone Waterway
Network Realignment Project
1).  For the waterways passing through fish raising farms, it is to
avoid constructing during the fish pregnance and growth period in order to
avoid impacts on fish production area by SS during construction. It is good
to construct in winter.
2).   The dredge and revetment construction shall be done in
sections of waterways, it' s better not to bl,ock navigation in order to
ensure the water body flow.

5.   SUBSTITUTE SCHEMES
5.1  The Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment Project
The Suliu Line ( Qingqiupu section ) and the Zhangjiagang Ship
Lock of the three Sunan waterway lines are selected for schemes
comparison and selection.
The recommended scheme of the Suliu Line ( Qingqiupu section )
has the noise pollution impact on the surrounding residents and the
agricultural ecological environment impact less serious than the substitute
scheme during construction and operation, but it has the water
environment pollution and anti-flood impact slightly more serious than the
substitute scheme. From the angle of environment protection, the
rerouting scheme is recommended.
The recommended scheme of the Zhangjiagang Ship Lock during
operation has obviously more serious impacts on the waterway water
environment and ecological environment than the substitute scheme.
From the angle of environment protection, the   Wushangang Lock
Location is recommended.
5.2  The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-Hangzhou
Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock
The Scheme I of the design lock locations is recommended one,
the Scheme 11 is compared one, i.e. Substitute Scheme.
To comprehensively consider the natural conditions, extemal
cooperation conditions and total investment and etc., the Scheme I of the
six locks is better than Scheme 11, from the angle of engineering, the
Scheme I is recommended one.
The quantities of living sewage, solid wastes and ship pollutants of
the six locks during operation in the Scheme I are same with those in the
Scheme 11. The differences are impacts on ecological and social
environment during construction and noise impact during operation.
After comparison of the two schemes, the impacts on environment of the
Scheme I are smaller than those of the Scheme 11, from the angle of
environment protection, the Scheme I is recommended one.
From the angles of engineering and environment protection, the
Scheme I is recommended one for each ship lock.

6.2.2 SURVEY RESULTS ANALYSIS
. Persons at all fields and levels around the ship locks to be built,
including unis and residents to be removed, 91.26% of them
understand that the construction of the Project will form an industry
belt with the ship locks and the Canal as center, and will bring new
industries of commerce, service and tourism and information, and will
accelerate trade and flow and will promote the development of the
local economy, and will prosper township and village owned-
enterprises, and will improve investment environment, and will raise
the people's living standard, and understand the policies of house
remove, reimbursement and settlement of the State's construction
projects, and completely believe that the Government will well resolve
problems of house remove and settlement . 60% of the pollees of the
ship locks projects support the construction of the projects and are
eager to hope the beginning of the ship locks projects and an early
operation as soon as possible in the Column of Other suggestions and
requirements to the project.
- Pollees have put forward many good suggestions and requirements to
the Sunan Waterway Network Realignment Project. It is suggested
that attentions should be paid on the new construction and extension
of bridges and jetties in the aspects of the project scales and design,
the construction of the project shall be combined with the local town
construction plan and environment beautification, the special local
environment and architecture styles shall be maintained as much as
possible. In the environment pollution control, it is required to strictly
control pollution sources and to avoid waterways passing by cities and
to pay attention to river dredge.
D  In the survey of the three waterways, 77%, 31.8% and 13.1% of the
pollees consider that the pollution of water source, noise and
atmosphere are more serious. This shows that the IMPLEMENTATION
of environment protection measures is backward to the large scale
economic construction and development, the environment pollution is
getting more and more serious, it is sensed that the living environment
is getting worse and worse, it is very urgent to enhance management
and take pollution retardation measures. So during the construction of
the Project, management shall be enhanced to minimize pollution on
the surrounding environment.
About the environment pollution before and after the construction of
the ship lock project, 40% pollees deem that they can not sense the
environment pollution before the construction of the ship lock project,
88



and hope to enhance management in order to control environment
pollution if there is environment pollution after the construction of the
ship lock project.
Among the people affected by the land requisition and house remove,
99.3% of the pollees obey the need of the house remove and only
0.7% of the pollees have different ideas. Residents and units to be
removed at the lock location, except that one large enterprise will be
removed according to the plan, all hope to be settled locally, this
indicates the reasonable present local settlement policy of the Project
is consistent with the will of majorities, and is down-to-earth and
feasible.
In a word, the survey results show that the construction of the
Project is supported and agreed by majority and that the pollees are
concemed about the problems of environment, town and communication
construction and the remove of enterprises and residents due to the
Project and that they hope to well resolve the problems concerned by the
people. So the project construction plan shall be optimized and serious
design and construction shall be ensured in order to make the Project to
maximize its benefits on the people.

7.2 SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT DURING CONSTRUCTION
7.2.1 Impacts on the communication order of both banks of waterways
and the Canal
7.2.1.1   The Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment
Project
The excavation and widening  are distributed  in different
construction locations of three waterways , impacts will happen just on the
communications of the local sections, no interference impact will happen
on the normal order of most of roads along the three waterways.
(1).  Among the bridges to be revamped are railway bridges,
national road bridges and provincial road bridges. The bridge revamping
will have impacts on communication mains.
(2). The Kunshan Qingyanggang Railway Bridge and
Zhenyizhen Double Line are the important railway lines of the Shanghai -
Nanjing Railline, which undertake a very heavy passengers and goods
transport task and is the first sub-expression-railline. The revamping of the
three railway bridges will affect train velocity and train passage quantity.
(3).  The revamping of 33 road bridges will have a big impact on
the communication flow, among which the Gangkou Bridge , one of
national road No. 204 crossing the Shenzhang Line   and the
Tongchenghe Bridge , the provincial road No. 325 bridge, are the main
communication passes, the Tanjie Bridge of the Gangkou town and the
Beiguo Bridge of the Beigou town and etc. will cause the most serious
impacts on the long distance passengers transport lines.
(4).  Passengers' bridge revamping will affect the pass of
passengers flow of both banks, especially the bridges at the important
places , such as: the Nansha Bridge of the Zhangjiagang Port, the Xili
Bridge of the Xibei Line and etc. are distributed respectively in the town
and residents area, those bridges are closely related with the production
of the town enterprises, communications and transportation and
residents' lives.
94



(5).  The tractors' bridge revamping will cause a certain impact
on agricultural production. Such as: the Beiguo Wanshui Bridge in
Jiangyin, the Dukou Bridge in the Fenghuang town, Gushan Yongan
Bridge , those bridges undertake the flow of agricultural production
substances and provide convenience for the farmers' production and lives.
During the waterway realignment and bridge revamping, the
communication impact shall be well handled to avoid and reduce
accidents.

95



Canal during the construction of The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At
The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan
Ship Lock.
7.2.3 Construction impacts on local residents' living quality
The engineering load of each waterway and each ship lock is
bigger, the construction period is two years long (three years for the
Shenzhang Line ). During construction, a great deal of materials will be
transported in, and temporary labors and living necessities are required,
which will create employment opportunities for the lock area and will
prosper the market economy and create conditions to increase the income
of the local residents.
7.2.4 Impact lessening measures
1).  Temporary simple passage and bridge shall be set during
the waterway bridge revamping and lock room construction, for the
bridges to be removed, firstly new bridges shall be constructed, then the
old bridges shall be reremoved in order to ensure no block the Canal
communication.
2).  A temporary road from the earth taking area to the
abandoned earth area shall be built according to the actual condition in
order to lessen the communication load of the village road.
3).   The required temporary labors for the project shall come
from the local residents as much as possible by the construction unit and
the owner,  in order to reduce the decrease of income and living
standard due to the impact of land requisition .
4).  The construction of scrapers, bulldozers, agitators and
concrete vibrators shall be stopped at the night ( 22:00-6:00 ) in order to
lessen noise's interference on the residents normal lives and study.
Periodically water shall be spreaded on the construction site and the road
sections abandoned earth vehicles pass through in clear days by water
spreading truck in order to reduce secondary dust pollution on residents.
5).   Navigation notice shall be issued in advance for the
waterway construction sections and bridge construction and site safety
command management stations shall be set at upstream and downstream
of the construction area to command and manage ships to safely pass
through the construction area.

95



downstream channel approaches of each ship lock, an overwater ship
safety management station shall be set to manage ship for safe lock
passage.
7).  The main road from Suqian to Xinqi via the ship lock is now
busier, Communication management of the road from Huaiyin to
Chengnan Village via the ship lock and for the main county-village road
from Guannan county town to Zhangdian town, Dachuan Village and
Beichengji town shall be enhanced during construction period. It can be
applied from the communication management department that a NO
STOP plate shall be set in the construction road section, if necessary,
periodically single-direction passage can be controlled in order to reduce
traffic jam due to increase of construction vehicles.
8).  The Zhenjiang to Changzhou national road No.312 is now
busier, communication management shall be enhanced during
construction. Vehicle flow division command stations shall be set at the
national No. 312 exit of the Zhenjiang city area and at Ge Village in
order to reduce transit vehicle flow.
7.3  IMPACT ANALYSIS OF SCENERY AND CULTURAL FACILITIES
7.3.1 Brief introduction to the scenery of the area where the project is
located
The Sunan Waterway Network Realignment Project is located in
the famous historic and cultural city , Suzhou and the South Yangtze
Ancient City, Wuxi, which are China',  famous tourism spots, many
scenes are centralized in the city area and suburbs.
The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-Hangzhou
Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock is located
respectively in the suburbs of Xuzhou, Huaiyin and Zhenjiang which have
a long history and possess scenes of different times.
7.3.2 Analysis of impacts on scenery and cultural facilities
7.3.2.1    The Sunan Backbone Waterway Network Realignment
Project
Along the Network is mainly farmland, the natural protection zone
and the State Forest Garden are far away from the waterways. So the
excavation of the waterways will not affect them.
97



7.3.2.2    The Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-
Hangzhou Grand Canal And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock
There are no historic spots in the ship lock sites. The construction
of the ship locks will not result in disadvantageous impacts on the existing
historic spots and humanities scenes of Xuzhou, Huaiyin and Zhenjiang.
The construction of the project will damage partly the greening and scenic
spot of the existing lock area . After the completion of the Project, the
vegetation will be resumed and a new district and scenic spot will be
established.

8.2 ENVIRONMENT LOSS AND BENEFIT ANALYSIS
8.2.1 Atmosphere environment loss and benefit analysis
The dust caused during the overwater construction of waterways
and ship lock rooms and channel approaches will pollute the atmospheric
environment protection objectives of the earth taking area, abandoned
earth area and the places near the road for transport of abandoned
earth . After measures are taken, it can reach Grade IlIl of GB3095-
1996. After the construction completion, the dust pollution will disappear
and the atmospheric environment quality can be resumed to the existing
level.
8.2.2 Water environment loss and benefit analysis
1).  During construction period: The suspended solids caused
during the construction of underwater earth volume will pollute the water
quality of the channel approach waters of the upstream and downstream
of the lock area and will affect part of the protection objectives. After
pollution prevention measures are taken, the water quality of the water
works water supply will not be affected.    After the construction
completion,  the water environment quality can be resumed to the
existing level.
2).  During operation period: The Sunan Waterway Network
Realignment Project will increase the water flow of the main water
transport rivers greatly, which is good for anti-drying of the drainage area
and shipping, basically no disadvantageous impact will happen on the
water quality of the waterways, the water quality of part of river sections
will be improved. Because the ship pollutant discharge quantity will be
reduced, water environment pollution increase will be reduced, no impact
will happen on each environment protection objectives.
After the extension of the ship locks, the ship lock waiting time will
be shortened in the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal , the oil-contained
waste water, living sewage and solid wastes discharged from ships in the
lock areas will be reduced, the cabin bottom oil-contained waste water
and solid wastes of each ship lock will be collected for treatment,  which
will further reduce pollutant discharge quantity,  the water environment
of the lock area at present can reach Category IlIl and Category IV of the
Standard, it will not pollute the water quality of the environment protection
objectives
100



8.2.3 Acoustic environment loss and benefit analysis
1).  During construction period: The construction noise of each
waterway and each ship lock will cause the sensible objectives outside the
construction site boundary to exceed  the Category 4 of GB3096-93 with
six month long impact time. After measures are taken, night noise
pollution can be reduced. After the completion of construction, the
construction noise impact will disappear.
2).  During operation period: the motor boat' s and tug' s noise
will influence most of the protection objectives at both banks of the
waterways and the lock area at night time . Following the gradual
elimination of the motor boats and qualified silencers are installed in the
continuously existing motor boats, the ship noise impact scope will be
reduced.
8.2.4 Ecological environment loss and benefit analysis
1).  Vegetation damage and land resource occupation:  The
waterway project and the ship lock project will damage 31899 trees and
108338 trees respectively. After construction completion, the both banks
of waterways, lock room and channel approaches shall be greened in
order to resume part of the ecological environment.
The waterway project will requisite 426.7 ha land and the ship lock
project will requisite 132.5 ha land. The requisited land of the Project will
have a very small impact on land resource
The rented land area of the waterway project and the six ship locks
project are respectively 577.7 ha. and 314.6ha , most of the land are
shallow, part of unit land and a small amount of paddy field. Abandoned
earth will ruin part of crops, bush, grassland and fermented soil with many
years' cultivation, after the land is recovered and farmed, the fertilizer
effect and crops output will be decreased in two to three years.
Abandoned soil will make part of shallow, flooded area and water pond
-into farmland after treatment. The abandoned earth of the waterway
project will form 86.7 ha. land and the abanrdoned earth of the ship lock
project will form 54.9 ha. land, so land resource will be increased. The
ecological environment impact time .will be two to three years in the
abandoned earth area, new good ecological environment will form
gradually after land farming resumption.
2).   Waters ecological environment: The waterway dredge will
result in suspended solids increase and dissolved 02 change and heavy
metals separated from bottom mud of less river sections which will have a
101



certain impact on aquatic organism and have a very small impact on the
Shanghu Raising Farm and the Kunchenghu Raising Farm of the
Shenzhang Line . No precious or rare protective species exist in the river
sections with a very small impact and a short period. After construction,
it will be resumed. After rivers are widened and deepened, the water flow
will be increased, the self purification ability of the water body will be
enhanced. At the same time , the construction of bank protection will
lessen water quality pollution due to the collapse. The fishes living
environment will be improved and be good to the raising industry.
The total abandoned earth of the waterway project is 17.927 million
m3, bottom mud is laid with cushion and covered with soil on the surface,
which can eliminate harms on the fishery production and pollution on
underground water and surface runoff.
8.3 ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS ANALYSIS
8.3.1 Direct economic benefit
8.3.1.1    The Sunan Waterway Network Realignment Project

The main national economic benefits of the Jietai First-line Ship
Lock, the Suqian First-line and No.2 ship locks , the Huaiyin First-line and
No.2 ship locks , the Huai' an First-line and No.2 ship locks are to
shortening the lock waiting time of ships and to reduce the fund
occupancy due to goods transport time reduction and reduce goods land
transport cost instead of waterway. Details are given in Table 8.3.1-2
The main national economic benefits of the Jianbi Ship Lock  are
mainly to save transport cost and goods transport time, see Table 8.3.1-3.
The national economic benefits of the Yanguan Ship Lock are
mainly to save transport cost due to reduction of goods transport distance
of coal, wood, steel , fertilizers and pesticide and etc. and change of
transport way. The cost to be saved by 2005 of the Yanguan Ship Lock
103

8.3.2 Social benefit analysis
8.3.2.1   Social benefits  of the  Sunan  Waterway  Network
Realignment Project
The Project is located at the advanced Sunan region, following the
economic fast development, the production output and consumptions of
that area will be greatly increased, while water transport is the important
transport way of the Sunan economic zone, the ships of each waterway
will be gradually increased. The construction of waterways will increase

10. CONCLUSIONS
10.1 ENVIRONMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS
10.1.1 Outstanding comprehensive project benefit
(1). The Project possess a very obvious direct economic benefit.
The direct economic benefits of the Sunan Waterway Network
Realignment Project reveals mainly in the ship economic cost saving and
road transport economic cost saving, its direction economic benefit in
2004 will be 296 million yuan. The direct economic benefits of The
Extension Project Of Ship Locks At The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal
And The Project Of The Yanguan Ship Lock reveals mainly in the lock
waiting time saving, goods loss saving and the cost saving of land
transport in stead of water transport, it direct economic benefit in 2005 will
be 130 million yuan.
(2).  Larger positive effect of environment impact
The Project features have decided that the Project proper
possesses outstanding social benefit and economic benefit and that the
environment positive benefit is larger than environment negative benefit.
The Project will greatly change the positive situation of unsmooth
communication due to narrow channels and too long lock waiting time.
The waterway dredge and-widening will improve the existing waterway
water pollution situation; the ship lock extension will shorten the lock
waiting time and reduce the pollutant accumulation pollution at the lock
area due to the ships waiting for lock; the improvement of water body
exchange conditions are good for the dilution and decomposition of the
pollutants. Local vegetation damage and soil erosion due to waterway
widening and lock room and channel approach dredge will be resumed
and improved by slope protection, revetment and greening and etc..
Vertical revetment shall be constructed in the sections of the city
area and town , combined with the city plan, riverside gardens shall be
built after revetment in order to not only beautify the city and to increase
tourism spots , but purify air and avoid soil erosion.
Greening shall be carried out in the banks of the waterways to be
realigned, which will not only beautify environment and purify air , but
reduce ship noise to lower noise pollution on the bank residents.
116



At both ends of cities, ship mooring anchorages shall be set for
ships to moor in the anchorages for centralized living garbage treatment.
Ships will not moor in the city area in order to lessen the pollution on
the waterway water quality of the city area and to lower ship noise
pollution on the city area.
The project construction will not have impacts on the historic spots
and scenes within the project area, the waterway realignment will not be
involved in precious and rare animals in imminent danger.
(3). Promoting regional economic development
The Project is located at the advanced Sunan region, following the
economic fast development, the production output and consumptions of
that area will be greatly increased, while water transport is the important
transport way of the Sunan economic zone, the ships of each waterway
will be gradually increased. The construction of waterways will increase
water transport and raise waterway' s passage ability and transport benefit
and meet the continuous and stable development requirement of the
Sunan economy and promote the economic development of the
surrounding provinces.
The Jiangsu section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal flows
through the most advanced area of China, the Yangtze River Delta, which
is the main south-north water transport passage of that area. The
extension of the Jietai No.2 Ship Lock, the Suqian No.3 Ship Lock, the
Huaiyin No.3 Ship Lock, the Huai' an No.3 Ship Lock and the Jianbi No.2.
Ship Lock will complete regional water transport network and will raise
the Canal' s capacity to meet the need of the economic development of
the Yangtze River Delta and Jiangsu.
The Yanguan Ship Lock will complete regional water transport
network and promote the water transport development of  the Yan River
and the Guan River and meantime it will change substances transport
situation of each city and county and accelerate the regional substances
tumover and the regional economic development.
10.1.2 Promoting regional ecological environment
The waterway realignment will not cause disadvantageous impacts
on anti-flood, the daily and monthly average water levels at the three
section of Wuxi, Beiguo and Gangxia will be lowered , which are good
for flood discharge.
The waterway realignment will make the flow to increase at
117



different extents during rich season, plain season and dry season, the
minimum flow increase rate is 5.9%, the maximum increase rate is 280%,
the average flow increase rate is 20%-40% , which is good for the
application of waterways, anti-drying and regional water resource.
Abandoned earth shall be disposed in three categories according to
the environment impact degrees. The covered areas are mainly shallows,
ponds and etc.. Through refarming , good ecological environment will be
formed, 106.37 ha. cultivative land will be created.
10.1.3 Pollutants by the Project are not the main ones of that region
The direct impacts on environment of the Project reveals mainly in
the damage of the existing land vegetation, part of farmland and fish
ponds on both banks of the waterways to be realigned, the lock areas and
each abandoned earth area, After effective measures are taken, the
impact scope will be minimized, the ecological environment damaged by
the Project will be resumed and improved. After the operation of the
Project, the pollution in the waterways and lock passage ships shall be
treated and controlled by the different kinds of pollution treatment facilities
and measures, no impact will happen on the protection objectives and
water quality along the waterways.
Living pollutants discharged into waterways by ships belong to
indirect pollution, which is not caused by the Project proper , and the
discharge quantity covers not more than 1% of all the pollution load
( including industrial pollution sources and living pollution sources on both
banks ).
At the same time , the new ship lock is put into operation, the lock
waiting time will be reduced, the living waste water, oil-contained waste
water and living garbage by the ship at the upstream and downstream of
lock areas will obviously be reduced.
10.1.41Measures are taken during construction which can reduce the
environment impact to acceptable degree
(1).  After water spraying and cleaning by water spraying truck,
Grade II of the standard exceeding area by the construction dust can be
controlled in a scope of 150m.
(2).  Cutter sucking dredgers are applied , SS content in local
waters at a short term can be controlled between 80-160mg/I. The base
SS content is 50 - 106mg/l.
1 18



(3).  Noise standard exceeding area can be controlled in a scope
of 35 - 270m at daytime and a scope of 105-475m at nighttime.
10.1.5AII kinds of pollution prevention and treatment measures are taken
during operation , which can effectively protect the protective objectives.
(1).  The CODmn content increase at the seven water intakes of
the waterway realignment project zone are between - 0.4 - 0.5mgA, the
base CODmn content is 3.7-7.8mg/I,  their original water quality
categories are basically protected, so the permanganate content increase
due to waste water discharged by ships is zero basically.
(2)  After waterway realignment, oils content will be reduced by
0.08-0.1 8mg/A.
(3).  After the operation of the ship locks, Category IV of standard
exceeding zone of oils content can be controlled within 40m.
(4).  Both sides of waterways, outside 30 -50m at daytime and
outside 40-70m at night time can reach the standard.
The sensible points surrounding the lock room can reach the
standard.
10.1.6 The total environment protection investment of the Project is
20.6223 million yuan, covering 0.66% of the total project investment, 3129
million yuan. The investment proportion is feasible.
(1).  The total investment of the Sunan Backbone Waterway
Network Realignment Project is 1661 million yuan, the environment
protection investment is 8.4825 million yuan, covering 0.51% of the total
investment.
(2).  The total investment of the six ship locks project is 1147
million yuan, the environment protection investment is 12.1408 million
yuan, covering 1.06% of the total investment.
10.1.7The environment management and monitoring system can ensure
the IMPLEMENTATION of all the environment protection measures of the
Project
(1). Specified monitoring plan can ensure to master actually
monitored information at different conditions before construction, during
construction and after construction, which will be reported to related
authorities and the World Bank.
119



(2).  Specified pollution prevention and treatment measures
during construction and operation are China' s mature and operable
technologies in the shipping and harbour engineering, the owner and
