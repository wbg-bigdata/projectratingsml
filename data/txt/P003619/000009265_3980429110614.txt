1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Objectives and Origins
The waterway regulation project for the lower Xijiang river in Guangdong province
consists of two parts: the seagoing waterway of the lower Xijiang river (from Zhaoqing to
Hutiaomen), and its branch Liansharong waterway (from Nanhua to Lianhuashan), with the
existing maintenance standards being 1,000 dwt and 500 dwt respectively.
Pertinent departments in Guangdong province commenced the preparatory work of the
project from 1994, and the feasibility studies for the waterway regulation projects of the
lower Xijiang river and Liansharong waterway had been fulfilled in sequence. In May of
1995, Environmental Assessment Report for Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen Waterway Regulation
Project in the Lower Xijiang River (2nd phase) was completed by the Scientific Institute of
Pearl River Water Resource Protection, and was approved by Guangdong Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau.
In March of 1996, the project put forward the application for the World Bank loan.
Based on the negotiation memorandum formulated between the World Bank preparatory
group and Chinese side, Guangdong Provincial Waterway Bureau in April of 1996
commissioned the Scientific Institute of Pearl River Water Resources Protection to carry out
environmental impact assessment work for Liansharong waterway regulation project, and to
supplement and improve the Environmental Assessment Report for Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen
Waterway Regulation Project in the lower Xijiang River based on the requirement of World
Bank, which aims to mitigate the adverse environmental effects arising from the project, and
to guide the environmental protection design and to satisfy the requirement of World Bank
on the environmental protection.
The objectives to prepare the environmental assessment report for the proposed project
include: identifying environmental effects, putting forward environmental protection
measures, supplementing environmental monitoring plan, answering the main environmental
concerns by public and working out environmental action plan.

3 Description of Current Environmental
Situations
3.1 Physical Environment and Biological Resources
The project area situates in the alluvial plain region of Xijiang and Beijiang River
Deltas, being of typical delta plain with the altitude of between 0.5-0.9 m. Base rocks are
mainly composed by granite, conglomerate, sandstone, shale and argillite, which were
formed in different geological periods. Weathered crust is 3-4 m thick, with the thickest
being 10-20 m. Soil types consist of artificial cumulous soil, paddy soil and krasnozem.
The project area is south to the Tropic of Cancer, with a typical subtropical marine
monsoon climate. The rainfall is abundant with mean annual rainfall of 1648.9 mm. It is rich
of heat, and mean annual temperature is 21.8 OC. Storms are highly concentrated (from May
to October), and the region is seriously affected by typhoon (from May to October).
River networks intersect in the project area, and annual runoff is great. Yearly
alterations of runoff are small, but the distribution within the year is uneven. Ground water in
the shallow layer belongs to alluvial pore water with a depth of about 20-50 m, and that in
deep layer belongs to pore water and crevice water between layers with a depth of about 105
m. Most of ground water is potable.
The lower Xijiang river waterway suffers from the influence of irregular mixed
semidiurnal tide from the coastal region near the Pearl River Estuary. The tidal current
boundary in wet season is generally below the Hengmen station, while in dry season reaches
up to Tianhe. The whole Liansharong waterway is affected by tide.
In the lower Xijiang river waterway, there are more silting sections than scouring
sections, and scouring takes place in the narrow sections or the sections with great flow, but
the overall trend is that silting dominates. However, in Liansharong waterway, scouring
sections are more than silting sections, and the waterway is on the state of scouring.
Since the waterway is affected jointly by runoff and tidal flow, aquatic resources are
abundant, and the waterway is an excellent fishery production area.
3.2 Economic Development and Living Quality
11



In terms of economic development, 20 counties (cities) under the administration of the
four municipalities of Yunfu, Zhaoqing, Foshan and Jianmen have direct relationship with
the lower Xijiang river waterway (Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen). The total land area of these
counties (cities) is 3.44 X 104 km2, and total population is 1,1 15.6 X 1IO persons (1994),
respectively accounting for 19.3% and 16.7% of those in Guangdong province.
Liansharong waterway traverses Shunde municipality and Panyu municipality. Total
land area of two municipalities is 2119.80 km2, and total population 182.82 X 104 persons,
respectively accounting for 1.19% and 2.73% of those in Guangdong province.
Main economic indexes in the area are summarized in Table 3.1.

Since the economic reform and open-door policies in China, the export-oriented
economies in the Pearl River delta area have developed rapidly, especially in the eastern and
middle parts of the delta. With the growth of economy in the region, cultural and living
qualities are rising gradually, town or city planning tend to be rational, medical and
hygienic conditions become better and better day by day, educated level is enhanced steadily
and population quality has improved greatly (Table 3.2).

3.4 Monitoring and Assessment of Existing Environmental Quality
3.4.1 Water Quality Assessment
The historical data and the observed results show that in the lower Xijiang river
waterway (Zhaoqing - Hutiaomen), water quality was fine in all sections other than Beijie
section in Jiangmen city where water pollution was relatively serious. Overall water quality
was within Class 1-2 standards of National Surface Water Quality Standards (GB3838-88),
and water quality in all water source reserves met the requirement.
All the observed results of the water source reserves within Liansharong waterway
satisfied the requirement. Because of tidal effects, water quality in Lianhuashan waterway
and in Guanyinsha section of Shawan channel was worse in dry season and/or at rising tide
than in wet season and/or at falling tide. Liansharong waterway was apparently polluted with
oil-type substances, and the concentration of non-ionic ammonia in Lijiasha section
exceeded Class 3 quality standard.
The monitoring results of sediments from the lower Xijiang river waterway and
Liansharong waterway show that heavy metal contents in sediment were 1-2 orders of
magnitude lower than the maximum permissible levels of pollutants in agricultural
contaminated soils, and thus the sediment was suitable for agricultural utilization.
14



3.4.2  Acoustic Environmental Quality Assessment
Monitoring results of environmental noise level in daytime and at night, in Lianhuashan
town and Yongqi town along the shores of Liansharong waterway, showed that the
background noise levels in the residential areas of both towns were been within Class 2
standards of GB3096 (Environmental Noise Standards for Urban Regions).
3.5 Investigation and Analysis of Ship Pollutants
According to comparative survey and analysis, in 1995 there were 94,584 ships sailing
on Liansharong waterway, which resulted in a total of 748.59 tons of oil wastewater (of
which oil was 3.38 tons), 1,213.41 tons of domestic sewage, and 951.92 tons of garbage.
At present, oil wastewater from ships has become one of significant factors to pollute the
waterway waters.
3.6 Environmental Protection Targets
3.6.1 Water Quality
To ensure water quality in all water source sections within appropriate quality standards,
and to protect the water quality at 4 drinking water intakes along the lower Xijiang river and
at 9 drinking water intakes along Liansharong waterway.
3.6.2 Fishery Resources
To reduce the effects of construction activities on fishery resources, and to ensure the
restoration of fishery resources during the operation stage.
3.6.3 Acoustic Environment
To protect the four towns along the waterway, namely, Guangli, Shakou, Yongqi and
Lianhuashan, where there are densely populated areas.
3.6.4 Bank Protection
To ensure that flood level rise after the regulation will be within certain limits, and after
taking measures, the existing flood control standards can still be maintained.

4 Environmental Impact Prediction and Analysis
and Mitigation Measures
4.1 Environmental Impact during Construction Stage and Mitigation
Measures
4.1.1 Water Quality Impact and its countermeasures
4.1.1.1 Water Quality Impact of Suspended Substances (SS) from Dredging and
Mitigation Measures (L-S-R Waterway)
(1) Model Selection, Coefflcient Estimate, Model Verification and Computation
(For details. please refer to Environmental Assessment Report of Waterway Regulation
Project for the Lower Xijiang River, Guangdong Province)
(2) Simulation Result Analysis and Assessment
Lijiasha section is chosen as the key assessment section. Impact of SS from dredging
during the construction stage are predicted for the three construction points: Banshawei,
Daliangcongkou and Huoshaotou within the Lijiasha section.
1) At Banshawei, SS from dredging, at rising tide, has a maximum impact range of 3.6
km. Within this range, the incremental value of SS content is between 1.00 - 11.41 mg/L,
with the scope of exceeding the assessment standard being limited in a small area of 400 m
long and 50 m wide. At falling tide, the range with the incremental value of SS content being
over 1.2 mg/L is about 1200 m, and there is no exceeding standard area (Table 4. 1).
2) At Dailiangcongkou, the maximum impact range at rising tide may reach as large as
4.2 km around the construction point. The increment of SS content is between 0.5 - 22.4
mg/L. The maximum value occurs around the dredging point. The range of exceeding the
assessment standard is 1.6 km long and 150 m wide. At falling tide, the increment of SS
content is between 1.5 - 14.99 mg/L in 4.2 km-long section. The area of exceeding the
assessment standard is about 1,000 m X 100 m (Table 4.1).
3) At Houshaotou, the maximum impact scope at rising tide may reach as large as 1.2
km, with maximum increment being about 17.93 mg/L, and the range of exceeding the
assessment standard is 500 m X 50 m. At falling tide, the maximum impact scope may
16



reach as large as 1.8 km, with maximum increment being about 11.99 mg/L. and the range of
exceeding the assessment standard is about 200 m X 50 m. (Table 4. la).

In summary, in regard to the hydrodynamic characteristics and the strength of water
pollution source within Liansharong waterway, the regulation project would only have
temporary effects on water quality in a very small area and for certain period. These effects
would be mitigated to some extent, given that the construction scheme would be rationally
arranged.
(3) Countermeasure
1) The construction scheme would be rationally arranged. Water dilution and diffusion
conditions are fine in most sections of the regulated waterway, but are relatively poor only in
a few of sections such as the middle part of Lijiasha waterway. In making the construction
plans, working intensity should be arranged appropriately in those sections with relatively
poor dilution and diffusion conditions, and go-and-return frequency of working ships should
lower as much as possible. It is best to place at most one dredging craft with 2.0 m3 dredge
bucket every kilometer in the project area.
2) Environmental protection engineering for short-cutting projects during construction
stage: Short-cutting projects are concentrated in space with large amount of earth excavation.
Some short-cutting projects are shore-excavating engineering. Construction plan should be
arranged according to the principle of minimizing the scouring of mud and sand from
17



excavating. The following suggestions are put forward:
(D It is best to execute shore-excavating engineering on land;
(2) Around the operation place of shoal-cutting, dike for working and grid area for
lower speed should be established;
© Waste earth should be properly disposed.
3) Construction activities should be stopped when the concentration of SS exceeds
controlling standard (about 2 hours).
4.1.1.2 Impacts of Saline Intrusion
(1) Model Selection, Coefficient Estimate, Model Verification and Computation
(For details, please refer to Environmental Assessment Report of Waterway Regulation
Project for the Lower Xijiang River, Guangdong Province)
(2) Simulation Result Analysis and Assessment
Results of computation are listed in Tab 4.1b. As shown in the table, the distance of
saline intrusion after the construction is only 6m increase, therefore the Impact is negligible.

(3) Countermeasure
Water quality monitoring after the completion of this project should be strengthened.
4.1.2 Impact on Fishery Resource and Mitigation Measures
18



The construction activities, such as reef blasting and dredging, would disrupt aquatic
organisms, especially fishery resources. Since there exist no spawning fields for migratory or
semi-migratory fish in the project waterways, the project would have no significant impact
on migratory fish. However, the waterway is the migration route for fish, thus construction
period should avoid the migratory season. Reef blasting would probably damage some food
organisms, and kill some fish which migrate through the engineering sections, but such
impact would not be great because of the low fishery production and lack of economic
fishery resources currently within the Liansharong waterway. Of course, the project
developer should coordinate and negotiate with the fishery administrative department as
early as possible, so as to formulate jointly a construction scheme which would minimize the
loss of fishery resources. After the completion of construction, fishery multiplication should
be conducted.
4.1.3 Noise Impact from Construction Machines and Mitigation Measures
Noise Impact arising from the operation of construction machines is temporary.
Furthermore, since most sections in the project waterway traverse the countryside with less
population, noise impact will be substantially small, given that rational working hours be
chosen.
4.1.4 Impact of Reef Blasting Shock Waves on Nearby Constructions and Mitigation
Measures
Reef blasting would produce strong shock waves which would have some impact on the
banks, bridges, cross-river cables and other nearby constructions. Therefore, the blasting
method using small doses of explosives should be applied in the blasting, and in the sections
where base rock was heavily weathered, reefs should be removed with mechanical methods.
4.1.5 Environmental Impact of Waste Earth and Dredged Materials Dumping and
Mitigation Measures
Waste earth and dredged materials arising from the construction works would be
disposed in the following ways: Dredged materials from Shawan waterway will be dumped
to the area around Daiwu shoal; those from other sections dumped to Jiang'ou dumping
ground; waste earth and materials from reef blasting will be dumped to nearby deeps along
the shores of dangerous sections so as to protect the levees and the ait. Since contents of
heavy metals in sediments are low (within the standard of Pollutant Control Standards of
Contaminated Agricultural Soil), dumping will have no much impact on the dumping
19



grounds. Dumping would result in muddy water for short time, so that dumping should be
conducted as deep as possible in order to prevent waste earth from diffusing in large scale.
4.1.6 Impact of Public Health and Mitigation Measures
Because of lots of construction workers and poor hygiene conditions in the construction
sites during the construction stage, some diseases such as infection diseases of the intestines,
hepatitis and typhoid would be easy to prevail. Therefore, publicity of hygiene knowledge
should be strengthened, public health works should be well done in construction sites and
residential areas, and administration of food hygiene should enhanced. In case of epidemic
disease, reporting should be made to pertinent departments timely and remedial measures
should be taken.
4.1.7 Impact on Harbour Operation and Ship Navigation and Mitigation Measures
Construction activities such as reefs blasting, dredging and sailing of construction ships
misht have influence on traffic order along the waterway, causing local and short-term traffic
jam and even impacting harbour operation. The construction scheme to ensure navigation
while constructing.should be formulated and implemented by the construction departments.
In the meantime the waterborne transportation department should be contacted in time, and
ships passing through the waterway should be well informed so as to take preventive
measures. Transportation of stones obtained at nearby places and dredged materials through
the waterway would have no much impact on land traffic, but should be conducted out of
the peak hours of navigation and harbour operation.
4.1.8 Impact on Cultural Relics, Historical Sites and Landscapes
Within the project region, there are no significant scenic spots, no important cultural
relics and historical sites. Therefore, there will be no impact on cultural relics and historical
sites.
4.2 Environmental Impact during Operation Stage and Mitigation Measures
4.2.1 Impact of Flood Level Rise and Mitigation Measures
The simulated results show that after the completion of the project, discharge in all the
Liansharong waterway (except Lijiasha section) would have very small alterations (in most
sections below 1%) compared with that before the regulation, and flood water level would
also have very small alterations (with max. rise being only 0.03 m). Therefore, the
20



Liansharong waterway regulation would have no much impact on flood control, and the fall
of flood water level in some sections would be favorable for flood control. Regulation
activities such as dike building and dumped bank would reinforce levees and enhance their
ability to prevent scouring, which in return would help flood control. With the completion
of Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen waterway regulat:on, maximum rise of flood water level might
reach 0.16 m compared with that before the regulation. The flood water level rise would
mainly occur in the upper Dianshuizhoutou, and would have little impact on the sections of
the lower Beikingtou in Hutiaoment waterway. There exist such main levees as Jingfeng
joint levee (with the recurrence interval of 50 years) and Shapu joint levee (with the
recurrence interval of only 20 years) in the region of Dianshuizhou, but the maintenance
standards of the levees in the section from Shishangou to Gaoyao are low. Better
construction schemes should be adapted in order to heighten the levees which currently have
low flood control standards. In addition, the observation of water level, both during the
construction stage and after the completion of regulation, should be enhanced and the
observation results should be reported timely to the Flood Control Command Center, so as to
have a good grasp of the actual impact of flood level rise.
4.2.2 Impact on Scouring and Silting and Mitigation Measures
After the completion of the regulation project, due to the alterations of flow rate and
current velocity and water level compared with that before the regulation, consequently
silting and scouring regime along the waterway would change. Flow rate in Lijiasha section
of Liansharong waterway would have relatively great increase, so that scouring effect would
be possibly stimulated. Since there would be no many spur dikes to be established along
Liansharong waterway, scouring effects to the opposite bank of the dikes would not be great.
Along Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen waterway, many spur dikes would be established and
comparatively great effects would arise. Therefore, bank protection measures should be
taken on the opposite shores of the spur dike group so as to reduce the scouring effects.
4.2.3 Impact on Water Supply and Drainage Facilities and Mitigation Measures
A great deal of spur dike groups would be set up along Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen waterway
within the lower Xijiang river, which would have some influence on the water gates and the
water diversion works among the dike groups. In the project plan at present stage, there are
13 water gates or water diversion works among the spur dike groups. During the design
stage, appropriate modification should be made, or some jetty should be established in the
course of construction, or water intake should be moved outward. Some compensations
should be made for the original administrative or construction units to change or remove the
existing water supply or drainage facilities. Within Lianshrong waterway, there are only a
21



few water gates locating among the spur dike groups, which could be removed and re-built.
The project would be helpful for drainage or irrigation with tidal effects, since flow regime
and velocity after the completion of regulation would be improved.
4.2.4 Water Environmental Impact of Ship Pollutants and Mitigation Measures
During the operation stage (taking 2010 as the representative year), oil wastewater,
sewage and garbage from the ships navigating along Liansharong waterway are predicted to
be 556.76 t/a (in which oil is 4.35 t/a), 1481.71 t/a and 1111.29 Va respectively, which are
very small compared with the correspondings from land sources. However, their direct
discharges into the waterway, without any treatment, would also aggravate water pollution.lt
is suggested that in short tern oil wastewater should be collected and transferred to the shore
to treat, and oil separators should be equipped progressively when conditions are apt.Potable
pumping closestools should be made extensive use on ships. Deposit cabinet for garbage
should be equipped so as to collect sewage and garbage. In addition, inspection to ships
should be strengthened, and management regulation on ship pollution control should be
formulated. Ships which violate the regulation should be fined, and some ships with heavy
pollution must be forbidden to put into operation.
4.2.5 Ship Noise Impact and Mitigation Measures
After the completion of the Liansharong waterway regulation project and upto 2010,
impact of ship sailing noise on shoreline areas would be small. Whether in peak hours, or in
daytime and at night, noise levels would be within the corresponding environmental noise
standards. Only abrupt noise levels caused by ship whistling would exceed the standard by 5-
8 dB(A), which would have some impact on local residents. It is suggested that in the
regions near to the banks, especially within a distance of 30 m from the banks, no noise
sensitive constructions be planned to develop. Supervision and management on ship noise
should be strengthened. Ships without holds or noise abatement facilities must be controlled
to operate. Afforested belts are proposed to be established along the shorelines of sensitive
sections so as to help mitigate the impact of ship noises.
4.2.6 Ship Pollution Accidents and Countermeasures
For all of the 9 kinds of dangerous materials classified by IMO, there exists
transportation on the waterway. According to the investigation, ships subject to generate
pollution accidents mainly include oil ships, miscellaneous chemicals ships and liquidated
gas ships. 9 water plants exist along Liansharong waterway, and a number of water intakes
locate along Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen waterway in the lower Xijiang river, with the upper reach
22



being the drinking water source reserves. Thus, the waterway of the project is the sensitive
regions for environmentl protection. In case of pollution accidents, the quality of water
taken by water plants and aquatic organisms along the waterways would be threatened.
Therefore, navigation safety management, especially the management on ships transporting
dangerous materials, should be strengtiiened. Advanced navigation mark systems,
communication facilities and other complete facilities should be established. Emergency         -
response system to pollution accident should be developed. Specified pollution control and
treatment companies for different kinds of accidents should be set up so as to meet the
requirement in urgency.
43 Socio-Economic Environmental Impact Assessment                                               7o
With the completion of the waterway regulation project in the lower Xijiang river, a         i
more convenient waterborne transportation environment composed of river and sea would be
created for the economic zone of the Pearl River Delta, which would change the relatively-
closed inland transportation pattern at present, and improve the integral transportation
nerwork comprising with waterway, road and railway. That would help for the development
of regional economy, and stimulate the economic rise in the Pearl River Delta and even all
Pearl River Basin.
With the growth of navigation capacity after the completion of the regulation project,
large ships could reach directly so as to reduce the number of transfers, which would help
lower the transportation cost and raise the benefits for the enterprises. In associate with the
development of new harbours and docks along the waterway, the environment for investing
would be further optimized. All these would play an active role in introducing foreign capital,
advanced technology and management methods,-and in reforming the production structure
and the productivity layout.
After the completion of the project, regional economy would growth, which would
provide more employment opportunities, stimulate the development of the third industry, and
raise the income of residents. As a result, living quality for local residents would rise
progressively.
There are no special landscapes and important cultural relics and historical sites along
both shorelines of the waterway, and tht regulation engineering itself would not cause any
damages to the existing landscape and places of historical interest and scenic beauty. In the
course of construction, 62.4 ha (or 936 mu) of lands would be occupied, however, impact on
land use would be small and temporary, since these lands are floodplains and its existing
means of utilization would be restored quickly after the completion of the project. Rational
23



compensation should be made for land users. No such issues as removal and migration
would be invoived.
The construction activities such as reefs blasting, spit cutting and dredging would
probably have some impact on nearby harbour operation and ships navigation. However,
such impact might be mitigated, given that rational working hours and working modes would
be adopted, navigation notices well done, and safety warning enhanced.
24



5 Project Alternatives
5.1 Alternatives for Liansharong Waterway Regulation Project
5.1.1 Recommended Regulation Scenario
There are three design scenarios for the Liansharong waterway regulation project. After
the comprehensive comparison among them, the recommended regulation scenario is that the
design dimensions of the waterway are 80 m wide and 4 m deep with a minimum curvature
radius of 500 m.
5.1.2 Comparison between Design Scenarios
5.1.2.1 Design Scenarios
(I) Scenario I, 80m  X 3.5m  X 500m (width X depth X minimum curvature
radius).
(2) Scenario 2, 80m X 4.Om X SOOm (width X depth X minimum curvature
radius).
(3) Scenario 3, 80m X 4.5m X SOOm (width X depth X minimum curvature
radius).
5.1.2.2 Comparison between Scenarios
Liansharong waterway situates in the river network region of the Pearl River Delta. In
dry season the waterway is basically controlled by tidal flow, while in flood season the
boundary of tidal flow moves up and down within the waterway. The average tidal level
difference is 0.46 m, and that at Yingezui is 0.63m, at Rongqi 0.86m, at Banshawei 1.OOm,
at Sanshanjiao 0.93m and at Sanshakou 1.SOm. Therefore, Liansharong waterway, situating
near the boundary of tidal flow, should make full use of tidal effects for navigation. Scenario
I needs 0.5-0.6 m of tidal water depth, which is greater than the average tidal level
difference at Nanhua station, and full-time navigation can not be guaranteed. Scenario 2 can
meet the requirement for 1,000 dwt river-seagoing ship's navigation, but there will be no
depth for silting. Tide can be employed to meet the requirement. Scenario 3 does not need
tidal level difference for silting, and there already has enough depth for silting, but it needs
more investment than Scenarios I and 2. After comprehensive analysis, Scenario 2 is
recommended.

5.1.3 Comparison of Environmental Impact
5.1.3.1 Discharge and Water Level Alterations and Their Impact on Flood Control
The model simulation shows that the results of three scenarios at different frequencies
are very similar.
(1). Alterations of discharge division ratio before and after the regulation: In Ronggui
section, discharge division ratio for each scenario would have nearly no alterations. In
Lijiasha section, alterations of discharge division ratio would be great, with the increase
ratios being 5.8-6.5%, 7.5-8.4% and 9.6-10.4% respectively for Scenario 1, Scenario 2 and
Scenario 3. In Shawan section and Lianhuashan section discharge division ratio would have
small changes, with a decrease ratio of about 1-2%. Comparatively speaking, alterations of
discharge division ratio for Scenario 3 would be the greatest, those of Scenario I the smallest
and those of Scenario 2 rank at the middle.
(2) Alterations of water level before and after the regulation: Water level alterations for
each scenario appear to be nearly in the same trend. In Ronggui section and Lianhuashan
section, water level would have hardly changes compared between before and after the
regulation. In Shawan section, water level would have slight changes, with the maximum
flood level rise being 3 cm and the maximum fall 5 cm. Comparatively speaking, alterations
for Scenario I would be greater than those for Scenarios 2 and 3.
5.1.3.2 Environmental Impact of Dredging and Reef Blasting
Dredging volumes for scenario 1, scenario 2 and scenario 3 would be 224.62 X 1  m3,
26



314.28 X 104 m3 and 426.70 X 104 m3 respectively. In general, with the increase of dredging
volumes, working hours of construction would increase, consequently SS amount in water
and dumping volume of dredged materials would also increase, that is, the greater the
dredging volume, the greater the environmental impact.
Volumes of reef blasting for Scenario 1, Scenario 2 and Scenario 3 would be 16.95 X
I 04  3, 26.46 X 10 m3 and 37.84 X 104 m3 respectively. Noise and relatively strong shock
waves from reef blasting would cause some impact on nearby residential areas and
constructions and aquatic organisms, but this kind of impact would be short-term and
irreversible. Since the volumes of reef blasting would be different among three scenarios, the
extent of environmental impact would also be varied. Generally speaking, the greater the
volumes of reef blasting, the greater the environmental impact. Among three scenarios,
volumes of reef blasting of the recommended scenario (Scenario 2) rank in the middle place,
and its environmental impact would be smaller than that of Scenario 3 and greater than that
of Scenario 1.
5.2 Alternatives for Xijiang Sea-going Waterway Regulation Project
As the recommended scenario of Xijiang sea-going waterway, Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen
waterway in the lower Xijiang river has two other alternatives: Modaomen seagoing
waterway and Hengmen seagoing waterway.
5.2.1 It is very difficult to train the sand bars at Modaomen outlet
Modaomen, the main seaward outlet of Xijiang river, diverts about 1/3 of the total silts
measured at Makou station. Modaomen waterway, wide and deep, is an ideal seagoing
waterway. However, sand bars are well developed at the outlet. If it is chosen as the
seagoing waterway, the critical engineering is to train the sand bars. Due to the poor
understanding of sand bars at the Modaomen outlet and the absence of investigation and
study at present, it is best not to train this sand bars for the present.
Flood discharge through Modaomen outlet ranks at the first place among 8 outlets. The
regulation of Modaomen outlet should mainly aim at satisfying the requirement of flood
discharge. The regulation scheme is to construct double guide levees along the waterway,
and the constructed guide levees do not access to the sand bars. How to extend the guide
levees need further study. The training of sand bars should combine with the outlet
regulation, and waterway regulation should not be conducted in haste.
27



5.2.2 It is very difricult to regulate Qi'ou shoal in Hengmen seagoing waterway
Feasibility study report for Hengmen seagoing waterway project has been completed.
Critical studies had been made in the report for Lanshan shoal and Ernao shoal, and the
causes of their formation had been analyzed and engineering measures were also put forward.
For Qi'ou shoal, only the cause of its formation had been analyzed. The sediment from Qi'ou
shoal is clay, which results from the sedimentation of coagulated substances. Qi'ou shoal,
having the characteristics of sand bar, is very difficult to regulate. It could be solved
gradually with the means of concentrating water flow and increasing scouring effects by
means of guide levees which would be constructed according to the planning, and in
associate with the outlet regulation and waterway regulation engineerings.
5.23 For Hutiaomen waterway it is more practical to go to sea through Yamen
seagoing waterway
Hutiaomen waterway has always been the main navigation channel to maintain. Except
for that bend radius at Hengken is not large enough, the waterway reaches the standard of
3rd class inland channel. Its important properties are that both tidal flow and runoff flow
follows the river configuration, the existing pattern that water and silts go separately would
not change after the regulation, no lands would be occupied, flood level rise could be
controlled within 15 cm, drainage and irrigation facilities along the shorelines would
function normally, and road, railway and bridges would not be disturbed. After having
negotiated with pertinent departments for many times, we consider that Hutiaomen waterway
is relatively practical.

On-post training aims to strengthen environmental monitoring and management during
construction stage and operation stage, and to ensure environmental monitoring quality and
efficient environmental management, so as to enhance the overall quality of the project. The
on-post training would also help to find the problems in environmental monitoring and
management, which should be reported to Environmental Protection Section timely so as to
take appropriate measures to modify and solve. The training last I month, and two training
would be conducted during construction stage (at the Ist quarter of the 1st year and 1st

transportation network in which waterway, road and railway develop coordinately in Pearl
River Delta, for promoting the extension of shoreline and coastal productivity and
stimulating the growth of regional economy.
(3) However, during construction stage, the project might have negative effects on
aquatic organisms, water quality, acoustic environment, and human health. Therefore,
35



appropriate mitigation measures should be put forward.

water plant intake. Therefore, we simulate, with the two-dimensional model, the
concentration fields of SS caused by dredging and analyze the impact of SS on water intakes.
In addition, the Environmental Action Plan required that monitoring stations be set up,
during construction stage, at 5 km upstream and 500 m downstream of the water intakes and
water quality monitoring be performed once per I 0-day.

8 Analysis of Environmental and Economical
Benefits and Costs
8.1 Investment of the Project
The total investment of the project will be 127,363.29 X 104 RMB, or 15,400.64 X 104
USS. The construction period divides into 4 fiscal years.
8.2 Social Benefit of The Project
With the completion of the waterway regulation project in the lower Xijiang river, a
more convenient waterborne transportation environment composed of river and sea would be
created for the economic zone of Pearl River Delta, which would change the relatively
closed inland water transportation pattern at present, and improve the integral transportation
network of waterway, road and railway. That would help develop the regional economy and
stimulate the economic rise in the Pearl River Delta and even all Pearl River Watershed.
With the increase of navigation capacity after the completion of the regulation project,
the transportation cost would be lowered. In associate with the establishment of new
harbours and docks along the waterway, the environment for investing would be optimized.
All these would play an active role in introducing foreign capital, and advanced technology
and management methods, and in reforming the production structure and the productivity
layout.
With the completion of the project, regional economy  would grow rapidly, which
would  provide more employment opportunities, stimulate the development of the third
industry, and raise the income of residents. As a result, living quality of local residents
would rise steadily.
8.3 Environmental Loss and Environmental Protection Investment
8.3.1 Environmental Loss
(I) Construction activities such as reef blasting would have influence on fishery
production, and destroy some aquatic organisms and fishery resources.
(2) Since reef blasting and dredging during construction stage might increase SS
content in water, water plants along the waterway would have to spend more money on
water treatment.
39



(3) Cost to conduct dredging in front of the water gates, locating between spur dikes
group. would increase.
(4) Levees along both banks would be influenced by the project, thus bank protection
measures should be added.
(5) The occupation of some lands during construction stage would influence land use
and agricultural production.
8.3.2 Costs to Mitigate Environmental Impacts
8.3.2.1 Pollution Control
*   Ship Waste Control
(1) For Scenario 3, treatment of oil wastewater and oil leakage would need an
investment of RMB30 X 104.
(2) Treatment of ship sewage would cost RMB243.29 X 104
(3) Disposal of ship garbage would need invest RMB 1046.40 X10;.
(4) The total investmnent for ship waste control would be RMBI,319.69 X 104.This
investment will be made by harbor superintendence and is not part of project estimate costs.
*   Noise control
Supposed that half of the ships navigating on Liansharong waterway and the
construction ships do not have noise abatement facilities and each noise abatement facility
costs RMB5,000, a total investment of RMB26,160 X 104 would need for ship noise control.
This investment will be made by shipping companies and is not part of project estimate
costs.
8.3.2.2 Shoreline Protection
*   Levees and Bank Protection Engineering
Because the waterway regulation project would change the flow pattern, some river
sections would need bank protection engineerings, dykes or erosion protection. Total
investment is about RMB 1763.04 X 104, included within "engineering" category of project
investment.
40



*   Reforestation along Shorelines
Total length of reforestation would be 20 km and Supposed that RMB 20,000 would
need for each kilometer of greening belt, totally RMB 400 X 10 would be required. This
investment will be made by local governments and is not part of project estimate costs.
8.3.2.3 Compensation for rishing loss
This part of investment will be decided by agreement on GPWB and GPSAPD
(Guangdong Provincial Sea and Aquatic Products Department) altogether.

9 Conclusions and Suggestions
9.1 Conclusions
9.1.1 Economic Benefit of the Project Construction
With the completion of the waterway regulation project in the lower Xijiang river, a
more convenient waterborne transportation environment composed of river and sea would be
created for the economic zone of the Pearl River Delta, which will improve the integral
transportation network of waterway, road and railway and stimulate the further development
of regional economy in Pearl River Delta and even all Pearl River Watershed.
9.1.2 Main Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures
9.1.2.1 Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures during Construction Stage
(I) During construction stage, construction activities such as dredging, dike building
and reef blasting would cause bottom mud floating up, and result in the increase of SS
contents in water. Water plants should be informed in advance before the construction starts,
so that they can make proper preparation not to take water in the working hours of the
construction. In addition, water quality monitorinig for each water intake should be
conducted during construction stage.
(2) Construction activities, such as reef blasting and dredging, etc. would disrupt
aquatic organisms, especially fishery resources. The project developer should coordinate and
negotiate with the fishery administrative department as early as possible, so as to formulate
jointly a construction scheme which would minimize the loss of fishery resources. After the
completion of construction, fishery multiplication should be conducted.
(3) Noise impact arising from the operation of construction equipment would be
temporary, and would be substantially lowered, given that rational working hours be chosen.
(4) Strong shock waves from reef blasting would have some impact on the banks and
other nearby constructions, and would also disturb aquatic organisms. Therefore, the blasting
method using small doses of explosives should be applied during the reef blasting, and in the
sections where base rock has been heavily weathered, reefs should be removed with
mechanical methods as far as possible.
44



(5) Waste earth and dredged materials arising from the construction works should be
dumped to the planned dumping grounds.
(6) Because of lots of construction workers and poor hygiene conditions in the
construction sites during the construction stage, some diseases would be subject to prevail.
Publicity of hygiene knowledge should be strengthened, public health works should be well
done in construction sites and residential areas.
(7) 936 mu (62.4 ha) of lands would be occupied during construction stage. There
would be no removal and migration, and no resettlement would be involved. Rational
compensation should be made for land users.
(8) Construction activities such as reefs blasting, dredging and sailing of construction
ships might influence the traffic order on the waterway, cause local and short-term traffic
jam, and even impact harbour operation. A scheme to ensure navigation while constructing
should be formulated and implemented by the construction department, and construction
engineering should not be conducted during the peak hours of navigation and harbour
operation.
9.1.3.2 Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures during Operation Stage
(1) Liansharong waterway regulation would have no much impact on flood control,
since the maximum rise of flood water level would be only 3 cm and the flood water level
would even fall in some sections after the regulation. With the completion of Zhaoqing-
Hutiaomen waterway regulation, the maximum rise of flood water level might reach 0.16 m
compared with that before the regulation. The rise of flood water level would mainly occur
in the upper Dianshuizhoutou, and its impact would be small on the sections of the lower
Beikingtou in Hutiaoment waterway. Levees with low flood control standards should be
heightened and reinforced. In addition, observation of water level during the construction
stage and after the completion of regulation should be enhanced.
(2) The regulation project would change silting and scouring regime of the waterway.
Channel depth should be maintained, and re-silting should occur on the shore side, so as to
make scouring and silting in waterway rational and orderly.
(3) Many spur dike groups would be set up along Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen waterway
within the lower Xijiang river, which would have certain influence on the water gates and
the water diversion stations among the groups. These gates and stations coutd be modified
45



and removed.
(4) Computation results of saline intrusion of Z-H Waterway show that the distance of
saline intrusion after the construction is only 6m increase, therefore the Impact is negligible.
But. water quality monitoring (e.g. chlorinity) after the completion of this project should be
strengthened.
(5) Amount of pollutants generating from ships would be small. However, their direct
discharges into the waterway would still aggravate water pollution. It is suggested that in
short term ship pollutants should be collected and transferred onto land for treatment.
Meanwhile, management regulation on ship pollution control should be formulated, and
some ships with heavy pollution must be abandoned to operate.
(6) Noise levels caused by ship sailing would basically be within the corresponding
environmental noise standards. Only abrupt noise levels caused by ship whistling would
exceed the standard. It is suggested that in the regions near to the shorelines, especially
within the distance of 30 m from the banks, no noise-sensitive constructions be planned to
develop. Monitoring and management of ship noise should be strengthened. Afforested
belts should be established on the shorelines of sensitive sections.
9.2 Suggestions
(I) Publicity of the project should be enhanced through media such as TV, radio and
newspaper so as to let the project be well known.
(2) Environmental protection during construction stage should be strengthened.
(3) Much attention should be paid to the observation of flood level along the waterway
after the completion of the project, and the observed results should report to the Flood
Control Command Center timely.
(4) Regional water pollution sources, including ship pollutants, should be controlled.
(5) Navigation safety management, especially the management on ships transporting
dangerous materials, should be strengthened. Emergency response system to pollution
accident should be established.
In summary, the waterway regulation project in the lower Xijiang river is a project of
comprehensive water resources utilization beneficial for both the nation and the common
46



people. After the regulation, navigation conditions in Pearl River Delta would be improved,
which would be not only favourable for the regional economic development and social
progress in the delta, but also favorable for realizing the policy of "open-door' further in
Pearl River Catchment. The project is feasible. Although the project construction would
bring some negative environmental effects, most of the effects would be short-term and
small, and would be mitigated by taking some control measures.
