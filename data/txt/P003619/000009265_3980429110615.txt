1 Environmental Protection Targets
The environmental protection targets for the waterway regulation project are specified as
follows, according to the construction properties of the waterway regulation project in the lower
Xijiang river and the environmental impact assessment for the project, and the requirement for
environmental assessment and environmental action plan by the World Bank.
1.1 Environmental Protection Targets During Construction Stage
1.1.1 Water Quality
Suspended substances (SS) from the earth-rock works such as dredging, reefs blasting and
spit-cutting in course of the waterway regulation would cause certain water quality pollution
above or below the construction sites. Protection targets for water quality include 9 water intakes
along Liansharong waterway and 4 water intakes in the lower Xijiang river.
1.1.2 Fishery Resources
The engineering behaviors such as navigating of the construction ships, earth excavating and
reef blasting would have temporary destructive effects on aquatic ecological environment, and
change the distribution of fish communities. Damming would change the migratory path of fish
communities, and the increase of SS would also have negative effects on fish living. The target
would be to reduce the impact of construction activities on fishery resources, so that fishery
resources could  be restored in operation stage.
1.1.3 Acoustic Environment
Noise sources include noise generating from the engines of construction ships, whistling,
explosive sound from reef blasting and spit-cutting, and thunder from the operation of dredging
machines and mixing machines, of which some are strong. Protection targets are the four densely
populated towns of Guangli, Shakou, Rongqi and Lianhuashan on both shorelines of the
waterway.
1.1.4 Others
Vibration resulting from reefs blasting might cause damages to nearby constructions.
Protection targets include levees along both banks, underwater cables and bridges, etc.
1.2 Environmental Protection Targets During Operation Stage
1.2.1 Water Quality
After being widened and deepened, the waterway would be navigable for 3,000 dwt sea-



going vessels (Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen waterway) and 1,000 dwt vessels (Liansharong waterway)
respectively. Compared with that before regulation, navigation capacity would be raised, and
waterborne transportation flow might have apparent increase. Accordingly, more oil wastewater,
sewage and garbage would be generated from ships. In course of the transportation of harmful
or toxic chemicals and dangerous materials of inflammables and explosives, pollution accidents
might happen due to improper management and unexpected causes. The above two factors,
especially the former, would have constant negative effects on water quality. Protection targets are
same with those as stated in Section 1.1.1.
1.2.1 Acoustic Environment
Navigation capacity and waterborne transportation flow would be raised after the completion
of waterway regulation project. Noise from the operation of ship engines and whistling would
have some negative effects on acoustic environment along the shorelines of the waterway.
Protection targets are same with those as stated in Section 1. 1.3.
In order to protect the above environmental factors from suffering the negative effects,
certain protection measures must be taken, and in addition, action plans for environmental
monitoring and environmental management must be worked out so as to efficiently undertake
environmental protection work.



2 Environmental Protection Measures
In order to mitigate negative environment effects generating from the waterway regulation
project in the lower Xijiang river, the project development must follow the specifications defined
by the Environmental Management Regulations for Development Projects, so that both
environmental protection facilities and the main project would be simultaneously designed,
constructed and put into operation.
2.1 During Design Stage
2.1.1 Water Quality
2.1.1.1 Sensitive Protection Targets for Water Quality
There exist 4 water plants along Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen waterway in the lower Xijiang river,
and 9 water plants along Liansharong waterway.
2.1.1.2 The Regulation Scheme Favorable for Water Quality Protection
The regulation of Lianshrong waterway would adopt the medium scheme, that is, 80m X
4.Om X 500m (width X depth X minimum curvature radius), since the scheme would not only
make full use of tidal range for satisfying the requirement of re-silting, but also save the
investment and reduce the dredging and reefs blasting volumes. With the decrease of dredging and
reefs blasting volumes, that is, the decrease of SS source strength, SS amount would reduce
accordingly, and water quality impact caused by SS would be lowered proportionally.
2.1.2 Fishery Resources
2.1.2.1 Protection Targets
Protection targets include such rare and precious fish species as Acipenser sinensis Gray,
Macrura reevesii (Richardson), Leucosome chinensis (Osbeck) and Auguillajaponica Temminck
et Schlegel, etc. which migrate along the lower Xijiang river and Liansharong waterway.
2.1.2.2 Regulation Scheme Design Favorable for Fishery Resources Protection
(I) Reefs blasting should be avoided as far as possible, because explosion in reefs blasting
would be relatively strong and would threaten nearby fish. Therefore, it is suggested to remove the
heavily weathered reefs by means of excavating mechanically.
(2) For the sections where reefs blasting are necessary, it is best to conduct blasting in winter
but not in the migratory season of fish (May to October).



2.1.3 Flood Level Rise and Flood Control
2.1.3.1 Protection Targets
Flood protection levees along the waterway should be protected so as to ensure that the
existing flood control standards would not be lowered after the regulation project.
2.1.3.2 Heightening and Reinforcing of the Existing Levees
In accordance with the protection targets, the levees in the main sections with flood level rise
(that is, at the upperstream of Dianshuizhoutou in the lower Xijiang river, and Lijiasha section in
Liansharong waterway) should be heightened and reinforced, and bank protection facilities should
be established.
2.1.4 Noise
2.1.4.1 Protection Targets
Densely populated areas include Guangli town and Shakou town along the lower Xijiang
river, and Lianhuashan town and Rongqi town along Liansharong waterway.
2.1.4.2 Establishment of Afforested Belts
An afforested belt of 5 km long and 10 m wide should be established, mainly by planting
trees, along the shorelines in each of the above 4 towns. This task would be fulfilled by local
governments in combination with the town construction and environmental amenity.
2.2 During Construction Stage
2.2.1 Water Quality
(1) To coordinate with water plants, and not to undertake construction works while taking
water so as to mitigate the effects on water quality at the water intake.
(2) During construction stage, water plants should store water timely in the intervals of
construction.
(3) Based on the simulation results of mathematical models, SS contents and diffusion ranges
would be greater at rising tide than at falling tide. Therefore, it is best to conduct construction
activities at falling tide.
(4) Pollutants from construction ships would not be allowed to discharge at will, but should
be collected and transferred onto the shores for treatment.



(5) Construction activities should be stopped when the concentration of SS exceeds
controlling standard (about 2 hours).
(6) Water quality monitoring for the water intakes and main sections with construction
activities should be well conducted.
2.2.2 Fishery Resources
(1) Numbers of reefs blasting should be reduced as far as possible so as to mitigate damages
to fishery resources.
(2) For the necessary reefs blasting, explosion techniques using small dose of explosives
should be employed, and blasting should not be conducted during the fish migratory season (May
to October).
2.2.3 Noise
(I) Construction activities should be conducted far away from such sensitive points as
residential areas.
(2) Construction activities should be conducted in daytime (6:30-22:00).
2.2.4 Vibration from Blasting
(I) Levees along both shores are the nearest constiuctions away from the source of reefs
blasting. The explosion design should aim not to destroy the existing levee structure and not to
affect the flood control standards, the utilization of explosives should be controlled, and the
advanced techniques should be adopted.
(2) Cross-river cables and bridges are also critical protection targets.
2.2.5 Other Environmental Protection Measures
(I) In order to mitigate the impact on agricultural production and farmners' income, lands
required by the construction should choose. the overflow land as far as possible. Rational
compensation should be made for the land users.
(2) In order to ensure the lower section of the waterway unobstructed and mitigate flood level
rise during construction stage, the principle of "Constructing first at the lower section and then at
the upper section, and combining dredging with regulating" should be strictly followed.
(3) During construction stage, working hours should not be in the peak hours of navigation



and harbor operation. Navigation notice should be issued before the construction begin, so as not
to influence waterborne transportation order and harbor operation.
(4) Public health work should be well done at the construction sites so as to prevent
prevailine of infectious and epidemic diseases.
2.3 During Operation Stage
2.3.1 Water Quality
(1) In the near future, ship pollutants (including oil wastewater, sewage and garbage) should
be collected and transferred to the shore to dispose, and oil separators should be gradually
equipped when conditions are fine. In addition, management regulation to control ship pollution
should be formulated, and some ships with heavy pollution must be abandoned.
(2) Water quality monitoring to the water intakes and at the routine monitoring stations
should be strengthened during operation stage.
2.3.2 Flood Level Rise and Flood Control
(1) The existing levees along both shores should be reinforced so as to achieve appropriate
flood control standards, and especially for Lijiasha section, bank protection engineering should
start and complete at the same time with the dredging engineering.
(2) In the sections with flood level rise observed after the regulation, the project development
unit should heighten and reinforce the existing levees on the existing basis so as to counteract the
effect of flood level rise.
(3) Water level observation after regulation should be enhanced so as to well understand the
actual effect of flood level rise, and the observation results should be conveyed in time to the
Flood Control Command Center.
2.3.3 Fishery Resources
The project development unit should coordinate with the fishery administrative department to
perform multiplication work so as to restore fishery resources as soon as possible.
2.3.4 Ship Noise
(1) Ships without holds or noise abatement facilities should be limited to put into operation.
(2) It is suggested that, in order to mitigate ship noise impact, afforested belts with a total
length of 20 km should be established along the shorelines in course of the town development in



four towns of Lianhuashan, Rongqi, Shakou and Guangli (each town with 5 km).
2.3.5 Scouring Effects on the Banks
In the sections with spur dike groups, bank protection measures should be taken on the
opposite bank of the dike. A total of 19,875 m bank protection works would be required for the
lower Xijiang river and Liansharong waterway regulation project.



3 Environmental Monitoring Plan
The factors which would impact the above environmental protection targets can be divided
into two kinds: temporary factors and permanent factors. Temporary factors generate mainly
during construction stage, such as dredging, reefs blasting, bends or spit cutting, and occupying
part of arable lands, etc., and their impact on aquatic ecological environment and fishery resources,
and land occupation along both shores would gradually diminish after the completion of
construction works. For this kind of factors, environmental protection conscience and
environmental management should be strengthened during construction stage, and effective and
feasible pollution control measures should be taken. For the permanent factors, regular monitoring
at the fixed stations needs to conduct so as to provide sound basis for environmental management.
3.1 Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Standards
Water quality and environmental noise etc. belong to long-term environmental protection
targets. Monitoring items and standards should thoroughly follow the relevant state standards.
Relevant state standards are listed in Tables I to 4.

Environmental monitoring during construction stage would be of relatively high frequency,
and work load is heavy. During environmental management activities before the construction,
personnel training should be well done in advance, and monitoring equipment and instrument and
a certain amount of operation capital should be well prepared. It is requested that managerial
personnel of the construction teams in the project contractor should receive short-term training (1-



2 weeks) on environmental protection and monitoring, and nominate part-time environmental
management assistant from the construction teams so as to ensure the complete implementation of
environmental monitoring plan.
3.3 Environmental Monitoring Plan During Operation Stage
After the completion of the waterway regulation project, the structure of environmental
impact factors would have changed. Besides wastewater discharged directly from residential and
industrial areas of the towns along the waterway, ship noise and pollutants would become one of
the main factors which have influence on environment. Under these circumstance, besides
continuing to monitor water quality and environmental noise, it seems more important to
strengthen inspection and management on ships. Environmental management during operation
stage must be placed into an more important position. In order to quantitatively evaluate the
influence on water environment and acoustic environment arising from the improvement of
waterway conditions and the raise of navigation capacity, and to provide sound basis for
environmental management in near future, 1-3 years' environmental monitoring would still need
during the operation stage after the completion of all the project. Table 6 presents the
environmental monitoring plan during operation stage.
3.4 Submission of Monitoring Results
Monthly report of monitoring results during construction stage should be submitted by the
Project Office to its competent authority Guangdong Provincial Waterway Bureau and local
Environmental Protection Bureaus at municipal or county levels. Each season, a seasonal report
should be submitted by the Project Office to Guangdong Provincial Waterway Bureau,
Guangdong Provincial Transportation Department, Guangdong Provincial Environmental
Protection Bureau and related Municipal- or County-Level Environmental Protection Bureau.
Each year, an annual report should be submitted by the Project Office to the Ministry of
Transportation, NEPA (National Environmental Protection Agency), and related local competent
authorities of the project. In addition, the monitoring results should also be given to related
affected units (for example, water plants). The submission procedure of monitoring results is
shown in Figure 1.

4. Environmental Management Plan
4.1 Environmental Management Organizations, Duties and Operation Procedure
The waterway regulation project in the lower Xijiang river is a regional transportation
engineering of large scale and long time, which will have significant and far-reaching impact on
the transportation conditions of the Pearl River Delta area. Environmental management during
construction and operation stages will also be a complicated system engineering with extensive
scope and heavy duty, which needs to face many tasks. A special environmental management
agency should be established, which should be experienced and specified, and possess a certain
administrative power. Accordingly, a special Environmental Protection Section should be set up
during construction stage in the Project Office to be in charge of environment supervision,
management and monitoring, etc. During operation stage (after the completion of construction
activities), the Environmental Protection Section should remain and be directed by Guangdong
Provincial Waterway Bureau, to continue to be responsible for environmental management and
monitoring. Figure 2 is the composition of environmental management organization chart.
Duties of the Environmental Protection Section are as follows:
(1) To work out specific environmental protection measures in accordance with the
construction schemes, and to provide consulting opinions for the Director of Project Office and
related persons.
(2) To review what are related with environmental protection in the construction scheme, and
for the parts which are not conformed with the relevant state and sector environmental protection
regulations, to put forward opinions for modification or inform the Project Office to instruct the
design institute to modify. If the construction scheme did not pass the review, no construction
work would be allowed to start.
(3) With the cooperation of the municipal and county governments and special environmental
protection agencies along the waterway, to set up Environmental Protection Divisions being
complete with the various branches of the project office, and to determine the monitoring region
and contents for various environmental monitoring institutions along the waterway. To organize
preparatory training for local environmental management and monitoring personnel.

(4) To be responsible for the coordination with relevant units and departments, and to keep
the feedback of information, through the Project Office, with the Enviromnental Division of
World Bank and other related departments with which the project involves.
(5) To be responsible for analyzing environmental monitoring data and prepare monthly,



seasonal and annual environmental management reports, and to dynamically understand
environmental pollution status during construction stage and operation stage. Once finding that
there are construction teams (ships) and operation ships to violate environmental protection
regulation or to take no specified pollution-control measures, the Project Office should order
immediately the construction team to take improving measures and demand the Harbor
Supervision Department and the Ship Inspection Departments to instruct the violating ships to
take appropriate pollution control measures.
Environmental Protection Branches are the environmental management institutions set up in
the grass-roots units of the project. Their duties include:
(1) Directed professionally by the Environmental Protection Section of Project Office, they
would be responsible for supervising the execution of various environmental management plan
issued by Environmental Protection Section. They should keep contact with the Environmental
Protection Section, submit monthly executive report of local environmental management, and
prepare environmental monitoring report.
(2) To check how the construction teams execute pollution control measures, to join in
engineering supervision, to issue the notice immediately to those construction teams (ships) who
violate environmental protection regulation and do not execute control measures efficiently and to
report to the Environmental Protection Section, and to assist in dealing with environmental
pollution accidents.
(3) To assist environmental monitoring institutions and the Environmental Protection Section
to fulfill environmental monitoring task, and to conduct on-post training for   environmental
monitoring and construction management personnel.
Environmental management is one of the important tasks to ensure the regulation project to
become an excellent one, which has less negative environmental effects and great long-term
benefits. Environmental management plan must be put into execution from the preparatory stage,
including such works as organizing environmental monitoring personnel and environmental
manager, technical training, purchase of equipment, housing arrangement, establishment of
environmental management regulation and formulation of environmental monitoring plan, etc.
According to the different environmental protection targets and the changes of monitoring
requirement during the construction stage and the operation stage, meetings should be held to
discuss proper measures. Table 7 lists annual arrangement of the environmental management plan.

4.2 Environmental Management Training Program
4.2.1 Preparatory Training for Environmental Management and Monitoring Personnel
Environmental monitoring and environmental management are critical to all the waterway
regulation project whether during construction stage or during operation stage. During the four-
year-long waterway regulation project, environmental monitoring and environmental management
would face various kinds of conditions, and work load would also be great. The core to
successfully implement environmental monitoring and management plans is to have responsible
environmental monitoring and management cadres with advanced technology and high efficiency.
To train environmental monitoring and management personnel is an important aspect of
environmental management.
One year before construction work begins, Environmental Protection Section should also be



set up in the same time with the establishment of the Project Office. The first thing, after the
establishment of the Environmental Protection Section, is to organize I months training for
environmental monitoring and management personnel. Training program can be divided into the
following three stages:
(I) Intense training on environmental protection knowledge: Through such activities as
inviting specialists to give lectures, watching video cassettes, and visiting, relevant personnel
would have a thorough understanding on environmental protection regulations and specifications
in China, on the requirement of environmental protection by the World Bank, on the
environmental impact of the project, and on the regulations and requirement in the
environmental protection design, supervision, management and monitoring of the project, so that
they would understand the importance of environmental protection on promoting the sustainable
development of social economy and living quality. Training period is one month. (see to Tab.8).

(2)Field practice: Experts would be invited to lecture on monitoring principles and
methodology at different water functional zones. In the meantime, environmental management
staff would required to discuss environmental impact of various engineering operations and
mitigation measures. Conclusions from the discussion should be integrated into the environmental
protection measures for construction stage. It would last 15 days.
(3) Overseas training: 5 persons of environmental management staff would be selected and
sent abroad to learn the advanced techniques of environmental protection in other countries where
there existed similar waterway regulation projects (The best is the World Bank loan projects), and
to work out practical environmental protection measures in accordance with the actual situations
of the present project. It should last 15 days. (see to Tab. 7)



4.2.2 On-post Training for Environmental Monitoring and Management Staff
On-post training aims to strengthen environmental monitoring and management during
construction stage and operation stage, and to ensure environmental monitoring quality and
efficient environmental management, so as to enhance the overall quality of the project. The on-
post training would also help to find the problems in environmental monitoring and management,
which should be reported to Environmental Protection Section timely so as to take appropriate
measures to modify and solve. The training last I month, and two trainings would be conducted
during construction stage (at the Ist quarter of the 1st year and Ist quarter of the 2nd year
respectively), and one training every other year during operation stage (at the I st quarter).
4.3 Environmental Management during Construction Stage
Environmental protection targets during construction stage mainly includes water quality,
fishery resources, acoustic environment, land resources and navigation traffic, of which fishery
resources and navigation traffic would be restored very soon after the completion of construction
activities. Furthermore, according to the investigation, no large- to medium-sized fish reproduction
bases were found along Zhaoqing-Hutiaomen waterway and Liansharong waterway, and the
negative effects on navigation traffic caused by the construction ships are the unavoidable cost for
the waterway regulation. Environmental management plan during construction stage should
concentrate on water quality, acoustic environment, vibrations of reefs blasting and land
resources.
4.3.1 Water Quality
Earth excavating and dredging, bends cutting and straightening, reefs blasting and pollutant
discharges from ship in operation would have great impact on water quality. Earth excavating and
dredging should be controlled in scale , and should be avoided to conduct at the same section
simultaneously. The engineering around water intakes (at 3 km upperstream, 500 m downstream)
should be coordinated in time with the water plants, and three hours' interval would be needed
between constructing hours and water-intaking hours. For the branches with aquaculture which
have direct connection with the water from the project waterway, construction teams should be
requested with unpolluted earth to construct cofferdams.
All construction ships (for examples, dredging ships, tugboats, and barges), before putting
into operation, must go through inspecting by the Ship Inspection Bureau, and should also receive
annual routine check. Ships with load capacity of over 200 tons must equipped with oil separator
and sewage collection hold. Small-sized barges and powered ships must mount oil disk under
power equipment, and equip with pumping closestools and nightsoil collecting box. All garbage
should store in plastic bags. Oil ballast water from large-sized ships, after being treated with the
oil separator, might be discharged directly. Oil collection box, and nightsoil collecting box from
small-sized ships, and garbage from all kinds of ships should transfer to harbor or specified



garbage receiving stations.
The GPWB entrusts  the Pearl River Basin Water Environment Monitoring Center to
undertake the water quality monitoring work according to the Action Plan . The monitoring report
will be submitted to the General Office of the World Bank Loan Project of GPWB and then be
submitted to the related authorities by the General Office. Any  water quality problem will be
reported to the local environmental protection agencies and the local environmental protection
agencies will require the GPWB to protect the water quality of the construction river section. Then
the GPWB will require the construction unit to adjust the construction plan and take some
environmental protection measures .If the water quality is unqualified (SS ,etc.) due to the
construction, the construction scope and speed shall be adjusted and if necessary , the construction
unit shall stop the construction for a short time to recover the water quality. If the oil leakage
from construction ships happens, the construction unit will be required to clean the leaked oil and
collect the oil to the bank for treatment. The harbouir superintendent agency will undertake the
routine management work for the navigation ships (see Fig. 3 for the supervision and management
process).
4.3.2 Acoustic Environment
Various kinds of ships, vehicles and machines (e.g., cement mixing machines) in operation
during construction stage will generate constant noise, and reefs blasting will produce  strong
explosive noise. Construction teams should be requested to arrange their operation hours
rationally, and avoid working during the resting and sleeping hours (12:00-14:00, 22:00-6:30).
Environmental management on transportation should also be strengthened, and ships and vehicles,
while passing through residential areas, must lower their speed, and should be forbidden to whistle
or use high-voice loudspeakers.
Pearl River Water Resources Protection Scientific Institute (PRWRPSI) will be in charge of
the noise data analysis work during the construction stage. If there exists any noise problem, the
PRWRPSI will notice the local environmental protection agencies and the local agencies will
require the GPWB to guarantee that the noise of the construction river section can reach
standards. Then, the GPWB will ask the construction unit to adjust the construction plan and
take some environmental protection measures such as adjusting the construction time, avoiding
the noise sensitive time, strengthening the supervision and management work and controlling the
whistle noise of construction trucks and ships (see Fig. 3 for the supervision and management
process).
4.3.3 Vibration from Reefs Blasting
If reefs blasting is undertaken near to protection targets, environmental protection
management personnel should remind the construction workers in advance that, during the
operation, on-site inspection and post check should be performed seriously so as to ensure the
safety of environmental protection targets. in case of accidents or if problems occur, further



construction works should stop at once, and report should be made to relevant departments. The
engineering might continue only after the construction methods have been improved.
During the blasting construction stage, the Environmental Protection Division of the General
Office of GPWB will be in charge of the supervision and management work. If the environmental
protection division finds any unexpected fish resources problem, the  division will report to the
environmental protection agencies and aquatic products agencies. If the blasting  have impacts
on embankments and cross-river buildings, the environmental protection division will notice the
project owner or related responsible authorities and then require the GPWB to demand the
construction unit to take some environmental protection measures to mitigate the impacts. If the
vibration is too severe and is dangerous to the surrounding population or buildings, the
construction unit shall stop construction and do some research  work on blasting technique with
small amount of explosives. If blasting construction have caused economical losses ,the
construction unit shall give compensation (see Fig. 4 for the supervision and management
process).
4.3.4 Land Resources
Earth and rock generated by the construction works, apart from being used to reinforce
levees, and dredged sediments would require lands to store. Land occupation by the project would
change the existing land use forms. For dredged sediments, the construction teams should strictly
select dumping places, and transport them to designated dumping places ( For details, see relevant
figures in EA report). The occupied arable lands or residential lands, according to relevant
regulations, should be economically compensated through state and local governments. With the
completion of construction, the construction teams should clear the remains so as to reach the
original land use conditions.
The GPWB will be in charge of the supervision of the land use in construction area and the
dredging material disposal in cooperation with the local land management authorities. If there
exists any problem, the local land management authorities will require the GPWB to demand the
construction unit to continue construction in accordance with the land requisition scheme and
dredging material disposal plan (see Fig. 5 for the supervision and management process).

4.4 Environmental Management for Operation Stage
After the completion of the waterway regulation project, large-scale earth and stone
engineermgs would be basically completed, and waterborne transportation flow would increase
apparently. To protect water quality along the waterway and to control noise pollution would
become the chief issues for environmental management. The main points of environmental



management during operation stage are as follows:

C-
C- C
Construction  Unit
Fig. 5   Environmental Protection Supervision and Management Process
4.4.1 Water quality and environmental noise should be monitored at the same as Tab.6. Publicity
of environmental protection consciences should be strengthened, and such thought that
environmental monitorincg and management may be paid less attention after the completion of
regulation should be eliminated. Although the Project Office might be dismantled, its
Environmental Protection Section must be remained and should continue to be in charge of
supervising environmental monitoring along the waterway, and to deal with the cases that
wastewater is discharged into the waterway over specified standards and garbage pollution
accidents, in associate with the local Environmental Protection Bureau, Harbor Supervision
Bureau, Waterway Bureau and Ship Inspection Bureau, efc.
4.4.2 Annual inspection on ships and navigation supervision management should be
strengthened. All ships navigating periodically along the waterway, according to relevant state
specifications, must equip with oil separator or collection box for wastewater ( including sewage
and human excrement). Only after wastewater from the oil separator in trial operation could
meet the discharge standards, would the ship pass the inspection. Its complete measures would
be to establish additional receiving stations for wastewater and garbage in proper locations along
the waterway (for exarnple, in the residential areas or industrial areas on the shores where there
exist facilities for wastewater and garbage treatment). Harbor supervision departments should
equip with excellent waterway supervising facilities (e.g. helicopter for pollution monitoring) so
as to raise the efficiency and accuracy of navigation supervision. Those ships which have
violated environmental management regulations should be punished heavily by the means of
fining, stopping operation, and even detain the ship ( in cooperation with the Public Security
Department).
4.4.3 Monitoring at the direct discharge points from residential areas and industrial areas



(including harbor areas) along the waterway should be strengthened. In case of finding the
discharger who discharge heavily-polluted wastewater of over standards, the Environmental
Protection Section of the Project Office can ask relevant departments to inform local
Environmental Protection Bureau to take proper measures.
4.4.4 Noise monitoring should continue to be conducted regularly at the fixed stations according
to the monitoring plan. Monitoring results should be summed up and analyzed, and accordingly
noise control zones should be put forward. Within the control zones, warning signal and noise
level control marks should be established, and ships would be requested to lower their sailing
speed and whistling level should be controlled. For those private or family-kind power barges,
which navigate often along the waterway but do not have noise-abatement hold, Ship Inspection
and Harbor Supervision Departments should force the ship owners to take appropriate noise
abatement measures (for example, to equip with noise abatement protection cover). Harbor
Supervision Departments should take proper fining measures to the ships which violate
regulations. No noise-sensitive constructions such as hospital, school, office and residential areas
should be arranged within the distance of 200 m away from the bank.
4.4.5 Management to dangerous materials transportation and response ability to pollution
accidents should be strengthened. After the waterway has be deepened, widened and straightened,
navigation capacity and transportation load, in one hand, would have been increased, and in the
other hand, the possibility of pollution accidents would also be raised. To strengthen supervision
and management on the ships which transport dangerous materials is also an important aspect of
environmental management during operation stage. The loading and unloading dangerous cargoes
in all harbors along the waterway must strictly follow the operation procedure: to declare---to be
examined--to load at the designated dock under supervision---to leave harbor under guidance---to
register for the entrance of harbor---to enter harbor 'under guidance---to unloading at the
designated dock under supervision. Any behavior to violate the regulation must be corrected in
time, and should be punished according to No.20 or 21 Orders of the Ministry of Communication.
In order to strengthen the response ability to pollution accidents, the Harbor Supervision
Departments should be well prepared in the following two aspects:
(I) The harbour superintendent agencies shall set up a good emergency communication system
and keep close contact with each port, harbor and water environment sensitive points (such as the
water factory ) along the waterway. If leakage of poison and harmful chemicals or any another
pollution accident happens, the sensitive points along the waterway shall be noticed of the
accident according to the fixed supervision process.
(2) With the increase of the transportation flow, we propose the harbor superintendent agencies to
fit out some emergency pollution-prevention equipment (such as garbage clear ship) in some
bigger harbors along the bank such as Lianhuashan Harbor and Rongqi Harbor and also set up a
special accident rescue team. At the same time, the harbor superintendent agencies shall make
further research on chemistry and microbiology method for treatment of dangerous chemicals in
order to promptly take some effective measures when pollution accident happens.



5 Costs to Mitigate Environmental
Impacts
5.1 Pollution Control
5.1.1 Ship Waste Control
(1) For Scenario 3, treatment of oil wastewater and oil leakage would need an investment of
RMB30 X 10.
(2) Treatment of ship sewage would cost RMB243.29 X 104.
(3) Disposal of ship garbage would need invest RMB 1046.40 X I04.
(4) The total investment for ship waste control would be RMBI,319.69 X  104.This
investment will be made by harbor superintendence and is not part of project estimate costs.
5.1.2 Noise control
Supposed that half of the ships navigating on Liansharong waterway and the construction
ships do not have noise abatement facilities and each noise abatement facility costs RMB5,000, a
total investment of RMB26,160 X 104 would need for ship noise control. This investment will be
made by shipping companies and is not part of project estimate costs.
5.2 Shoreline Protection
5.2.1 Levees and Bank Protection Engineering
Because the waterway regulation project would change the flow pattern, some river sections
would need bank protection engineerings, dykes or erosion protection. Total investment is about
RMB 1763.04 X 104, included within "engineering" category of project investment.
5.2.2 Reforestation along Shorelines
Total length of reforestation would be 20 km and Supposed that RMB 20,000 would need
for each kilometer of greening belt, totally RMB 400 X 104 would be required. This investment
will be made by local governments and is not part of project estimate costs.
5.3 Compensation for fishing loss
This part of investment will be decided by agreement on GPWB and GPSAPD (Guangdong
Provincial Sea and Aquatic Products Department) altogether.



5.4 Compensation for Land Requisition
A total of RMB 2434.9 X I04 is needed for land requisition, included within "engineering"
category of project investment.
5.5 Personnel Training
5.5.1 Domestic Training
There will be 20 persons to receive domestic training (10 persons trained half a month, and
10 persons trained a month) and the training fee be RMB 2,000 per person, a total of RMB 4 X
104 would need.
5.5.2 Overseas Training
There will be 5 persons x 15 days for overseas training and the cost would be US$ 8,500
per person a month, a total of US$ 2.125 X 104 would need (corresponding to RMB 17.574 X
