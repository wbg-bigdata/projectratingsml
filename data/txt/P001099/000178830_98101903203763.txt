SECOND OIL PALM AND COCONUT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This is an appraisal report on a project which constitutes a sec-
ond stage of development of palm oil and coconut production in Ivory Coast.
The project includes the (a) further developmient of oil-palm outgrower small-
holdings; and coconut estates and outgrower smallholdings; (b) provision
of the necessary infrastructure; and (c) construction of a palm oil mill.
The project also would include the provision of credit to outgrowers. The
first stage is proceeding on schedule and is being carried out efficiently.
ii.       Oil palm and coconut products are two of the main agricultural
components of the Government's crop diversification program. The country
is well suited to compete with these products in the world market under
present and expected future conditions.
iii.      The project would be carried out by SODEPALM, a company fully
owned by the Government and by PALMIVOIRE, a privately controlled manaRe-
ment firm which would construct and manage theTiWrn.wch_would be owned
by PALMINDUSTRIE, a private limited company with a government iiajority
shareholding  These three organizationis are interrelated, ar-  a   worked
closely together in the past on similar projectE with good results.
iv.       Tie project would be carried out during thle 1971-fi6 p-2riod and its
costs are estimated to be llS$17.6 million:  US$1./ million 'or oil palms;
US$11.1 million for coconuts; and US$4.8 million for the oil mill. The
Bank would make two loans totalliing US$7 million: one to SODEPALI4 (US$5.1
million) for the oil palm outgrower's program (US$017 niillion), anc for the
coconut program (US$4.4 million) and the other to PALMIND)USTRTIE (US$1.9 mil-
lion) for the Dabou oil mill. The Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE), through the Banque Nationale de Development Agricole (BNDA), would
also make two loans for the same amounts. The Government would allocate
US$2.6 million equivalent and the balance of US$1 million woulu be financed
out of self-generated funds. Most of farmers' contribution would be in the
form of labor and self-provided tools. The Bank's coatribution represents
40% of total Project costs from; 1971 through 1976 andi would repiescitt 60% of
foreign exchange costs. Iterms financed by the Bank would be procured under
international and local competitive bidding.
v.        Oil palm outgrowers would enter into contracts wich SODEPALM, under
which they                        and loans fjrom SODEPALM in return  qr supply-
ing their production to SODEPALM at a, fixed prigg_whicTh In effect would ven-
sure a return to SODEPALM and Government of at least 7% owl their investments
in Efiz-offtl4rd     ram     oans to coconut ougrowers would be orthiodox
credit operations and would bear 7-1/i,  interest.
vi.       The returns to the economy from the proposed Project's investments
are estimated to be as follows: oil palm outgrowers, 17%; coconut estates,
18%; coconut outgrowers, 16%; and oil mill, 17%.



- i:i -
vii.      The whole incremental production generated by the Project would
be exported, increasing Ivory Coast's annual net foreign exchange earnings
by about US$5.6 M by 1980.
viii.     At peak production, the annual incremental income net of debt ser-
vice from the average 4 ha individual oil palm outgrower's holding would be
about US$360, and from the 4.5 ha coconut outgrower's holding US$250 equiva-
lent.
ix.       The Project is suitable for two Bank loans totalling US$7 million.
The loan to SODEPALM would be disbursed during the period 1971-76 and repaid
over 15 years from 1977. The loan to PALMINDUSTRIE would be disbursed during
the period 1971-74 and repaid over 15 years from 1975. Both loans would bear
interest at 7-1/4%. Interests would not be capitalized during the disburse-
ment periods.

SECOND OIL PALM AND COCONUT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.0l      The Government of the Ivory Coast has asked the Bank to finance part
of the costs of consolidating and expanding its ongoing oil palm and coconut
development programs. The objective of these programs is to further diver-
sify agricultural production in forest areas, and to increase farmers' in-
comes and the country's foreign exchange earnings.
1.02      The prolect, for which financing is sought. includes for SODEPALM
the planting of 4,500 ha of outorower oil palms, the planting of hybrid
Coconut_ on government-owneF  te ..                  and o-n out g_ 4 _  hi_ g
--4,500 ha; and for PALMINDUSTRIE the construct           a palm oil mill w
the capacity to process the produce of some 13,Q00 ha of oil palms.
1.03      The project was prepared by the association of companies (SODEPALM,
PALIfINDTUSTRIE and PALMIVOIRE -- commonly called the Participation) which
have responsibility for carrying out the Government oil palm and coconut
programs. The Bank's Permanent Mission to West Africa (PMWA) provided as-
sistance in preparation. This report is based on the findings of a Bank
mission which visited the Ivory Coast in November/December 1970, and whose
members were Messrs. Losson, Huas and Palein.
1.04      The Bank has made four loans for agricultural development in the
Ivory Coast: three totaling US$17.1 M in 1969 for oil palm and coconut
development and a loan of US$7.5 million in 1970 for smallholder cocoa
production. The progress of these projects has been satisfactory. Disburse-
ments for the three first loans have been much slower than estimated due to
the very favorable cash flow resulting from the high prices obtained re-
cently for palm oil and kernels and also because SODEPALM and PALMINDUSTRIE
have been able to obtain short term funds at low interest rates. The Bank
has been notified that disbursements will increase during the next months
(Annex 1).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Population is estimated at about 5.0 M and to be growing at about
3-3.5% annually (including 1% growth from immigration). More than 80% of
the working population is directly engaged in rural pursuits; in addition,
close to 500,000 foreign workers, mainly from Upper Volta, are employed in
agriculture.



- 2 -
2.02      The Ivory Coast has a land area of about 322,000 km  broadly di-
vided into two ecological zones. Bordering the Atlantic Ocean in the south,
the tropical rain forest zone stretches about 200 km inland. To the north,
the forest gradually diminishes, and is replaced by savannah.
2.03      Gross domestic product amounted to CFAF 405 billion (US$1.5
billion) and exports to CFAF 144 billion (US$0.5 billion) in 1970. Agricul-
ture, forestry and fishing accounted for 28% of GDP at market prices and
for 92% of exports in that year. The agricultural sector is one of the
most dynamic in Africa. The Ivory Coast is the world's third largest
producer of coffee and the fourth largest producer of cocoa. Bananas and
fresh and canned pineapples are also produced and exported in large quantities.
2.04      Agricultural policy objectives of the Government are:  to become
self-sufficient in foodstuffs excelpt for livestock products; to expand the
production of traditional export crops; and to seek diversification opportuni-
ties, especially into such products as oil palms, coconuts, cotton, fish,
lLd rubber.  The production of the first three has already been expanded
greatly. Government has recently embarked on a program for expanding cocoa
producticn, and is considering prolposals to establish two large rubber
development schemes.
B. Institutional Structure
2.05      Responsibility for crop lproduction, forestry and fresh water fish-
eries is held by the Ministry of Agriculture. Development planning is in
the hands of the Planning Ministry, while detailed agricultural development
programming is the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture. Execu-
tion of these programs is entrusted to a number of agencies, some of which
are state companies, e.g. Societe d'Assistance Technique pour la Modernisa-
tion Agricole de la Cote d'Ivoire (SATMACI) for coffee, cocoa and livestock
development; Societe pour le Developpement et l'Exploitation du Palmier a
Iluile (SODEPAIM)) and its associated companies for oil palm and coconut
development. Others are foreign companies under contract to the Govern-
ment, such as Compagnie Francaise de Developpement des Textiles (CFDT) for
cotton development.
2.06      Three principal entities are involved in the proposed Project:
SODEPALM, PALMINDUSTRIE and PALMIVOIRE. SODEPALM was founded in 1963 to
manage and participate fully in thie development of the oil palm, and of the
coconut industries. It is wholly owned by Government. It owns, and develops,
oil palm and coconut estates in thie country, and is also responsible for
providing services to all oil palm and coconut outgrowers.  It is an effi-
cient organization. PALMINDUSTRIE is owned 73% by Government and 27% by
private interests, and owns the palm oil mills and ancillary installations.
PALMIVOIRE is owned 40% by Government and 60% by the same private interests
w:ho take a minorit  ownership in PALMINDUSTRIE. PALMIVOIRE operates only
the SODEPALM oil palm estates (not the sma lholdings) -- supplying all staff



- 3 -
above estate manager level -- and the PALMINDUSTRIE mills, for which it
supplies all staff.  Its operating standards and performance are very good.
The three companies are linked together in an Association in Participation
(the Participation), a form of joint venture (Annex 2). The Participation's
profits or losses are divided proportionately among the three companies on
the basis of their relative financial contributions. PALMIVOIRE is remune-
rated for its management services on a sliding scale formula based on the
financial results of the Participation's activities. During the first five
years of development, when no profits are expected, it will receive a fixed
fee of CFAF 30 M per annum.
2.07      Agricultural research is undertaken by various French organiza-
tions under a technical assistance agreement with France, and research costs
are shared equally by the two Governments. Oil palm and coconut research is
undertaken by the Institut de Recherches pour les Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO).
These organizations concentrate on applied research of a high standard.
C. The Oil Palm and Coconut Sectors
Oil Palms
2.08      Oil palms grow wild in the forest regions, and until very
recently satisfied the country's palm oil requirements, and permitted the
export of about 12,000 tons of palm kernels annually. In the 1960's it was
estimated that the production of wild palms was about 330,000 tons of fresh
fruit bunch (ffb) annually, of which about 75,000 tons were processed in
modern palm oil mills and the balance by traditional methods.
2.09      Government began in the 1950's to encourage the planting of
improved oil palms, bred by IRIO, to replace wild palms. With the develop-
ment of even higher-yielding varieties, a new program was introduced to
produce palm oil and kernels for export and SODEPALM was established in
1963 to carry it out with the financial help of Fonds Europeen de Develop-
ment (FED) Banque Europeenne d'Investissements (BEI), CCCE, and the Bank
(Loans IVC-611, 612 and 613). The current SODEPALM program will be completed
in 1972, at which time some 66,000 ha of oil palms will have been established:
39,000 ha (together with milling facilities) on SODEPALM-owned estates, and
27,000 ha on smallholdings in the vicinity of those estates (Annex 3). Close
to 9,000 ha of program palms are now in production; and as a consequence
the Ivory Coast has become a palm oil exporter 1/.
Coconuts
2.10      Coconuts are not indigenous to the Ivory Coast, but have been
grown along the coast by smallholders since the last century. Government
1/   About one-half of the 20,000 tons of oil which reached the market in
1970 were exported.



- 4 -
programs to stimulate coconut production started in 1967. About 27,000 ha
are under coconuts: of these, about 19,000 ha belong to smallholdings devel-
oped prior to 1967. Most of the remaining area has been developed by SODE-
PALM more recently, and comprises about 4,700 ha in SODEPALHI-owned estates,
and 2,600 ha in smallholdings (Annex 3).  The SODEPATIM coconut program has
been financed principally by the Bank (Loan IVC-613) and CCCr (Annex 1).
2.11      Coconut products ae not,e psrted at pr,tsent.  The internal trade
is in the  orm of copra (about 2,000 tons are milled annually), fresh
coconut oil extracted by traditional methods, and fresh nuts. An expansion
of coconut plantings will require the export of coconut products 1/.  Export
market prospects are satisfactory (Chapter VI).
2.12      IRIIO has developed hybrid varieties of coconut which are not only
high-yielding (para 6.03), but which bear fruits in the third or fourth year
(instead of in the seventh or eighth year) after planting.  As such, coconut
cultivation is a profitable undertaking, and particularly attractive on the
s.ardy coastal soils which are unsuitable for the commercial production of
most other crops.
Financing the Overall Oil Palm and Coconut Programs
2.13      Detailed financial statements of the First Oil Palm and Coconut
Project, together with the summarized financial position of SODEPALM, PALM-
ITDUSTRIE and the Participation, as well as the consolidated annual cash
surpluses and deficits for the First and Second Oil Palm and Coconut Projects
are in Annex 2 and are summarized as follows:
SODEPALM4
2.14      Except for a small cash deficit of CFAF 88 million (US$0.3 million)
in 1971 the estimated overall SODEPALM cash flow, before corporation taxes
and distribution of dividends, would be in surplus as from 1972. Cumulative
deficits on the coconut programs in the first and second projects would rise
to CFAF 1.6 billion (US$5.8 million) during the period 1975 through 1979,
but would be adequately covered by surpluses arising from oil palm estate
operations.
PALMINDUSTRIE
2.15      Despite estimated annual cash deficits of up to CFAF 200 million
(US$0.7 million) in 1972, 1973 andl 1975 the cumulative cash position of
1/   Copra contains about 64% coconut oil and is prepared by drying the meat
of the coconut. The meat is extracted after dehusking and splitting
the nut. There is an increasing trend among producing countries to
mill copra domestically and to export coconut oil and coconut expeller
cake (a livestock feed). It is believed that the Ivory Coast would
follow this pattern.



PALMINDUSTRIE remains positive throughout due to the cumulative surplus
accrued up to 1971. Subject to corporation tax and distribution of dividends,
estimated annual cash surpluses would rise to an average of CFAF 470 million
(US$1.7 million) from 1977 onwards.
Oil Palm Outgrowers
2.16      The annual cash deficit of the two oil palm outgrowers' projects
would reach a maximum of CFAF 280 million (US$1 million) in 1978 but small
annual surpluses would arise from 1982 onwards.  Annual cash deficits to
1981 would be met by the Fonds d'Extension et de Renouvellement pour le
Development de la Culture du Palmier a huile (FER), subject to commitments for
labor housing under the FED-financed programs. This special fund, FER, was
created by act of Parliament in June 1969 to renovate and develop oil palms
in Ivory Coast. SODEPALM refunds to this fund the cost of its estates
established with FED grants and BSTE funds and also the cost of outgrowers?
plantations financed with FED and BSIE Funds. FER uses its funds to
establish modern houses and villages for Estate workers under a program
which has been approved by FED and to assist in financing the outgrowers
development of oil palms. The PER cash flow (Annex 15) shows that Govern-
ment funds totalling CFAF 1.3 billion (US$4.7 million) would have 'to be
provided from 1971 through 1973 but this would be fully recovered by 1979.
If FER funds are insufficient to meet oil palm outgroxwers' cumulative
deficits of CFAF 533 million (US$1.9 million) during the period 1971 througl
1974, Government funds would have to be provided pending recovery from FER
from 1975 onwards.
III. TIE PROJECT
A. General
3.01      The project comprises:
(a)  planting 4,5son ha of oil palms_by out9 rowers in existing
development areas with the help of SODEPALM's technical                -
and supervised credit servie.  The total area of oil
palmout~growers would increase from 22,800 ha to 27,300 ha;
(b)  planting 8,000 ha of coconut's on two existing, and on two         C
new SODEPAL- es-sttats, increasing their total area from
4,890 ha to 12,890 ha;
(c) planting 4,500 ha of coconuts by outgrowers in the vicinity
of SODEPAI,11 estates with the hele  p12XiQEl'M's techn_ical,
and supervised credit services.  The total area of coconut         J-
outgrowers would increase from 3,024 ha to 7,524 ha;



(d)  providing roads, other iTfrastr        e, and pKrocessing
facilijti.es for the above outgrowers, as well as for those
bein%g financed tinder Loan 613-IVC; and
(e)  desi&iniE, const A_Un:g.nd commiss Juio       a p almoil mill
(the Dahou oil mill) to be owned by PAIMTNDIISTRIE, to
process the production of some 10,000 ha of SODEPALM's
estate and associated outgrowers' oil palms, the production
of 3,600 ha of IPJIO-owned estate oil palms; and of wild
oil palm ffb offered for sale in the mill's service area,
as well as providing transport facilities for the mill's
activities.
The project would be carried out from 1971 through 1982. The proposed Bank
loans, however, would be disbursed in the years 1971 through 1976, when most
of the total project expenditures would be incurred.  The development costs
during the period 1977 to 1982 would be met by self-generated funds and
Government subsidies. SODEPALM would be responsible for the oil palm and
coconut planting programs, and PALNIVOIRE on behalf of PALMINDUSTRIE for
the mill program.
Ecological Conditions in the Project Areas
3.02      The project area extends along the coast up to some 60 kms
inland from Brediberi 250 kms West of Abidjan to the border with Ghana,
120 kms East of Abidjan. Vegetation varies from light to dense underbrush.
The land is flat. Soils of the coconut areas are sandy, homogeneous and
well-drained, althouvh they lack nutrients.  Soils of the oil palm areas
are heavier, but well-drained and slightly richer in nutrients. Ecological
conditions for coconut production are very good. Those for oil palm
production are good by African standards, but not capable of producing the
yields of Southeast Asia which are 30 to 40% higher. Temperatures vary from
22 C to 310C. Rainfall averages 1,800 mm per annum, humidity is high, and
sunshine is adequate.
B. Oil Palm Outgrowers
Planting Program and Location of Plantings
3.03      Annex 4 Table 1 gives a schedule of proposed project plantings.
Plantings would be made in 11 locations where either the average size of
outgrowers' holdings needs to be increased and/or where additional plantings
are nee0ded to redtuce ffb collection costs ('tap 1) . Five-hundred ha would be
1l.itate (In ii172, and 2,000 ha each in 1973 and 1974.  The relationship be-
fwotni th. proposed plantings and those made under previous programs is given
hi A\inte  4, Table 2.  Some 900 new families would benefit from the project.



-7-
Land
3.04      Plantings would be made on land for whichl thie farmer alrecddy has
right of usufruct.
Communications, lnfrastructurc and Equipment
3.05      All plantings would be made close to existing roads, and as close
aas possible to the mills, and would be supervised by existing SODEPALM staff
w w |who are generally housed and equipped adequately for this purpose. Con-
I? s[sequeny_ apartfrom some minor costs for staff transportation which are ac-
/    jcounted for in project calculations, expenditures on new infrastructure and
equipment would be insignificant.
Development and Maintenance
3.06      Oil palm holdings, unlike coconut holdings, would be cleared by
their owners (due to their scattered location and the existence of light
underbrush in their areas), whlo would subsequently plant and maintain
oil palm seedlings provided from SODEPALM nurseries. Seedlings, cover
crop seed, fertilizer and cash for hiring labor would be supplied to the
outgrower by SODEPALM (para 5.09), and SODEPALM would supervise all opera-
tions. Development and maintenance methods used would be the same as those
used in the past, which have proved satisfactory.
3.07      Labor would be supplied by both the farm family and hired workers.
Some 19,000 ha of outgrowers' oil palm plantings have been made; shortages
of land and labor have not been constraints and are not expected to become
so.
C. Coconuts
Planting Program
3.08      Estates and Outgrowers.  Planting of the new hybrid variety
(Annex 5) would be carried out on the existing Assinie and Grand Lahou estates
(establishedl with Bank assistance under Loan IVC-613) and on two new estates:
Boulay and Fresco. Outgrower plantings, on the other hand, would be made
in the vicinity of these four estates, and the Alladian area between Addah
and Jaqueville (Annex 5, Table 1). Plantings would be made as follows:

Land
Estates
3.09      The land to be occ,upte4by SODEPALM is owned by the Statp, When
coconut plant  is  ,comp let_ed..SODBPAlM willI be granted full ownership of the
are>,. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
Outgrowers
3.10      Outgrower plantings would be made on blocks, comprising about 1,125
fxm   wzh4ae1lop  4.ha af..co4iconu'ts eac,h . Most of the land would be
provided by the.,State and the balance by communities with usufruct rights.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that each outgrower will have
a personal usufruct on his planting when it is completed. The individual
usufruct right lapses at the beneficiary's death but may be transferred to
one of his heirs.
Transport and Communications
3.11      The first three estate sites are located on the lagoon/canal sys-
tem which runs along the Atlantic seaboard, and which provides cheap trans-
port to Abidjan. Assinie is some 1O0 km east of Abidjan, to which it is
connected also by road. Boulay is aLn island lying to the immediate west of
Abidjan, with which it has a road and ferry link. Grand Lahou, also an is-
land, lies some 150 km west of Abidjan and has road and ferry links with the
capital. Fresco, some 200 km west of Abidjan is relatively isolated, but is
linked by about 35 km of road to Port Gauthier on the lagoon system (Map 2).
Transport to Abidjan from this site is by truck and by barge. Outgrower
plantings in the Alladian area would. be adjacent to the Ebrie lagoon and
2njoy good water transport facilities.  Under the project radio equipment
would be installed to bring all estates within the SODEPALM radio network.



-9-
Infrastructure and Equipment
Estates
3.12      Assinie and Grand Lahou were established in 1968 and at the end of
1970 had 1,220 ha and l,006 ha of coconuts respectively. These two estates
have substantial basic infrastructure, such as roads, management and labor
housing, stores, and water supplies, as well as standard estate equipment,
such as vehicles, tractors and trailers, generators, and office equipment.
The project would entail the expansion of estate infrastructure, and the pur-
chase Of additional egui.pment for these two estates, as well as the,oiton
of infrastructure and equipment in line with the plantings scheduled for
Boulay and Fresco.
Outgrowers
3.13      About 225 km of tracks and access roads and a wharf would be con-
_  x   _ ~ ,...,,  _  ,.... ..          ks     w . th   .t  's ..
structed to link all existing anoe prop.i d outgri6wef blocks wIth the estates,
Ehfi;hnational road network, and the lagoon system.  Some houses would be
built to house the junior SODEPALM staff needed to supervise outgrowers.
Tractors and trailers, and a few trucks, light personnel vehicles and motor-
cycles would be purchased to provide adequate facilities for the transport of
materials and personnel.
Development and Maintenance
Estates
3.14      The land would be cleared mechanically, and trees and debris wind-
rowed and burned completely, complete burning is necessary to prevent the
buildup of beetle populations capable of seriously damaging the youmng palms.
SODEPAIM would carry out the bulk of land clearing by force account. IIybrid
seed nuts would be produced at IRIIO seed gardens and would be germinated at
the IRHO station, which would make a first selection of the plant material.
6  3.15      The estate areas.. are-thinlyy populated, and as in the case of most
<S   -\estate development in Ivory Coast, labor would be recruited from among
t[Voltaics, of whom a steady stream is eni`grating to the Ivory Coast's
! coastal zone.  Generally, male workers arrive without fam'lies, 'ie-riiiing
after'''a yea'r or so to fetch their families or to marry.  Consequently, a
new estate generally experiences a high labor turAnQvr_ in its initial years.
After this initial period, and as workers return with their families, the    -
situation stabilizes.  Labor problems are not anticipated, since SODEPALM
has substantial experience in labor recruitment, and its operations have
never been affected seriously, or for a sustained period, due to labor
shortages.
3.16      Funds would be provided under the project for the maintenance
of all project plantings until the end of 1976. By that time plantings
made in 1972 would be in their first year of production. The maintenance
requirements of the crop are small; principal components are maintenance of
the cover crop; and fertilizer and pesticide applicaLtion. Fertilizer would
he applied annually in accordance with IRUO recommendations.



- 10 -
Outgrowers
3.17      Land clearing would be carried out mechanically by SODEPALHI on a
block basis, and outgrowers would then establish and maintain their holdings
under SODEPALM direction using the same planting material, inputs and tech-
niques used on the estates. Planting material and inputs, and some cash,
would be supplied under the credit arrangements de.scribed in paragrap'^ 713.
3.18      Outgrowers would plant their 4 ha holding in one year and would
need to supply about 124 man days for ths purpose.~ ereater, tIe require-
ment w-oul& Td eiEii Gasuai labor is obtainable locally: both from resident
and from itinerant Voltaic workers.  No problems have arisen in obtaining
sufficient labor under the ongoing program and none are foreseen in the fu-
ture.
Processing
3.19      The bulk of processing facilities required for project plantings
would not be neecled during the disbursement period of the Bank loan, although
the cost of all facilities needed is included in financial and economic
calculations. Tentative plans have been prepared by consultants 1/ under
IRIIO guidance for a central, continuous-flow processing plant capable of
handlinp, undehuslced nuts and producing coconut oil and expeller cake. This
plant could be in operation by 1975. In the interim period, about 100
small copra-drying units will be needed and provision is made for this under
the Project.
D. Dabou Oil M4ill
General
3.20      The proposed Dabou mill (Annex 6) would process the ffb production
of the Dabou zone (Map 3). Construction has started and the mill will be
commissioned in early 1973. Plantings in the zone now comprise 3,500 ha of
SODEPALMI estates 2/, 4,800 ha of outgrower palms (scheduled to increase to
6,300 ha by 1974), and 3,600 ha of palms on IRIIO's Robert Michaux estate.
In addition, about 10,000 tons of ffb from wild palms is supplied by the
zone's growers annually for processing.  Tle zone's total processing
requirements are expected by the mission to increase from 94,000 tons of ffb
in 1971 to 141,000 tons in 1982. 3/  Existing proccssinz facilities
1/   These consultants are:  Societe d'Etudes Techniques et d'Enterprises
(enerales (SODETEG) for the technological studies and Societe d'Etudes
et- dc Development Tconomique et Social (SEDES) for the marketing studies.
?/   Including 1,950 lha of new Government-owned estate palms whiclh are being
transferred to SODEPAII.
3/   SODEPALM's own forecast is 149,000 tons.



- 11 -
are the state-owned Acobo-D:k abnmill-managed by -la Societe Fermiere des
Huileries de Palmes (CFHP), and a mill on IRHO's estate.  The'CFHP-managed  
-millE,c-otimm 6isi'nd7 in i950, has an effective annual capacity of 40,000 tons
of ffb, is inadequate for the zone's needs, has high labor requirements, and
needs substantial investments to improve extraction rates and to ensure high
oil quality.  The IRHO mill is old, too small, and uneconomic to operate.
3.21      An assurance was obtained from Government that the CFHP-managed
mill would b16-TI'sed d6wn once'''the new _1i1 was commissionedd sucessfuiy.
IRHO has stated that it will scrap the Robert Michaux station's mill once
the new mili is commissioned.  A Government decree and signature of an agree-
ment satisfactory to the Bank between IRHO and PALMINDUSTRIE-PALMIVOIRE, res-
pectively, providing for the processing of all their estate ffb by the new
mill would be a condition of signing the proposed loan to PALMINDUSTRIE (see
para 4.04). The alternatives of improving and expanding the above mills and
of transporting ffb from the Project area to other PALMINDUSTRIE mills (Annex
6, page 2) have been considered and rejected.
Location and Communications
3.22      The mill would be located about 50 km west of Abidjan on the
Abidjan-Bouake main road, and about 10 km northwest of Dabou (Map 3). The
Abidjan-Bouake road is tarred and well maintained. Other roads in the Dabou
zone are gravel-surfaced and generally well maintained. The mill would be
sited near the crossroads Sikensi-Dabou/Grand Lahou-Yassap and would be
within a maximum of 20 km from the plantings that it would serve. Oil and
kernels would be evacuated to Abidjan. The proposed mill site is satisfac-
tory both from location and engineering standpoints and detailed investigations
confirm good underground water supplies.
3.23      The location of a mill of this size close to a main road would
cause major traffic problems unless special precautions were taken (Annex 6,
Chart). It is proposed that a cloverleaf type intersection be constructed
to avoid traffic bottlenecks at the mill site. Costs are estimated at
CFAF 25 M and are included in project costs.
Technical Features
3.24      The mill would have an hourly capacity of 40 tons of ffb.  It
would be designed to allow the later installation of a third line to bring
capacity to 60 tons/hr if ffb production in the mill's area so warranted.
3.25      Ancillary equipment and infrastructure would include:  oil storage
tanks adequate to hold 1,600 m3 or half a month's average oil production;
a small stock of spare parts; houses for senior mill staff, accommodation
for artisans and laborers; a workshop and store, and an office/laboratory.
Vehicles would include a few automobiles, tractors and trailers, and a light
truck. The mill would be connected by radio with the PALMIVOIRE network.
Electricity would be supplied by two turbo alternators.



- 12 -
3.26      The mill would be designed by PALMIVOIRE, whlich also would under-
take its construction. The company's engineering section is well staffed
and has been responsible for similar work on PALMINIDUSTRIE's existing mills.
FFB Collection and Palm Product Evacuation Vehicles
3.27      The project would include the purchase of vehicles from 1972
through 1974 for the collection of ffh from the outgrowers and from estates
which the mill would serve, as well as for the transport of oil and of ker-
nels to Abidjan. Five-ton capacity dump trucks would be purchased for the
collection of ffb and 20-ton capacity oil tankers for the evacuation of oil
to Abidjan. No replacement vehicles would be needed until after 1974.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
A.  Cost Estimates
4.01      Project costs during the six-year period 1971 through 1976 (see
para 3.01) are estimated at CFAF 4.9 billion (US$17.6 million), of which the
foreign exchange component is about CFAF 3.3 billion (US$11.8 million) or
67%. Detailed cost estimates are in Annex 7, and are summarized in the fol-

4.02      As agreed by Government, all imports will be free of import
tduties during the development  deriod.  Estimates are based on curreint SODE-
PALM, PALMINDUSTRIE and PALMIVOIRE experience in field and palm oil mill
operations and contain the following contingencies:
(a)  physical contingencies totalling about 5% of project cost
are included for oil palm outgrowers, coconut estates and
outgrowers, kilns and roads and 3% of project cost for the
Dabou oil mill. These are considered adequate in view of
the experience obtained from the first project; and
(b)  overall price contingencifes totalling about 5% of project
cost are also included for oil palm outgrowers coconut
estates and outgrowers, kilns and roads and 5% of project
costs for the Dabou oil mill. These would primarily
cover possible increases in the cost of imported items and
labor cost.
B. Proposed Financing
4.03      It is proposed to make two Bank loans totalling US$7.0 million.
The loans would cover 40% of total project costs of US$17.6 million and
about 60% of the estimated foreign exchange cost of US$11.8 million.



- 15 -
4.04       As in the case of the First Oil Palm and Coconut project, separate
loans would be made to SODEPALM and to PALMINDUSTRIE as follows:
(i)  US$5.1 million to SODEPALM to finance 4,500 ha of outgrowers
oil palms, 8,000 ha of estate coconuts, 4,500 ha of out-
growers coconuts, and infrastructure and coconut processing
facilities for both these and existing coconut outgrowers;
and
(ii)  US$1.9 million to PALMINDUSTRIE to finance the Dabou mill.
4.05       The loan to SODEPALM would be disbursed during the six-year period
1971-76 and would be repaid over the 15 years 1977-1991. The loan to PALM-
INDUSTRIE would be disbursed over the four years 1971-74 and would be repaid
over the 15 years 1975-1989.
4.06       CCCE through the BNDA would lend identical amounts to PALMINDUSTRIE
and to SODEPALM, which would be disbursed over the same period as the IBRD
loans. The CCCE loans would bear interest at 6% and would be repaid over
the same periods as the Bank loans.
4.07       Part of the remaining project costs would be met from the Budget
Special d'Investissement (BSIE), a Government budgetary fund, in the form
of grants to SODEPALM, and part by PALMINDUSTRIE's self-generated funds.
The overall financing plan is summarized in the following table:

C. Procurement
4.08       International competitive bidding would be used to procure goods
and services estimated to cost US$3.5 million: fertilizer and insecticides,
US$0.8 million; vehicles and equipment, US$0.4 million; and kilns, US$0.4
million. However, the procurement of mill machinery and plant for US$1.9
million would be restricted, to two firms. PALMINDUSTRIE owns eight palm
oil mills in the Ivory Coast, all of which are equipped either with
Speichm (France) or de Wecker (Luxembourg) mill equipment. PALMIVOIRE wishes
to purchase similar equipment for the project mill, and in the interest of
standardization the Bank has agreed that tenders should be limited to these
two companies. Light vehicles estimated to cost US$0.5 million would be



- 16 -
obtained under CCCE procurement procedures. High-yielding coconut and palm
oil seeds estimated to cost US$1 million would be supplied by IRHO. Land
clearing estimated to cost US$5.2 million would be carried out by force
account with the help of government equipment following the excessively high
tenders received from international bidders. The cost per hectare financed
under the Project would not exceed CFAF 105.000 (US$380). Palmivoire would
(a) supply the staff and labor estitnated to cost US$2.2 million; (b) develop
the nurseries, estimated to cost US$0.9 million; (c) build the access roads,
estimated to cost US$0.6 million; (d) transport the ffb, nuts, fertilizers,
labor and finished products, and upkeep buildings at a cost of US$1.4 million;
(e) build labor and staff houses; and (f) build the mill (but the steel
structure, cement and other materials would be obtained through local
competitive bidding). The total cost of items under (f) are estimated to
be US$2.3 million.
D. Disbursement
4.09      Disbursements of the Bank loans would be against 100% of the cif
cost of the vehicles (US$0.2 million) imported fertilizers and insecticides
(US$0.6 million); kilns and oil mill machinery and equipment (US$1.8 million)
as certified by shipping documents. These would also cover 50% of the cost
of oil palm and coconut seedlings (US$0.8 million), 35% of the cost of land
clearing (US$1.7 million) as certified by approved completion certificates
and about 70% of the cost of specific project expenditures and totalling
US$1.9 million as detailed in Annex 8. Any surplus loan funds remaining
after completion of the project would be cancelled.
E. Accounts and Audit
4.10      SODEPALM, with PALMIVOIRE assistance, would maintain accounts for
the oil palm outgrower, coconut estate and coconut outgrower components of
the project. PALMIVOIRE would maintain accounts for the Dabou mill as part
of its accounting responsibility for the Participation. Present accounting
procedures are satisfactory. SODEPAILM and Participation accounts are audited
by both the Government's Audit Department, and by a private firm -- Societe
Fiduciaire France-Afrique. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
a firm satisfactory to the Bank would be employed to audit the Participation,
SODEPALM and PALMINDUSTRIE accounts; and that such audited accounts would be
made available to the Bank within four months of the close of each financial
year.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
5.01      While present organizational arrangements (Annex 2) work well, fur-
ther expansion would require decentralization of management. So far, over-
centralization has not been a problem because of: the personal capability of
the common General Manager of SODEPALM and PALMIVOIRE and of his key assis-
tants; excellent radio communications with all stations; and the use of very
detailed operational directives. With extensive areas of oil palms and coco-
nuts coming into production, field management is entering a more complex phase
which will require timely decision-making by persons who fully understand the
local situation. In addition, the present system is heavily dependent on the
General Manager and on two or three key assistants who are seconded from
French institutions. The departure of the General Manager would probably be
accompanied by that of these key personnel, which would seriously endanger
the management of the enterprises. For these reasons assurances were obtained
during negotiations that SODEPALM and PALMIVOIRE would: (a) make proposals
satisfactory to the Bank to ensure the strength and continuity of manage-
ment. These would include decentralization to the extent necessary of the
day-to-day operations to the regional level; (b) SODEPALM and PALMIVOIRE
would submit these proposals and an implementation plan to the Bank not
later than December 31, 1972; and (c) implement these proposals, as agreed
by the Bank, before the closing date. On the other hand, while Ivori-
anization is taking place at management level (81 Ivorians in 1971 as opposed
to 30 in 1968), it is occurring at a faster pace at headquarters (most Ivori-
ans prefer Abidjan to field postings) than on the SODEPALM estates, but even
in Abidjan most technical positions are still filled by expatriates. Assur-
ances were received during negotiation of the previous loans that the Parti-
cipation would establish training policies and facilities for Ivorians in
keeping with staffing needs. These assurances have been fulfilled in part
only. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from SODEPALM and from
PALMIVOIRE that: (a) they would review, in consultation with the Bank, their
management training facilities and programs; and (b) that they would adopt
not later than January 1, 1972, and subsequently implement, a phased progim,
satisfactory to the Bank, for the management training and recruitment of na-
tionals of the Ivory Coast.
5.02      Loans IVC 611, 612 and 613 required that appointments to the key
posts of General Manager, Assistant General Manager and Chief Loan Officer of
SODEPALM, would be made only following agreement with the Bank; the same as-
surance witlh respect to these posts was obtained during negotiation of the
proposed new loan.
Oil Palm Outgrowers
5.03      As shown in the Chart to Annex 2, SODEPALM maintains a Division res-
ponsible for oil palm outgrowers. Within this Division and at field level
area chiefs appointed by SODEPALM supervise outgrower activity in nine princi-



- 18 -
pal areas, each covering a zone of about 20 km radius from a planned or ex-
isting mill. Below the area level, group chiefs appointed by SODEPALM super-
vise plantings made individually by farmers who are grouped for administrative
purposes. When group plantings come into production a SODEPALM employee is
appointed to coordinate and record the collection of ffb by the area's mill.
About half of project plantings would be made by farmers who have already
planted palms under the SODEPALM program. Because of this factor, and also
because about one-half of outgrower palms are now in production and require
less supervision, carrying out the project would require no significant in-
crease in headquarters or area field staff.  The very small increase in group
chiefs required is provided for in project costs. The performance of the
SODEPALM outgrower program has been generally satisfactory and no organiza-
tional or management problems are envisaged in carrying out this component
of the project.
Coconut Estates and Outgrowers
5.04      SODEPALM estates and outgrower schemes are managed by the SODEPALM
Coconut Division from headquarters in Abidjan.  Seven additional supervisory
staff would be required at the estate level as a consequence of the project:
five assistant managers, one estate assistant, and an administrative as-
sistant. SODEPALM has several Ivorians who could fill some of the new re-
quired posts.  The rest would be taken by expatriates.
5.05      Outgrower development is supervised by sector and group chiefs ap-
pointed by SODEPALM. Sector chiefs are responsible normally for 1,000 to
1,500 ha of outgrower coconuts or 2510 to 375 farmers; under them, group chiefs
supervise either 200 ha in the course of establishment or 400 ha of estab-
lished palms, and about 100 farmers. Sector chiefs report to the manager of
the SODEPALM estate with which his outgrower development is associated. In
this way the outgrower supervisory service receives the benefit of estate-
developed techniques. In the loan disbursement period, three sector chiefs
and 11 group chiefs would be required. SODEPALM operates a training scheme
for Ivorians wishing to fill technical posts, and difficulties are not fore-
seen in filling the additional supervisory positions that would be created by
the outgrower coconut scheme.
Dabou Oil Mill
5.06      Design, construction and subsequent operation of the mill would be
undertaken by PALMIVOIRE. Since its establishment in 1969, PALMIVOIRE is per-
formance in oil palm estate and palm oil mill management has been most satis-
factory. Construction of the new mill would not require any strengthening of
PAI24IVOIRE staff except for the employment of an additional mill manager.
Assurances were obtained in Loan IVC-613 that appointments to the posts of
PALMIVOIRE's General Manager, Technical Department Manager, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Engineer-oil mills would be made only after agreement with
the Bank and under terms satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations of
Lhe proposed new palm oil mill loan, the same assurance was obtained.



- 19 -
B. Outgrower Selection, Size of Holdings and Credit Arrangements
5.07      Participation in both outgrower schemes would be conditional
on the farmer's agreement to follow, throughout the development period of
his crop, the technical advice provided by SODEPALM. Such an obligation
forms part of the credit agreements that are signed between SODEPALM and
outgrowers. These agreements have been approved by the Bank.
Oil Palm Outgrowers
5.08      About 50% of project plantings would be made by farmers already par-
ticipating in the ongoing program. Personal selection criteria would be those
applicable to coconut outgrowers and to farmers already participating in the
ongoing program. Existing selection arrangements would apply. Under these,
the farmer's planting site must be within 200 m of a road passable by ffb col-
lection vehicles; and, for project plantings, the site must be located in a
zone where additional plantings are needed to increase the cost efficiency of
SODEPALM supervision and ffb collection services. SODEPALM has tightened up
selection, in particular as regards the favorable location and access of
planting sites. SODEPALM provides assistance for outgrowers to plant up to
10 ha of oil palms; the average size of holding is now 4 ha but tends to grow
each year.
5.09      Outgrowers would receive about CFAF 54,000/ha in credit from SODE-
PALM, repayable in 12 years after a seven-year grace period, at 2% interest,
which would be capitalized during the grace period. Outgrowers would contract
to sell all their produce to SODEPALM, which would deduct the principal and
interest payments due from the sales price. The difference between the fore-
casted export prices and the price paid to producers would accrue to SODEPALM
and not to the outgrowers, increasing the true interest charge to 9% on the
latter's development loans. Similar incentives have proved adequate in the
past and the outgrowers' repayment record is very good. This credit alloca-
tion represents about 54% of the total cost of establishing one hectare of
palms and would be made up as follows: seedlings, 50%; cash to assist in
maintenance, 22%; cash to assist in land clearing, 15%; and fertilizers, 11%.
The balance would be financed by Government and recovered through financi..1
surpluses expected from the sale of produce (Annex 9). During negotiations
assurances were obtained that: (a) the credit arrangements would not be
changed further without the prior consent of the Bank; (b) the producer price
would be maintained at levels consistent with a minimum financial return to
Government of 7% on its palm oil outgrower program investment.
Coconut Outgrowers
5.10      outgrowers would be selected from the village communities to which
usufruct of the land would be transferred (para 3.05). Holdings would be
limited to 4.5 ha per outgrower; compared with up to 25 ha under the ongoing
program financed by Loan 613-IVC in which hybrid planting material is not
used and consequently where net incomes/ha will be substantially lower.



- 20 -
5.11      The local SODEPALM agent inspects each applicant's farm, checks
his standing in the community and recommends approval or disapproval to
headquarters. Participation is dependent upon the potential outgrower be-
coming associated with a group of at least five individuals, who are either
existing or potential outgrowers. The group mutually guarantees the credits
obtained by its individual members.
5.12      Because of the precocity and yield potential of the hybrid coconuts
that would be planted under the project, changes to the coconut outgrowers'
agreement would be required. As such, the outgrower would repay SODEPALM's
production loan of about CFAF 254,000/ha over 19 years after six years of
grace at 7-1/2% interest instead of at 6% interest as previously (Annex 10).
The CFAF 254,000 is made up mainly as follows: land clearing, 50%; insecti-
cides and fertilizers, 12%; planting material, 11%. Other components include
cash to assist in maintenance, cover crop seeds and labor. An assurance was
obtained that no changes would be made without the consent of the Bank.
SODEPALM has tentatively fixed a producer price of CFAF 5/nut delivered to
roadside pickup points. Similar arrangements have provided adequate incen-
tives to farmers in the past.
5.13      The terms of financing for oil palm outgrowers are those practiced
in the past. The terms for coconut outgrowers represent a simplified arrange-
ment, and are based on the new, hybrid variety yield and growth potential.
C.  Processing Outgrowers Production
5.14      Oil Palms.  PALMININDUSTRIE would have sufficient capacity to
process all envisaged outgrower ffb production with its eight existing mills,
and the proposed Dabou mill. PALMINDUSTRIE would provide the transport
services needed to collect outgrower ffb.
5.15      Coconuts.  Outgrowers would sell their produce to SODEPALM in the
form of nuts delivered to roadside pickup points. They would be transported
to the nearest SODEPALM processing plant, where the nuts would be split, the
meat removed and dried into copra. While outgrowers could produce copra;
some form of communal processing would be necessary to justify the use of
modern copra driers, but such communal arrangements would be less efficient
than centralized SODEPALM operations.
D. Marketing
5.16      The production of palm oil and kernels from SODEPALM estates and
outgrowers areas would be marketed by PALMIVOIRE, both directly and through
contracts concluded with the Belgian commodity trading company SOGESCOL as
broker (Annex 11). These arrangements are in force and are satisfactory.



- 21 -
5.17      Copra would not be produced in quantity until 1976 and, as dis-
cussed in paragraph 6.06, no difficulties are foreseen in disposing of SODE-
PALM's production on world markets. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained, however, that marketing arrangements for coconut products would be
agreed with the Bank.
5.18      Under present legislation Government's Caisse de Stabilisation et
de Soutien des Prix des Productions Agricoles (SCCPPA) is empowered to main-
tain steady producer prices for all palm products. So far, CSSPPA has not
needed to support prices. On the contrary, high world prices for oil palm
products have resulted in its receiving a substantial inflow of funds
(CFAF 250 M in 1970) from SODEPALM. The Bank has agreed to CSSPPA interven-
tion in the case of oil palm products (Annex 11). Since no copra is exported
currently, CSSPPA's role in stabilizing prices of this commodity has yet to
be determined. Consequently, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the role of CSSPPA in stabilizing producer prices for coconut products
would be agreed with the Bank.
VI. YIELDS, OUTPUT, MARKETS AND PRICES, PARTICIPANTS' BENEFITS
A. Yields and Output
6.01      Oil palm outgrowers are estimated to obtain 10.5 tons ffb/ha
(21% oil and 5% kernel contents) when their oil palm plantings are mature,
nine years after planting. Actual results from existing oil palm outgrowers
confirm the validity of this estimate.
6.02      All oil palms planted under the project would be mature in 1982
and from that time project-induced production would average 9,900 tons of
oil and 2,360 tons of kernels annually, both less than 1% of the anticipated
world trade in these commodities in that year (Annex 12).
6.03      At full maturity (in the eighth year after planting) annual yields
of copra on SODEPALM estates are estimated to be 3.5 tons/ha, and on out-
growers' holdings 3.0 tons/ha. These yields are high by world standards (2
tons/ha on the twelfth year after planting) and are made possible by the suc-
cess of IRIO in producing a high yielding hybrid. The maintenance of high
yields will depend on sustained fertilizer use; this would be standard prac-
tice on SODEPALM estates, and among outgrowers.
6.04      All coconuts planted under the project would be mature in 1982,
and from that time project-induced output would average about 41,500 tons of
copra annually (which represents about 2% of the expected world trade by
that year), or 26,700 tons coconut oil equivalent (Annex 12).



- 22 -
B. Markets and Prices
6.05      Palm Oil and Kernels.  ALl palm oil and kernels 1/ produced by
project pla tg.woildbe exported,.since the large internal demanhdfor
i:Fese products can be more than met by existing supply. Total world pro-
duction of palm oil is estimated to be expanding at about 5.5% annually.
Production by 1980 is expected to reach about 2.7 M tons and exports 1.9 M
tons (of which the Iv_ry _5DLyouiU.h-ave-about 195 2  tons or 7%).  Demand
will grow more slowly. Therefore, the Bank's Economics Department expects
palm oi   iTes,,  settle at US$155--165/ton cif Europe in 1975_and in sub.se-
quent years.  A price of US$160/ton cif Europe, as assumed for the first
proeec6F, has been used for Project purposes (Annex 12).  This compares with
(a current price of about_US$270/ton.  The principal product of palm kernels
s palm kernel oil, which has similar chemical characteristics to coconut
oil; consequently, palm kernel prices are expected to drop from a current level
ot US$182/ton cif Europe to ,US$145 t,-by 1975, and the latter figure is used
in project calculations as compared to a price of US$136 estimated for the
jfiroj ect   The full production of kernels from the project, is expected
Lto have a negligible impact on prices for this commodity.
.06      Copra and Coconut Oil.  While a small amount of project-produced
copra would be cons,,med dom4estically, the bulk would be e xpofted, in'tly' to
rEurope, either as coconvtoil  or unprocessed copra.  Coconut oil and copra
(Intonsof oil equivalent) coprised a   t            l,ota.J, Drld fats and 'il
production in 1967-1969.  Production has expanded slowly (0.5% p.a. from
1954-1956 to 1967-1969, compared with 3.0% p.a. for all fats and oils pro-
duction). Generally, coconuts are a poorly organized smallholder crop with
a high proportion of over-aged trees and, so far, not the subject of devel-
opment programs, with the exception of the Philippines. The Bank's Economics
Department forecasts that by 1980 world exports of coconut products (oil
equivalent) will rise from a current 1.2 M tons to about 1.6-1.7 M tons,
principally from increased Philippine production. This expansion in exports
would not take place at past high prices, since import demand would not expand
significantly above present levels. Consequently, for the economic analysis
of the project, a copra pric,-aof US$lgs5-/ton-cif Europe has been used instead
ff_of US$165 for the first proiect.  The copra price of US$185/ton is equivalent
to US$285/ton coconut oil, which compares with an average price over the last
three years for this commodity of about US$400/ton (Annex 12).
C. Outgrower Benefits
Oil Palm Outgrowers
6.07      Production would begin in the fourth year after planting when 39
working days would be required to maintain and harvest one hectare of oil

and cakes after local processing.

increase and reach a maximum of CFAF 772 (US$2.80) wlhen debt service is
completed in year 19. While lower than that of coconuts, the return of
labor employed is satisfactory compared with the apricultura1 total com-
pensation rate of CFAF 310/day and with the return from coffee cultivati.on
(the otl ie  principai  crop In the oil palm zone) of about CFAF 300 (US$1.10)

tion the total annual income of a farming family after debt service payment
would amount to approximately CFAF 68,000 (US$250), and abotut CFAF 229,000

E. Government Benefits
6.12      The Government project cash flow (Annex 15) shows that the cumula-
tive deficit at the end of the BSIE grant disbursement period in 1976 would
be CFAF 351 million (US$1.3 million). Export duties would become effective
Ifrom 1974 which, together with value added and income tax revenues, wouid
eeliminate the cumulative   ficit,by 1980, and would provide an average annual
surplus of-CFAF 161 million (US$0.6 millio,J1 thereafter.  In addition, the
Government, as the sole shareholder in SODEPALM, would be entitled to receive
dividend payments from coconut program profits subject to the overall SODE-
PALM financia1 position.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      Primary benefits from the oil palm outgrowers and coconut program
components would be the increased production of oil palm and coconut products
and resultant net annual incremental foreign exchange earnings amounting to
about US$5.8 M by 1983. Based on expected world prices for these commodities
the returns to the economy from the project investments are estimated to be
as follows: oil palm outgrowers 17%, coconut estates 18%, and coconut out-
growers 16% (Annex 16).
7.02      In calculating the above, all labor used in coconut estates has
been costed at the average o,fficijl rate, CFAF-_31l6manday.  This amount in-
cludes fringpZbpa,e$fits, and an allowance for supervisors such as foremen.
For outgrowers, however, where the proportions of hired and family labor are
impoiss1Vl6_to-determine, a cost of CFAF lOiOmanday has been used for all labor
d4ueh-tefoe-iowtng:   (a) this is t'he subsistence gps   ,I.abt; (b)- casa-al
j9 .abnx employed on a daily basis when needed receives much lower-rates than on
- SODEPALM estates; and (c) most farm families have labor in excess of the needs
iC~fiitr ~firms.~ If all labor on"outgrowers plantings were costP_at_cash
ates paid on SODEPALM estates, the rate of return would be:  oil palm out-
growers 13% and coconut outgrowers 15%. Details of the calculation are given
at Annex 16, which includes an analysis of the sensitivity of the rates of
return to changes in costs and benefits, and in the case of the coconut com-
ponents, to varying lengths of project life. As shown below, all project com-
ponents are most-q-nsitive to change in the value of output/ha, the value of  A
output being influenced by both yields and prices.
Returns (%)
Output/ha                     90%    110%
Oil palm outgrowers                14.5   19.7
Coconut estates                    16.2   19.9
2;                  Coconut outgrowers                  14.6   18.0
'i,J  7.03     The mill would serve both oil palm outgrowers and oil palm estates.
The internal economic rate of return has been calculated to be 17% for the
new palm oil mill (Annex 6, Table 1).  The alternatives to construction of a



- 25 -
new mill are examined (Annex 6); the analysis shows that commissioning a new
mill in 1972 is slightly more expensive than the closest alternative, but
that the slight cost disadvantage is more than outweighed by considerations
of operational simplicity which are not easily quantifiable in financial
terms.
7.04      The project would have substantial secondary benefits through pro-
viding work for some 1,800 persons on the coconut estates and for about 100
persons in the mill and increasing the incomes of about 2,300 outgrower fami-
lies. Additionally, it would further the Government's program of agricultural
diversification.
VIII. RECOMIFNDATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reachesl on the following
pr'incipal points:
(a)  SODEPALM and PALMIVOIRE would:  (i) m.ake Proposals satisfac-
tory to the Bank on measures to ensure the strength and con-
tinuity of management. These measures would include decen-
tralization, to the extent necessary, of the day-to-day
operations to the regional level; (ii) submit their proposals
and an implementation plan to the Bank not later than December
31, 1972; and (iii) implement these proposals as agreed with
the Bank prior to the closing date (para 5.01);
(b)  SODEPALM and PALMIVOIRE would:  (i) review, in consultation
with the Bank, their management training facilities and pro-
grams; and (ii) would adopt not later than January 1, 1971,
and subsequently implement, a phased program, satisfactory
to the Bank, for the management training and recruitment of
nationals of the Ivory Coast (para 5.01);
(c) appointments to the key posts of General Manager, Assistant
General Manager and Chief Loan Officer of SODEPALM (para
5.02); and of General Manager, Technical Department Manager,
Chief Financial Officer, and Chief engineer-oil mills of
PALMIVOIRE (para 5.06) would be made only with Bank agree-
ment;
(d) credit arrangements for oil palm outgrowers would not be
changed without the prior consent of the Bank; the producer
price would be maintained at levels consistent with a mini-
mum financial return to Government of 7% on its oil palm out-
grower program investment (para 5.09); and
(e) credit arrangements for coconut outgrowers would not be
changed without the prior consent of the Bank (para 5.12).



- 26 -
8.02       A condition of signing the loan to PALMINDUSTRIE is that Government
would 'issue a decree, and IRHO would sign an agreement with PALMINDUSTRIE-
PALMIVOIRE to close their respective mills, and to process their ffb at thie
projected Dabou mill (para 3.21).
8.03       The project is suittblSe for two Bank loans:  one to SODEPALM for
US$5.1 million repayable over 15 yiears after six years of grace; and another
to PALMINDUSTRIE for US$1.9 miklidn repayable over 15 years after four years
of grace.  Grace periods would only apply to capital repayments.

A.   Loan 611 IVC PALMIVOIRE US$3.3 Million Equivalent
1.        Ehania Oil Palm estate plantings (4,000 ha) have been on schedule
(see Chart), and planting will be completed as planned in 1971. Planting
has been of a high standard, and subsequent plantation maintenance is
satisfactory. Planting costs have been slightly lower than estimated at
the time of appraisal.
B.   Loan 612 IVC PALMINDUSTRIE US$4.8 Million Equivalent
2.        The project comprised the construction of a palm oil mill to
service the 10,000 ha, Ehania Estate, and some associated outgrowers. The
first phase of mill construction was completed two months after the appraisal
report target date. Orders have been placed with de Wecker to expand the
mill to 40 ton/hr. The mill functions satisfactorily, and costs have been
within appraisal estimates.
C.   Loan 613 IVC SODEPALM US$9.0 Million Equivalent
3.        Oil palm plantings by outgrowers are only 67% (8,072 ha compared
with 12,000 ha) of appraisal targets (see Chart). This is a consequence of
applying more stringent selection criteria for growers. The planting
program will be completed in 1972, two years behind schedule.
4.        Coconut estate plantings (3,500 ha) have been completed on schedule,
but outgrower plantings have been reduced because of a shortage of satisfactory
planting material (see Chart), and a shortfall of 420 ha remains to be plant-
ed. Plantings will be completed in 1971.
5.        Tile standards of planting and maintenance for outgrower coconuts
and oil palms and of SODEPALM coconut estates have been satisfactory.
D.   Disbursements
6.        At appraisal it was estimated that by March 31, 1971 disbursements
against Loans IVC-611, -612, -613 would have reached US$6.2 million. In
practice, actual disbursements at April 10, 1971 were only US$2.6 million.
The slow rate of disbursement of the Bank loans has been permitted by the
very favorable cash flow that has resulted from the relatively high prices
received for palm oil and kernels in recent years, and also because SODE-
PALM and PALMINDUSTRIE have been able to borrow at low rates of interest.
Government has been requested to take steps to draw down the Bank loans

more quickly; and indications are that the pace of disbursement will accele-
rate rapidly within the next 12 months.
E.   Loan 686 IVC US$7.5 Million Equivalent
7.        This project involves the new planting of about 18,830 ha of
cocoa and the rehabilitation of 30,000 ha of young cocoa. The project
became effective on November 27, and to date project activities have been
restricted to preparing for the 1971 season. No requests for disbursement
have been made.

IVORY COAST
SECOND OIL PALM AND COCONUT PROJECT
PROJECT ENTITIES
1.        Three principal entities are involved:  SODEPALM, PALMINDUSTRIE
and PALMIVOIR. For the purpose of managing the Ivory Coast's oil estates
and palm oil mill programns the three companies are combined in an "Associa-
tion in Participation" (the Participation). In the case of the proposed
project, the Participation would be concerned only witlh the Dabou mill and
with the outgrowers oil palm plantings. Both SODEPALM and PALMIVOIRE
would be concerned with the coconut estate, coconut outgrower and oil palm
outgrower components of the project, but PALMIVOIRE only because certain
officials of this corporation are also officials of SODEPALM -- principally
Mr. Fraisse, who is General Manager of botlh corporations, and his immediate
aides; and because PALMIVOIRE maintains SODEPALM's accounts and provides
other specialized services.
2.        Until mid-1969, SODEPALM owned and operated all oil palm estates,
palm oil mills, and coconut estates establislhed under the Government's oil
palm and coconut programs, and was responsible for oil palnm and coconut
outgrower schemes. In 1969, however, two new companies were formed: PALM-
INDUSTRIE, to take over ownership of the SODEPALM palm oil mills and to
construct new milling facilities as required; and PALMIVOIRE, to manage the
PALMINDUSTRIE mills and the SODEPALM oil palm estates, and to provide SODE-
PALM with specialized services for the latter's continued management of its
coconut estates and outtgrower programs. The 1969 changes were mnade to per-
mit the introduction of private investment in the counrtry's oil palm devel-
opment program through the sale of shares in PALMINDUSTRIE and PALMIVOIRE
both to foreign companies, and Ivorian companies and individuals, and there--
by to initroduce a profit-oriented element in the management of the program.
A.  The Association in Participation
3.        On establishmnent of the two new corporations. SODEPALM, PALMINDUS-
TRIE and IPALMIVOIRE entered into a Contract of Association in Participation
(a form of joint venture) oni October 31, 1969, for the (development and
operation of the industrini oil palm estates and of thie mills. PALMIVOIRE
collects, processes and sells oil palm outgrowers production, but develop-
ment and supervision of oil palm outgrowers' holdings remain the responsi-
bility of SODEPALM.
4.        The contract of association 1has an initial life of 30 years. sub-
ject to termination after 1,, 20 or 25 years. Under its terms, PALMIVOIRE
manages and admninisters tlie Association in Participationi, and SODEPALM and



ANNEX 2
Page 2
PALMINDUSTRIE have executed separate mandates authorizing PALMIVOIUE to
administer their palm oil industrv assets and to carry on their respective
operations.  The mandates specify the programs for oil palm estate develop-
ment and for the construction of oil mills. The powers delegated to PALMI-
VOIRE are also embodied in the mandates, and cover the employmnent and re-
moval of personnel, authority to purchase, to lease and to hire; execution
of contracts; collection of debts and payment of dues; opening and operat-
ing bank accounts; and preparation of accounts. However, each company re-
tains ownership of, and control of, the ultimate disposition of its assets
and is responsible individually for its debt service.
5.         The accounts of the Participation are kept by PALMIVOIRE, and a
common operating account is prepared annually and is made up as follows:
Credit:   sales revenues
processing fees received from outgrowers
Debit:    all expenses and management charges, excluding:
(a) investment costs
(b)  interest on long- and medium-term loans
(c) income and company taxes
(d) costs directly attributable to the individual
companies -- for example, Council members'
fees.
6.         Profits and losses of the Participation are divided among the
three companies on the basis of the relative contributions made by them in
the way of assets, both fixed and current, placed at the disposal of the
Participation.
7.        PALMIVOIRE is remunerated for management services under a sliding
scale formula based on the positive results of the Participation. During
the first five years of development,, when there will be no profits, PALMI-
VOIRE will receive a management fee of CFAF 30 million annually from SODE-
PALM and PALMINDUSTRIE. This fee is deducted from the future profits of
the Participation before the distribution of these to the three companies
is determined. Actual and estimated operating accounts of the Participation
appear in Table 6.
8.        The Council of Administration, or Board of Directors, of the Par-
ticipation consists of nine members. The Government is represented by
five members (three from SODEPAI24, one from PALMINDUSTRIE and one from
PALMIVOIRE), private Ivorian shareholders by one member, and foreign and
Ivorian private companies (the Technical Group) by three members. Resolu-
tions of the Council of Administration require a majority of more than two-
thirds of those present and voting. The principal function of the Council
of Administration of the Participation is to define general policy, and to
approve the annual budget and other accounts of the Participation.



ANNEX 2

B. SODEPALM
Constitution
9.        SODEPALM (Societe pour le Developpement et i'Exploitation du
Palmier a Huile) was created by Decree No. 63-467 of November 7, 1963 as a
statutory corporation ("societe d'Etat"). Its objectives are: (a) to in-
vestigate the problems of and make proposals on, the development of both
coconut and oil palm; (b) to participate directly with capital management
and administrative staff, or indirectly through the coordination, or direc-
tion of the various public and private bodies interested in coconuts and
in oil palms. The original Decree was amended in September 1966 to bring
membership of the Council of Administration in line with ministerial re-
groupings.
10.       SODEPALM's affairs are directed by a Council of Administration of
10 members. These are: two representatives each of the National Assembly
and of the Minicter of Agriculture, and one each from the Economic and
Social Council, the Minister of the Armed Forces and the Civil Service, the
Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, the Minister of Planning, the
Institut de Recherche pour les Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO), and the private
sector. Members are nominated for three years but this period can be ex-
tended. Members receive no fees, but are entitled to expenses at fixed
rates. Meetings are held as required, in practice generallv twice a year.
Alternates are allowed, and the President, who is elected from among the
members, can vote. The Council has powers to carry out all the usual busi-
ness of a company, including the disposal of its funds. Minutes of each
meeting have to be handed to the Minister of Agriculture within eight days
of the meeting.
11.       In common with all companies with a 40% or more Government share-
holding, SODEPALM is subject to the control of a Government Commissioner
appointed by the Minister of Planning.  The Commissioner has the right to
attend all Council meetings, to investigate SODEPALM's affairs, and to sus-
pend any decision of the Council. In practice, he acts as a liaison officer
for the Government. Assurances have been obtained from the Government, how-
ever, that the Commissioner would not intervene in the day-to-day management
or act in a way detrimental to the efficient carrying out of the project.
These assurances have also been given in connection with the Commissioners
appointed to PALMINDUSTRIE and PALMIVOIRE. The Bank also obtained amend-
ments to the statutes of SODEPALM in 1968 when the first loan for oil palm
and coconut development was negotiated. These restricted the ability of
Ministers of the Governmnent to interfere unduly in the day-to-day affairs of
SODEPALM, and ensured that Ministers exercised their supervisory responsi-
bilities indirectly thirough their representatives on the Council of SODEPALM.
12.       SODEPALM started with a fixe(I capital ("capital social") of
CFAY 50 million whichi has since been raised to CFAF 400 million (US$1.4 mil-
lion). SODEPALM is subject to the same laws applicable to limited liability
companies ("societe anonyme"), but any land required to carry out its objec-



ANNEX 2
Page 4
tives can be expropriatedl under the Liws covering public utillties. Its
head office is in Abidjan, and it is empowered to open branch offices as
required. Accounts are kept in accordance with commercial practice by a
special section in PALMIVOIRE under the latter's Direction of Accounts.
The fiscal year ends December 31.  Two auditors are appointed by the Minis-
ter of Economic Affairs and Finance (in practice one is from the Government
Audit Department and the other is a private firm of auditors, Societe
Fiduciaire France-Afrique). Accounts remain provisional until approved by
the Minister, and submitted to thie National Assembly together with an annual
report.  This must be withlin tlhree months of the end of each fiscal year.
Administration is in the hands of a Director nominated by the Council.
Administration
13.       The President is Mr. Joseph Anoma, a former Minister of Agricul-
ture, and the General Manager is Mr. Andre Fraisse, who is also General
Manager of PALMIVOIRE.  Mr. Amagou iLs Deputy General Manager and responsible
to Mr. Fraisse for direct SODEPALM operations, i.e., coconut estates and
outgrowers and oil palm outgrowers. The organization of SODEPALM and its
relationship with PALMIVOIRE is shown by the Chart. Essentially, SODEPALM
has two operating divisions, Coconuts and Oilpalms, and these are subdivided
into estate and outgrower sections. In the oil palm estate section, estate
managers report to PALMIVOIRE.
Financial Arrangements
14.       SODEPALM has derived its development funds from four main sources.
First, its fixed capital of CFAF 400 million has been provided wholly by the
Government. Second, grants, partly from the Government and partly from FED.
Government grants are -rovided through the Budget Special d'Investissement
(BSIE) -- that part of the annual Government budget which provides for cap-
ital expenditure. As at the end of August 1970, the total amount received
from this source was CFAF 019.3 million. FED grants have been made lunder
Agreemnentc 183 and 331, and the total amount received up to the end of 197n
was CFAF 9,525 million. Third, a long-term loan from Caicse Autonome
d'Anmortissement (CAA) 1/ which at the end of 1970 amounted to CFAF 452.1
million.  Fourth. loans (IVC-611 and 613) from the bank made in 1969 and
amounting to CFAF 3.515 billion (US$12.6 million equivalent), and from the
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) for CFAF 1.4 billion to
finance the "First Oil Palm and Coconut Project".  SODEPALM also has ac-
counts with four conummercial banks, and is able to obtain short-term funds
wlhen required. SODEPALM also has overdraft facilities with CAA up to
CFAF 1.4 billion at 4-1/2% interest.  It has no mortgages or other charges
on its assets.
1/   CAA:  created by Government Decree in 1959 as an autonomous public in-
stitution to administer and manage the public debt and to act as banker
for other public institutions.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
15.       Lotal SODEPALM investment at November 30, 1970 was CFAF 11.360
billion (US$40,862,000 equivalent) out of which CFAF 10,421 billion
(US$37,480,000 equivalent) are in assets placed at the disposal of the Par-
ticipation. Balance sheets for the year ending December 31, 1964 through
1970 are at Table 1 and forecast cash flows at Tables 2 through 4.
C. PALMINDUSTRIE
Constitutioni
16.       PALMINDUSTRIE is a private limited liability company ("societe
anonyme").  The objectives of the company are the processing and sale of
oil palm products and by-products. Consequently, it owns the palm oil mills
required to process the production from existing and planned SODEPALM es-
tates and associated outgrowers. Eight mills have been constructed; a ninth
would be the proposed Dabou mill.
Financing ArranZements
17.       The share capital of the company is CFAF 2.5 billion (approximate-
ly US$9.0 million), and has been subscribed as follows:

Council of Administration
18.       The affairs of PALMINDUSTRIE are under the direction of a Council
of Administration consisting of nine members, six representing the Government
and three representing the private shareholders. A simple majority of those
present is required for those resolutions.  The President is selected from
among the members.  A Government Commissioner has been appointed with simi-
lar rights as those of the Commissioner appointed to SODEPAL4 (see para 11).
PALMINDUSTRIE has no staff.
D. PALMIVOIRE
Constitution
19.       PALMIVOIRE is a private company and its main objectives are:
(a) to provide all services required for the cultivation and
processing of oil palms, and other oil producing crops;
and for the sale of oil and of any bv-products derived
from such crops; and
(b)  to manaze agricultural unclertakings including processing
installations.
Council of Administration
20.       The Council of Administration of PALMIVOIRE consists of 12 members,
four repreqenting the Government (A Shares), six representing the technical
group (b Shares), and two representing the private Ivorian shareholders (C
Shares).  A simple majority is required for resolutions passed by the Coun-
cil.  It is mandatorv for the President to be elected froni the A Sharehold-
ers, but he cannot vote. The statutes provide for the delegation of powers
necessary for technical, commercial and financial operations, under programs
approved by the Council, to an executive committee ("Conseil restreint"),
comprised of six members resident in the Ivory Coast. Of the six members of
the executive committee two represent the Government (A Shares), three rep-

SECOND OIL PALM AND COCONUT PROJECT
COCONUT PRODUCTION
Planting Material
1.        Hybrid coconuts would be grown under the project from seed supplied
by the IRHO station at Port Bouet. The hybrid is a cross between dwarf
Malayan varieties (endogamous) and the tall African coconut palm (exogamous).
2.        Trials indicate that the hybrid material has excellent qualities,
in particular:
(a) high copra yields;
(b) early maturity;
(c) excellent copra quality; and
(d) drought tolerance.
Although it has been impossible to investigate all of the hybrid's character-
istics, those which are known are sufficient to advocate its use. Two impor-
tant qualities have not been investigated fully. These are its productive
life span, and its viral disease resistance. It is expected, however, that
its productive life span would be in range of the parent stock and therefore
between 40 and 100 years. So far it has not suffered from viral diseases.
The dwarf parent, is resistant and consequently there is a good chance that
the hybrid will have this quality.
Fertilizers
3.        Foliar analysis would be undertaken regularly with assistance from
IRHO to ascertain optimum fertilizer use. It is known already that hybrid
coconuts require large quantities of fertilizer, and in addition to nitrogen
at planting, by year six it is expected that each tree will require about
500 gram of phosphate, 2,000 gram of potassium, and 1,500 gram of magnesium
annually.
Yields
4.        The project copra yield projection of 3.5 ton/ha at full maturity
is conservative. It is less than the 4 ton/ha achieved on IRIO trials,
which were located on poorer soils than those selected for the project, and
which did not benefit from the use of the polybag nurseries to be used under
the project. The trial results and project yield estimates between years
3 and 7 are given below:

Processing
5.        At full maturity 200 ton/day of copra would be produced from es-
tates and outgrowers (see planting details Table 1). The relationship be-
tween the proposed plantings and those made under Loan IVC-613 is given in
Tabie 2.  A study to develop and design a central processing unit by 1976 is
being carried out. This unit would be a continuous flow process capable of
converting coconuts directly into oil and expeller cake. In the meantime
small units capable of processing about 5.5 tons of copra in 38 hours would
be used for the limited amounts of copra that would be produced by the proj-
ect before 1976.

SECOND OIL PALM AND COCONUT PROJECT
DABOU OIL MILL
General
1.        A new oil mill in the Dabou area would process the ffb from a total
of 13,000 ha, including the Sodepalm estates (3,500 ha), an IRHO's estate
(3,600 ha) and outgrower's areas (6,300 ha). At maturity, about 141,000 1/
tons of ffb would be produced for processing. The new mill would be
commissioned by January 1973, when a capacity of 35 ton ffb/ha would be
required. Initially, two lines of 10 ton ffb/hr each would be installed,
and a third line of similar capacity would be added in the late 1970's,
when ffb production would have increased.
Location -
2.        The mill site is at the intersection of the Abidjan-Bouake and
Yassap-Grand Lahou roads. Investigations of water availability indicate a
groundwater supply of over 100 m3/hr at about 50 m, which is more than
adequate for mill requirements.
Construction
3.        PALMIVOIRE would build the mill.  It has the experience and
equipment necessary for earth moving, ground preparation, and building and
storage tank construction. Steel work, roofing, painting, and road surfac-
ing would be let on subcontracts. Mill machinery would be procured through
international competitive bidding.
Time Schedule and Tendering Arrangements
4.        Civil works were started in March 1971 and should be completed
by the end of the year, allowing trial production to begin in 1972. Bids
for machinery and equipment were opened in April and orders will be
placed early in May. The Bank has agreed to pre-qtialification for bids
and these will be limited to the Speichim and de Wecker companies. These
two companies have equipped the eight existing PALMIVOIRE mills.
1/   The Bank's forecast is slightly more conservative than that of SODEPALM
(149,000 ton ffb).

Alternative Phasing for Milling Arrangements
6.         There are mills at Irobo and Anguededou (Map 3), which are 62 km
and 40 km from the centre of the Dabou area. Each has a potential capacity,
with additional equipment, to handle 40 ton ffb/hr. This additional capacity
and that in the new mill at Dabou would be required by 1976 to process the
ffb produced around the three mills. The possibility of expanding these
mills, before building the new Dabou mill, to handle project ffb in the
early years of production was investigated, and though there is a marginal
financial benefit from expanding them first, it was decided to proceed
immediately with construction of the Dabou mill because:
(a) haulage distances would be reduced by two-thirds, eliminating
risks of delays, and extra cost caused by accidents and road
impediments; and
(b) mill management would be simplified.
7.        Table 1 shows the comparative costs and rates of return for the pro-
posed milling arrangements and the alternative arrangements for expanding the
Irobo and Anguededou mills first, and constructing the Dabou mill in 1975/76.

1/  Dabou Mill eostruetion by 1973 followed by extensions is 1973 sod 1976
2/  FiPet estension by 1973, Second by 1974 followed by Dab.. Hill in 1976
Other Notes
(a) Residuol value of old Dabou mill includes housing, vehicles and equip-ent
(b) Residual value of new mill and enteosions assumes 20-yeao life deprecioted on straight line basis
(c)  Sales proe.eds are nmialo only and identical for proposed and alternative phasing of eopendit-ra
(d)  Alternative phasing assumes IRHO fruit would be transported up to 60 km until new Dabou mill is built in 1976; if IR0O elected to build a new mill, if Dabou mill .osstruetion is deferred,
the rats of return would be red-ced below 17%.
(a)  No aucount has been taken of poor road conditions, delays and t-ck breakdowns during the wet season in the aIter-ative phasing of expeodituce calculation;  the t-ansport haul during
first sin years would average 40 km, twice thl maxinun 20 kI haul generally ammed for practicaI operation and efficiency.

2.        During the operating period SODEPALM would supply fertilizers on
credit to outgrowers at the rate of CFAF 2,250/ha in year 4 and CFAF 3,000/ha
in year 5 to 9, for a period total of CFAF 17,250.  llTis was not included in
the first project but experience to date indicates that outgrowers would be
unlikely to apply fertilizers during the first 6 years of production without
credit facilities. From year 10 onwards SODEPALM would supply fertilizers
to outgrowers at the rate of CFAF 3,000 per hectare per year and would
deduct the cost from the sales price.
3.        The outgrower would supply the necessary tools at an estimated cost
of CFAF 100 per hectare per year as from year 0. The estimated number of
man-days per outgrower per liectare per year are as follows:

/1   Mostly land clearing.
4.        Credits to outgrowers would be made by SODEPALM through its Compte
de Plantations Villageoises (C.P.V.). Each participating outgrower would be
debited with a total of CFAF 53,750 per ha (See Annex 10 page 1). This is
based on past experience and compares with CFAF 63,000 per hectare
established as average in the first project.
5.        The credits would bear compound interest at 2% and the outgrower
would repay principal and interest, together with the credits for fertilizers
supplied during the first 6 years of operation, over a period of 12 years
beginning in the 7th year after planting. Interest would be capitalized in
the grace period. SODEPALM would deduct credit repayments from its payments
to outgrowers for ffb. Participating outgrowers would contract to sell all
their ffb to SODEPALM and in practice would have no other market except for
small quantities of ffb for local oil production. These arrangements work
well currently.
6.        F.E.R. would reimburse SODEPALM CFAF 48,300 per hectare, which is
the difference between the total cost of establishing one hectare (CFAF 102,050
per ha) and the amount repaid by the outgrower (CFAF 53,750 per ha); F.E.R.
payments under the first project were CFAF 63,800 per hectare. Reimbursement

7.        The following table shows the estimated annual average allocation
of the value of one kg of outgrower bunch for the period 1978 through 1988
using the Bank's forecast of palm produce prices and assuming a net price
to outgrowers of CFAF 4 per kg of ffb (CFAF 5 per kg, less CFAF 1 per kg for
SODEPALN supervision costs).

but the interest will be 7-1/2% instead of 6%.  The compound interest will
be capitalized during the grace period of 6 years (Year-1 through Year 4)
and repayments will be made during the following 19 years (Year 5 through
Year 23).  SODEPALM will deduct credit repayments from its payments to out-
growers for nuts. Participating outgrowers will contract to sell their nuts
to SODEPALM, although an allowance of some 7% of the product is made in the
project for family consumption and direct sales to traders.

MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS
Oil Palm Products
1.        Project production of palm oil and palm kernels would be marketed
by PALMIVOIRE, both directly, and through contracts concluded with SOGESCOL as
an intermediary. This is a major trading company in fats and oils in Europe
and is the commodity trading subsidiary of the Societe Financiere des Caout-
choues S.A. (SOCFIN), which is an international plantation company owning and
operating extensive areas of oil palm estates. Three companies of the SOCFIN
Group are shareholders of PALMINDUSTRIE and of PALMIVOIRE.
2.        An agreement has been obtained from SOGESCOL (which is satisfactory
to the Bank) that Ivory Coast palm produce marketed by SOGESCOL at the request
of PALMIVOIRE, would receive equal treatment with respect to volume and prices,
as produce of equal quality from other sources under the control of SOCFIN, or
of any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.
3.        The domestic market for palm oil, either in crude or refined forms,
is still growing. Under a draft agreement, the Blohorn Group, (the only
industrial processor of palm oil in the Ivory Coast and a shareholder in
PALMIVOIRE and PALMINDUSTRIE) would be supplied with oil, to the extent of
its processing capacity, at ruling cif Europe prices less export costs. Sales
of crude palm oil would be made directly by PALMIVOIRE to wholesalers at prices
probably slightly more attractive.
Coconut Products
4.        Production will not start until 1976, and formal arrangements are
not necessary at present.
CSSPPA
5.        In common with other agricultural exports, the Caisse de Stabilisa-
tion et de Soutien des Prix des Productions Agricoles (CSSPPA) intervenes to
stabilize producer prices for palm oil and for kernels. Another function of
CSSPPA is to collect farmer's taxes; and to transfer a substantial portion of
the collected money to BSIE to promote new crops; and also, to other special
agency budgets. CSSPPA does not intervene directly in the sale of palm
products.
6.        Prices of products are given in Tables 1 and 2.

ANNEX 12
Page 1
IVORY COAST
SECOND OIL PALM AND COCONUT PROJECT
MARKETS AND PRICES FOR OIL PALM AND COCONUT PRODUCTS
1.        Fats and oils may be conveniently divided among vegetable oils,
animal fats (butter, lard, tallow) and marine oils (whale and fish oils).
Modern refining and hydrogenation techniques have made the various oils
and fats increasingly interchangeable, and an analysis of international
market prices for an individual oil generally has to consider the supply,
demand and price developments for all fats and oils. However, for many
oils there is still a primary market for specific uses; only when this
demand is filled does the oil compete directly with other oils and become
interchangeable with them.
2.        World production of fats and oils during the 1954-56 to 1967-69
period expanded by 3.0 percent yearly. Exports, on the other hand, in-
creased by 3.7 percent yearly (Table 1). This expansion in trade could
only be absorbed at declining world market prices. Thus the index of
prices for the major fats and oils declined by about 1.0 yearly from
1958-60 to 1967-69 (Chart I).
3.        Most important to world trade in fats and oils is the import
demand in developed countries, particularly Western Europe. Although
the rate of growth of import demand in all developed countries increased
slightly in the 1960's as compared with the 1950's (from 3.0 percent to
3.5 percent yearly), this increase was mainly accounted for by an increase
in import demand in Japan. The rate of growth in import demand for Western
Europe, which accounts for more than 50 percent of world import demand,
declined (from 2.7 percent to 2.4 percent yearly). This situation explains
to a large extent the pressure on prices experienced in the past.
4.        On the other hand, declining world market prices stimulated the
import demand in developing countries. Their share on world imports in-
creased from about 15 percent in 1954-56 to nearly 25 percent in 1967-69.
Although there exists a large potential import demand in developing coun-
tries, which could reverse the price trend, the lack of foreign exchange
in these countries made it difficult to turn the potential into an effec-
tive demand. Expansion in import demand in these countries will depend
on relatively low fats and oils prices.
5.        World exports in the 1970's are expected to grow at about the
same rate as in the 1960's (3.8 percent yearly). The major expansion
will take place in vegetable oils; among these palm oil will experience
the largest expansion with about one million tons between 1967-69 and
1975. The expansion in total exports will not be met by an equally large



ANNEX 12
Page 2
increase in import demand at 1967-69 prices, however. Import demand is
expected to increase to about 13.8 million tons in the mid-1970's from
10.8 million tons in 1967-69, while export availabilities will rise to
about 14.2 million tons. The potential export surplus will push prices
downward from their 1967-69 level.
6.        The potential surpluses ,are similar in relative magnitude to
those that developed during 1962 and 1968, and it is assumed that the
overall price level for fats and oils in 1975 will settle around the 1968
level - or slightly below because of the unusually large drop expected
for some individual oils in the stiruggle to increase market shares.
Those oils which may be considered more valuable from the processors'
point of view (such as groundnut o:1l, cottonseed oil, coconut oil and
sunflowerseed oil) may settle at about or slightly above their 1962 and
1968 levels. After 1975 prices are expected to increase temporarily,
encouraging production and exports of annual oilseed crops, but the price
level at the beginning of the 1980"s is not going to remain above the
level predicted for the mid-1970's.
Palm Oil
7.        Prices for some oils, mainly palm oil and perhaps soybean oil,
are expected to decline below levels achieved at any time in the 1960's.
These oils are of lower quality from the processors' point of view, and
they already have a large market shiare or they are expected to increase
this share. The latter point applies particularly to palm oil. Proces-
sors will only be induced to increase the relative share of these oils
if there is a sufficient price incentive to do so. Therefore, palm oil
prices are expected to settle at $155-$165 per metric ton in 1975 and
thereafter. This level compares with $222 per ton in 1962-64 and $190
per ton in 1967-69.
8.        Palm oil is produced almost entirely in four developing coun-
tries: Nigeria, Congo (Democratic Republic), Indonesia and Malaysia.
Table 2 indicates the production situation in these and other countries
in recent years. Palm oil production expanded slowly in the past as com-
pared with other major fats and oils. The growth rate for world palm oil
production amounted to only 1.9 percent yearly, compared with 3.0 percent
yearly for all fats and oils. The only really significant expansion took
place in Malaysia. However, in a number of countries, particularly
Malaysia, a considerable expansion in production is planned for the
future. Some of these plans have already been put into operation. If
these developments go according to schedule, total world production will
amount to approximately 2.7 million tons by 1980. This would represent
a growth rate of 5.5 percent between 1967-69 and 1980, and the share of
palm oil production on total fats and oils production would increase to
approximately five percent, compared with about three percent in 1967-69.
9.        Many of the new plantings are export-oriented and a considerable
share of the additional supplies will have to be absorbed by the interna-
tional market. Palm oil exports increased very slowly during the last



ANNEX 1 2
Page 3
decade, owing largely to the slow growth in production rather than to
marketing difficulties. It is estimated that by 1980 palm oil exports may
amount to approximately 1.9 million tons, compared with about 620,000 tons
in 1967-69. Consequently, the share of palm oil exports on total trade
will probably increase to about 12 percent in 1980, compared with 5.7 per-
cent in the earlier period.
10.       The palm oil economy thus faces two major problems in the
future. First, it will experience declining world market prices, a
phenomenon that is shared by all major fats and oils. Second, it will
have to increase its share in total usage of fats and oils - particularly
in food end-products.
11.       It has already been mentioned that securing an increased share
of the market will require a much greater than average decline in the price
of palm oil as compared to most other oils. At the same time the increased
share will have to take place within the highly complex technical setting
which determines the input and output mixes of the world fats and oils
processing industry. Here it meets its strongest competition from soybean
oil, fish oil and lard.
12.       The economic and technical factors involved in the interchange-
ability of fats and oils are very complicated, however, and prohibit a
simple substitution of one oil for another. It appears that lard and soy-.
bean, fish and palm oils all have characteristics which make them less
desirable to processors than, for example, groundnut oil and coconut oil.
The less desirable aspects of palm oil are the comparatively high content
of the inedible portion of stearin and the tendency to change color and
crystallize during storage. The elimination of these shortcomings requires
research which has been lacking in the past, since relatively small supplies
and high prices made the expense not worthwhile. Recently, in anticipation
of lower prices, research aimed at improving the substitutability of palm
oil has started.
13.       While having to compete on technical grounds, palm oil will also
have to contend against strong price competition. This is illustrated in
Chart I, which indicates the close price relationship between soybean oi-
and palm oil. In future, price developments for these two oils, which
from the processors' point of view are of similar quality, will continue
to move closer together.
Coconut products
14.       Coconut palm cultivation is restricted to a relatively narrow
belt within the tropics, since the tree grows best on alluvial soils under
conditions of high temperature and rainfall; hence, palms are mainly found
on islands and in other coastal regions. In most countries the bulk of
the palms are owned by smallholders for whom the coconut palm is often
an important source of the basic necessities of life, as well as of a

cash income. The chief commercial. products obtained from the nut are
copra, which is the dried kernel, and coconut oil, which is extracted from
the copra. In addition, the production of desiccated coconut is of some
importance in the Philippines and Ceylon, as is coir (the fiber from the
coconut husk) in India and Ceylon. International trade in fresh coconuts
and copra cake is relatively small. Copra normally has an oil content of
64 percent. It is utilized in the production of margarine and compound
cooking fat, in the manufacture of soap and synthetic detergents, and for
other industrial uses.
15.       Coconut oil and copra (in oil equivalent) comprised about five
percent of total world fats and oil production in 1967-69. Over 60 per-
cent of world coconut output is produced in three countries (Table 3).
The Philippines is by far the largest producer and exporter of copra and
coconut oil and accounted for about 40 percent of world production in
1967-69. Developments in that country's coconiut industry have been and
will continue to remain the major factor influencing coconut production
and exports in the next decade. Indonesia is the second largest producer,
followed by Ceylon.
16.       Coconut production (in terms of oil equivalent) expanded by only
0.5 percent yearly from 1954-56 to 1967-69, compared with 3.0 percent for
all fats and oils production. A nulmber of reasons explain the rather poor
production performance. Coconuts -are a poorly organized smallholders'
crop in the major coconut-producing countries. They provide a food and
cash crop for growers, and require very little attention and expenditure
as long as output is maintained at a low level of productivity. Because
of problems involved in the collecting, processing and shipping of copra,
buyers insist on relatively large raargins. The price the farmer receives
is usually not sufficient incentive to induce him to increase the producti-
vity of his trees. In addition the long gestation period of coconut trees
reduces the incentive for farmers to replant as they are uncertain of a
situation ten years hence when the trees would be in full production. To
put it bluntly, when prices are good the grower sells more nuts, and when
prices are bad he eats more of them. As long as the trees keep bearing
he feels no need to devote time ancl energy to improving his production.
The result is that most of the coconut stands are old and of declining
productivity, with very little new planting or replanting being done.
17.       The situation was somewhat different with respect to new plant-
ing in the Philippines. While very, little replanting or new planting took
place in the northern islands, substantial new planting was undertaken
in the south. Up to the early 1960's most of the production was concen-
trated in the northern islands. This area is in the typhoon belt and
severe losses were often experienced through typhoon damage. Since the
early 1960's substantial new planting (mainly on large plantations) was
carried out in the south, particularly Mindanao, where typhoon occurrence
is small. So far output has not expanded significantly, because not all
of the trees have reached maturity and typhoon damage was heavy during
the past years in the northern part of the country. In addition severe
droughts reduced output in the south.

18.       But output (and exports) from the Philippines will expand mainly
because of the replanting. We estimate that by 1980 about 1.6 million
tons of copra (in oil equivalent) will be produced, of which about 1.2
million tons will be exported. Little expansion is expected in other
areas.
19.       World exports of coconut oil and copra (in oil equivalent) de-
clined by 0.3 percent yearly from 1954-56 to 1967-69. The decline in
exports would have been even more severe had not output from new plant-
ings in the Philippines slowed down the decline. That country is the
largest exporter of coconut products and accounted for about 60 percent
of world exports in 1967-69. Exports from Indonesia, the second largest
exporter, have declined since the 1950's and have only recently begun to
increase. Whether this will be a permanent trend depends on an improve-
ment in the inter-island shipping situation as well as the development
of domestic consumption. These factors are uncertain, but it is doubt-
ful that a great export expansion can be expected, particularly since
replanting has been neglected.
20.       Relatively little export expansion can be expected from the
other coconut growing areas. Tree stands are old and a growing domestic
consumption limits export expansion, a situation which is particularly
prevalent in Ceylon. Thus the major expansion in exports will come from
the Philippines. The expansion of about 26,000 tons from project plant-
ing is only a small contribution to export development, and will account
for about 1.5 percent of world exports when the project reaches maturity.
21.       Taking these factors into account, we estimate that by 1980
world exports of copra and coconut oil will be about 1.6-1.7 million tons
(oil equivalent). Within this overall trend copra exports will continue
to decline, while exports of oil will increase as more and more process-
ing will be carried out in the country of origin. From 1960-64 to 1967-
69 copra exports declined by 4.0 percent yearly, while coconut oil exports
increased by 4.6 percent yearly.
22.       It is unlikely that the expansion in exports will take place at
past high prices, since the import demand will not expand significantly
at these price levels. The United States is by far the world's leading
importer of copra and coconut oil (Table 3), and is followed by the
Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom and the other Western
European countries, especially France and the Netherlands. The United
States, the EEC and the United Kingdom accounted for 75 percent of world
imports in 1967-69. Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan and Japan are also
fairly important users of coconut oil, while moderate imports are made by
a large number of countries in Eastern Europe, South America and Asia.
In all these countries, however, long-term import demand has not increased
because of limited export availabilities and high prices.
23.       In the 1920's coconut oil was the lowest-priced major vegetable
oil on the world market. At that time it was widely used for food and
technical purposes. Since the end of the 1950's it has become the highest-



ANNEX 12
Page 6
priced oil, mainly because output ancl exports have failed to expand with
demand, thus encouraging large-scale substitution by less expensive oils.
Today coconut oil still has certain irreplaceable uses which make export
demand inelastic up to a certain point and allow prices to rise steeply
if supplies fall short. If export supplies increase beyond these special
requirements, however, prices decline to the level of those of other fats
and oils.
24.       The special characteristic of coconut oil in food uses is due
to the fact that it has less tendency to become rancid than other oils,
has a high melting point (75 F.) and contains more than 40 percent solids
at 50 F. These qualities make it a necessary ingredient in many bakery
and confectionery products, and to a lesser extent in table oils. The
increase in utilization in the EEC and in the United States from 1963 to
1967 was caused by increased use in the food industry. When world mar-
ket nrices continued to rise, imports were reduced drastically in 1968-69.
In other importing regions coconut imports declined as other oils replaced
coconut oil in food uses.
25.       The technical uses of coconut oil are based on its lauric acid
content, necessary to produce the lathering quality of soap and detergents,
as well as in synthetic rubber, hydraulic brake fluids, synthetic resins,
plasticizers and insecticides. Technical use of coconut oil has not in-
creased in the major consuming countries (Table 4) in spite of a growing
demand for its end-products. This indicates that some substitution took
place, and this process can only be stopped if lower coconut oil prices
make substitution less profitable.
26.       If there is to be an increase in future import demand, it seems
quite clear that international market prices will have to come down in
order to encourage increased use - mainly in the food industry. At past
high prices it is unlikely that import demand will increase beyond 1.3-1.4
million tons by 1980. Our export projections indicate world market avail-
abilities of 1.6-1.7 million tons. Prices will have to decline if this
surplus of about 300,000-400,000 tons is to be disposed of.
27.       Copra and coconut oil prices are illustrated in Chart I.  The
substantial price premiums coconut oil enjoyed over competing oils are
attributable mainly to the long-run rigidity in total supplies of copra
in the face of a rigid demand for specific uses. When this demand was
filled prices declined sharply (as in 1955-57 and 1961-62), because coconut
oil had to then compete with other oils in food uses, particularly marga-
rine and shortening. The major competitor in this field is groundnut
oil - also a high quality oil from the processors' point of view. Since
future coconut oil supplies will exceed its specific demand, prices will
have to decline to allow it to compete with other food oils. We esti-
mate that this situation will reduce prices by 1980 to about $280-$290
per metric ton, c.i.f. Europe.  Assuming that the past price relationship
between copra and coconut oil prices prevails, copra prices at the
end of the 1970's would amount to about $180-$190 per ton.



ANNEX 12

28.       There is one possibility that the specific demand for coconut
oil will exceed our projections, and consequently keep copra and coconut
oil prices above the projected price level. Coconut oil derivatives have
been found to be non-water polluting when used as a detergent base, and
it is possible that they will find increasing use in the detergent in-
dustry. So far there is no evidence that this will be the case. In 1964
a law was passed in the Federal Republic of Germany restricting thie use
of detergents to those that are 80 percent decomposable or non-water
polluting. This has not led to the increased use of coconut oil derivatives
in that country, however. Apparently detergent manufacturers have found
a cheaper substitute than coconut to comply with the law.

SECOND OIL PALM AND COCONUT PROJECT
CALCULATION OF THE ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
1.        The estimated economic rates of return from investments in the
project on the basis of conservative estimates of yields, costs free of
identifiable taxes but including cash cost of labor and the price assumptions
set out in para 6.05 and 6.06 of the main report and Annex 12 are as follows:
Oil palms
Outgrowers:  17.2%
Coconuts
Estates   : 18.1%
Outgrowers:  16.4%
Overall         : 17.5%
For the purpose of the considerations below these rates are referred to as
the standard rates of return.
Increases and decreases of Income and Expenses
2.        An analysis has been made of the sensitivity of the standard rates
of return to alternative assumptions concerning increases and decreases of
income and expenses by 10%.
Expenses               90%           100%         110%
Oil Palm       Income
outgrowers        90%                 17.7%          14.5%       11.7%
100%                20.5%         17.2%        14.5%
110%                22.5%         19.7%        17.2%
Coconut        Income
Estates            90%                18.2%          16.2%       14.4%
100%                20.1%         18.1%        16.3%
110%                21.9%         19.9%        18.1%
Coconut        Income
outgrowers        90%                 16.4%          14.6%       13.0%
100%                18.2%         16.4%        14.8%
110%                19.9%         18.0%        16.4%



ANNEX 16
Page 2
Cost of labor
3.        It has been assumed that the outgrowers would pay their hired labor
at the daily rate of CFAF 100 which is the rate currently paid on small
holdings. The minimum agricultural daily wage enforced on industrial estates
is CFAF 210. If this rate was paid by the outgrowers the economic rate of
return would be as follows:
Oil palm outgrowers:       13.2%
Coconut outgrowers:       14.6%
4.        It is assumed that estate coconuts would have a productive life of
40 years. This is conservative in comparison with the known productive life
of existing coconut plantings in the Ivory Coast and elsewhere.  However,
since hybrid coconuts have not been grown for 40 years the sensitivity of the
return to lives of 20 and 30 years have been calculated:
Coconut estates           Coconut outgrowers
20 years                   17.1                      15.2
30 years                   17.9                      16.2
40 years                   18.1                      16.4
5.        Details of the calculations of the standard rates of return for
coconut estates, coconut outgrowers and oil palm outgrowers are shown at
table 1 to 4 below.
