REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON
TWO PROPOSED LOANS
TO
SOCIETE PALMINDUSTRIE AND SOCIETE SODEPALM
BOTH TO BE GUARANTEED BY
THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR THE
SECOND OIL PALM AND COCONUT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on two
proposed loans: i) to Societ6 PALNINDUSTRIE (co-signed by Societ6
PALMIVOIRE), for the equivalent of US$1.9 million; and ii) to
Societ6 SODEPALM (Societe pour le D6veloppement et l'Exploitation
du Palmier 'a huile), for the equivalent of US$5.1 million.  Both
loans would be guaranteed by the Republic of the Ivory Coast, and
the loan to PALMINDUSTRIE would also be guaranteed by SODEPALM and
PALNIVOIRE. The loan to PALMINDUSTRIE would bear interest at
7-1/4 percent per annum and be repayable 1975 to 1990; and the loan
to SODEPALM would bear interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum and be
repa-yable 1977 to 1992 (see Annexes I and II). The loans have been
appraised and negotiated together. The Borrowers are linked in a
form of joint venture for the production of oil palm, the processing
of palm oil and the sale of palm oil products; and,in addition,
PALMIV1OIRE provides certain management services for SODEPALM.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The Ivoly Coast became independent in 1960 and joined the
Bank in 1963. The first loan to the Ivory Coast was ma.de in 1.968
for a program of highway construction, feasibility studies and
detailed engineering. Since then, five additional loans have been
made, three for oil palm and coconut development and one each for
cocoa production and education. These six loans total Us$41.4
million (see Annex III). The IFC has a small participation -
US$20h,00o - in the capital of the Banque Ivoirienne de D6veloppe-
ment Industriel. A second highway loan for US$20.5 million is
expected. to be presented to the Executive Directors shortly.
3.       Because of the Ivory Coast's creditworthiness arnd relatively
high per capita GDP, all lending to the Ivory Coast has been on
Bank terms.  The sectors which are expected to IUJ.r-fit most from



- 2 -
Bank assistance are transport and agriculture because of their
importance to the economy of the country. Next fiscal year, it is
expected that two loans, one for a rubber project and the other
for road construction and maintenance, will be submitted to the
Excecutive Directors for their consideration.
4.       Three previous loans were made in 1969 to member companies
of the SODEPALN-PALIINDUSTRIE.-PALNIVOIRE joint venture (sometimes
referred to as the "Participation").  The loans, which were made
concurrently, assisted in the financing of: i) the establishment of
4,000 ha. of industrial oil palm estates (611-IVC); ii) the con-
struction of a palm oil mill (612-IVC); and iii) the establishment
of 3,500 ha. of industrial coconut estates and 3,000 ha. of outgrower
coconut holdings and 12,000 ha. of outgrower oil palm holdings
(613-IVC). The project had to be divided into three loans because
of the legal structure of the joint venture, which consists of the
three companies SODEPALM, PALMINDUSTRIE and PALMIVOIRE linked together
by an agreement of Association en Participation. The present loans
constitute a continuation of the joint venture's program of oil palm
development and commissioning of palm oil processing facilities, and
of SODEPALM's program for outgrower production of oil palm and coco-
nuts and for new industrial coconut estates.
5.       Progress in the execution of the first oil palm and coconut
project has been excellent: the oil mill is in operation and most
of the plantations, both outgrower and industrial, are more than
half-completed. The joint venture has worked well and enjoyed
effective management. Disbursement on the Bank loans has, however,
been slow due to the Borrower's ability to obtain short-term credits.
However, at our request, disbursements have been speeded up and are
now proceeding at a satisfactory rate.  Moreover, during negotiations,
the Borrowers provided the Bank with a schedule for future disburse-
ments to which the companies wvould adhere.
6.       The road project is now nearing completion.  Although it was
dalayud in pzttinj_ et-.rtHd bre&-use of slowness in the Borrower's
administrative procedures, it bag been 1rprP1centGd in a satisfactory
manner. The education and cocoa projects financed in 1970 have also
been slow in starting due in large measure to problems of management
on the part of the Borrower.
PART II - COUNTRY BACKGROUND
7.       The latest economic report on the Ivory Coast, "Economic
Growth and Prospects of the Ivory Coast", Vols. I-IV (AW-17a), was
distributed to the Exrecutive Directors on August 21, 1970. An eco-
nomic mission, which visited the country in January-jFebruary of this
year, is preparing its report. Its preliminary findings confirm the
Ivory Coast's continued creditworthiness. A basic Data sheet and map
are attached (Annex IV)



- 3 -
8.       Economic Situation and Policies - The economy of the
Ivory Coast has grown rapidly in recent years with GDP increasing
by about 12 percent per year at current prices and about 7.5 per-
cent in real terms. By 1970, GDP per capita had risen to US$286.
The principal factor in this rapid growth has been agricultural
and forest product exports. However, due to projected world com-
modity price declines and limitations on timber resources, exports
will in the near future probably grow at a slower rate. GDP should
nevertheless continue to grow at an annual rate of 5 to 6 percent.
9.       Owing to favorable export prices, the Ivory Coast's
balance of trade showed sizeable surpluses which, together with the
inflow of foreign grants and loans, allowed a substantial increase
in net external assets. By 1970, these amounted to the equivalent
of 4 months of imports. On the other hand, public debt has
increased rapidly and the debt service ratio (8 percent in 1970)
is expected to begin a sharp rise unless the Government reduces
its use of short- and medium-term financing.
10.      The Government is strongly committed to economic and
social development and continues to mobilize domestic resources
for this purpose. Public investment has been rising rapidly. Most
of the investment program appears well justified, particularly
investments for agricultural diversification, regional development,
education and improvements in infrastructure. However, in recent
years, the Government has undertaken large public investments of
lower economic priority, for example, the Kossou dam and the so-
called African Riviera (urban development and tourism). With the
inclusion in the public investment program of such projects, total
public investment could well exceed the financial capacities of
the Government, leading to a rapid increase in external debt.
11.      Although most sections of the population have benefited
from economic growth, certain economic and social problems have
emerged. For example, the participation of Ivorians in private
sector management and employment is still quite limited and the
level of literacy and skills is low. Thus, there is a continuing
dependency on expatriate managerial and technical cadres. Uneven
distribution of regional income has influenced the development
of Abidjan. And rapid urbanization and urban unemployment are
becoming important problems. The large influx of foreign African
labor coupled with the lack of housing and urban amenities has
aggravated the situation. The Government is seeking to alleviate
these problems through larger social investments and a policy of
dialogue with all major groups in the population.
12.      In the future, the Ivory Coast faces the problem of
maintaining a high growth rate and a high level of investment in
the face of less favorable export conditions and the need to choose
between competing investment possibilities. The Bank is discuss-
ing with the Government the policy options involved. In any event,



the high level of investment required to achieve sound growth
objectives in the Ivory Caost will require a substantial inflow
of public and private capital, as well as the best efforts of
the Government to increase and retain domestic savings in the
country. There are good prospects for a continued large scale
inflow of capital on public account from France and the EEC as
well as from other sources. Given sound fiscal management and
appropriate resolution of its investment priorities, the Ivory
Coast will remain creditworthy for further borroving on appropri-
ate terms, including substantial Bank lending.
13.       Agricultural Problems and Policies:   The Ivory Coast
has in recent years enjoyed excellent conditions for agricultural
development: abundant land, a plentiful supply of labor and favor-
able market conditions for its principal products. The Government
has implemented a policy of diversification in order to reduce the
country's dependence on coffee, cocoa and timber, which account for
78 percent of total exports. Thus, it has introduced the culti-
vation of such export products as oil palm, coconuts, bananas and
pineapples, and has programs for rubber, rice, and sugar under
study. These programs, entrusted largely to autonomous state
corporations, have been highly successful and agricultural pro-
duction has responded with a growth rate of 6.5 percent at current
prices and an export growth rate of 11 percent per year. Most of
the Government's projects are designed to encourage smallholders.
Moreover, several of the industrial estate projects have small-
holders associated with them.
1.       Through regional development, the Government has attempted,
although with only limited success, to redress the unequal rate of
income development between North and South and it is now endeavoring to
open up the South--W!,est. For example, cotton production - the main cash
crop in the North - was encouragE by instituting guaranteed prices and
providing an assured marke-c; and cotton production has risen rapidly
from 5,500 tons in 1965 to 42,000 tons in 1969. In the South-TWlest,
the Government will soon begin to implement a program for the de-
velopment of cocoa, oil palm, coconut, timber, rice and rubber culti-
vation in the hinterland of the new port of San Pedro. It is expected
that some of these projects will be subiritted to the Bank.
15.       Agricultural research in the Ivory Coast is making an
increasingly important contribution to agricultural diversification.
The development of hybrid coconut trees, which will be used in the
proposed project, is an excellent example of the benefits of re-
search. Coconut production has not been important thus far, and
coconut products are not presently exported. However, the new high
yielding, early maturing hybrids will make coconut production a very
profitable undertaking and one which is well adapted to the Ivory
Coast's sandy coastal soils.



PART III - THE PROPOSED PROJECT
16.       The two proposed loans would assist in financing a
project consisting of the following:
a) the establishment of 8,000 ha. of industrial
coconut plantations, 4,500 ha. of outgrowers'
holdings planted in coconuts and 4,500 ha. of
outgrowers' holdings planted in oil palm;
b) roads and other infrastructure for existing
and planned coconut plantations; and
c) construction of a palm oil mill at Dabou with
the capacity to process the produce of some
13,000 ha. of oil palm.
Because of the joint venture's legal structure, it has been
necessary to make two separate loans, one to SODEPAIN for the
industrial coconut and outgrower plantations and the other to
PALMINDUSTRIE for the processing facilities.
17.       The background and structure of the joint venture is
as follows: SODEPALM, a wholly government-owned corporation,
was established in 1963 to carry out the Government's programn
for the development of oil palm and coconut production. In 1969,
two new companies were formed: PALMINDUSTRIE, to own the palm
oil processing facilities, and PALMIVOIRE to manage the oil palm
production and processing facilities. Both 6f the new companies
are partly privately owaned and were established in order to bring
private capital and managerial experience into this industry. On
the establishment of the two new corporations, the three companies
entered into agreements for the development and operation of the
industrial oil palm estates and of the mills. PAUMIVOIRE received
from both SODEPALM and PALMINDUSTRIE full powers to direct the
investment stage and subsequently to manage their palm oil in-
dustrial plantations and palm oil processing facilities respectively.
SODEPALM retains, however, direct control over the management of
the oil palm and coconut outgrower program and the coconut
industrial estates.  PALMINDUSTRIE, on the other hand, is simply
a corporation in which the title to the mills is vested. It is
otherwise wholly managed by PALNIVOIRE.  PALIVVOIRE also has
control over the collection, processing and sale of all palm oil
production. Profits and losses of the joint venture are divided
among the companies on the basis of their respective capital contri-
butions, and, in addition, ?,LLHV-VOI1RT  receives a management fee.
18.       The oil palm program executed by SODEPALM was first
financed by the Fonds Europeen de D6veloppement (FED). But,
after the joint venture was formed, financing was obtained fromn



- 6 -
the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and the
-uropean Investment Bank, as well as the Bank. CCCE is contributing
to the financing of the present project through the Banque Nationale
de D6veloppement Agricole of the Ivory Coast (BNDA). BNDA is an
autonomous corporation in which CCCE is a minority shareholder.
19.      In order to strengthen the management of the companies,
which is highly centralized and dependent on a few key persons,
PALIqIVOIRE and SODEPALM have agreed to consider plans to decentralize
their management structures. The new structures should allow a de-
centralization of authority and at the same time should assure the
continuity of their management by encouraging promotion from within
the companies. It has been agreed that suitable plans would be
proposed by December 31, 19072 and that they would be implemented before
the closing date of the loans, i.e., within about four and six years
respectively. At the same time, the training of qualified Ivorians,
as required by the previous loans, would be accelerated. The Govern-
ment has also agreed to cooperate with the companies in finding
qualified Ivorian personnel. As in the previous loans, appointments
to key managerial positions will require the approval of the Bank.
20.      The total cost of the project, including taxes, is US$17.6
million of which the foreign exchange component is $11.8 million, or
67 percent of the total. It has been agreed with the cofinancier,
BNDA, that the Bank and BNDA would each cover 40 percent (44 percent
of total project cost net of taxes), with the Bank loan financing ex-
clusively foreign exchange costs. The balance of project costs will
be met, in the case of SODEPALM, by allocations from the Government's
investment budget (BSIE - Budget Special d'Investissement et d'Equi-
pement) and, in -the case of the oil mill, from the self-generated
funds of PALMINDUSTRIE. Because of the relatively strong cash flow
position of the companies, due to their successful operations,
interest will not be capitalized during the grace period. BNDA's
terms follow closely those of the Bank; however, their interest
rate to the Borrowers is expected to be 6 percent.   The following
table shows the financing plan:

21.       As in the first oil palm and coconut project, separate
loans would be made to PALMINDUSTRIE and SODEPALM as follows:
a) US$1.9 million to PALMINDUSTRIE-PALMIVOIRE to
finance the Dabou mill; and
b) US$5 1 million to SODEPALM to finance the- industrial
and outgrower coconut and outgrower oil palm plan-
tations.
The loan to PALMINDUSTRIE would be repaid in 15 years starting in
1975 and that to SODEPALM in 15 years starting in 1977.
22.       With the completion of the present program, the Ivory Coast
would become an exporter of coconut products just as it has already
become a small but growing exporter of palm oil and palm kernels.
Yields from SODEPALY's coconut estates and from the coconut out-
growers' holdings are expected to be excellent by world standards,
and will result in good financial returns to SODEPALI and to the
outgrowers. Oil palm yields in the Ivory Coast, although 20-30 per-
cent lower than those in South-East Asia, are high by West African
standards and will permit a good financial return.
23.       Coconut outgrowers would repay SODEPALMIs loans over a
period of 25 years including a six-year grace period and an interest
rate of 7-1/2 percent, as opposed to 6 percent in the previous loan
for the less productive non-hybrid coconut trees. The interest rate
for oil palm outgrowers will remain at 2 percent as in the previous
loan. The return to the hybrid coconut outgrowers, which in year 8
of the project would be $4.53 per man-day of labor, is much supe-
rior to the return on other agricultural products, including the
return to oil palm outgrowers which would be about $2.50 per man-day.
The higher interest rate charged the hybrid coconut outgrowers would
minimize the income differential between hybrid and other coconut
planters, and between oil palm and coconut planters. The oil palm
outgrowers are charged a comoound interest rate of 2 percent, because
they receive a fixed price for their production that is lower than the
estknatedc market rate.  The lower price means that in effect the outgrower
is presently payin? the equivalent of 9 nercent interest on his debt.
24.       Based on expected world prices for coconut and oil palm
products, as projected in recent Bank studies, the economic rates of
return for the plantations and the oil mill are estimated to be as
follows:
- coconut estates:       18è
- coconut outgrowers:    16è
- oil palm outgrowers:   17è
- palm oil mill:         17%



- 8 -
The present program should result in net annual foreign exchange
earnings to the country of about US$5.8 million by 1983.
25.      The Bank loan will be disbursed for foreign costs which
have been estimated as a percentage of total expenditures for the
various categories of goods, excent in the case of the oil mill equi-
ment for which the Bank will pay 100 percent. In some cases, the
percentage financed by the Bank will be less than actual estimated
foreign cost for the category in question. Some retroactive financing
is included in both loans since planting under the SODEPALM part of
the project began in May,1971, a small amount has been disbursed on
mill equipment,and a further amount of about US$450,ooo, representing
a down-payment of 33 percent for mill equipment may be made before
the end of June.  The mill equipment was ordered and work commenced
on the construction of the mill in order to conmnission it by mid
1972 when additional capacity will be needed in the Dabou area.
26.      The civil engineering for the oil mill will be executed
by PALMINDUSTRIE and financed by PALNINDUSTRIE and BNDA. The mill
equipment, totalling $1,640,oo, will be financed by the Bank and
the major part of it has been procured under an international call
for bids restricted to two suppliers. This departure from the Bank's
customary rules of international competitive bidding was accepted
in recognition of the savings in time and money resulting from
standardization; PALIINDUSTRIE's eight other mills have been equipped
by the two bidders solicited, and no additional mills are expected
to be undertaken for several years to come. The Bank will also
finance the purchase of some vehicles required by PALMINDUSTRIE,
costing about US$0.2 million, which will be subject to the Bank's
normal procurement procedures. Out of the SODEPALIs program of coco-
nut and oil palm plantings, US$1.6 million for the procurement of
fertilizers, insecticides, kilns,some vehicles and wire nets will
be suitable for international competitive bidding. The remaining
expenditures are principally civil works being executed by the
Company itself.
