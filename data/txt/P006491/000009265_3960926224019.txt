MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE CAIXA ECONOMICA FEDERAL
WIIH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A RTO FLOOD RECONSTRUCTION AND PREVENTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Caixa Econ6mica Federal (CEF) (National Savings Bank) of Brazil for
US$175.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan would be
guaranteed by the Federative Republic of Brazil. The proposed loan would
have a term of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate, and would help finance a flood reconstruction and
prevention project in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The project
would be cofinanced in parallel by the CEF with its own resources for
US$190.1 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  In February 1988, unusually heavy rains occurred
within a few days in the Metropolitan Region (MR) of Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil's second-most-important economic pole. In some areas, the
equivalent of three months' annual rainfall fell in less than 24 hours. By
March 10, the flooding and landslides caused by these rains had resulted in
289 deaths, 734 injured, 18,560 homeless, and severe damage to
infrastructure (roads, bridges, canals, dikes, water and sewerage
installations, electric power networks, homes, schools, and health
facilities) and an outbreak of leptospirosis, typhoid, and other gastro-
intestinal diseases. The damage to physical infrastructure severely
disrupted economic activity, particularly in the northern part of the MR,
as well as leaving much of the (predominantly low-income) population in
that area with even more limited access to schools, health facilities, and
basic sanitation, increasing the risk of further epidemics. The total
economic cost of the disaster has been estimated at US$935 million
equivalent, including US$435 million equivalent of lost production, US$400
million equivalent in physical damage, US$50 million equivalent in lost
tourism revenues, and US$50 million equivalent for the clean-up operation
immediately following the disaster.
3.       Immediately following the disaster, the State and municipal
Governments moved quickly to rescue people buried in landslides, reopen
closed transport arteries, and reestablish other essential basic services.
The homeless were sheltered in schools and other public buildings. Urgent
repair and reconstruction of roads, water and sewerage systems, electricity
networks, public buildings, and slope-containment structures have continued
until now, albeit at a rather slow pace, since the state and municipal
governments do not have the funds to pay the contractors who-are doing the
work. On March 30, 1988, the State Governor created an Executive Group for
Reconstruction and Emergency Works (Grupo Executivo para Recuperacgo e
Obras de Emergencia--GEROE) to oversee and coordinate the short-term
disaster-relief activities as well as medium- and longer-term
reconstruction and prevention activities.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Since the MR of Rio de Janeiro is
Brazil's second-most-important economic pole, the Federal, State, and



-2-
municipal goverrrnerts are eager to reestablish economic activity to pre-
flood levels. Yet the State of Rio and the affected municipalities do not
have the financial resources to undertake the necessary reconstruction and
prevention works on their own. The Federal Government is making efforts to
reduce the Federal deficit and is also unable, in the short term, to
provide the level of financial support necessary for an emergency
reconstruction and prevention program. No other ongoing Bank loans have
adequate surplus funds which might be used for the purpose. Federal and
State officials were aware that the Bank had earlier financed an emergency
flood reconstruction loan in the Northeast of Brazil and wished to avail
themselves of the Bank's experience in that and similar projects in other
countries, particularly in areas such as setting priorities,. preparing a
sound program of reconstruction and prevention, and establishing the
institutional structure to coordinate and implement the program.
5.       Proiect Obiectives.  The project's major objectives are (a) to
assist state and municipal authorities in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de
Janeiro in urgent reconstruction and rehabilitation made necessary by the
recent floods and landslides, (b) to implement essential physical works
designed to minimize or prevent future flood damage, and (c) to assist
state and municipal authorities in developing a program and the
institutional capacity to cope better with future emergencies.
6.       Project Description.  The project, to be implemented over a two-
year period, would consist of both reconstruction and preventative
activities. The reconstruction activities consist of rehabilitation and
repair of infrastructure damaged by the floods and accompanying landslides,
while the preventative activities are designed to minimize damage otherwise
likely to occur during any future major rains. Most project components
include both reconstruction and preventative aspects, frequently closely
intertwined. The project would consist of the following components: (a)
repair of roads and bridges (10.31 of the total base cost); (b) repairs and
dredging of drainage systems which were blocked by landslides or by debris
deposited during the flooding, and canalization and dredging of silted-up
drainage systems (45.12); (c) terracing, buttressing, retaining walls, and
other structural stabilization of steep hillsides (16.62); (d) repairs of
sewerage systems, and essential extension of sewerage networks to improve
collection of raw sewage currently draining into existing open waterways
(to minimize health hazards) (7.7Z); (e) improved collection and disposal
of solid wastes (to avoid silting up of drainage systems) (1.9?); (f)
reforestation of steep hillsides most likely to slide (1.9Z); (g) provision
of minimally serviced sites for families whose homes were destroyed during
the floods or landslides, and for families needing to be resettled because
they are presently living in the areas of highest risk or in areas where
flood-prevention works need to be undertaken (9.8S); (h) repairs and
rehabilitation of public buildings (particularly schools, health
facilities, and water-supply installations) damaged in the floods (3.3?);
(i) purchase of imported rescue and salvage equipment needed for local
flood-relief activities (1.7?); (j) consultants' services and technical
assistance (1.1?); and (k) project administration (0.4?). These components
are described at greater length in the attached Technical Annex.
7.       Summary cost estimates and the financing plan are given in
Schedule A. The proposed IBRD loan would finance 502 of total project cost
excluding taxes and items subject to reserved procurement. The IBRD loan



-3-
would be used to finance all components except land for the serviced-sites
component, vehicles produced locally, and project administration. The CEF
would onlend the World Bank loan funds to the State of Rio and to the
Municipality of Rio on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan to
the CEF, plus a spread of 2.0X to cover the CEF's administrative costs.
The State and the Municipality would bear the foreign-exchange risk. The
State of Rio would on-lend part of the funds it borrows from the CEF to the
six other beneficiary municipalities, on the same terms as the CEF loan to
the State, except that the State would bear the accompanying administrative
costs, the foreign-exchange risk, and the commitment fee. The State of Rio
would pass or. the rest of the funds it borrowed from the CEF to the various
State implementing agencies. Retroactive financing up to a total of US$10
million is recommended to cover project expenditures occurring before
signing but after March 14, 1988.
8.       The project would be implemented by existing State and municipal
agencies, including the State Secretariats of Urban Development,
Environment, and Transportatior, and their subsidiary agencies, and
corresponding agencies in the municipalities.   Overall coordination or
project implementation would be the responsibility of GEROE (para. 3). All
civil works would be carried out by private contractors. Procedures and
mechanisms for project implementation, and criteria for specific subproject
appraisal have been set forth in detail in Operational Manuals prepared by
the State and the Muni...ipality of Rio which are acceptable to the Bank.
Amounts and methods of procurement are shown in Schedule B and discussed in
the attached Technical Annex. Amounts of disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are also shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached.
9.       Agreed Actions.  The CEP has agreed to make counterpart funds
available for the project according to an agreed timetable. The State and
the Municipality of Rio have agreed (a) to implement the project in
accordance with the Operational Manuals; (b) to implement financial action
programs designed to improve the State's and the Municipality's financial
situation; (c) to carry out resettlement plans (para. 6[g]) in a manner and
according to a timetable satisfactory to the Bank; and (d) to recover,
either directly or indirectly, all maintenance and operating costs of the
facilities to be built or repaired under the project (with serviced sites
the only exception), such that the project would not increase the budget
deficit of either the State or the Municipality. As conditions of
effectiveness, (a) the State and the Municipality of Rio shall have entered
into a convenio (legal agreement) for purposes of coordinating project
implementation; (b) the CEF shall have entered into subsidiary loan
agreements with the State of Rio and the Municipality of Rio; and (c) the
State of Rio shall have entered into municipal subsidiary loan agreements
providing for at least 75? of all loans to be made under all six municipal
subsidiary loan agreements. As conditions of disbursement (a) for
subprojects under the drainage, sewerage, and solid-waste components, the
State and the Municipality of Rio shall have demonstrated that these
components have undergone an acceptable technical, financial,
institutional, economic, and environmental appraisal; (b) for the serviced-
sites component, the State and the Municipality of Rio shall have amended
their Resettlement Plans in accordance with comments received from the
Bank; (c) for each oi the beneficiary municipalities other than the



Municipality of Rio, the municipality in question shall have concluded an
onlending agreement with the Statel and (d) for the loan in general, after
March 31 of each year, the Bank shall have received evidence (i) that the
State and the Municipality of Rio are in compliance with their obligations
under their parallel loan agreements with the CE7 and (ii) that at least
75Z of the amounts shown in the disbursement schedules of the parallsl
loans has been disbursed during the previous year.
10.      Benefits and Risks.  The project would have immediate economic and
social benefits.  Economic benefits would derive from the -aconstruction
and rehabilitation of infrastructure necessary for the reestablishment of
economic activities which were brought to a halt or seriously hampered by
flood damage. Social benefits would derive from the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of water and sewerage networks, schools, and health
facilities and from the provision of serviced sites for homeless families
and families living in high-risk areas. Longer-term economic and social
benefits would derive from the preventative activities designed to minimize
future flood damage.
11.      Project risks include the followings  (i) Possible difficulties in
coordination among the various agencies and levels of government involved.
This risk has been addressed by the creation of the special coordinating
Secretariat (GEROE) at the State Cabinet level. (ii) The inexperience of
the six smaller beneficiary municipalities (those other than Rio) in
implementing projects of this type and their lack of knowledge of Bank
procedures. This risk has been addressed by the preparation of the
Operational Manual, by the use of legal instruments clearly specifying
obligations and responsibilities, and by technical assistance to be
provided to the municipalities by the State Government. (iii) The apparent
weakness of one of the implementing agencies, the Rio State Housing
Company, which would be responsible for implementing the State's part of
the serviced-sites component. This risk has been addressed in the project
by the reorientation of CEHAB's priorities ind by the creation of a special
ad hoc task force to oversee the timely impltmentation of the component.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satiufled that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agrmcaent of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

RIO FLOOD RECONSTRUCTION AND PREVENTION PROJECT
Timetable of Key Project Processing Events
(a)  Time taken to preparet               Two months
(b)  Prepared by:                         State and Municipality of Rio de Janeiro
(c)  First IBRD mission:                 March 14-23, 1988
(d)  Appraisal mission departure:        May 1, 1988
(e)  Negotiations:                       May 31-June 6, 1988
(f)  Planned date of effectiveness:      August 1, 1988
(g)  List of relevant PCRs and PPARs:   None; however, considerable experience has
been gained under the Northeast Urban Flooc
Reconstruction Project (Loan 2645-BR),
which is nearing completion. The team
responsible for implementing that project
reports that the key problems which they
had to overcome included (a) the
participation of many different agencies,
with few or no established coordinating
mechanisms; (b) the lack of criteria for
choosing the works to be included in the
project; (c) the lack of teams, both at thc
center (a coordinating team) and at the
local level (executing teams); (d) a lack
of knowledge of World Bank requirements an(
procedures; and (e) a lack of the
information systems necessary for efficient
project implementation and management. Thc
Rio Flood Reconstruction and Prevention
Project has been designed-to take these
lessons into account.

BRAZIL
RIO FLOOD RECONSTRUCTION AND PREVENTION PROJECT
A. BACKGROUND
1.       The State of Rio de Janeiro, with an area of 43,000 square
kilometers, has a population of about 12.8 million, of whom some 80? are
concentrated in the 12 municipalities which compose the Metropolitan Region
(MR) of Rio de Janeiro. The MR is Brazil's second-most-important economic
pole and second-largest city, yet one sixth of the MR's families are
classified as living in poverty (less than two minimum salaries per month).
The topography of the MR is characterized by 'a) a narrow coastal strip,
followed in sequence by (b) a narrow coastal mountain range (the Macicos
Litorlneos), (c) a broad, flat lowland area (the Baixada Fluminense), and
(d) a more substantial mountain range (the Serra do Mar). The MR has grown
up along the narrow coastal strip and across the narrow coastal mountain
range, spilling into the lowland area, which is now densely populated by a
predominantly low-income population deprived of access to adequate basic
services. (Population densities in the Baixada Fluminense are 13,500
inhabitants per square kilometer in the Municipality of Sao Jobo de Meriti
and 7,500 in the Municipality of Nil6polis, compared to 4,900 inhabitants
per square kilometer in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro itself.) -This
urban growth has occurred in an uncontrolled fashion, due to unenforced
legislation, intermittent populist policies, and an accelerated weakening
of urban planning-institutions during a decade of economic neglect. In the
process, the original forest cover has been radically cut back, and
squatters have established unplanned human settlements (favelas) which
occupy ever-steeper hillsides, often perching precariously above the city
below. In 1966, there were 0.4 million people living in favelas within the
Municipality of Rio alone (whose population at that time was 3.8 million);
in 1988, however, fully 1.2 million people were living in favelas within
the Municipality of Rio (whose population is now about 6.0 million). This
settlement pattern, combined with annual heavy rains in the summer
(December-March), and years of postponed investments and maintenance,
periodically results in tragedy.
2.       In February 1988, torrential rains fell upon Rio de-Janeiro,
effectively paralyzing the city for several days and engendering landslides
which caused extensive damage to infrastructure and housing. In some
areas, the equivalent of three months' normal rainfall fell in less than 24
hours. This was the heaviest recorded rainfall since 1966 (the last time a
flood disaster occurred in thp MR). The catastrophe came in two waves. On
February 3, 1988, the heaviest rains hit the northern parts of the MR,
particularly the Municipality of Petropolis, which is in the Serra do Mar,
causing flash floods and landslides. Just over two weeks later, on
February 20, the rest of the MR suffered the same fate. Although the
second wave of rains was less heavy, its economic costs were greater, since
the rains and the accompanying floods and landslides interrupted economic
and social activity in the MR during the rains themselves and caused
subsequent disruptions intermittently thereafter, for a total of about six
days altogether.

3.       The total economic cost of the disaster has been estimated at
US$935 million equivalent, which includes US$435 million equivalent of lost
production, US$400 million equivalent in physical damage, US$50 million
equivalent in lost tourism revenues, and US$50 million equivalent for the
clean-up operation immediately following the disaster. Had the second wave
of rains beguu, during the week instead of the weekend, the losses would
have been even greater. By March 10, 1988, the rains and accompanying
flooding and la:dslides had resulted in 289 deaths (most of people who were
trapped in the debris of collapsed buildings and-landslides), 734 injured,
18,560 homeless, and severe damage to infrastructure (roads, bridges,
canals and drainage networks, dikes, water and sewerage networks, electric
power networks, factories, commercial establishments, homes, schools, and
health facilities). The damage to physical infrastructure--disrupted roads
and bridges, flooded or destroyed factories and commercial establishments,
damaged water, sewer, gas, and electric lines--severely disrupted industry
and commerce, particularly in the northern part of the MR. Preliminary
data indicate a drop of 8.3Z in retail activity in February. The Avenida
Brasil, the main highway access to the city and to the international
airport, was interrupted for 25? of-its key traffic time for three weeks
during and after the flood. Some suburban railway lines were blocked for
one week. Drainage networks (which already were burdened with silt and
uncollected solid wastes) were further blocked by debris and garbage washed
down by the rains or deposited by landslides, causing them to overflow and
deposit garbage and raw sewage over much of the Baixada Fluminense,
paralyzing industry, commerce, and all normal activities for about three
days. An additional consequence of the fact that the floodwaters were
contaminated was that there were widespread outbreaks of leptospirosis,
hepatitis, typhoid, and other gastro-intestinal diseases, causing further
deaths and lost production due to illness. This contamination with garbage
and sewage, coupled with the physical damage to health facilities and basic
sanitation networks, leaves much of the (predominantly low-income)
population of the Baixada Fluminense at risk of further epidemics.
4.       In the days immediately following the disaster, the State of Rio
and the affected municipalities put to good use their own funds as well as
the emergency contributions and grants which arrived: roads were reopened,
the injured were dug out from landslides, emergeticy services were restored,
and the homeless were temporarily housed in schools and other public
buildings. The State and municipal governments now intend to begin the
longer, more arduous, and more costly task of rehabilitating the affected
areas of the Metropolitan Region and reestablishing economic activity and
physical infrastructure to their pre-flood levels. The governments are
also eager to undertake preventative measures which would minimize the
effects of the minor flooding which occurs in normal years and the major
disasters which occur about every twenty years. The Government of the
State of Rio and the governments of the affected municipalities do not,
however, have the financial resources to undertake the necessary
reconstruction and prevention works on their own. The Federal Government,
for its part, is making efforts to reduce the Federal deficit and is also
unable to provide the level of financ-ial support necessary for an emergency
reconstruction and prevention program in Rio. For that reason, the State
and Municipal Governments have already sought loans from the Caixa
Economica Federal (CEF) (Natlonal Savings Bank), an official Brazilian
financial agency, to finance some reconstruction and prevention activities,
and the State, Municipal, and Federal Governments have also requested a
loan from the World Bank for the purpose.



- 14 -
5.       The reconstruction and prevention program would include only the
most essential reconstruction activities and the most urgent prevention
activities; in addition, it includes only activities which can be
implemented within a period of two years. The program concentrates on
those sectors which are eminently within the domain of the public sector
(e.g., roods, drainage, waste collection and disposal) and where low-income
populations were most affected (e.g., housing). (Other reconstruction is
taking place in parallel, as higher-income populations have undertaken
reconstruction themselves, financing it with private insurance claims.)
The implementation of the program thus defined is estimated to cost
US$393.6 million equivalent; the costs of the specific components are as
follows:
USS milliotn
Roads and Bridges                              35.8
Drainage Systems                              156.8
Slope Stabilization                            57.8
Sewerage                                       26.8
Solid-Waste Disposal                            6.7
Reforestation                                   6.6
Serviced Sites for Low-Income Families         34.1
Public Buildings                               11.5
Civil-Defense Equipment                         6.0
Technical Assistance                            3.9
Project Administration                          1.4
Total Base Costs                              347.4
Contingencies                                  46.2
Total Project Cost                            393.6
Several of these categories (e.g., repair and expansion of drainage
systems) include both reconstruction and prevention elements; others (e.g.,
public buildings) are only repair/reconstruction; and still others (e.g.,
reforestation) are primarily preventative activities. A more detailed cost
table is set forth in Schedule A.
6.       Since a good part of the severity of the disaster can be
attributed to the fact that unplanned expansion of human settlement had
caused major environmental degradation, the project's preventative elements
have been designed to provide the maximum of environmental protection. The
sewerage and solid-waste-disposal components, for example, would fazilitate
the collection, treatment, and disposal of wastes which would otherwise
accumulate, clogging drainage systems, polluting the air, contaminating
water, and contributing to landslides. The reforestation and slope-
stabilitation components would protect slopes from further erosion.
Finally, the drainage component would consist mainly of canalization and
dredging which would enable existing drainage systems to cope with heavy
rains which will otherwise cause severe flooding.

B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
7.       The Bank's response and strategy has been to (a) assist the
Governments of the State and the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro to identify
and prepare a flood reconstruction and prevention program; (b) ensure that
all activities included in the program are essential reconstruction or
urgent prevention; (c) give priority to components that ensure a quick
resumption of normal economic activity; (d) eliminate components in areas
not affected by the floods or which can not be implemented within two
years; (e) give priority to components which benefit lower-income groups
among the affected population; (f) reduce the vulnerability of the
Metropolitan Region to severe floods; and (g) strengthen the institutional
capacity for disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, and
reconstruction.
8.       The strategy has been designed to provide a quick response to
ensure that Rio de Janeiro's economic activities are restored to pre-flood
levels and that the MR can cope better and suffer less damage in any future
floods. Thus the roads and bridges component aims to repair those roads
and bridges which were badly damaged during the floods, with serious
interruptions of the flow of traffic. The drainage component would clean
and repair canals and dikes which were blocked or damaged during the
floods. The erection of buttresses, earthworks, barriers, and other
stabilization measures on unstable slopes would make areas which are
currently threatened by potential landslides safe for habitation. The
sewerage component would repair networks which were damaged in the flooding
and would also include sewerage works in the Baixada Fluminense, which
suffers from severe drainage problems, since they are a necessary part of
future flood prevention. The sewerage component would also reduce the risk
of contamination of drinking water if future floods should occur. The
collection and disposal of solid wastes would minimize future flooding by
avoiding the clogging up of drainage systems. The reforestation of slopes
unsuitable for habitation would help prevent erosion and future landslides.
The serviced-sites component aims to provide minimally serviced housing
sites to families who either lost their homes during the flooding and
landslides or who need to be resettled, either because they presently live
in very high-risk areas or because they live in areas where necessary
preventative works (dredging, canalization, retaining walls, reforestation)
need to be undertaken. Public buildings, notably schools and health
facilities that were destroyed or damaged by the floods and landslides,
would be repaired or rehabilitated under the program. The State
Secretariat of Civil Defense would be provided with rescue and salvage
equipment unavailable in Brazil so that it would be better prepared to deal
with future flood emergencies. Finally, the project would include
technical assistance so that the State of Rio de Janeiro could prepare a
strategy for avoiding, mitigating, and coping better with future disasters,
so that beneficiary municipalities would be able to implement the project
efficiently, so that communities would be better informed about how to
avoid contributing to the effects of flood emergencies, and so that local
institutions would be able to take actions designed to prevent emergencies
from arising. A detailed description of the various project components is
included in the following section.



- 16 -
C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
9.       The project includes eleven components, as described below:
(a) Road and Bridge Reconstruction (US$40.6 million). This component would
consist of (i) reconstruction, rehabilitation, and repair of about 122
kilometers of roads and 24 bridges destroyed or severely damaged by the
February floods, and (ii) complementary preventative works, comprising
retaining walls and road-related drainage works. All civil works would be
carried out by private contractors and tendered in packages to facilitate
speedy implementation. The Roads Department of the State of Rio de Janeiro
(Departamento de Estradas de Rodagem do Estado do Rio de Janeiro--DER-RJ)
would administer the bulk of the works, with the assistance of consultants
for engineering design and construction supervision. In the Municipality
of Rio, the Municipal Secretariat of Public Works (Secretaria Municipal de
Obras Plblicas) would be responsible for the design and supervision of
works. The other six beneficiary municipalities would oversee the tender
and supervise the repairs to their roads under the guidance of DER-RJ. The
two subcomponents are:
(i) Repaving and Complementary Retaining Walls. Under this
subcomponent, surfacing and drainage of the most badly damaged
streets and feeder roads would be restored. Readily available
materials and proven road-repair techniques would be used, with
asphalt in some cases and cobblestones for the remainder,
depending on the levels of traffic to be sustained and the
existing conditions.
(ii) Bridge Reconstruction. Under this subcomponent, vital
transport links would be restored, one third of which remain
interrupted to vehicular traff'i:, and the remainder dependent upon
temporary structures lent by the Army, which needs them back for
other purposes. The 24 bridges are distributed as follows:
Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, 7; Nova Iguagu, 6; Mage, 2; Duque
de Caxias, 1; Petr6polis, 1; Nil6polis, 1; and State road network,
6.
(b) Drainage Systems (US$177.6 million). This component would include the
repair, rehabilitation, and construction of primary, secondary, and
tertiary drainage systems throughout the project area. The steady
accumulation of debris and garbage in drainage systems over a period of
years had diminished the capacity of the drainage network to deal with
rains, and the flooding and landslides occurring in February aggravated the
situation: canal and river banks were destroyed or severely damaged, and
their channels choked with mud, garbage, and other debris. This component
therefore includes both reconstruction and prevention activities. The
priorities for dredging and canalization to be included in the project have
been selected by technical specialists in this area, on the basis of such
criteria as the degree of vulnerability determined by the extent of damage
incurred and population density. Some 14 drainage basins which drain the
most flood-prone areas were affected. In these basins, the component would
(a) repair damage by dredging the canals and rivers blocked by debris
accumulated by the rains, and (b) canalize sections of rivers (0.3-4.7
kilometers in length) with retaining walls to ensure efficient discharges



_ 17 -
in the future. In a typical river basin (Bacia do Valao Guanabara), about
40Z of the component costs are due to dredging and about 602 to
canalization. The implementing agencies, which would tender the work out
to private contractors, would be the Municipal Secretariat of Public Works
in the case of the Municipality of Rio and the State Superintendency of
Rivers and Lakes (Superintendgncia Estadual de Rios e Lagoas--SERLA) in the
case of the other municipalities. Disruption of existing populations would
be minimized, but, to allow the work and subsequent maintenance to proceed,
some families would have to relocated. They would be offered serviced
sites under the project's low-income housing sites component (para. 9[g]).
Perimeter enclosures would be built around areas where canalization and
drainage works have been done to prevent future resettlement. The carrying
out an an acceptable technical, financial, institutional, economic, and
environmental appraisal acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of
disbursement for subprojects under this component.
(c) Slope Stabilization (US$65.4 million). This component would consist of
clearing debris and preventing further landslides in 80 favelas in Rio de
Janeiro through (a) removing or securing rock formations made unstable by
the rains; (b) providing drainage channels on hillsides to prevent further
erosion; (c) building retaining walls to buttress the slopes; (d) building
barriers against future avalanches; and (e) planting vegetation. The State
and the Municipality of Rio have confirmed that they have legal title to at
least 75Z of all land needed for this component. Again, disruption would
be minimized, but some families living in high-risk sites would have to be
moved and provided with serviced sites under the serviced-sites component
(para. 9[g]) to allow the work to proceed. The sites where slope
stabilization is needed have been identified by the State Civil Defense
Secretariat (Secretaria de Defesa Civil) with the assistance of a qualified
geologistlexpert in slope-stabilization works and by the Municipal
Secretariat of Public Works' Geological Service (a well-staffed unit with
at least 20 years of experience, established when the Municipality of Rio
was the State of Guanabara). All works would be carried out by private
contractors. The State Public Works Company (EmDresa de Obras P6blicas-
-EMOP) would be the implementing agency for the State and the Municipal
Secretariat of Public Works for the Municipality of Rio. Although most of
the proposed works would be done on public lands, there are cases where the
works envisaged would be on land currently in private hands. Legal
instruments exist to ensure full cost recovery by the public authorities of
any works undertaken in such cases. Related to this component, and
included under the project's technical-assistance component (Part E), would
be the preparation of a comprehensive, detailed, integrated, longer-term
development plan for slope stabilization in the State of Rio.
(d) Sewerage (US$30.4 million). This component would consist of the
installation of 14,630 house connections, 370 kilometers of sewers, five
pumping stations, and treatment facilities (oxidation ponds) in three low-
lying poorer municipalities in the Baixada Fluminense. Flood waters in
February 1988 were heavily polluted by ra-t uncollected sewage accumulated
in open drainage .channels, creating serious public-health problems. The
State Water and Sewerage Company (Comnpanhia Estadual de Agua e Esgotos-
-CEDAE) would be the implementing agency. The carrying out an an
acceptable technical, financial, institutional, economic, and environmental
appraisal acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of disbursement for
subprojects under this component.



- 18 -
(e) Soliij-:^ott  lisiossl (UtS7.6 million).  This component would consist of
the constructic.n of silx composting plants (total capacity: 80 tons per
hour), the provision of 149 trucks and other vehicles (not financed from
the Bank loan) to be used for solid-waste collection, and the provision of
technical assistsnce for municipalities to improve their management of
solid-waste collection from areas made hazardous by indiscriminate garbage
disposal. Misplaced and uncollected garbage (presently 3,400 tons per day
in the MR) was raw material for avalanches in some favelas, burying homes,
with loss of life; in addition, the inappropriate disposal of solid wastes
in canals and rivers aggravated the flooding. To prevent such consequences
from reoccurring, this component would (a) increase quantities collected in
these areas and (b) improve local solid-waste management by providing
technical assistance to local communities. Local municipalities would be
responsible for this component under the guidance of the State Secretariat
of Urban and Regional Development (Secretaria de Desenvolvimento Urbano e
Regional--SEDUR). The carrying out an an acceptable technical, financial,
institutional, economic, and environmental appraisal acceptable to the Bank
would be a condition of disbursement for subprojects under this component.
(f) Reforestation (US$7.5 million) would be done on an emergency basis to
stabilize 30 of the most unstable slopes (1,200 hectares total) for which
more costly engineering solutions are not needed. The State and the
Municipality of Rio have confirmed that they have legal title to at least
752 of all land needed for this component. For earliest effect, grown
saplings would be planted, the costs of which have been fully accounted for
by the project. A few families would have to be resettled so that
reforestation can take place; they would be provided with minimally
serviced sites under the serviced-sites component (para. 9[g]). The
implementing agency would be the State Secretariat of the Environment
(Secretaria do Meio Ambiente--SEMA) through its Forestry Institute
(Instituto Estadual de Florestas--IEF). Related to this component, and
included under the project's technical-assistance component (Part E), would
be the preparation of a comprehensive, detailed, integrated, longer-term
development plan for preventative reforestation in the State of Rio.
(g) Serviced Sites for Low-Income Families (US$38.7 million). This
component would consist of the provision of 11,000 minimally serviced lots
ranging from 40 to 70 square meters for (a) about 1,120 low-income families
made homeless by the floods; (b) 8,280 families relocated through civil
works (drainage, slope stabilization, and reforestation), and (c) 1,600
families in high-risk areas. Those families in the latter two categories
would be resettled according to detailed resettlement plans, one for the
State's part of this component and one for the Municipality's part, which
have been prepared by the authorities of the State and Municipality, in
consultation with the affected families, and have been reviewed by the
Bank. It would be a condition of disbursement for this component that the
State and the Municipality have amended their respective resettlement plans
to incorporate the comments received from the Bank. The State and the
Municipality have agreed to carry out the amended resettlement plans in a
manner and according to timetables acceptable to the Bank. The State and
the Municipality of Rio have confirmed that they have legal title to at
least 752 of all land needed for this component. The component would be
implemented by the State Low-Income Housing Company (Companhia Estadual de
Habitaclo--CEHAB) and the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Urban Development



- 19 -
Company (Empresa Municipal de Urbanizacao do Rio de Janeiro--RIO-URBE),
responsible for 362 and 642 of the component, respectively. CEHAB has an
adequate number of staff and ample technical experience to implement the
works envisaged, but by appraisal it had not yet mobilized to deal with the
flood emergency. For this reason, SEDUR has established a special ad hoc
task force reporting directly to the Secretary of Urban and Regional
Development to monitor the implementation of the State's part of the
resettlement component and advise the Secretary on the measures he should
take to ensure the timely implementation of the component. Beneficiaries
would be selected from (a) lists of victims made homeless by the flood
verified by local community associations and (b) information provided by
implementing agencies of civil works about displaced families. In
addition, only families with incomes under US$200 equivalent per month
(five minimum salaries) would be eligible to receive a serviced site under
this component. Beneficiaries could apply to the CEF (para. 4) for
mortgages. (Housing loans would not be included under the project). Land
is already available to begin developing 652 of the municipal program.
Homeless families outside the Municipality of Rio are being taken care of
through a program already being implemented. All beneficiaries of this
program would have unrestricted title to the land.
(h) Public Buildings and Installations (US$13.0 million). This component
would consist of the rehabilitation and repair of schools, other public
buildings, and water-supply installations.
(i) Schools. This subcomponent would consist of the repair and
rehabilitation of 126 municipal and state schools partially-
destroyed by the flood. The damage has been fully inventoried by
the municipalities. The implementation of the subcomponent would
allow the full resumption of the public-education program, which
is still partially paralyzed. Speedy reconstruction of the
schools would be assured through grouping contracts into packages,
to the extent possible. For the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro,
the Municipal Secretariat of Public Works would be implementing
agency; for the State's part of the component, the implementing
agency would be the State Public Works Company (EMOP). All works
would be done by private contractors.
(ii) Other Public Buildings. This subcomponent would consist of
the reconstruction of health facilities and civil-defense
installations destroyed by the flood. Implementation would be as
for the previous subcomponent.
(iii) Water-Supply Installations. This subcomponent would include
civil works to repair damage done by the flood and preventative
works to protect Rio de Janeiro's principal pumping station, 16
small reservoirs under threat, and eight key sections of main
water-supply pipes that risk being destroyed by future landslides.
The State Water and Sewerage Company (CEDAE) would be the
implementing agency.
(i) Civil Defense (US$6.8 million). This component would consist of the
acquisition of 21 pieces of rescue and salvage equipment not produced in
Brazil for the State Civil Defense Secretariat, such as amphibious trucks,
mobile heavy-duty cranes, salvage and lighting trucks, and mobile high-
performance pumps, to allow the Secretariat to deal better with flood-
related emergencies for which it is presently under-equipped.



- 20 -
(j) Technical Assistance and Studies (USS4.4 million). This component is
described in Part E.
(k) Proiect Administration (USS1.6 million). This component is described
in para. 10.
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
10.      Organization.  Project implementation would be coordinated by an
Executive Group for Reconstruction and Emergency Works (the Grupo Executivo
para Recuneracao e Obras de Emeraencia) (GEROE1). GEROE is a special, non-
permanent agency created by Decree No. 11.131 of March 30, 1988, and
reports directly to the Governor of the State of Rio. GEROE is headed by a
Special Secretary and and includes a Sub-Secretary of Programming, a Sub-
Secretary of Coordination, and Technical Coordinators in the areas of
hydrology, basic sanitation, geology (i.e., landslide control),
transportation, housing, urban reconstruction, and ecology. GEROE's
activities would be guided by a Consultative Group composed of the State
Secretaries of Planning, Urban and Regional Development, Environment,
Transportation, and Finance. GEROE would also be assisted in its
activities by a Coordinating Committee headed by the Sub-Secretary of
Coordination and including a representative of the mayor of each of the
beneficiary municipalities. Within the Municipality of Rio, project
implementation would be coordinated by the Municipal Secretariat of
Planning (Secretaria Municipal de Planeiamento), under the overall
supervision of GEROE. The State of Rio and the Municipality of Rio have
submitted a draft convenio between them, acceptable to the Bank, which
covers such topics as mutual exchange of information and periodic
consultation on technical norms, costs, priorities, and the pace of project
implementation; the signature of the convQnio would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
11.      The project would be implemented by existing State agencies,
including the Secretariat of Planning (SECPLAN), the Secretariat of Urban
and Regional Development (SEDUR), the Secretariat of the Environment
(SEMA), the Public Works Company (EMOP), the Superintendency of Rivers and
Lakes (SERLA), the Water and Sewerage Company (CEDAE), the State Roads
Department (DER-RJ), the State Low-Income Housing Company (CEHAB), and the
Secretariat of Civil Defense--and by similar existing agencies in the
beneficiary municipalities, in particular in the Municipalities of Rio and
Petr6polis. The capacity of all agencies involved in the project to
implement their respective project components was evaluated during
appraisal and was judged satisfactory, with the possible exception of
CEHAB, for which special corrective action (para. 9tg]) has been taken.
GEROE has established an information system for monitoring the physical and
financial progress of each component. Bank supervision missions would
review physical and financial implementation on a selective basis.
12. -   The State and the Municipality of Rio have prepared identical
Operational Manuals setting forth procedures and mechanisms for project
implementation (including the details of GEROE's information system,
procurement procedures, and accounting, auditing, and reporting



- 21 -
requirements) and criteria for specific subproject selection and appraisal.
The Operational Manuals have been reviewed Dy Bank staff, and
recommendations for modifications and additional sections have been
incorporated, such that the Manuals are now satisfactory to the Bank.
13.      Financing.  The Caixa Economica Federal (CEF) (para. 4) of Brazil
would be the Borrower. The CEF would on-lend the World Bank loan funds to
the State of Rio and to the Municipality of Rio under subsidiary loan
agreements acceptable to the Bank, which provide that the onlending terms
would be the same as those of the Bank loan to the CEF, plus a spread of
2.0Z to cover the CEF's administrative costs. The signing of the
subsidiary loan agreements would be a condition of loan effectiveness. The
loans to the State and Municipality would be in cruzados, but the repayment
terms would be denominated in the World Bank's basket of currencies, such
that the State and Municipality would in fact bear the foreign-exchange
risk.
14.      The State of Rio would pass on part of the funds borrowed from the
CEF to-the various State implementing agencies.- The State of Rio would on-
lend the rest of the funds borrowed from the CEF to the six other
beneficiary municipalities under subsidiary loan agreements acceptable to
the Bank, which provide that the onlending terms would be the same as those
of the CEF's loan to the State, except that the State would not charge the
six municipalities for the accompanying administrative costs, the foreign-
exchange risk, and the commitment fee. The principal of the sub-loans
would be adjusted for inflation using the OTN. It would be a condition of
loan effectiveness that the State have signed subsidiary loan agreements
with the municipalities providing for at least 75Z of the value of the
funds to be on-lent to the six municipalities. In addition, it would be a
condition of disbursement in each Municipality that the Municipality have
signed a subsidiary loan agreement with the State.
15.      Financing Plan.  The project would be financed as shown in the
following table (a more detailed financing plan is shown in Schedule A):
USS million

The proposed Bank loan of US$175.0 million equivalent would finance 50Z of
the estimated total project cost, net of taxes and duties (estimated at
US$40.0 million) and net of items subject to reserved procurement (US$3.6
million equivalent). The proposed Bank loan would oe used to finance parts
of all components except land for the serviced-sites component, vehicles
| ~~produced locally, and project administration. As shown, the CEF would
cofinance the project with US$190.1 million equivalent of its own resources
to the financing plan, under a number of loans for the roads and bridges,
drainage, sewerage, and slope-containment components. Since the CEF's
contributions to the financing plan account for almost 50? of the plan, and
since they are larger than the Bank's loan, it is crucial that the CEF's
contributions be available for the purposes of the project and be disbursed

on schedule. The CEF has agreed to make available cumulative totals of
US$57 million equivalent by August 31, 1988, US$114 million equivalent by
October 31, 1988, and US$190.1 million equivalent by December 31, 1988. In
addition, it would be a condition of disbursement, for the loan in general,
after March 31 of each year, that the Bank have received evi'ence (i) that
the State and the Municipality of Rio are in compliance with their
obligations under their parallel loan agreements with the CEF and (ii) that
at least 752 of the amounts shown in the disbursement schedules of the
parallel loans has been disbursed during the previous year.
16.      The Financial Situation of the State of Rio de Janeiro.  The
financial situation of the State of Rio de Janeiro will depend not only on
the State's own fiscal effort but also on the impact of the extensive
fiscal reform recently enacted by Brazil's Constitutional Convention. The
State has initiated--and has agreed to carry out, in a manner and according
to a timetable acceptable to the Bank--an aggressive State Financial Action
Program to improve its financial position by increasing State revenues and
reducing non-essential expenditures by means of specific actions, including
implementation of full cost recovery for water su'rply and sewerage services
in compliance with the National Tariff Law, the introduction of user
charges for solid-waste removal, and improvements in the collection of the
value-added tax (ICM). The goal of its Secretariat of Finance is to raise
revenues from the value-added tax by 5O0 over 1987 levels by 1989 through
increased used of computers and more efficient collection procedures. If
achieved, ICM revenues would be US$650 million equivalent higher in 1980
than in 1987. In its first quarter, this program increased total ICM
revenues by 27?, even with a downturn in economic activity of about 5?.
The State Government has also raised user charges at rates considerably
above inflation. Salaries of State civil servants have been cut by over
472 in real terms, producing a savings of approximately US$190 million
equivalent for 1988. The State Government has submitted to the-Bank a
detailed analysis with financial projections of the impact of these
measures and of the fiscal (revenue-sharing) reform soon to take effect.
These simulations show a total revenue increase attributable to the reform
of 242 for the State, due to an increase of 22? in tax revenues of the
State and a 35? increase in transfers from the Federal Government. The
fusion of five previously separate taxes vith the ICM in this reform,
together with the increased tax-collection effort, will greatly facilitate
reaching the goal of a 502 increase in ICM revenues.
17.      The total debt of the State of Rio was US$1.9 billion equivalent
at the end of 1987, of which US$1.0 billion equivalent was for the subway
system (metro). Negotiatiocis are currently underway with the Federal
Government to see if a solution can be found for the metrO debt. The
preliminary simulations done by the State and submitted to the Bank show
that the State's increased fiscal effort, combined with the fiscal reform,
should give the State a surplus of US$474 million equivalent in 1989. to
make loan payments, operate and maintain the facilities built or repaired
under the project, and make new investments, if the State is successful in
passing a part of the metrO debt to the Federal Government and rolling over
80? of the rest of the debt. The simulations also show that the surplus
will rise to US$632 million equivalent by 1991. The amount necessary to
amortize debts to the CEF for any one year should never exceed US$40
million.

18.      The Financial Situation of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro.
The Municipality of Rio has embarked on--and has agreed to carry out, in a
manner and according to a timetable acceptable to the Bank--an energetic
Municipal Financial Action Program to increase Municipal revenues and
reduce non-essential expenditures, especially salaries of municipal civil
servants, by means of specific actions including an evaluation of the
Municipal budgeting and accounting system, the revaluation of property-tax
assessments to reflect more closely the real value of properties, measures
to improve tax collection, and adjustments of tariffs and user charges to
recover the full cost of services. The improved efficiency in tax
collection for the urban real estate tax (ITPU) and the service tax (ISS),
increases in service charges, and better debt collection increased total
revenue by US$101 million equivalent (98Z) for the first quarter 1987/88.
The Municipal Government has submitted to the Bank a detailed analysis with
financial projections of the impact of (a) the measures it has taken to
increase revenues and control expenditures and (b) the fiscal (revenue-
sharing) reform soon to take effect. The simulations of the effect of the
revenue-sharing reform show that total current revenues of the Municipality
of Rio de Janeiro should increase by 26Z, due to a 15X increase in its own
tax revenues and a 42Z increase in total transfers from the State and
Federal Governments. Even so, the Municipality should show an operating
deficit of US$114 million equivalent in 1988. However, the Municipality
projects that its increased fiscal effort and the fiscal reform wil; boost
total current revenues by about 40%, or US$230 million equivalent, over the
period 1987-1989. The simulations of the Municipality show that the
projected total of US$75 million equivalent in 1989 available to make loan
payments, maintain new facilities, or make new investments will rise to
US$114 million equivalent by 1991. There should be, then, no problem in
paying back the CEF, as combined annual payments should not exceed US$15
million in any one year.
19.      Cost Recovery.  Mechanisms for cost recovery for the various
activities foreseen under the-project have been elaborated in detail by the
State and the Municipality of Rio and would be either direct (e.g., water
tariffs, garbage-collection tariffs) or indirect, through increases in
general revenues (through both improved collection and revaluation, to the
extent possible)(e.g., property and gasoline taxes). In view, however, of
the losses incurred by some target households and in view of the fact that
some families would be resettled involuntarily, the State and Municipal
authorities propose to grant title to plots with minimal services to such
families and to subsidize the cost fully (in the case of the State) and
partially (in the case of the Municipality). The State and the
Municipality have each submitted an analysis of the effect of this subsidy
for land and basic infrastructure on the finances of the State and
Municipal governments; the analyses demonstrate that the impact, in each
case, would be negligible. Loans for housing construction would not be
included in the project, as they would be available directly from the CEF
to eligible beneficiaries. With housing sites the only exception, the
State and the Municipality of Rio have agreed that all other costs would be
fully recovered, either directly or indirectly, such that the project would
therefore not increase the budget deficit of either the Municipality of Rio
or the State of Rio.

20.      Procurement.  Procurement would be carried out following the World
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement of May 1985. In general, international
competitive bidding (ICB) would be required as the basis for awarding
contracts for civil works and equipment. The total value of civil-works
contracts to be awarded on the baais of ICD Is estimated at US$129.2
million equivalent; the total value of equipment contracts, US$6.8 million
equivalent. Local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the
Bank which would allow interested foreign contractors to participate if
they so wished could be used to award civil-works contracts of US$4.0
million equivalent or less but more than US$25,000 equivalent. The total
value of civil-works contracts to be awarded on the basis of LCB is
estimated at US$230.0 million equivalent. Civil-works contracts estimated
to cost US$25,000 equivalent or less could be awarded on the basis of
quotations from at least three qualified bidderst the total value of civil-
works contracts to be awarded on this basis is estimated at US$5.0 million
equivalent. Civil works located within a reasonably confined area would be
packaged to the extent possible to facilitate bidding and implementation.
The State and the Municipality of Rio have submitted detailed draft bidding
documents for equipment and civil-works contracts to be procured under ICB
procedures and for civil-works contracts to be procured under LCB
procedures. Bank review of bidding documents, awards, and contracts would
be carried out for all ICB procurement. The Bank would also exercise prior
review, irrespective of the amount, of the first five contracts to be
awarded using LCB under each component. In the review by sampling, if the
Bank determined that procurement had been inconsistent with agreed
procedures, no expenditures for such items would be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan, and the Bank would cancel a corresponding amount of
the Loan. Consultants and technical assistants would be hired according to
the World Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants of August 1981. The
total value of contracts for consultants and technical assistants is
estimated at US$4.4 million equivalent.
21.      Implementation and Disbursements.  The project ia expected to be
implemented in two years. Disbursements would continue for a further six
months. Retroactive financing up to a total of US$10 million is proposed
to cover expenditures for reconstruction activities made before signing but
after March 14, 1988, the date when the first Bank mission for this project
arrived in Rio. The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against
eligible expenditures as follows: civil works for the serviced-sites
component - 802 of total expenditures; other civil works to be implemented
by the Municipality of Rio - 50Z of total expenditures; other civil works
to be implemented by the State and the other six municipalities - 401 of
total expenditures; equipment - 1002 of foreign expenditures; and technical
assistance - 100Z of total expenditures. Payments against civil-works
contracts of less than US$0.5 million equivalent would be made on the basis
of Statements of Expenditures. All other payments would be made agailst
full documentation.
22.      Accounts.  A Special Account would be established in U.S. dollars
in the Central Bank with an initial deposit of US$22.5 ='illion, equivalent
to about four months of expenditures. A Project Account would be
established in an official or commercial bank acceptable to the World Bank
and operated by GEROE. GEROE would certify statements of expenditures and
would make supporting documentation available to Bank supervision missions.



- 25 -
23.      Audits.  All project accounts, including the Special Account, the
Project Account, and the Statements of Expenditures, would be audited
annually be independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. These reports
would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end of
the (Brazilian) fiscal year.
24.      Reporting.  GEROE would require ronthly reports from each of the
implementing agencies and in turn would submit quarterly reports on project
implementation to the World Bank. GEROE would also prepare and submit a
Project Completion Report within six months of the Closing Date.
E. STUDIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
25.      For the State of Rio, given the density of population living in
proximity to potential hazards, GEROE would coordinate the preparation, by
technical assistants, of an in-depth civil-defense plan for the Greater
Metropolitan Region, covering different types of possible disasters
including floods, landslides, fires in high-rise buildings, toxic-waste
spillage, etc. The study would discuss, inter alia, such topics as
assessment of risks and vulnerability to disasters, proposed physical and
institutional arrangements to prevent disasters and/or minimize damage and
reduce risks, institutional preparedness for response to disasters, multi-
agency coordination, reconstruction mechanisms, and financing sources. It
is hoped that the study will be useful, not only to the MR of Rio, but to
other Metropolitan Regions which face similar potential for disasters. In
addition, technical assistance would be provided to prepare a detailed
medium- and long-term reforestation plan (para. 9[f]) for the State of Rio
de Janeiro including (i) a discussion of the technical, financial, and
institutional aspects of the program, (ii) the technical criteria used to
justify the areas selected as ones of high risk of landslides, (iii) a
description of the State Secretariat of the Environment and its technical
and institutional capacity to implement the program, (iv) proposed
arrangements for protecting the reforested areas (in particular, for
keeping squatters out), (v) a discussion of land tenure issues (if any),
and (vi) a schedule for implementing the program. Technical assistance
would also be provided to the State of Rio to prepare a similar medium- and
long-term program for slope containment (para. 9[c]) in the State of Rio.
Finally, technical assistance would also be provided to the State of Rio to
(a) prepare and implement a program to improve the management of solid
waste; (b) prepare and implement a program in environmental education; and
(c) prepare and implement a program to strengthen the fiscal administration
of the beneficiary municipalities (other than the Municipality of Rio).
26.      For the Municipality of Rio, technical assistance would be
provided to undertake educational programs in the following areas: (a)
proper handling and disposal of solid waste; (b) safe methods of low-cost
housing construction using self-help methods; (c) prevention of
reoccupation of hazardous sites; and (d) forestry protection. Technical
assistance would also be provided to the Municipality of Rio to carry out
programs for (e) the inspection and control of illegal and informal mineral
exploration and (f) the strengthening of the fiscal administration of the
Municipality of Rio.



- 26 -
27.      The Rio authorities have submitted, for each of the studies or
tasks to be carried out by technical assistants during project
implementat.Won, (i) the terms of reference for each study or task, (ii) the
agency responsible for carrying out the study or task, (iii) the number of
experts needed, (iv) their levels of qualification, (v) to whom within the
agency in question they would report, (vi) the duration of each assignment,
(vii) the approximate cost of each study or task (number of experts times
months time cost per man-month), and (viii) the proposed date to begin each
study or task, and the schedule for implementing it.
F. AGREEMENTS REACHED
28.      The CEF has agreed to make counterpart funds available for the
project according to an agreed timetable (para. 15). The State and the
Municipality of Rio have agreed to (a) implement the resettlement plans in
