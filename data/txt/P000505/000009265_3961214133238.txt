IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF CHAD
TRANSPORT SECTOR ADJUSTMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 2007-CD
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Transport Sector Adjustment
Project in Chad, for which Credit 2007-CD in the amount of SDR 45.4 million (US$66.09 million
equivalent) was approved on April 25, 1989 and made effective on December 20, 1989.
The Credit was closed on June 30, 1995 following an extension from the original closing
date of June 30, 1994. The Credit was fully disbursed. Final disbursement took place on
November 2, 1995.
The ICR was prepared by Gerard Tenaille, Consultant, under the responsibility of the
Infrastructure Division, Central Africa and Indian Ocean Department. It is based on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement and additional clauses to the Agreement and materials in
the project file. The Borrower and donors provided comments that are included in the annexes of
this ICR.

TRANSPORT SECTOR ADJUSTMENT PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Credit 2007-CD
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Transport Sector Adjustment Project (TSAP) was defined during a donors' meeting
held in N'Djamena on February 9-12, 1988 (para. 1). IDA then had two operations under way in
the transport sector: (i) the Road Maintenance Project (Cr. 1728-CD, SDR 17.1 million, 1986);
and (ii) the Road Reconstruction Project (Cr. 1901-CD, SDR 34.4 million, 1988) (para. 2).
Project Objectives
2.    The main objectives of the project were to: (a) reorganize the transport sector's public
institutions and implement this reorganization with the help of a newly created Interministerial
Project Monitoring and Coordination Unit (IPMCU); (b) promote liberalization measures in the
transport sector;  (c) enhance the development of the private sector in road works and
construction materials production; (d) rehabilitate 1,800 km of the priority road network with the
assistance of several cofinanciers; and (e) reduce the cost of transportation and improve financial
resource mobilization for funding road maintenance (para. 3).
3.    These objectives were too ambitious for a country which had just emerged from many
years of war, and where the Chadian Haulier's Cooperative (Cooperative des Transporteurs
Tchadiens) held an absolute monopoly of transport services.
Execution and results
4.    The results of the project differed markedly across components: the sector policy
component was a good achievement, but the physical accomplishments fell short of project
targets.
5.    The institutional component was the essential foundation of this sector adjustment project,
and most of its objectives were achieved or even exceeded. The various liberalization measures
taken in the transport sector, which consisted mainly of the abolition of the monopoly of transport
services, removal of Government control on freight tariffs; and the liquidation of the National
Office (OFNAR) responsible for road maintenance under force account, will have lasting
beneficial effects on the organization and cost of land transport. The merging of the two
ministries in charge of transport operations: Ministry of Public Works (MTP) and Ministry of
Transports and Civil Aviation (MTAC), the reorganization of their services, the contracting out of



iii
road maintenance activities to the private sector and to the two newly created local enterprises for
public works and road maintenance (SNER and ETTP) to be privatized, represent undeniable
achievements, which will likely be sustainable. Only the rehabilitation of Air Tchad was a total
failure (para. 12).
6.    In the Credit, a contribution to the Adjustment Program was included (US$21 million) to
be disbursed in several tranches. Only part of the first tranche was disbursed, and at the
Government's request, the balance of the contribution (US$15.5 million) has been transferred to
the investment component of the TSAP. Even so, accomplishment of the project's physical
objectives was impeded by several factors:
(a)   delays in the execution of road rehabilitation works caused by the slow
implementation of financial commitments of the various other donors resulting in:
(i)    a cost increase of the regular maintenance;
(ii)   an increase in the financial assistance provided by IDA.
(b)   the length of road rehabilitated had to be brought from 1,800 km down to 1,500
km because of financing constraints (para. 22);
(c)   about US$3 million of Credit 2007-CD had to be used to complete works
scheduled under Credit 1901-CD (para. 24); and
(d)   the N'Djamena urban roads component cost more, US$18.9 million as compared
with the estimated US$8.5 million (para. 25).
7.    The different points noted above caused the project to accomplish less rehabilitation of
roads than was envisioned at the appraisal stage (para. 40).  This was confirmed during
preparation of the ongoing Second Transport Sector Project (Credit 2520-CD, para. 41).
8.    Aside from the underestimation of the costs during preparation of the project, and the
absence of performance monitoring indicators in the Memorandum to the President's Report
which could have contributed to improve the Borrower's performance, the Bank's performance
can be considered satisfactory (paras. 35 and 37).
9.    The Borrower's performance was satisfactory as regards the institutional reforms.
Unfortunately, the Government was unable to provide the local counterpart funding, as of 1992,
even though this was limited to 5% of the cost of the works (para. 38). The IPMCU did not
prepare the quarterly progress reports on the Transport Sector Investment Program, as of March
1991. This meant that the Project was being executed without taking into account the priorities
and the constraints of the overall program. Finally, the construction work for the ministry
building suffered four years' delay, because of a disagreement in the procurement procedures
between IDA and, the Borrower on the architectural contract, which was finally settled with the
intervention of an external consultant (para. 39).



iv
10.   The outcome of the project can be rated satisfactory (para. 40).
Conclusions, Future Operation and Major Lessons
11.   Future operations in the transport sector should take into account the problems
encountered, in particular, close coordination with other donors, counterpart funding and
budgetary allocation for regular road maintenance. The Second Transport Sector Project
(Cr. 2520-CD), under implementation, is financing a road rehabilitation program and periodic
maintenance on the priority network. A Road Maintenance Fund (Compte Autonome d'Entretien
Routier, CAER) has been set up and is providing adequate financing for the routine maintenance
(para. 41). Although counterpart funding has improved, there is still a need for close monitoring.
12.   The main lesson to be drawn from the project is that road maintenance is very costly and
that owing to the country's limited financial capabilities, judicious selection of priorities during the
Public Expenditure Review must be established taking into consideration the need to carry out
periodic maintenance to avoid costly rehabilitation. It must therefore be admitted that for some
more years to come, an important part of the external assistance received will have to be allocated
to periodic road maintenance and road rehabilitation (para. 42).
11.   From the satisfactory execution of the project we can conclude that:
a)    The creation of an Interministerial Monitoring Committee, combined with an
Interministerial Project Monitoring and Coordination Unit (IPMCU) with the
support of an appropriate Technical Assistance was a good concept that addressed
institutional problems, political reforms and infrastructure needs, and increased the
role of the transport sector at the national level with the assistance of the Ministry
of Finances.
b)    Donors need to coordinate more closely on their input into the Sector Investment
Program, in particular its implementation and the technical and financial
implications.
c)    The Credit Agreement should require that management and technical personnel to
remain in place until the project is completed, in order to assure continuity.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF CHAD
TRANSPORT SECTOR ADJUSTMENT PROJECT
Credit 2007-CD
Part I: Perfornance Assessment
Introduction
1.    The Transport Sector Adjustment Project (TSAP) was defined in February 1988 during a
donors' meeting held in N'Djamena, at which the Government presented its development strategy
for the transport sector and the investment program for 1988-93.
2.    At that time, IDA had two operations under way in the transport sector: (i) the Road
Maintenance Project (Credit 1728-CD, SDR 17.1 million, 1986); and (ii) the Road
Reconstruction Project (Credit 1901-CD, SDR 34.4 million, 1988). These two projects were
successfully implemented and the two credits concerned were closed on June 30, 1990 and
December 31, 1991, respectively.
A. STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.    The main objectives of the project were as follows:
(a)   to reorganize the sector's public institutions, i.e., the Ministry of Public Works
(MTP) and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (MTAC), and to establish
an Interministerial Project Monitoring and Coordination Unit (IPMCU) as
conditions for Board presentation. The Project also included restructuring of the
Office National des Routes (OFNAR), Laboratoire National du Batiment et des
Travaux Publics (LNBTP) and of Air Tchad;
(b)   to promote liberalization measures in the transport sector, by abolishing the
monopoly held by the Cooperative des Transporteurs Tchadiens (CTT), and
establishing a Bureau National de Fr8t (BNF), and removal of Government control
on freight tariffs;
(c)   to enhance private sector development in road construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance, and also in construction materials production through privatization of
the Mani quarry, then state-owned through the Office National des Carrieres
(OFCA); the latter point was a condition for effectiveness of the IDA credit;
(d)   to complete, by the end of 1993, the rehabilitation of the priority road network of
3,800 km, about half of which had already been rehabilitated during past projects.



2
(IDA credit and the OPEC loan administered by IDA were to finance the
rehabilitation of 653 km, covering the Mongo-Oum Hajjer and Mongo-Oum
Timam sections; the rest of the 1,800 km was to be covered by cofinancing from
the EDF, the Federal Republic of Germany, USAID, ADF and BDEAC). In
addition, the project included the rehabilitation of 14 km of urban roads in
N'Djamena and construction or rehabilitation of MTPT buildings in N'Djamena
(the capital) as well as Sahr, Moundou and Abeche; and
(e)   as economic and financial objectives, to reduce transport costs and prices in Chad
and improve financial resource mobilization for the transport sector, in order to
assure the financing of road maintenance.
4.    The institutional objectives were realistic; they were mostly achieved, except for the
rehabilitation of Air Tchad and for having half of all road maintenance work done by private
contractors which proved to be unattainable. The physical objectives were too ambitious for a
country that was just emerging from long years of civil and foreign war, and whose budget
resources were minimal. Regarding rehabilitation works, only foreign contractors responded to
the calls for bids, at prices well in excess of the estimates, which led the Government to have
these works done by the Brigade Routiere Autonome on force account. Then it was accordingly
decided to convert the Ministry of Public Works' agencies (OFNAR and Brigade Routiere
Autonome (BRA)) into two autonomous enterprises, which was done at the end of the project.
They still remain to be privatized.
B. ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OBJECTIVES
REORGANIZING PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
Ministries of Public Works (MTP) and of Transport and Civil Aviation (MTAC)
5.    The Interministerial Project Monitoring and Coordination Unit (IPMCU) was created in
April 1989, and its coordinator was appointed prior to credit effectiveness. It is operating to the
satisfaction of the agencies concerned. Technical and financial project monitoring is being
performed by Chadians trained through technical assistance provided under TSAP. The
coordinator now has only one adviser, who is also the chief of the project technical assistance
mission. One criticism that can be made is that the quarterly project progress reports on the
Transport Sector Investment Program, covering all components, were no longer prepared after
March 1991. This meant that the Project was being executed without taking into account the
priorities and the constraints of the overall program
6.    The Ministry of Public Works (MTP) and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation
(MTAC) were reorganized for the first time in April 1989. In January 1991, the Government
combined them into one single ministry, the MTPT (Ministry of Public Works and
Transportation). This merger was in line with the project's recommendations aimed at facilitating
coordination of the services responsible for management and use of the road system (the
Directorate of Roads (DR) and Directorate of Land Transport (DTS)).



3
7.    A High-Level Interministerial Monitoring Committee for the TSAP was formed in March
1992 chaired by the Minister of Planning and Cooperation. This High-Level Committee is
assisted by a Technical Committee (established in June 1992), which is responsible for the
preparation and monitoring of the Second Transport Sector Project (PST2) for the period
1994-98. Its chairman is the Director General of Transport and Public Works and its secretariat is
provided by the IPMCU. These two committees facilitated the implementation of the project and
have been most valuable for the preparation of the PST2, and its execution, which is to continue
up till 1998.
Office National des Routes (OFNAR)
8.    OFNAR was established in February 1984, and pursuant to IDA's recommendation, was
subsequently reorganized in April 1989 as a public establishment with a legal personality and
financial autonomy, under the supervision of the MTP. It was made up of three directorates and
five regional agencies and had the monopoly of all road maintenance works. In the context of the
project, the heavy maintenance works on the Bokoro-Mongo section were carried out
satisfactorily by OFNAR. The quality of the works nevertheless suffered from the lack of
preliminary studies and programming.
9.    With a view to its privatization, and following a drastic reduction in its personnel from
1,100 to 600, OFNAR ceased its activities on June 30, 1993. In December 1993, the SocieIt
Nationale d'Entretien Routier (SNER) was created, as a mixed corporation with 98% of its
capital held by the State. The objective is to privatize it within the next two coming years. Upon
its establishment, OFNAR's equipment was transferred to SNER at a residual value of
CFAF 2 billion, repayable to the State (CAER) in three years. The bulk of its capital of CFAF
600 million is represented by the land and buildings transferred to it by the State. The working
capital needs were, however, underestimated which complicated financial operations at the
beginning.
10.   SNER now has a staff of 414, two of whom are expatriate professionals. It needs a
turnover of about CFAF 4.5 billion per year to break even. In 1995, 50% of routine maintenance
works are allocated to SNER on a sole source basis, while bids are sought on the other 50%, for
which SNER can not bid. However, SNER has already obtained several contracts for periodic
maintenance works through competition. The establishment of SNER is one of the project's
achievements, and all efforts should be made to enable its complete privatization and expansion of
activities, to include new works. The best way to achieve this objective would be to allow SNER
to bid on road rehabilitation works.
Air Tchad
11.   At the time the project was appraised, Air Tchad was virtually bankrupt. It was agreed
during negotiations that a study of Air Tchad would be made as a matter of urgency and that
signature of an action plan by the Govermnent and Air Tchad would be a condition for



4
effectiveness. This was done, and in December 1989, a Committee was established for
monitoring the performance contract between the State and Air Tchad.
12.   This performance contract set out a two-phase action plan aimed at restoring the company
to a technical and financial position such that, by May 1993, when the contract expired, Air
Tchad could be offered for sale on optimal terms for the State. A number of the actions included
in the first phase were not carried out; in particular, while the reduction in the number of
personnel was implemented, the benefits expected therefrom were erased by subsequent hiring.
This failure contributed to block the release of the second and third tranches of the Credit.
13.   A further attempt to restructure Air Tchad was made in the context of the Second
Transport Sector Project, but without success, and as the company's position continued to
deteriorate, it was accordingly decided to consider this component in the context of the structural
adjustment project.
Liberalization of the Transport Sector
14.   At the time the project was appraised, the road transport sector was characterized by
excessive regulation and an absence of competition, a situation in which the Cooperative des
Transporteurs Tchadiens (CTT) was the keystone. The CTT was established after independence
to protect small local carriers against the big international transport companies, and in 1972 it was
given the monopoly for international transport. In 1987, the Government gave CTT an absolute
monopoly of both international and domestic road transport, but at the same time replaced its
board of directors with a management committee, the members of which were appointed by the
Government. Although a cooperative, CTT thus became in effect a government agency.
15.   Notwithstanding its monopoly, CTT's financial position had deteriorated, owing to
inadequate accounting and numerous irregularities. By 1988, its liquidation was the only
alternative, which was required in the credit agreement (condition for the Credit effectiveness and
release of the first tranche of the adjustment program component).
16.   Following the disappearance of CTT, several groups of Chadian hauliers were formed:
(i) the Groupement Professionnel Routier (GPR), which set up shop in the same premises as CTT
and under the same president; with 500 small hauliers as members, its purpose was to exercise
pressure for restoration of the monopoly; (ii) GETRANS; and (iii) the Union des Transporteurs
Tchadiens. The latter two groups, whose role was collecting and allocating the freight carried by
their members, are under liquidation. But since 1994, new groups were constituted: STTCR,
SCTT, SETT, SNTE, TRAMES and INTERGLOBAL, which succeeded in largely reducing the
monopoly that prevailed before the project.
Bureau National de Fr8t (BNF)
17.   With CTT no longer in existence, a new agency was needed to: (i) establish reliable
statistics on road traffic and tariff setting; and (ii) collect directly a number of taxes on transport
operations. The BNF was established in April 1989, and its bylaws were issued in November



5
1989. The BNF was to achieve financial autonomy in three semesters, which indeed it did by the
end of the first semester. However, some problems of intenal organization caused the bureau
difficulties in 1991, but after steps proposed by the Directorate of Land Transport (DTS) an
improvement was observed as regards both internal operation and tax collection. Fiscal Years
1992 and 1993 nevertheless closed with deficits of CFAF 35 million and CFAF 42 million,
respectively. For BNF to be able to break even, BNF would need its remuneration on the LVOs
(Lettres de Voiture Obligatoires) (mandatory way-bills) it issues, be raised from 7.14% to 10%.
Private Sector Development
18.   This objective was only partially achieved. As a condition for credit effectiveness, a mixed
corporation was to be formed to operate the Mani quarry, which was then State-owned and had a
virtual monopoly on production of road construction materials. This requirement was met, and
the mixed corporation (SOTEC) was established and is supposed to become an entirely private
company, by selling the State shares to private Chadian entrepreneurs. On the other side, the
French partner which was supposed to sell its stock to Chadian private shareholders, has not done
so up to this point. It is not readily apparent why foreign investors should be required to pull out
of a country so desperately in need of capital.
19.   For road rehabilitation, only foreign contractors responded to the request for bids.
Moreover, their prices were so high, compared with the estimates, that no action was taken on the
bids received. In 1990, an Autonomous Road Unit (Brigade Routiere Autonome - BRA) was
created to implement the works by force account while preparing itself for subsequent
privatization. In March 1993, BRA was converted into a private company, Entreprise
Tchadienne de Travaux Publics (ETTP), with a staff of 103, including 3 expatriate professionals.
ETTP required an annual turnover of at least CFAF 2 billion to operate at a profit.
Physical Achievements
20.   Half of the earth-road rehabilitation work in Gu6ra was to be done by force account and
the other half by private contractors. However, as estimates (based on per-km cost of CFAF 5
million) fell short of the average price quoted by the lowest bidder ( CFAF 37.5 million per-km,
reflecting an exaggerated risk coverage), the works were done on force account by BRA, as
noted above (para. 19).
21.   The works were carried out satisfactorily by BRA  on the following stretches:
Mongo-Abou Deia (122.5 km) and Saour Galbak-Eref (32.15 km) at per-km prices of CFAF 11.3
million and 25.6 million respectively, both with IDA financing; and Monga-Saour Galbak (44.3
km) at CFAF 25.6 million per km, with OPEC financing. The lower cost per-km of the first
stretch compared to the other is explained by its implementation by force account under an
agreement that included neither equipment depreciation nor profit. This was not financially
sustainable, and presumably the real cost under force account was higher than through open
competition.



6
22.   Earth-road rehabilitation financed by IDA-OPEC covered 198.95 km, to which must be
added the 200 km of maintenance on the Bokoro-Mongo section done by OFNAR for CFAF 374
million. For its part, the Federal Republic of Germany funded maintenance on the Abeche-Adre
(167 km) and Abeche-Biltine (92 km) sections. During the period 1989-94, USAID assisted
OFNAR (US$30 million) on the Djermaya-Bokoro (274 km) and Guelengdeng-Ere (160 km)
sections. The EDF financed periodic maintenance of the Guelengdeng-Sahr road (402 km) and
the Sarh-Moundou-Lere road (603 km) while the AfDB funded the N'Djamena bypass.
23.   Some cofinanciers are now resuming their activities in the road subsector now that the
TSAP has ended, and not necessarily on the sections programmed initially at the start of the
TSAP:
(a)   in the context of the PST2, IDA is financing the Eref-Mangalme section;
(b)   Kuwait and OPEC fund co-financing has been arranged for rehabilitation of the
Abou Deia-Am Timan stretch;
(c)   the European Union has three projects under way or in preparation: (i) periodic
maintenance on the Sahr-Moundou-Lere and M'Baikoro-Bedayo sections; (ii)
rehabilitation of the cotton trails in the same zone; and (iii) a new paved road
linking Ere and Kelo (50 km) for which studies have started; and
(d)   KfW is financing the paved Guelengdeng-Bongor-Ere road covering about 150
km. As of today, only the contract for works has been signed in June 1995.
24.   By way of compensations, IDA financed works not originally included under the project:
(i) resumption of surfacing and protection of the slopes of the N'Djamena-Guelengdeng paved
road at a cost of CFAF 700 million, financed under Credit 1901-CD; and (ii) at a cost of CFAF
456 million, reconstruction of the bridge on the Loumia, the rehabilitation of which was being
financed by Credit 1901-CD. A contractor's error had caused that existing metal bridge to
collapse, and since sufficient funds were no longer available in Credit 1901-CD, TSAP had
contributed CFAF 258 million to supplement the CFAF 96 million provided by the contractor.
Reconstruction of the bridge was finished in October 1994. One could wonder whether it might
not have been preferable to issue a request for bids for the reconstruction of the bridge.
Nevertheless, the sole source contract contributed to reduce delays for the works to begin and
to guarantee the supplement of the CFAF 96 million from the contractor's part.
25.   The N'Djamena urban roads (14 km) were satisfactorily rehabilitated, although the final
cost amounted to US$18.9 million compared to an estimate of US$8.5 million. Out of these 14
km, 10.5 km concerned rehabilitation of existing urban roads, 3.5 km concerned construction of
new urban roads. The cost difference can be explained by: (i) an additional 1.5 km of urban road
renovated, (ii) the public lighting installation not included originally in the project and (iii) an
underestimated cost at the appraisal stage by lack of information on current prices for simnilar
works. These roads may be judged overdesigned (avenues with two lanes in both directions, and a
median of 2-2.5 m), considering that other streets in the city center are prone to inadequate



7
maintenance; although the new roads have been built to last 20 years, some maintenance will be
required.
26.   Finally, the project also included rehabilitation of MTPT buildings in N'Djamena, Sahr,
Moundou and Abeche and construction of a new building to locate the ministry headquarters.
The works were started four years behind schedule (October 1993 for the rehabilitation and April
1994 for the new construction), because of a disagreement between IDA and the MTPT on
competitive bidding procedure for the architect's contract. This disagreement required the
intervention of an external consultant to be settled. Rehabilitation and construction have both
now been completed, but the delay caused the Credit's closing date to be extended from June 30,
1994 to June 30, 1995.
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS
27.   The transport taxes (fees) collected by BNF (axle-load tax and tax on LVOs) increased
considerably during the project, amounting to CFAF 650 million in 1992, CFAF 751 million in
1993 and more than CFAF 900 million in 1994.
28.   No agency is in a position to accurately estimate transport prices, which are required to be
based on LVOs; however, such an estimate is biased, as LVOs are also used to calculate the tax
base. Nevertheless, it would appear that transport prices declined 30% in 1990. Such a decline, if
true, may be traced not only to the liberalization of the sector but also to the rehabilitation of the
Guelengdeng-N'Djamena-Djermaya paved road (Credit 2007-CD). However, the devaluation of
the CFA franc in January 1994 caused prices to rise again, by about 60% in 1994 (according to
the information provided by the DEP of the Ministry of Planing).
29.   It is also very difficult to assess the project's impact on road traffic, in view of the short
length of the roads rehabilitated. With respect to the three sections discussed in para. 21, daily
traffic increased in 1991 and 1992 on the Mongo-Abou Deia section, and in 1992 and 1993 on the
other sections. Indeed, the works carried out may have stimulated growth in traffic. However,
the data are so uncertain, and the project actually executed so different from the one defined at
appraisal, that an update of the economic study and calculation of an economic rate of return
would be meaningless.
30.   The IDA credit agreement required the Government to meet no more than 5% of the cost
of the works. Despite the low requirements, the Government was unable to provide the local
counterpart funds on a regular basis. The arrears for the last three years are as follows: CFAF
134.4 million in 1992, CFAF 140.7 million in 1993, and CFAF 23.4 million in 1994, for a total of
CFAF 298.5 million. These shortfalls create unacceptable constraints for SNER, ETTP and
SATOM, in particular.
C. IMPORTANT FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
31.   The main political event that affected the project was the change of regime in December
1990, following a change of political regime. The change had no direct negative consequences on



8
the project; in fact, the new regime maintains the merging of the two transport ministries (MTP
and MTAC), which had a beneficial impact. However, some indirect adverse effects were felt as
certain donors involved in the project adopted a wait-and-see attitude resulting in the delayed
implementation of several components.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
32.   The sustainability of the project has to be considered from several aspects. The institutions
created or strengthened are functioning well, and their sustainability could be assured, if their
management and technical expertise can benefit from an adequate human resources policy, real
financial autonomy and a sustainable financial management. As regards private sector
development, however, the enterprises established under the project continue to exist, but their
viability is not yet assured. New road projects will be needed to enable them to achieve an
adequate turnover under normal circumstances. The Government, through the Compte Autonome
d'Entretien Routier (CAER) finances the routine maintenance of the entire priority road network.
The sustainability of road rehabilitation or periodic maintenance remains entirely dependent on
external financing, which could be very contingent. Already, during the course of the project,
there was a shift from rehabilitation, which was programmed for 1,800 km of priority roads, to
either routine or periodic maintenance. Out of a total of 830 km of roads to be rehabilitated
under the Project, only 260 km were really rehabilitated.
E. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
33.   IDA carried out its responsibilities satisfactorily. The project was generally prepared,
appraised and supervised in a satisfactory manner. The main negative comment relates to the
project coordination. In addition, when this project started in spring 1989, the Road Maintenance
Project (Cr. 1728-CD), which comprised maintenance works, wvas under completion and was to
be closed on June 30, 1990, the Road Reconstruction Project (Cr. 1901-CD) which was an
emergency credit for construction of paved roads had just started but was to be closed in
December 1991. The outcome was inevitably an overlapping of responsibilities. An important
sum under the TSAP had to be used to complete works which had to be carried out under Credit
1901 -CD.
34.   The project was prepared as an investment project and then became a hybrid adjustment
investment project during appraisal. The Government was not prepared for this change, and only
about a fifth of the first tranche (US$4.5 million out of a total program of US$20 million) was
disbursed. It would have been simpler to concentrate on road investments in line with the
Government's priority. At the Government's request, the funds not disbursed under the program
were applied towards investments.
35.   The first bids received for road works far exceeded the appraisal cost estimate (CFAF 37
million per-km compared to an estimate of CFAF 5 million per-km). As such costs made it
impossible to proceed with awarding contracts, the works had to be done by force account,
contrary to the project objectives. The cost of urban road works in NDjamena, estimated at
US$8.5 million at appraisal, finally amounted to US$18.9 million.



9
36.   IDA supervision was relatively continuous. A total of 15 missions visited Chad --three per
year in 1989, 1990 and 1994, and two per year in 1991, 1992 and 1993. These missions were
also handling supervision of Credits 1728-CD and 1901-CD at the beginning, and preparation of
Credit 2520-CD at the end, of the project. Almost all the missions comprised a road engineer and
the project leader. Some 139.5 staff-weeks were put into the project over the entire project cycle,
well below the average for investment projects of around 200. Details of the missions and staff
inputs are shown in Tables 12 and 13 in Part II.
37.   Relations with the other cofinanciers were very sporadic; in fact, the Bank did not receive
any progress reports on the components financed by them. This was connected with the fact that,
after March 1991, the IPMCU stopped preparing the quarterly project progress reports and made
do with forwarding to the Bank the reports of the consultants responsible for control of the
works. This drew no comment from the Bank. The existing documentation accordingly provides
a good picture of the physical part of the project financed by IDA, but is rather silent on the other
aspects. Finally, evaluation of the project's accomplishments is difficult because the President's
Report did not include any performance criteria.
F. BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
38.   Overall, the Borrower's performance was satisfactory.  The Government took some
difficult institutional measures, and complied with all its commitments under the Credit
Agreement. Its sole, serious shortcoming was the failure, as of 1992, to provide local counterpart
funds, even though these had been reduced to 5% of the cost of the works, with IDA financing
100% of the technical assistance and training. This failure particularly complicated matters for the
enterprises established in the context of the project, that is SNER and ETTP.
39.   In the technical sphere, IPMCU's performance was good, but a substantial amount of
technical assistance (89 man-months over the period of the project) had to be used. It was
ultimately reduced to a single engineer, the adviser to the Coordinator. Total technical assistance
to the Project was about 422 man-months over a period of 39 months. However, the absence of
quarterly progress reports on the Transport Sector Investment Program, as of March 1991, was a
problem noted above. In addition, the construction works for building MTPT were four years
behind schedule, because of the disagreement between IDA and the Borrower on procurement
procedures for the architect's contract, which was finally settled with the intervention of an
external consultant.
G. OVERALL EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT
40.   At the institutional level, the project was satisfactory, since it achieved all its objectives,
apart from the total failure of the rehabilitation of Air Tchad. As regards physical
accomplishments, the project can be considered satisfactory, although the shift from rehabilitation
of earth roads (which includes improvement of alignment and of profile), for part of these roads,
to just maintenance, observed during implementation is a cause for some concern. Nevertheless,
the overall outcome of the project may be considered satisfactory.



10
H. FUTURE OPERATION
41.   Future operations in the transport sector should take into account the problems
encountered in particular, close coordination with other donors, counterpart funding and
budgetary allocation for regular road maintenance. To meet current needs, the Second Transport
Sector Project (Cr. 2520-CD), under implementation, is financing a road rehabilitation program
and periodic maintenance on the priority network. This project is also addressing the need for
institutional development within the agencies created in the context of the first project and the
necessary support to the Road Maintenance Fund (Compte Autonome d'Entretien Routier,
CAER) which has been set up and is providing adequate financing for the routine maintenance.
I. MAIN LESSONS
42.   The main lesson to be drawn from the project is that road maintenance is very costly and
that owing to the country's limited financial capabilities, judicious selection of priorities during the
Public Expenditure Review must be established taking into consideration the need to carry out
periodic maintenance to avoid costly rehabilitation. A radical solution would be to build paved
roads, as it has been done for the N'Djamena-Guelengdeng section and as the Germans plan to do
for the Guelengdeng-Ere section.  But in addition to the very costly initial investment,
maintenance will be needed to ensure the sustainability of new road over its expected useful life.
It must therefore be admitted that for some more years to come, an important part of the extemal
assistance received will have to be allocated to periodic road maintenance and road rehabilitation.

PROJET D'AJUSTEMENT SECTORIEL DES TRANSPORTS
Credit 2007 - CD
Mission d'Achevement de la Banque Mondiale du 20 au 27 Janvier 1995
Aide-M6moire
1.          Le present aide-memoire fait suite a la mission de la Banque
Mondiale, effectuee du 20 au 27 Janvier 1995, par Messieurs Amadou
Cisse, ingenieur principai des transports, et Gerard Tenaille, ing6nieur
consultant.- -
2.           La mission a eu pour objectif d'examiner le deroulement du
projet PASET depuis son origine, et d'6valuer son impact technique,
economique et financier, en vue de la pr6paration du rapport
d'ach6vement. Un projet de rapport d'achevement sera adresse au
Couvernement dans les trois mois pour avis, commentaires et toutes
autres precisions qu'il jugerait utiles. Le rapport final, incluant les
commentaires de l'emprunteur, doit etre issu dans les six mois qui
suivent la cl8ture du credit, qui a et6 repouss6e au 30 Juin 1995.
3.           La mission tient a remercier les autorites tchadiennes
charg6es de l'execution et du suivi du PASET pour leur accueil et leur
coop6ration.  Cet aide-m6moire resume les observations et conclusions de
la mission.  II sera confirm6 officiellement par la banque mondiale dans
les semaines qui viennent.
4.           L'objectif majeur du rapport d'achavement est d'evaluer dans
quelle mesure les objectifs definis a l'origine, et detaill6s dans le
Rapport du President de 1'IDA, dat6 du 30 Mars 1989, ont ete atteints.
Nous procederons a cette evaluation en examinant successivement les
aspects institutionnels, physiques et financiers du projet.
I. ASPECTS INSTITUTIONNELS
5.           Les principaux objectifs du projet 6taient de:
(a)   r6organiser les institutions publiques du secteur, Ministeres des
Travaux Publics (MTP) et des Transports et de l'Aviation Civile
(MTAC), et creer une Cellule Interministerielle de Suivi et de
Coordination des Projets Transports (CISCPT).  ces actions 6taient
des conditions de presentation au Conseil de l'IDA.  Le projet
prevoyait 6galement la restructuration de l'Office National des
Routes (OFNAR) et d'Air Tchad.
(b)   liberaliser le secteur des transports par I'abolition du monopole
de la Coop6rative des Transporteurs Tchadiens (CTT), la creation
d'un Bureau National de Fret (BNF) et la liberation des tarifs de
fret.



25
(c)   promouvoir le developpement du secteur prive dans la construction,
la r6habilitation et l'entretien des des routes, ainsi que dans la
production de materiaux par la privatisation de'la carriere de
Mani, alors propri6t6 de l'Etat dans le cadre de l'Office National
des Carrieres (OFCA). Ce dernier point 6tait une condition de
mise en vigueur du credit IDA.
Ministeres des Travaux Publics (MTP) et des Transports et de l'Aviation
Civile (MTAC)
6.          La CISCPT a 6te cre6e par decret No.277/PR/MTPT/MTAC/89 du
29 Avril 1989, et son directeur a et6 nomme avant la mise en vigueur du
credit. Elle fonctionne A la satisfaction de toutes los autorites
concern6es. Le suivi technique et financier des projets est assur6 par
des tchadiens qui ont ete formn6 par l'assistance technique fournie par
le PASET. Ne reste plus A cote du coordinateur que son conseiller qui
est aussi le chef de la mission d'assistance technique du projet. On
peut seulement regretter que les rapports trimestriels d'avancement du
projet, couvrant 1'ensemble des volets, n'aient plus ete pr6pares apres
Mars 1991.
7f.         Le Ministare des Travaux Publics (MTP) a et6 reorganise une
premi4re fois dans le cadre du decret No.274/PR/MTP/89 du 29 Avril 1989,
et le Ministere des Transports et l'Aviation Civile (MTAC) par d6cret
No.268/PR/MTAC/89 du ler Avril 1989.  En Janvier 1991, le Gouvernement a
d6cid6 de les fusionner en un seul ministere, le MTPT.  Ce regroupement
est conforme aux recommandations du PASET visant A faciliter la
coordination des services responsables de la gestion et de l'utilisation
du reseau routier-(Direction des Routes, DR, et Direction des Transports
de Surface, DTS).
8.          Malheureusement, cette fusion s'est accompagnee de la
suppression, au sein de la DR, de la Cellule d'Etudes et Planification,
qui a 4te transferee A la Direction des Etudes et Planification (DEP) du
nouveau Ministere. En fait, l'elaboration et le suivi de la politique
routiere aurait du rester au sein de la DR, la DEP 6tant seulement
charg6e de la coordination entre les diffarents modes de transport.
9.          Un Haut Comite Interministeriel de Suivi du PASET a ete cree
par arrete No.801/PR/IMPC/92 du 20 Mars 1992. II est preside par le
Ministre du Plan et de la Cooperation.  Ce Haut Comite est assista par
un Comite Technique (cr6e par arrete No.034/MPC/92 du ler Juin 1992)
charge de 1'e1aboration et du suivi du PST2 pour la periode 1994-1998.
Son pr6sident est le DCTPT et son secretariat est assur6 par la cellule
de suivi et de coordination. Ces deux comites ont facilite la
realisation du projet et ont ete tres utiles pour la pr6paration du PST2
et sa realisation qui doit se poursuivre jusqu'en 1998.
Office National des Routes (OFNAR)
10.         La creation de 1'OFNAR remonte A l'ordonnance DU 2 fevrier
1984, No.004/PR/CAP/84. Sa r6organisation, demandee par l'IDA, a fait
l'objet du decret No.275/PR/NTP/89, du 29 Avril 1989, qui en a fait un



26
Etablissement Public dote de la personnalite morale et de l'autonomie
financiere, sous la tutelle du MTP.  I1 comprend trois directions et
cinq agences regionales.
11.         La Direction du Materiel gere un parc dont la valeur de
renouvellement avoisine 5 milliards CFA, et son personnel a et6 ramen6
de 60 a moins de 40 agents. La Direction des Travaux anime, avec 12
agents, les cinq agences d'Abeche, Mongo, N'Djamena, Moundou et Sahr,
qui emploient un total de 600 agents (apres r6duction drastique de 1100
a 600). Dans le cadre du projet, les travaux d'entretien lourd sur la
section Bokoro-Mongo ont ete r6alis6s par l'OFNAR, dans de bonnes
conditions.  N6anmoins, la qualite des travaux a souffert du manque
d'etudes pr6liminaires et de programmation.
12.         Le projet pr6voyait de confier une partie des travaux
d'entretieir-routier a des PIE. -Comme il n'y en avait pas, on a voulu en
creer, mais 1'effort s'est arret6 quand on a cesse de fournir des
travaux aux PME retenues. Pour casser ce monopole de fait, on a d6cida
de privatiser 1'OFNAR, et l'op6ration est en cours. L'office a ete
transforme en societe anonyme, la Societe Nationale d'Entretien Routier
(SNER), mais dont la quasi totalite du capital appartient a 1'Etat.
Cette action doit continuer dans le cadre du PST2.
Air Tchad
13.         Au moment de 1'6valuation du projet, Air Tchad etait
virtuellement en faillite.  It fut entendu lors des negociations qu'une
etude d'Air Tchad serait entreprise d'urgence, et que la signature d'un
Plan d'Action entre le Couvernement et Air Tchad serait une condition de
mise en vigueur du credit IDA.  Ceci fut fait et, le 14 Decembre 1989,
l'Arr&te No.4519/PR/89 portait creation d'un Comite de Suivi du Contrat
Plan entre I'Etat et la compagnie Air Tchad.
14.         Ce contrat plan definissit un plan d'action en deux phases
visant a mettre la compagnie dans une situation technique et financiare
talle qutau terme du contrat plan, en Mai 1993, elle pourrait etre
offerte A des repreneurs dans des conditions optimales pour l'Etat.
Nombre d'actions prevues dans la premiere phase n'ont pas ete r6alis6es;
en particulier, la compression de personnel indispensable a bien eu
lieu, mais des embauches ult6rieures en ont annu1l  les effets escomptes.
Cet 6chec bloqua les secondes et troisieme tranches du programme
d7ajustement sectoriel.
15.         Un nouvel effort de restructuration d'Air Tchad a ete tente
dans le cadre du PST2, sans succes, et la situation de la compagnie a
continue a se degrader.  Aussi a-t-il et6 decide de retirer ce volet du
projet et de le traiter dans le cadre du projet d'ajustement structurel.
Lib6ralisation du Secteur des Transports
16.         Le secteur des transports routiers etait caract6risa, au
moment de l'6valuation du projet, par un excas de regulations et une
absence de concurrence, dont la Cooperative des Transporteurs Tchadiens



27
(CTT) etait la c16 de voGte. Cr66e apres l'independance pour defendre
les petits transporteurs locaux contre de grands transporteurs
internationaux, elle obtint en 1972 le monopole des transports
internationaux. En 1987, le Couvernement lui accorda le monopole absolu
des transports routiers, internationaux et domestiques, mais en mime
temps supprima le conseil d'administration de CTT et le remplaga par un
comite de direction dont il nommait les membres.  De cooperative, CTT
6tait passee au statut de simple.agence gouvernementale.
17.         De plus, et malgre son monopole, la situation financiere de
CTT s'etait d6gradie, a cause d'une comptabilite inadequate et de
nombreuses irragularit6s.  En 1988, il n'y avait plus d'alternative a sa
liquidation, qui fut exigee dans I'accord de credit (condition de
liberation de la premiere tranche d'ajustement sectoriel).
18.         A la suite de la disparition de la CTT, se sont formes
plusieurs groupements professionnels de transporteurs tchadiens, dont
les trois principaux sont:
- 1e Croupement Professionnel Routier (CPR), qui s'est installe
dans les locaux de la CTT, avec le meme pr6sident; avec 500 petits
adh6rents, son but est de faire pression pour le retour au
monopole;
- le GETRANS; et
- l'Union des Transporteurs Tchadiens.
Ces deux derniers groupements remplissent correctement le rSle qu'ils se
sont donne, a savoir la collecte et la repartition du fret de leurs
adherents.  Malheureusement, aucun groupement professionnel ne rempl4t
son r6le pedagogique en matiere de formation a la gestion d'entreprise.
Bureau National de Fret (BNF)
19.         La CTT ayant disparu, il fallait creer un nouvel organisme
charge de:
- l1'tablissement de statistiques fiables en matiere de trafic
routier et de tarification; et
- la perception directe d'un ensemble de taxes et impots sur les
op6rations de transport.
20.         Le BNF a 6t6 cree par decret No.270/PR/MTAC/89 du 14 Avril
1989, et son reglement interieur a 6te promulgue par Arrete Ministeriel
No.010/MTAC/DC/89 du 7 Novembre 1989. Le BNF devait assurer son
autonomie financiere, ce qui n'a pas ete le cas au debut. De plus, des
problemes d'organisation interne ont mis le BNF en diffidult6 en 1991.
Suite a des mesures proposees par la Direction des Transports de Surface
(DTS), une amelioration a ete constatee, tant sur le plan du
fonctionnement interne que sur celui des rentrees fiscales.



28
D6veloppement du Secteur Prive dans le Domaine Routier
21.          Cet objectif du projet n'a 6te atteint que dans une faible
mesure.  L'accord de cr6dit exigeait, comme condition de mise en
viguour, qu'une Societe Mixte fQt cr6ee pour l'exploitation de la
carri&re de Mani, alors propriete de l'Etat et disposant d'un quasi
monopole de production de materiaux de construction de routes. Cette
demande a ete satisfaite, et cette soci6te mixte est ensuite devenue une
soci6te entierement privee, l'Etat ayant cede ses parts a des
entrepreneurs prives tchadiens.
22.          Pour la rehabilitation de routes en terre, les appels
d'offres lanc6s dans le cadre du projet ont montre que seules des
entreprises etrangeres se presentaient. De plus, leurs prix 6taient si
eleves, compar6s aux estimations, quo ces appols d'offres n'ont pas eu
de suite.  I1 a ;te alors imagine de cr6er, au sein du MTPT, une Brigade
Routiere Autonome (BRA), qui realiserait des travaux de routes en regie,
tout en se preparant a une privatisation ult6rieure.
23.         Dans le cadre du projet, les sections Mongo-Abou Deia et
Mongo-Eref ont ete confi4es par le MTPT A la BRA par conventions, en
regie, puis sur bordereau de prix. Les travaux ont 6te executes
correctement, A la cadence de 5 A 6 km par mois hors saison des pluies.
L'effectif etait de 120 permanents, renforc6 selon les besoins par 150 A
200 ouvriers temporaires, et assiste par trois cadres europeens. Un
chiffre d'affaires annuel de 1 milliard CFA permettait de rentabiliser
1'exploitation.
24.         L'autonomie, aussi bien technique que financiAre, n'a et6
acquise que lentement, mais la BRA est maintenant transform6e en une
societe anonyme, 1'Entreprise Tchadienne de Travaux. Publics (ETTP t '-Son
avenir est li6 A l'activite du secteur routier at devrait pour l'instant
gtre assure grace aux nombreux projets. Si ce succAs se confirme, ce
sera un des rares exemples de creation reussie de PME Africaine par
passage de la regie a la societ6 privee.
Conclusions du Volet Institutionnel
25.          Le volet institutionnel etait evidemmenV le fondement
essentiel de ce projet d'ajustement sectoriel.  Les objectifs etaient
tras ambitieux, peut-etre trop ambitieux pour un pays qui sortait A
peine de longues ann6es de guerre.  Neanmoins, mis A part le fiasco du
redressement d'Air Tchad, tous les objectifs ont ete atteints et meme
d6passes, bien que seule la premi&re tranche du programme d'ajustement
ait ete lib6r6e en partie.



29
II. ASPECTS PHYSIQUES
26.         L'objectif du projet 6tait de compl6ter, A la fin de 1993,
la r6habllitation du reseau de routes prioritaires de 3.800 km, sur
lesquels environ 2.000 km etaient d6jA r6habilites ou en cours de
rehabilitation. Le credit IDA et le credit OPEC, administre par 1'IDA
devaient financer la rehabilitation des sections Mongo-Oum Haijer et
Mongo-Am Timan, soit 653 km.  Le reste des 1.800 km A rehabiliter devait
etre couvert par l'ensemble des autres cofinancements, A savoir le FED,
la RFA, l'USAID, le FAD, la BAD et la BDEAC. De plus, le projet
comprenait la rehabilitation de 14 km de routes urbaines A N'Djamena et
la construction ou la rehabilitation de batiments du MTPT A N'Djamena,
Sahr, Moundou et Abeche.
27.         La moitie des travaux de rehabilitation devaient etre
realises em_regie et I'autre moiti6 par des entreprises privies. Les
estimations avaient ete basees sur un cout au km de 4,88 millions CFA.
Les appels d'offres ont gt6 lances et l'entreprise moins-disante
proposait un prix moyen de 37,4 millions CFA par km. 11 a alors ete
decid6 de ne pas donner suite aux appels d'offres et de faire r6aliser
les travaux en r6gie par une Brigade Routiere Autonome (BRA), en vue de
la privatiser en cours de projet (par.23 et 24 ci-dessus).
28.          Les travaux ont 6te realises de fagon satisfaisante par la
BRA sur les trongons suivants:
- Mongo-Abou Deia, 122,5 km, au prix de 11,3 M.CFA par km, avec
financement IDA;
- Mongo-Saour Calbak, 44,3 km, au prix de 25,6 M.CFA par km, avec
financement OPEC; et
- Saour Calbak-Eref, 32,15 km, au prix de 25,6 M.CFA par km, avec
financement IDA.
La difference de prix au km entre le premier trongon et les autres
s'explique par le fait que Mongo-Abou Deia a et6 realise en r6gie, sur
une convention qui ne comprenait ni amortissement des materiels ni
benefice.  Les autres ont fait l'objet d'un contrat d'entreprise, sur
bordereau de prix.
29.         La rehabilitation de routes en terre financee par IDA-OPEC
s'est donc limitee a 198,95 km, au lieu des 653 prevus, soit 30%.  Plus
grave encore, tous les autres cofinanciers se sont *vanouis, et sur les
1.200 km qu'ils devaient rehabiliter, rien n'a ete fait. Le taux de
realisation est donc seulement de 117., ce qui est derisoire. Coci est
d'autant plus regrettable que le projet formait un tout et que certaines
sections rehabilitees ne servent a rien si la liaison complete n'est pas
assuree.  Un des butfdu projet 6tait do permettre 1'6vacuation vers
N'Djamena des c6reales produites dans la region d'Am Timan, qui sont
bloquees en saison des pluies, qui est aussi celle de la recolte, par la
coupure de la route Abou Deia-_Am Timan, de Juillet A Octobre. On no
peut donc utiliser la section Mongo-Abou Deia, qui a 6te rehabilitee.



30
30.         Certains cofinanciers reprennent maintenant leurs activites
dans le domaine routier, au moment out le projet PASET se termine, et pas
forcement sur les sections prevues au depart du PASET:
(a)   un financement arabe a ete mis en place pour la r6habilitation du
trongon Abou Deia-Am Timan, ce qui resoudra le probleme expose au
par.29 ci-dessus;
(b)   l'Union Europ4enne a trois projets en cours ou en preparation:(i)
entretien periodique sur les sections Sahr- Moundou-ler6 et
M'Baikoro-Bedayo; (ii) rehabilitation de pistes cotonnieres dans
la mime zone; et (iii) route nouvelle bitumee Er&-Kelo, 50 km,
dont les etudes vont etre lancees prochainement; et
(c)   laYKfW finance la route bitum6e Guelengdeng-Bongor-Er6, environ
150 km. Les marches seront signes incessamment.
31.     ..-En maniere de compensation, l'IDA a finance des travaux non
prevus au d6part: (i) travaux d'entretien sur la route Bokoro-Mongo.
Ces travaux ont et6 r6alis6s par l'OFNAR, dans de bonnes conditions. Le
cout total a 6t6 de 374 millions CFA pour 200 km; (6i  la reprise du
revetement de la route bitum6e N'Djamena-Cuelengdeng, financ6e par le
credit 1901-CD, qui se fissurait dangereusement, pour un montant de 700
millions CFA; et (iii) la reconstruction du pont sur la Loumia (456
millions CFA), dont la rehabilitation etait en cours, financee par le
cr6dit 1901-CD.  Une fausse manoeuvre a conduit a l'croulement du pont
m4tallique existant. Le credit 1901-CD n'ayant plus assez de fonds
disponibles, le cr6dit 2007-CD a contribu6 pour 258 millions CFA, et
l'entreprise responsable pour 96 millions. On peut se demander s'il
n'eat pas 6te pref6rable de lancer un appel d'offres pour la
reconstruction du pont. Le pont a 6te receptionn6 le 19 Octobre 1994.
31.         La voirie urbaine de N'Djamena (14 km) a 6te r6habilitge
dans de bonnes conditions, bien que le coat final ait atteint 18,7
millions US$, contre une estimation de 8,5 millions. On peut estimer
que ces travaux sont trop luxueux (avenues a 2 voies dans chaque sens,
avec terre-plein central de 2 m ou 2,5 m) quand d'autres rues, en centre
ville, sont des fondrieres inutilisables en cas de pluie. Neanmoins,
avec un peu d'entretien, ces voies nouvelles sont construites pour 20
arts.
32.         Enfin, le projet comprenait la rehabilitation de batiments
du MTPT a N'Djamena, Sahr, Moundou et Abeche, et la construction d'un
nouveau batiment pour les services du ministre. Les travaux ont 6te
lances avec 4 ans de retard, en Octobre 93 pour la rehabilitation et en
Aoat 94 pour la construction du ministere, par suite d'un desaccord
entre l'IDA et le ministere qui voulait recruter un architecte de son
choix, sans appel a la concurrence.  Ces batiments sont maintenant en
bonne voie d'achevement, mais ce retard a ete la cause de l'extension de
la date de cloture du credit IDA du 30 Juin 1994 au 30 Juin 1995.

Conclusions du Volet Phvsique
33.         Bien que la non utilisation des fonds du programme
d'ajustement sectoriel ait ameng le Gouvernement A demander le transfert
de 16,5 millions de DTS au projet d'investissement, la realisation des
objectifs physiques du projet a ete rendue impossible par plusieurs
causes:
(a)   une forte sous-estimation des co&ts lors de l'6valuation initiale,
de 1 a 5 pour la r6habilitation de routes en terre, et de 1 A 2
pour la voirie urbaine de N'Djamena;
(b)   la disparition de tous les cofinanciers, hormis 1'OPEC; et
(c)   des deficiences et erreurs commis tAk i'e ition du credit
1901-CD, qui ont oblige A lui substituer le cr6dit 2007-CD.
111. ASPECTS ECONOMIQUES ET FINANCIERS
34.         Les objectifs economiques et financiers du projet etaient la
r6duction du cout et du prix des transports au Tchad, et l'amelioration
de la mobilisation des ressources financieres du secteur des transports,
on vue d'assurer le financement de l'entretien routier.
35.         Aucun organisme n'est capable d'6valuer correctement les
prix de transport, car la seule base officielle repose sur les LVO, mais
cette source est biaisee puisque ces LVO servent a prelever des taxes.
Neanmoins, les prix auraient baisse de 30% dans la region de N'Djamena.
Si cola est exact, on peut penser que c'est dC A la refection de la
route bitumee Guelengdeng-N'Djamena- Djermaya (cr6dit 1901-CD), plutot
qu'aux travaux executes dans le Guerra par le FASET (credit 2007-(4D1.
36.         I1 est aussi tres difficile d'evaluer l'impact du projet sur
les trafics routiers, compte tenu de la faible longueur de routes
rehabilitees: 198,95 km, ou 398,95 km, en tenant compte des 200 km
d'entretien realis6 sur la section Bokoro-Mongo.  Sur les trois sectionj
concernees, les trafics journaliers releves sont les suivants:
Section                  88    89    90    91    92    93    94
Mo,ngo-Eref              6      9     28    12    24    61    21
Mongo-Abou Deia          10    7      13    22    41    13    58
Bokoro-Bitkine                               17    58    39    23
Mongo-Bitkine            19    18    19    48    44    68    31
37.         On peut se demander si l'augmentation du trafic n'est pas
simplemeat dae aux travaux, en 1991 et 1992 sur la section Mongo-Abou
Deia (laissant inexplique le chiffre de 1994), et en 1992 et 1993 sur
les autres sections. Ces donnees sont si aleatoires, et le projet
realis6 est tellement diff6rent du projet defini a l'6valuaticn qu'il



32
serait illusoire de vouloir actualiser 1'6tude economique et calculer un
taux de rentabilito economique.
38.          L'accord de credit IDA mettait seulement 5% du coat des
travaux a la charge du Couvernement.  Malgre ce faible pourcentage, le
Gouvernement n'a pas ete capable de fournir regulierement la part
locale. Los arrieres des trois dernieres anneies sont les suivants:
1992               134.394.330 F.CFA
1993               140.682.372
1994                23.417.296
298.493.998 F.CFA

37.         On peut se demander si l'augmentation du trafic n'est pas
simplement dGe aux travaux, en 1991 et 1992 sur la section Mongo-Abou
Deia (laissant inexpliqu6 le chiffre de 1994), et en 1992 et 1993 sur
les autres sections.  Ces donn6es sont si aleatoires, et le projet
realise est tellement different du projet d6fini A l'evaluation qu'il
serait illusoire de vouloir actualiser 1'6tude 6conomique et calculer un
taux de-rentabilit6 economique.
38.         L'accord de credit IDA mettait seulement 5% du coat des
travaux A la charge du Couvernement.  Malgri ce faible pourcentage, le
Couvernement n'a pas ete capable de fournir regulierement la part
locale. Les arrieres des trois dernieres ann6es sont les suivants:
1992               134.394.330 F.CFA
1993               140.682.372
1994               23.417.296
298.493.998 F.CFA
Ceci cr6e des contraintes inacceptables pour les entreprises, la SNER et
P'ETTP en particulier.
39.         L'assistance technique a financierement represente une part
consid6rable des decaissements du cr6dit IDA: 10,8 millions DTS, contre
8,9 pr6vus lors de l'evaluation, soit enviroa 15 millions de dollars US.
C'est le second poste de depense apres la voirie de N'Djamena, qui a
atteinit 19 millions USS, contre une estimation de 8,5 millions US$. Une
part des succes du projet est dae A l'assistance technique, mais cette
assistance massive etait prevue pour la rehabilitation de 1800 km de
routes en terre.  Les cofinanciers ayant fait dtfaut, la r6habilitation
a 6t4 ramen6e de 1800 a 200 km. N'aurait-il pas fallu alors r4duire
l'assistance technique ? Au lieu de cela, elle s'est trouv6e accrue de
21 pourcent, et represente a la fin du projet 25 pourcent des coats.
IV. CONCLUSION GENERALE
40.         Les rCsultats du projet sont tres contrastes: l'ajustement
sectoriel a ete un succes, bien que seule la premiere tranche du
programme ait ete liberee, on partie (3,3 millions DTS au lieu de 5),
mais les r6alisations physiques ont ete tres en dessous des objectifs du
projet.



34
41.         La lib6ralisation du secteur des transports aura des
cons6quences ben6fiques durables sur l'organisation et le cout des
transports terrestres. La fusion des deux ministeres, MTP et MTAC, la
rCorganisation do leurs services, la privatisation des activitCs
d'entretien et la cr6ation de deux entreprises locales, SNER et ETTP,
sont des rCussites indeniables dont la p6rennitC peut etre assuree
moyennant une attention permanente. Seul le redressement d'Air Tchad a
6te un 6chec total.
42.         MalgrC le transfert de 16,5 millions USS du programme
d'ajustement sectoriel au projet d'investissement, les realisations ont
Cte tres an dessous des objectifs. La disparition des cofinanciers a
itC un 6choc qui a ramenC. le kilomAtrage de routes rChabilitCes a un
chiffre dCrisoire: 200 km au lieu de 1800 km. La voirie de N'Djamena a
absorb- une part trop importante des credits: 19 millions US$ contre
13,5 millions consacr6s aux routes, dont une partie (environ 3 millions)
pour reparer des erreurs commises par les entreprises dans l'ex&cution
du projet de reconstruction routiere (CrCdit 1901-CD).
43.         Dans l'ensemble, nonobstant les lacunes indiquees ci-dessus,
le projet peut &tre jug6 satisfaisant.

I - CONCEPTION ET ORGANISATION DU PROJET
Le PASET est un ensemble de politiques et d'actions destin6es a promouvoir le secteur
des transports au Tchad.
Ce programme vise a la realisation des objectifs de d6senclavement int6rieur du pays, la
baisse des couits de transports. Le PASET integre l'execution des travaux
d'investissement et d'entretien des infrastructures de transports, des reformes de
politiques sectorielles, des mesures institutionnelles et des actions de mobilisation de
financement.
La realisation du PASET a necessite l'implication de plusieurs Ministeres et plusieurs
bailleurs de fonds et la coordination des actions au travers d'une Cellule de
Coordination des Projets; des cadres de concertation ont et6 egalement mis en place au
travers des r6unions regroupant soit l'Administration et ses partenaires exterieurs, soit
les Administrations impliqu6es au PASET (Comit6 Technique et HCIM).
II - EXECUTION DU PROJET
'ex6cution du projet a et6 realisee par les differentes institutions concernees
notamment au niveau des administrations suivantes:
- Minist6re des Travaux Publics, de l'Habitat et des Transports,
- Ministere du Plan et de la Cooperation,
- Ministere des Finances et de l'Informatique.
11.1 Reformes de politique sectorielle
Afin d'assurer un support efficace au programme d'investissement prevu dans ce projet,
le Gouvernement a pris sans tarder les mesures suivantes:
- Dans le cadre de la politique de liberalisation, le Gouvemement a decide la
suppression de l'Office des Carrieres (OFCA) et la reprise des activites
d'exploitation de la Carriere de Mani par la Societ6 Tchadienne d'Exploitation
de Carrieres (SOTEC) dans laquelle l'actionnariat prive est predominant.
- Le Gouvernement a procede a l'abolition du monopole de la CTT en 1989 et a sa
liquidation.



37
- La liberalisation totale des tarifs de transports a 6t6 r6alis6e apres une periode
transitoire d'un an A partir de l'officialisation d'une fourchette tarifaire indicative.
- Un Bureau National de Fret (BNF) a ete mis en place en septembre 1989 pour
assurer la diffusion de l'information relative A l'offre et A la demande de fret,
l'enregistrement des operations et de leurs declarations A l'Administration fiscale.
- La mise en place d'un programme de promotion du secteur prive A travers les
travaux routiers.
- La definition d'un reseau routier prioritaire de 3800km et l'adoption de standards
de construction et d'entretien.
11.2 Renforcement institutionnel
Pour permettre une meilleure gestion du secteur, le Gouvernement a mis en oeuvre une
serie de mesures notamment:
- la reorganisation des services du Ministere des Travaux Publics et des Transports
ainsi que la red6finition de leur mission orientee vers l'elaboration des politiques
sectorielles, la planification et la r6glementation.
Cette reorganisation a ete soutenue par la mise en place d'une assistance
technique consequente au debut du programme.
- La mise en oeuvre d'un programme de formation approprie qui a permis
d'ameliorer les competences nationales et reduire le volume de l'assistance
technique de facon significative.
- L'amelioration des conditions de travail qui a ete 6galement obtenue grace A la
rehabilitation et l'6quipement des bureaux ainsi que la dotation des services en
moyens mat6riels adequats.
- En concertation avec l'IDA et le FAC, le Gouvernement a mis en place un plan
d'action pour le redressement de la societe Air Tchad.
- Le Gouvernement a 6galement revise ses procedures de passation et
d'approbation des marches, de manibre A accelerer le processus de r6alisation
physique des investissements tout en respectant le jeu normal de la libre
concurrence. Le Gouvernement a pris a cet effet un decret en date du 2/08/1989;
Un Code des marches publics a ete egalement adopte en 1990.
- Les structures de l'Office National des Routes (OFNAR) ont ete modernisees
afin que celui-ci assure plus efficacement sa mission dans des conditions
technique et economique optimales.



38
Afin de permettre une gestion rigoureuse et une souplesse d'utilisation des ressources
de 1'entretien routier, le Gouvernement a cree un Fonds Routier au sein de l'OFNAR.
- Le Gouvernement a egalement consenti des efforts financiers importants en
consacrant au financement de l'entretien routier des ressources adequates
provenant de la fiscalit6 petroliere.
A cet effet, le Gouvernement a consacre 900 millions en 1989, 1.100 millions de
FCFA en 1990; 1.300 millions en 1991. A partir de 1992, la d6gradation de la
situation 6conomique du pays n'a permis de mobiliser que 90% des 1500 millions
pr6vus.
- Le Gouvernement a entrepris l'encadrement et la formation des petites et
rmoyennes entreprises privees tchadiennes afin de les rendre aptes aux activit6s
d'entretien routier de maniere a developper l'intervention des entreprises privees
dans cette activite. En 1993, les PME devraient pouvoir executer 50% des travaux
d'entretien routier.
Get objectif n'a pu Wtre atteint du fait de l'inadaptation du cadre institutionnel de
l'OFNAR.
- La coordination du Programme a 6t6 assur6e par la Cellule Interministerielle
creee par D6cret n° 277/PR/MTPT/MTAC/89 du 29/04/89 et dont le
coordinateur a ete nommee avant la mise en vigueur du projet.
Cette mission a ete menee a la satisfaction des institutions concern6es.
I1.3 Les realisations physiques
Le programme a prevu la rehabilitation de 1800 km de routes et de 10 a6rodromes
secondaires.
II.3.a Infrastructures routieres
Les lenteurs dans la mobilisation des financements ainsi que les couits eleves des travaux
routiers n'ont permis de rehabiliter que 1500 km sur les 1800 km de routes pr6vues.
Les travaux d'entretien routier ont ete realis6s de maniere satisfaisante grAce aux
brigades de l'OFNAR.
II.3.b Infrastructures aeroportuaires
Le projet de r6habilitation des aeroports secondaires financ6s par la CFD n'a pas et6
realise pendant le programme. II sera ex6cut6 pendant la periode du PST2.



39
II.3.c R6habilitation des batiments du MTPHT
Le programme de rehabilitation des locaux du MTPHT n'a 6te acheve qu'en 1995 A la
suite d'un retard dui a un desaccord intervenu entre l'Administration et la Banque pour
le recrutement de l'architecte.
11.4 Financement du programme
Le Gouvernement par l'intermediaire du Ministere du Plan et de la Cooperation a mis
en place une procedure de concertation avec ses partenaires exterieurs afin d'assurer
une meilleure mobilisation des ressources financieres.
Ainsi le Gouvernement a 6labore un programme sectoriel des transports dont le
contenu a ete discute et adopte lors de la table ronde tenue en 1988 avec la
communaute internationale.
Cette procedure a permis de mobiliser environ 180 millions de dollars E.U. y compris la
part du Gouvernement.
Ce financement a ete cependant insuffisant pour permettre la realisation de la totalit6
des investissements, d'une part les couits des travaux s'av6rant beaucoup plus elev6s lors
de l'execution du programme, et d'autre part certains bailleurs ayant differ6 leur
participation.
III - RESULTATS DU PROJET
Les resultats obtenus sur l'ensemble du projet sont satisfaisants.
III.1 Reformes de politiques sectorielles
L'abolition du monopole de la CTT et la lib6ralisation des tarifs des transports ont
permis d'instaurer la concurrence dans la passation des contrats de transports routiers et
d'obtenir une baisse des prix de transports de l'ordre de 30%.
La promotion des PME a travers les programmes d'entretien routiers n'a pas e
realisee; Une nouvelle strategie a 6t6 6laboree dans le PST2. Cependant a la fin du
Programme on a pu assister A l'emergence d'une PME Tchadienne (ETTP) en mesure
de realiser des travaux de rehabilitation routiere.



40
II12 Rdformes institutionnelles
II ressort que depuis le demarrage du PASET en 1989, les annees ecoulees ont vu
s'am6liorer de facon consid6rable le cadre institutionnel de l'Administration des routes
au Tchad:
- les autorites politiques ont ete sensibilisees aux enjeux du PASET,
- le management des routes est competent, mobilise et mandate par l'autorit6
politique,
- le personnel d'encadrement a ete forme et occupe des postes bien d6finis: H sait
ce qu'on lui demande, et il est persuade que ce qu'on lui demande n'est ni
irrealiste, ni au dela des competences qui sont les siennes,
- sur le terrain l'etat de praticabilite du reseau routier le plus circule s'est
grandement am6liore.
Correlativement, les principaux textes d'organisation institutionnelle ont e  promulgues
et ont permnis notamment:
- le regroupement en un seul Ministere des Ministeres des Travaux Publics, du
Transport et de l'Aviation Civile, et de l'Urbanisme, et la promulgation des
decrets et arretes d'application subsequents,
- le statut du Laboratoire transforme en 6tablissement public, a caractere
industriel et commercial,
- la creation du Haut Comit6 Interministeriel pour le PASET, du Comit6
Technique et de la Cellule de Suivi des Projets,
- l'amelioration des procedures en matiere de passation de marches,
- le renforcement des proc6dures de protection des infrastructures routieres,
- l'am6lioration des systemes de gestion : comptable, personnel.
Des ameliorations restent a entreprendre et des lacunes a combler, notamment en
matiere de classification routiere, de planification, de recueil des donnees,
d'organisation des circuits d'ordonnancement et de paiement, de devolution et de
contr6le des travaux, de formation et de motivation du personnel.
Au niveau du secteur des transports, il semble que les difficultes rencontrees notamment
pour la mise en place du BNF et la restructuration d'Air Tchad aient ete beaucoup plus
grandes et les progres moins rapides, de sorte que tant au niveau de la DTS, de la DEP
et de la DAC qu'au niveau de la formation des transporteurs, de vastes efforts restent a
accomplir. On peut regretter que les mesures d'accompagnement aupres des
transporteurs n'aient pas ete mises en place en temps voulu pour faciliter leur
adaptation a la nouvelle politique.



41
I11.3 R6alisations physiques
a) reseau routier
En comparant 1'6tat du reseau routier en 1989 et A 1'etat actuel et en tenant compte des
investissements programmes, on peut constater qu'un effort important a ete r6alis6 dans
ce domaine grace A une politique volontariste et coherente poursuivie durant le PASET.
Ce succes a et6 bati grace A la concentration des actions sur le reseau prioritaire de
3.800 km.
Cependant, eu £gard au derapage sur les coults, les financements n'ont permis de
rehabiliter que 1.500 km de routes en terre et 275 km de routes revetues.
Les travaux d'entretien routier courant ont cependant couvert l'ensemble des 3.800 km
du r6seau prioritaire.
Les effets des travaux sur l'amelioration de la praticabilite des grands axes de circulation
ont ete tres nets en saison seche; cependant des interruptions de trafic qui demeurent en
saison des pluies sur les routes en terre penalisent le resultat acquis.
b) Infrastructures a£roportuaires
Les operations de rehabilitation et d'entretien sur les infrastructures de transport aerien
prograrnrnes dans le PASET n'ont pas ete realisees; Des efforts importants restent A
faire au niveau des institutions, des r6formes de politique et des realisations au cours du
PST2.
III.4 Financement
La proc6dure de concertation entre le Gouvernement et les partenaires de
developpement a permis de mobiliser une dizaine de bailleurs de fonds pour un total
d'environ 54 Milliards de FCFA (avant devaluation) soit l'6quivalent de 180 Millions
Dollars E.U.
Le dynamisme du Gouvernement a donc port6 ses fruits et il y a lieu de poursuivre la
politique des tables rondes sectorielles.
IV - VIABILITE DU PROJET
L'ex6cution du Projet d'Ajustement Sectoriel des Transports a apport6 des changements
importants qui ont permis:
- sur le plan institutionnel: une gestion du secteur des transports plus efficace
grace A l'appui institutionnel dont a beneficie l'Administration,



42
- sur le plan des infrastructures: une baisse des prix des transports routiers due a
la politique de liberalisation mise en place et a l'amelioration des infrastructures.
La perennit6 des acquis en matiere institutionnel passe par la qualite et la stabilite des
Ressources Humaines et sur le plan des infrastructures sur une disponibilite de
ressources suffisantes.
Ces acquis doivent cependant etre pr6serves et consolides par la poursuite des r6formes
politiques et institutionnelles orientees vers une plus grande efficacite du secteur.
V - PERFORMANCE DE L'ADMINISTRATION
Grace aux programmes d'assistance et de formation mis en place, les performances de
l'Administration ont et6 satisfaisantes; Des am6liorations sont cependant n6cessaires au
niveau des capacit6s de programmation et dans l'6laboration des rapports.
II y a lieu de noter egalement l'insuffisance constatee a la fin du programme dans la
mobilisation des financements incombant au Gouvernement.
VI - PERFORMANCES DE LA BANQUE MONDIALE
Dans le cadre du programme, la Banque a assure deux r6les:
- Chef de file des Bailleurs de Fonds,
- Partenaire financier.
En tant que partenaire financier on peut dire que la Banque a fait preuve d'une grande
efficacite par:
- la rapidit6 dans la mobilisation de ses ressources et par l'importance de leur
montant (60 millions de dollars US sur les 180 millions du Programme),
- la diligence dans le traitement des dossiers qui lui ont etd communiqu6s par le
Gouvernement,
- la r6gularite et la qualite des missions de supervision.
En tant que Chef de file, la Banque a apport6 un soutien determinant au Gouvernement
dans ses negociations avec les autres partenaires dans le programme.



43
VII - RAPPORTS EMPRUNTEUR/BANQUE
Apres des rapports difficiles lors de la preparation dus essentiellement aux insuffisances
institutionnelles de l'Administration, les rapports entre la Banque et le Gouvernement
se sont nettement amelior6s grace a la disponibilite des responsables impliques dans la
mise en oeuvre du programme.
On peut affirmer ainsi que la bonne qualite des relations entre les partenaires a ete une
des causes de reussite du PASET.
VIII - ROLE DES COFINANCIERS
Le programme sectoriel des transports 6labore par le Gouvernement avec l'appui de la
Banque a permis l'adhesion de plusieurs partenaires financiers. Cependant il y a lieu de
deplorer une certaine disparite dans les d6lais de mobilisation des financements
annonces lors de la table ronde tenue en 1988; Des retards importants voire des
defaillances ont et enregistres, ce qui a conduit a la non execution complete du
Programme, notamment au niveau des infrastructures.
