Project at Risk- at Any Time:
3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
As stated in the SAR, the main objective of the project was to improve the living conditions of the
low-income population in the low areas of the city of Antananarivo and in the Antananarivo Plain.
Specifically, the project would (i) create a favorable environment for private investment and economic
growth in the metropolitan zone of Antananarivo; (ii) consolidate the financial and administrative



development of the municipalities which was begun under the Antananarivo Urban Development Project
(1 987-MAG); (iii) establish an institutional framework to ensure the efficient operation and maintenance of
works and installations financed under the project; and (iv) ensure integrated rural and urban development
in the Antananarivo Plain.
The Antananarivo Plain has a large concentration of the region's low income population and is the only
large area available for the expansion of low income settlements and employment in the Antananarivo area.
Poverty alleviation, private sector development, economic growth, municipal development and integrated
rural/urban development in this area were relevant to the Bank's assistance strategy and responsive to the
Borrower's concerns. However, these were very broad objectives involving different sectors, levels of
govemment and institutions. This inherent complexity hampered implementation throughout the project.
The objective of establishing efficient operation and maintenance of new installations was dependent on
new agencies being created under the project and has proved more risky than expected (see section 3.4)
3.2 Revised Objective:
The above set of objectives were broad and reflected wider goals for development in Madagascar at the
time. They were not changed during project period, but, given their breadth, the main project components
listed below in fact came to be used as development achievements during project implementation.
3.3 Original Components:
The main components of the project were: (i) to provide 100-year flood protection through rehabilitation
and construction of dikes along the Ikopa and Mamba Rivers and a flood warning system, including sites
for relocating families from areas affected by these works; (ii) rehabilitation and construction of drainage
canals on the Antananarivo Plain and construction of a pumping station to remove excess water from the
plain into the Mamba River; (iii) irrigation improvements, including construction of an irrigation canal and
rehabilitation of the drainage and irrigation network for 2,910 hectares in the Antananarivo Plain; (iv)
rehabilitation and extension of the sewerage system in Antananarivo and rehabilitation of the existing solid
waste composting plant; (v) improvements in two out of five drainage areas (drainage, storage basins and
primary roads) in the southern part of the plain to accommodate urban development; and (vi) institutional
strengthening including updating and improving the management of the cadastre, improving the land tax
system, creating an institution to manage hydraulic works in the Plain, creating a user association of the
irrigation system, and assisting public agencies responsible for sewerage and solid waste management.
The original components were effectively designed to implement flood protection, drainage and irrigation as
well as storage basins and road improvements for future urbanization in the Plain, and implement sewerage
and solid waste improvements. These tasks proved to be largely within the capacity of the implementing
agency. The proposed improvements in the cadastre were not directly related to the cost recovery needs of
the project. Modest achievements in the land tax system could be achieved. However, the institutional
arrangements to operate and maintain the main investments of the project (APIPA for flood control and
drainage, SAMVA for sewerage and solid waste, and user associations for irrigation), which were of
critical importance to sustain the investments, were not defined until long after appraisal and proved much
more difficult to achieve than originally envisioned.
-2-



3.4 Revised Cornponents:
There were limited changes in some components which did not imply changes in objectives: (i) an
additional 4 km. of dikes were added to the flood control component; (ii) the scope of the sewage
component remained the same but after completion of a feasibility study, it was changed from new
investment to rehabilitation; (iii) the cleaning out of Anosy Lake, which plays an important role in the
drainage system of the central city, was added to the project in 1998; and (iv) at the request of the
Municipality of Antananarivo, the component to rehabilitate the solid waste composting plant was modified
in 1995 and the funds were reallocated to the reconstruction of 289 garbage containers and provision of
135 metal containers. The Credit Agreement was amended in 1996, due to a suspension in AFD financing,
to finance additional drainage works (C3 canal north) and the flood warning system originally to be
financed by AFD. In 1999, the flood waming system was transferred back to AFD so that the IDA credit
could be closed without further delay.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project was consistent with Govemment priorities and Bank country strategy. Improvements in urban
development, private investment, agriculture and poverty alleviation in the Antananarivo metropolitan area
were complementary to the structural adjustment process underway at that time. However, it was not
advisable to address all of these issues in one project, especially given the disappointing results from a
previous urban development project (Credit 1497-MAG) and in the absence of subsequent analysis. The
project tried to address both urban and rural development issues with a large and diverse number of
components involving complex engineering works, urban management issues and rural
development/irrigation problems. The cadastre component, which was not directly related to the project
objectives, could have been financed from another source.
The technical aspects of the project were well defined through a detailed analysis financed under an
engineering credit (Credit 1086-MAG) which lasted from 1981 to 1986. The engineering studies examined
a number of alternatives to identify a technically and economically justifiable project for flood control and
agricultural development in the Antananarivo Plain. Further studies under an ongoing Bank-assisted
Antananarivo Water and Sanitation Project (Credit 1002-MAG) recommended a pumping station in the
northwest corner of the protected zone to drain the flood waters into the Mamba River. In December 1986,
a PPF was initiated to undertake additional economic and financial studies, including the design of
urbanization schemes and local finance and institutional arrangements.
In contrast to the technical aspects, the institutional arrangements were not well defined in advance and the
risk to long-term financial viability was underestimated. Indeed, much of the institutional framework was
left to be detailed at a future date. Experience under the Antananarivo Urban Development Project (Credit
1497-MAG) had not been positive in improving local government management and finance. Therefore, the
project recommended the establishment of separate authorities (later combined into SAMVA) to manage
sewerage and solid waste. For both components, operation and maintenance were required to be contracted
to the private sector as a condition of disbursements; there was an additional disbursement condition that a
tax on water be enacted to pay for sewerage. SAMVA's operationshave been contracted to the private
sector and taxes have been established, but despite its separate status, it has not been insulated from the
management and financial problems of the municipality. The project alsocalled for the establishment by
December 1992 of an independent authority (APIPA) to manage flood control on the Plain. APIPA, has a
broader scope of responsibilities (functional and regional), and its separate status was more appropriate.
However, like SAMVA, its separate status has not been sufficient to ensure that the investments made
- 3 -



under the project would be sustained. The user associations established to maintain irrigation systems
remain untested.
The promulgation of measures to control urbanization in the southem part of the Plain was a condition of
disbursement for the flood control component, but the municipality was not sufficiently committed to this
objective. Uncontrolled urbanization has continued which is especially serious in the retention pond areas
necessary to create equilibrium during flooding. The project required evictions of 2,341 households, 80%
of whom were squatters, about twice the number estimated during preparation. The details of the
resettlement program were not folly elaborated during project preparation. Local government was not
fully consulted and involved in resettlement, leaving BPPA in charge of the process. This led to long delays
during implementation and poor results in resettlement.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievenment of objective:
The living conditions of the low income population in the Antananarivo Plain have been improved. The
low areas of Antananarivo are protected from 100-year floods and the infrastructure is in place to drain the
Plain from rain flows. Private investment, albeit anarchic, is taking place. Less fill is necessary to
safeguard plots. These improvements are reflected in increased land values. An estimated total of 24,250
man months of work were created during the last two years of the project when most works were finished.
However, the institutions now in charge of operation and maintenance (APIPA for flood control; SAMVA
for sewerage and solid waste) are not well anchored into government structures and their sustainability is
questionable.  Due to delays in the AFD-financed irrigation component, the thirteen user associations
established to operate and maintain the irrigation system are not fully developed. There has been little
financial and administrative development of the municipalities beyond limited improvements in the potential
municipal real estate tax. The relevant central and local govemment departments have not proven their
ability to assure integrated rural and urban development of the Plain and designated retention pond areas
are not being adequately protected from development. Nevertheless, given the successful completion of the
project works under difficult circumstances, the overall outcome is rated marginally satisfactory.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Physical Objectives Most of the physical objectives have been met. This successful completion of such a
complex set of works is an important achievement. Dikes have been rehabilitated along the Mamba and
Ikopa Rivers. Drainage canals in the Antananarivo Plain have been constructed and rehabilitated and a
major pumping station has been put in place to extract water from the protected area. Sewerage
rehabilitation has improved sanitation in a previously urbanized 67 hectare area, although sewage is
discharged without treatment into the Ikopa River. New solid waste receptacles have been rehabilitated and
solid waste management is now managed under private contract. Lake Anosy has been cleaned out. A new
irrigation canal has reduced the pollution of rice paddies and the irrigation network in the north of the Plain
will soon be improved with AFD financing. A flood warning system will also soon be put in place with
AFD financing.
Involuntarv Resettlement. While the project has improved the living conditions of many poor households in
the Antananarivo Plain, many households subject to resettlement are in worse conditions than before. The
original plan to give each family a resettlement plot in addition to compensation was changed to one of
reduced compensation, temporary shelter and an option to buy a plot in three designated areas far from
most employment opportunities. In 1998, only three of the 2,341 households displaced were living in the
-4 -



three designated resettlement sites. Most households used their compensation to settle nearer their original
homes and many suffered a deterioration in tenure status and housing quality. More than 60% of former
owners and tenants in a survey on resettled households were not satisfied with resettlement. The
resettlement process did not provide assistance with the move, support at the resettlement site or assistance
with improving living standards as would now be required (appraisal was one year before OD 4.30 on
involuntary resettlement was issued).
Financial Objectives. The institutions established for operation and maintenance of works financed under
the project are not yet financially viable. APIPA is authorized to recover: (a) a fee for new landfills, but
for 1998 it recovered only FMG 2.3 billion of the 7 billion expected based on landfill authorizations to date
(part is overdue payments; some expected landfills have not yet been made); and (b) a 5% surtax, based on
updated property values (see section 4.5) on properties benefiting from flood control, to be collected by the
city and transferred to APIPA. This annual surtax is not yet being collected, but the first tax roles should
be issued the end of 1999. With the present rate of filling and with a tax surcharge rate of 5%, it would
take five to seven years for APIPA to be self sufficient. With a lower surtax rate of 3%, which was
suggested bythe local authorities, APIPA would not cover its costs until 2010. These projections assume
that some depreciation and maintenance costs will be subsidized from presently unidentified Government
sources. The long-term operation and maintenance prospects for the complex flood waming system are
particularly poor. SAMVA is supported by a special solid waste management tax on built-up property
which is a percentage of the property tax, but the tax rate depends each year on the municipal council.
Solid waste removal fees were insufficient to cover SAMVA's cost in 1998. For 1999, FMG 4 billion have
been collected and transferred to SAMVA, compared to the FMG 7 billion necessary to cover full costs,
possibly leading to curtailment of service. The management of the sewerage system is supposed to be
covered by a surcharge on water fees collected by JIRAMA, currently 10% of the amount due for water
consumption. Present transfers from JIRAMA enable SAMVA to maintain only 15 km. of the 47 km.
network. Even if the tax were raised to 15% in 2000, it would not be able to carry out the necessary
maintenance. The problems are likely be more severe than reflected here. Much of APIPA's infrastructure
maintenance is still covered under works and equipment contracts. Both agencies infrastructure is new.
T'he cost of deferred maintenance will not be apparent for several years.
4.3 Net Present Value,/Economic rate of return:
The economic rate of return of the project calculated at appraisal was 18%. At completion, the irrigation
component was incomplete, and the benefits of the sewage, solid waste management and urban finance and
management components could not be quantified. A rate of return of 17% was calculated for the flood
protection and drainage components which account for 49% of project cost, confirming the substantial
economic return of protecting the 635 hectare area of the southern plain (see Annex 3).
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The objective of consolidating the financial and administrative capacity of the municipalities in the area
covered by the project was achieved in part through the improvement of the tax base (property ownership
study, updating property values and taxes, and assessing municipal resource and expenditure). This will
have a city-wide impact on tax receipts, including revenues for SAMVA and APIPA which are based in
part on property values. However, one recommendation of the study was to increase the tax rate on higher
- 5 -



valued properties. This has proven difficult to implement. The cadastre has been updated based on aerial
photography and digitized maps, but this work is having a lower impact. Only 10% ofthe property records
have been entered into the new system, and FMG 2.5 billion would still be required to complete this work.
The separate para-public entities created to operate and maintain the investments made under the project
were slow to develop and their future is uncertain. Laws establishing SAMfVA and APIPA were not
enacted until 1995 and the taxes and fees necessary for operation and maintenance were not established
until 1996. Disbursements on works contracts could not begin until management contracts were signed by
SAMVA with private operators and the taxes and fees were fully agreed to by the government. These
actions did not occur until 1998. SAMVA lacks the technical capacity to carry out its functions and both
agencies lack financial capacity. The creation of SAMVA as a separate entity to manage solid waste and
sewerage was not sufficient to ensure continuity of service. A strong financial base would be essential for
this, but that would have required more effort to build the financial base of the municipality.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Not applicable.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
*  AFD funding was suspended from 1994 to 1997 due to arrears of government with AFD. This stopped
AFD disbursements and work on the main pumping station, and IDA-financed drainage works could
not proceed. Eventually a special arrangement was made with the French Government to finance the
pumping station. The drainage works which the French Ministry of Cooperation could not finance
were finished with a 2 1/2 year delay with IDA financing.
*   The process of land expropriation was stopped several times during elections and due to delays in
funding from the government. The entire eviction/reallocation process lasted six years from January
1993 and December 1998.  Relocation of households affected by flood control work were not
managed by FIRVEN (the local government) in accordance with its convention with BPPA. This led to
long delays in the construction of dikes and canals.
* There were some early delays in counterpart funding from Government. The problem was more severe
at the end of the project because about 70% of the project had to be implemented after 1997 when work
on the pumping station could resume. During this period, large amounts of counterpart funds were
required and budget provisions were made. However, the funds were not disbursed to the project in a
timely manner. There were also some delays in the signing of contracts.
5.3 Faclors generally subject lo implementing agency control:
* The accounting system of BPPA involved complexities of multiple donors and components. The
accounting system put in place in 1993 was insufficient and led to delays in producing financial reports
acceptable to the donors. An improved version was put in place in 1997 and has proven to be
satisfactory.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The original cost of the project was US$ 68.6 million, and the final cost is US$ 63.3 million. The original
- 6 -



credit amount was US$ 30.5 million (SDR 23 million). When AFD financing was resumed in 1997, the
closing date of the IDA credit was extended from June 30, 1997 to June 31, 1999. A further three-month
extension was made to September 30, 1999 to complete the execution of the remaining works. Because of
the suspension, IDA agreed to finance a much larger percentage of drainage canals and it reduced its
participation in the pumping station and in irrigation.  At the time of suspension, IDA also agreed to
finance the flood warning system, but this was transferred back to AFD in 1999 so that the IDA credit
could close without fiurther delay. At that time, SDR 5 million were canceled from the project leaving the
final amount of IDA financing at SDR 18 million (US$ 23.4 million equivalent).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
BPPA provided strong leadership during implementation, but its future role is still unclear following the
closing of AFD financing expected in December 2000. A study is currently being undertaken to examine
future options for BPPA. The ability of APIPA and SAMVA to operate and maintain the works is not
certain. These are new agencies with serious financial problems (see section 4.2). The municipality must
approve the fees they collect and subsidize costs they cannot cover, but local govermnent finances are also
constrained. The inability of central and local govemment to control development is also a serious issue
(see section 3.2). User associations were set up to manage irrigation but are untested. Given the delay in
implementing the irrigation component, they would need to be revitalized when the irrigation systems are
operational.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
SAMVA and APIPA are supervising their respective components jointly with BPPA during the final stages
of the project. There has been a provisional handover of all components except some of the retention
basins and the C3 drainage canal. SAMVA and APIPA have sufficient fumding to pay their staff but
funding of contracts for private operating contractors is less secure. Some payments to contractors by
SAMVA are already in arrears.

Recommended follow-up by the Bank
Sector work has been initiated by the Bank to take a program approach to the urban problems in
-Madagascar, especially those of the Capital region. This approach should lead to more focused and better
phased project interventions with donors expected to finance discrete parts of a complementary program.
An OED impact evaluation is recommended after two to three years of implementation experience and after
the irrigation components are complete, especially to assess the institutional development and sustainability
aspects of the project.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The project was very complex involving too many components, both the urban and rural sectors, and
difficult engineering and urban development issues (see section 3.4). For the engineering aspects, there
was a thorough weighing of technical alternatives, and strong technical implementation arrangements put in
place. However, the institutional arrangements were to be defined during implementation. The resources
required to finance operation and management were not assessed or agreed upon, and the lessons from the
First Urban Project, especially the need for local government development, were not taken into account.
7.2 Supervision:
There were 19 supervision missions during the ten-year implementation period. These were characterized
by a good skill mix, almost always with an engineer or urban planner and a financial analyst. There were
only four team leaders during the long supervision/ICR period. Nine missions included a municipal
financial specialist to assess institutional/financial arrangements and four missions included sociologists to
assess the resettlement component. The Bank's performance on supervision is rated marginally satisfactory
given the strong technical support from Bank missions enabling the implementation of a complex set of
engineering works under difficult circumstances. The redirection ofsewerage works from new investment
to rehabilitation also demonstrated the Bank's flexibility in a changing environment. However, when faced
with a critical 2 1/2 year suspension by AFD, the Bank did not take the opportunity to reflect fully on the
project and consider possible restructuring. There was no mid-term or other systematic review of project
objectives which continued to be judged satisfactory despite the suspension and the lack of progress on
institutional issues.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The technical design and supervision of the project was strong. However, the lack of initial sector analysis
and stock taking of previous project experience, the complexity of the project with very broad objectives
and the inadequate preparation of the institutional aspects were serious problems which could have been
mitigated or avoided. The Bank's response to the 2 1/2 year suspension by AFD was insufficient.
Therefore, overall Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory.

7.4 Preparation:
The technical aspects of the project were well prepared by the Government. The Government established
the BPPA during project preparation to manage implementation. Under the engineering loan and the
subsequent PPF, options were evaluated and project proposals were prepared with consultants with
- 8-



minimum delays.
7.5 Governnment implementation performance:
Support from Government was irregular. There were many changes in govemment which adversely
affected implementation. The inter-ministerial steering committee in charge of coordinating the project and
addressing key institutional and financial issues often failed to meet. This led todelays in the promulgation
of laws and creation of APIPA and SAMVA. There were also some delays in the provision of counterpart
funds and the signing of contracts, and the project was delayed for 2 1/2 years when the Govemment was in
arrears to AFD.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The agency generally managed well. It overcome early accounting problems which were due to the
complexity of the project (multiple donors, many components and institutions). The 1993 audit report of
BPPA indicated irregularities in accounting and inadequate control, and a committee was established to
examine this. As a result, errors in three reimbursement claims were rectified in 1994 and improvements
recommended by the auditors were introduced. Progress reports were submitted in a timely manner. The
BPPA managed well the large procurement and supervision burden at the end of the project.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
On balance, the Borrower's performance is judged generally satisfactory, especially given the complex set
of works which were well executed under difficult circumstances, with renewed efforts during the last two
years of the project after AFD resumed financing.
8. Lessons Learned
v  The full range of complex problems in large metropolitan areas need to be carefully assessed and are
unlikely to be effectively addressed with a single all-encompassing project. It would have been
preferable to undertake a review of issues and opportunities in the region in order to define a set of
priorities. Focused individual and more manageable projects with clear objectives would then be
identified to meet the priorities. Thus, when faced with a range of issues such as flood control,
agricultural development and urban development, a set of more focused, complementary projects could
achieve better results within a broader development program for the region.
*  When possible, cofinancing should be targeted to discrete projects of a larger program or to discrete,
physically unlinked components of a single project to avoid interruption when problems occur with one
cofinancier.
* Flood control projects of this magnitude require support and funding from national budgets as well as
from local sources to make sure the system will operate over the long term. Sustained commitment is
needed from high levels of government. Occasional coordinating committee meetings are not enough.
*   When projects are substantially delayed, the Bank should review the project objectives to assess
whether restructuring is advisable.
* The definition of the institutional and resource mobilization arrangements to ensure sustainability after
implementation should not be postponed until long after appraisal. Alternatives should be carefully
assessed, and an explicit plan should be agreed upon at appraisal.
-9-



*   Most types of municipal functions cannot be successfully quarantined from municipal govemments.
The development of sound municipal govemment, particularly its revenue base, is critical for
sustainability.
*   Resettlement components should be planned with clear objectives and in more detail during project
preparation to avoid delays. The capacity and will of local government to implement agreed
resettlement plans should be carefully assessed. This is especially important if living standards and
income eaming capacity are to be preserved.

Annex 3: Economic Costs and Benefits
The economic rate of return (ERR) of the project calculated at appraisal was 18%, with a lower estimate of
15% using somewhat more moderate estimates of land price increases. The appraisal used a complex
methodology for estimating an ERR for most of the project.
At completion, the irrigation component was incomplete and its benefits could not yet be quantified. The
economic benefits of the sewage, solid waste management and urban finance and management components
do not lend themselves to accurate quantification. An ex-post economic rate of return was calculated for
the flood protection and drainage components which accounts for 49% of project cost.
The calculation of benefits was based on increases in the US$ equivalent value of land prices in the 635
hectares of the southem plain affected by improvements in flood protection and drainage. The net amount
of land usable for urbanization increased from 97 hectares to 490 hectares, and land dedicated to
agriculture has decreased from 538 hectares to 97 hectares. The difference is accounted for by the 47
hectares now dedicated to infrastructure created under the project.
Much of the increase in the value of urbanizable land was due to the reduced need for costly filling in the
protected area. Although irrigation improvements have not yet been realized, agricultural land values have
increased due to improved drainage which controls water flows and enables a wider variety of crops. The
combined value of urbanizable and agricultural land in the area is estimated to have increased during the
implementation from 1992 to 1999 by about eleven-fold. In such a rapidly urbanizing area, all of the
increase in land value cannot be attributed to the flood protection and drainage works alone. Several
assumptions were tested when assessing benefits attributable to the project against the costs (see below).
The yearly capital costs in US$ net of taxes were used for the flood control and drainage works together
with prorated amounts for miscellaneous and overhead costs. Together these costs amounted to 49% of the
project costs. The projected O&M costs of APIPA were used as operating costs for a twenty-year period
extending after implementation.
With the assumption that 50% of the total increase in land values is attributable to flood protection and
drainage, these investments yield a 17% ERR If 40% of land value increases are attributable to the project
investments, the ERR would be only 11%. Conversely, if 60% of land value increases are attributed to the
project, the ERR would be 23%.
Other projects in Madagascar during the same period, such as the Social Fund II and the Antananarivo
Urban Works projects, have had as a primary objective the creation of employment. While this was not a
primary objective of this project, most of the works such as dredging canals and preparing retention ponds
were undertaken using very labor intensive techniques. It is estimated that a total of 24,250 man-months of
work were created during the last two years of project implementation when the bulk of the works were
carried out.

REPUBLIQUE DE MADAGASCAR
RAPPORT D'ACHEVEMENT
DU PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DE LA PLAINE D'ANTANANARIVO
(CREDIT 2117-MAG)
A. RAPPEL DES OBJECTIFS ET DU FINANCEMENT DU PROJET
1. Objectifs du projet
1.1    Le projet de developpement de la plaine d'Antananarivo a et initie en 1984 lorsqu'il a ete propose
que les travaux de drainage du projet eau et assainissement (credit 1002-MAG) soient realises avec
les travaux de protection de la Ville d'Antananarivo contre les crues, dans le cadre d'un seul projet
appele << projet de developpement de la plaine d'Antananarivo >).
Des etudes economiques et financieres complementaires assorties d'une etude institutionnelle ont
ete faites sous le financement PPF de l'IDA. A la suite de ces dtudes, l'IDA, conjointement avec
la Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (France), a procede en 1989 a l'evaluation
du projet.
1.2    Selon le rapport d'evaluation, le projet vise fondamentalement l'amelioration des conditions de
vie des populations pauvres vivant dans les zones basses de la ville d'Antananarivo et de sa plaine.
Les objectifs specifiques du projet sont:
-  de creer un environnement favorable A la reprise des investissements prives et A la croissance
economique dans la zone metropolitaine d'Antananarivo;
-  de consolider le developpement financier et administratif des municipalites deja entrepris dans
le cadre d'un premier projet urbain (credit 1497-MAG);
-  de mettre en place un cadre institutionnel assurant l'exploitation et l'entretien efficaces des ou-
vrages et des installations construites dans le cadre du projet lui-meme ; et
-  de rendre possible un developpement integre, urbain et rural, de la plaine d'Antananarivo.
1.3    Pour arriver A ces fins, les objectifs physiques du projet ont ete fixes comme suit:
-  foumir une protection contre les crues centennales aux quartiers peripheriques d'Antananarivo,
ainsi qu'un systeme fiable d'annonce de crues;
-  ameliorer, rehabiliter et etendre les installations de drainage et d'assainissement pour evacuer
les eaux de ruissellement et les eaux usees de la plaine sous toutes conditions, en developpant
ces installations de fa,on coherente et pleinement compatible avec les autres projets
de developpement urbain, agricole et de protection contre les inondations;
-  rehabiliter et etendre le reseau d'irrigation de la rive droite de l'Ikopa (3.000 ha).
1.4    Le projet comprend dix composantes principales:
Partie A : Digues sur l'Ikopa et dans le Nord
Partie B  Systeme d'annonce de crue
Partie C: Drainage
Partie D: Station de pompage
Partie E: Rehabilitation du systeme d'irrigation
Partie F: Assainissement urbain

2. Financement
2.1    Le projet a ete estime a 68,6 millions de dollars (taxes incluses)
dont 39 millions en devises
19,3      en FMG
10,2      de taxes
2.2    Le financement a et assure par le Gouvernement malgache avec l'appui de l'IDA (credit) et de la
France (dons et prets de la CCCE / don FAC)

B. EXECUTION DU PROJET
1. Agence d'execution
L'execution du projet a et confiee au Bureau du Projet de la Plaine d'Antananarivo, cree en decembre 1987
et place sous la tutelle du President du Faritany d'Antananarivo puis en 1993 sous celle du Ministre du
Developpement Urbain et du Tourisme (actuellement de l'Amenagement du Territoire et de la Ville). Ce
bureau assure la coordination generale de 1'execution du projet et les relations avec les bailleurs de fonds
en tant que maitre d'ouvrage delegue du Fivondronampokontany d'Antananarivo Renivohitra ou FIVREN
(actuellement Commune Urbaine d'Antananarivo) et des Ministeres charges de l'Amenagement du Terri-
toire, des Travaux Publics, des Finances et du Budget, de la Meteorologie, des Eaux et Forets et de
l'Agriculture avec lesquels il a passe des conventions de travail.
2. Ralisation physique
A l'expiration du credit IDA au 30 septembre 1999, 1'ensemble du projet n'etait realise qu'a (83%) du fait
du decalage du financement AFD qui ne s'achevera que le 31 decembre 2000 ce qui devrait permettre
d'atteindre le taux de 100% & cette date.
L'ensemble des composantes financees par l'IDA a pu etre acheve a l'exception:
- de la rehabilitation d'une partie des reseaux unitaires d'eaux usees pour laquelle il ne restait
pas un delai suffisant pour un AOI, ce qui a entraimd correlativement l'annulation de 5 millions
de DTS sur le cr6dit;
- de l'achevement de la filiere sable qui etait une operation nouvelle ajoutee a la suite de
l'dtude des bassins versants.
-22-



3. Realisation financiere
L'analyse financiere est rendue extremement difficile en raison des variations tres importantes du taux de
change A la suite de la liberation des taux de change en 1994 (taux initial 1 US$ = 1606 FMG/taux actue,
1 US$ = 6540 FMG).
Le taux de consommation du credit est le suivant:
Taux en US$
Credit initial  23 millions DTS    77,41 %
Credit modifie 18 millions DTS     95,51%
(annulation de 5 millions DTS)
Les financements du gouvemement et de 1'AFD etant encore en ccuvre, le niveau
de realisation financiere globale n'a pas de signification.
C. ANALYSE DES PERFORMANCES
1. Contexte du projet
Dans l'historique du projet, il faut distinguer trois periodes:
- 1990 A fin 1993: periode de demarrage des travaux apres levee des conditionnalites (notam-
ment libdration des emprises), marquee par la grande greve des forces vives de juin-
decembre 1991 et de nombreuses periodes electorales qui ont oblige le BPPA pour preserver
sa neutralite A ralentir les operations d'expropriation et d'eviction.
-  1994 a mai 1998 : periode de sanction financiere des institutions de Bretton Woods vis a vis
de Madagascar. La suspension des credits de I'AFD (14 janvier 1994) a entrain6 l'arret des tra-
vaux de la station de pompage sur ce financement et en consequence celui des reseaux en
amont sur le financement IDA. La reprise a pu se faire en juillet 1996 grace a une
aide budgetaire exceptionnelle de la France qui a pennis I'achevement de la station de pom-
page, inauguree en septembre 1997.
-  mai 1998 a septembre 1999, pdriode de realisation de la majeure partie des travaux. La lev6e
des contraintes exterieures a permis de demarrer les travaux restants A executer apres l'ache-
vement des longues procedures d'etablissement et d'approbation des marches.
2. Performances de l'Administration
En dehors des problemes circonstanciels rdsultant:
- des interventions de la tutelle dans la gestion autonome du BPPA (jusqu'en 1994);
-  de l'introduction de procedures supplementaires (examen des marches de 1994 a 1998 par
l'Inspection d'Etat - en 1998 par la Direction des Investissements);
- des changements de gouvernement (retard dans l'approbation des textes concemant l'APIPA
et le SAMVA);
- de l'insuffisance des fonds de contrepartie et taxes en debut de proj et jusqu'en 1997,
deux questions ont fortement influence le deroulement du projet.
2.1. Les expropriations et ivictions
Depuis la declaration d'utilite publique jusqu'A l'ordonnance d'expropriation les d6lais necessaires ont et
de 1 an (digues Ikopa) A quatre ans et demi (4,5) (bassin d'Anosibe) pour franchir les
deux etapes techniques qui seules etaient du ressort du BPPA (plans et etats parcellaires/evaluation sur le
terrain) et les six (6) etapes reglementaires du ressort des administrations.
Une des principales difficultes etait l'absence de mise a jour du cadastre dtabli en 1936, bien que celle-ci
ait et prevue dans le projet mais sa mise en ceuvre necessitait des delais tels que le BPPA n'a pu
en beneficier. Malgre l'ampleur de la tache, il a pu assurer les expropriations de 2679 parcelles et
-23-



332 constructions appartenant a pres de 600 menages (582) pour un montant d'indemnisation de
7,5 milliards de FMG.
Aux operations normales d'expropriation pour les projets neufs, il s'est ajoute les evictions indispensables
des families occupant illegalement les emprises des ouvrages A rehabiliter (digues - berges de canaux)
puisque la population considere que le Domaine Public appartenant A tous est utilisable par chacun pour
un usage prive. Les autorites ont accepte le principe d'une aide financiere, pour frais de demenagement,
aux occupants sans titre.
En vertu de la convention de travail FIVREN-BPPA, la procedure d'eviction recasement etait du ressort
du FIVREN mais le BPPA a du se substituer A lui et a eu la lourde charge d'obtenir la demolition de
1684 constructions et le depart de 2340 familles qui ont beneficie d'une aide financiere de 2,6 milliards
de FMG.
Le risque de reoccupation des emprises des ouvrages realises par le projet est reel et les autorites doivent
sans tarder:
- appliquer strictement les textes relatifs au domaine public;
- informer la population, effectuer des contr6les reguliers et prendre des sanctions immediates.
Les responsables de ces problemes A la Banque qui se sont succe&ds, sans avoir une veritable continuite
dans leurs politiques, ont impose des contraintes tres lourdes de recasement des populations que celles-ci
ne demandaient generalement pas.
2.2 Les delais de passation des marches
Les delais ont ete excessifs et la responsabilite des retards est tres largement partag6e entre les intervenants
dont les comportements ont varie dans le temps et selon le stade de leur intervention:
-  pour l'Administration, la Commission Centrale des Marches (CCM) a tres fortement reduit ses
delais d'examen passes de un mois et demi (1,5) A environ une semaine et le passage en CCM
n'a plus pose de probleme. Les autorites administratives ont demande un delai generalement
voisin de deux (2) mois pour l'approbation des marches.;
-  la Banque Mondiale a demande des delais tres variables de quinze (15) jours A trois (3) mois
pour sa non-objection aux differents stades de la preparation et de l'etablissement des marches,
mais la difficulte reside dans le nombre de non-objections demandees dans le deroulement de
la procedure (jusqu'A 4);
-  le BPPA, bien que ces ddlais ne dependent pas entierement de lui, n'a pas toujours pu reduire
les delais d'appels d'offres qui ont varie de un mois et demi (1,5) A trois mois et demi (3,5) et
surtout les delais d'analyse des offres qui ont et au minimum de un mois et demi (1,5) et ont
atteint cinq (5) mois;
L'ensemble conduit A des delais de l'ordre de huit (8) mois qui peuvent depasser douze (12) A quinze (15)
mois.
Toutefois, la sortie par la Banque de dossiers type fin 1996 a permis au BPPA de mettre au point des
modeles de dossiers d'appels d'offres et de contrats prenant en compte la reglementation locale qui ont
facilite la delivrance d'avis favorable de la CCM et de non-objection de la Banque.
II faut souligner enfin qu'A ltexception d'un appel d'offre de travaux annule pour utilisation d'une procedure
d'ouverture en deux temps, aucun contrat n'a e  rejete depuis pour non-respect des directives de la Banque.
2.3 Le renforcement des administrations
Le projet avait prevu le renforcement des deux administrations dont le bon fonctionnement
est indispensable pour le developpement de la Plaine:
-24-



-  le cadastre pour contr6ler l'dvolution du foncier. Le projet a permis de niettre en place un outil
informatise performant qui a pu etre evalue de facon tres positive lors de
son expertise finale. Malheureusement, les utilisateurs n'ont pas marque leur volonte de le
prendre effectivement en charge et d'en tirer en consequence les benefices attendus;
-  les services fiscaux pour assurer des ressources suffisantes A la commune. De grande reticences
se sont manifestdes A tous les niveaux pour faire obstacle A la realisation et A l'exploitation
des rdsultats    des    enquetes    foncieres    qui    remettaient    en    course
des situations anormalement favorables aux assujettis aux taxes. Les rdsultats de l'etude de
la pression fiscale n'ont pu etre que lies partiellement mis en ceuvre sous pretexte de mise en
place de mesures applicables au niveau national, toujours en cours d'etude.
3. Performances du BPPA (agence d'execution)
Les performances en matiere d'expropriation et d'eviction ainsi que de passation des marches ont ete vues
avec celles des administrations en raison de l'imbrication des responsabilites de ces deux parties dans ces
domaines.
3.1 Systeme d'information comptable
Le grand probleme du projet est la mise en place d'un systeme comptable multi-bailleurs, multi-monnaies
et multi-comptes. Un premier logiciel a ete mis en place par le cabinet Rindra en 1993, malgre plusieurs
tentatives d'amelioration, il n'a pas repondu aux attentes. En 1997, suite A diverses concertations, le projet
s'est dote du logiciel TOMPRO.
Ce logiciel a permis de gerer l'ensemble du projet et de ressortir tous les dtats conformes aux normes des
Bailleurs de Fonds. Le chef comptable a fait une formation en France pour une meilleure utilisation du
logiciel en juillet 1998.
11 est toutefois regrettable que le BPPA n'ait pas ete informe A ce moment sur les tableaux qu'il aurait A
presenter dans le rapport final car il aurait etd facile A l'epoque d'ajouter au logiciel un module qui aurait
permis d'assurer les ventilations necessaires, tres difficiles A effectuer A partir des donnees agregees.
Le suivi comptable a ete constamment ameliore en prenant en compte les observations des audits annuels
et des specialistes de la Banque:
en 1994 introduction de carnets de bons de commande numerotes pre coupure
en 1995 seances de formation inteme
en 1995 mise en cnuvre du manuel de procedure
3.2 Comptabilite matiere
En 1994, le BPPA a mis en place une comptabilite matiere conforme A la reglementation maigache pour
laquelle il a ete possible grace au logiciel TOMPRO d'assurer une interface avec la coinptabilitd gdndrale.
3.3 Utilisation du compte spdcial
Jusqu'en 1998, le compte special dont le niveau avait ete ramend en 1994 A 200.000 $ et qui faisait l'objet
de 5 A 6 reapprovisionnements annuels a ete relativement peu utilise (environ 20% des paiements).
Par  contre  en  1998,  son  relevement  progressif jusqu'A  1.500.000 $  et  l'accdiiration
des reapprovisionnements qui se sont eleves A 16 dans l'annee et permis de l'utiliser en priorite (environ
85% des paiements), ce qui apporte rapidite et efficacite dans les paiements.
3.4 Suivi des marche's
A partir de 1995 le BPPA a mis en place un suivi des marches sur tableur Excel et un suivi des planning
sur Microsoft Project.
-25-



3.5 Suivi de l'avancement duprojet
A la demande des responsables de la Banque, lors d'une mission du Directeur du Projet au siege en
decembre 1997, le BPPA a retenu pour chacun des 5 composantes du projet 2 A 4 indicateurs
de performance, soit au total 13 indicateurs, qui apres ponderation, ont permis de mesurer l'avancement
global du projet.
3.6 Personnel
Le BPPA a ete constitue de cadres de profils differents (ingenieurs TP, GR, agronomes, inspecteur des
Domaines, comptables, juristes et administratifs) qui ont beneficie dans le cadre du projet de formations
specialisees qui leur ont permis d'assurer leurs missions dans les meilleures conditions.
A la demande de la Banque, les effectifs, malgre l'augmentation de la charge de travail, ont 6te ramenes
de 47 (dont 13 cadres) en 1991, et A 24 (dont 11 cadres) en 1999.
4. Performance des soci6tes d'exploitation
Un des objectifs importants du projet etait la crdation de quatre (4) societes d'exploitation et
de maintenance que le BPPA a reduites A deux.
II avait ete tres fortement sous estime les delais necessaires pour l'adoption des textes reglementaires (lois
et decrets d'application) et surtout pour la mise en cruvre des mesures financieres dont une dizaine d'annees
tant il est difficile de faire perdre conscience A la population urbaine de la necessite de perdre en charge
les frais de fonctionnement et de maintenance des equipements publics a leur niveau de coat reel.
4.1 APIPA
L'APIPA a fait preuve de sa capacite technique a gerer la station de pompage, A assurer l'entretien courant
des canaux et des digues mais elle se heurte A deux difficultes resultant toutes les deux de l'absence d'une
volonte des autorites d'appliquer des mesures commutatives:
- les ressources financieres provenant des redevances dues sur les terrains remblayes auxquelles
echappent la plupart des investisseurs qui ont effectud leurs travaux sans autorisation;
- la police des ouvrages que l'APIPA ne peut assurer qu'au niveau de la construction sans qu'il
y ait application de sanctions de la part des autorites.
4.2 SAMVA
Malgre quelques annees dans l'organisation et le financement de la collecte des ordures, il reste une grande
marge d'amelioration a obtenir par une meilleure collaboration entre la Commune et le SAMVA.
Si le SAMVA a pu gerer correctement un reseau limite d'egouts qui lui avait ete transfere par la Commune,
il n'a pas pu prendre en charge convenablement le reseau rdhabilitd dans le cadre du projet en raison du
refus de la JIRAMA soutenue par sa tutelle de recouvrir la redevance du niveau de 15% convenu avec la
Commune (taux maintenu a 10%) et surtout de le porter A 25% comme le prevoit la loi instituant le
SAMVA.
5. Performance de la Banque
5.1 La passation des marches
La Banque intervient aux differents stades d'appel d'offres et de passation de marche pour donner sa non-
objection dans un dMlai tres variable ainsi que nous I'avons eu precedemment et parfois sous condition ou
sous reserve.
-26-



-  1988 a 1993 sous condition de liberation des emprises;
-  1994 a mi 1998 sous reserve de la mise en place et de la fonctionnalite des societes d'exploita-
tion et maintenance des ouvrages realis6s et sous reserves de la fonctionnalite de la station de
pompage d'Ambodimita pour les travaux d'assainissement pluvial;
-  mi 1998 a 1999 sans conditions ni rdserves.
L'installation du courrier electronique a permis d'accelerer fortement les echange de correspondance
concernant ces non-objections.
5.2 Le paiement des marches
La Banque intervient dans le bon deroulement des marches en accelerant la realisation des paiements. Dans
ce domaine, le dMlai de reapprovisionnement du Compte Spdcial a varid de 2 semaines a 4 mois.
5.3 Remarques concernant le Rapport d'Evaluation
Le Rapport d'evaluation mentionne la necessite de mise en place des institutions devant assurer la perennite
des ouvrages mais n'a pas approfondi le mecanisme a suivre.
II est vivement souhaite que la Banque Mondiale, de par sa connaissance des projets dans le monde mette
en place les instruments uniformises pour la tenue de systeme comptable multi-bailleurs, multi-monnaies
et multi-comptes capables d'etablir les etats qu'elle souhaite avoir du projet (suivi de I'Accord de Credit et
Rapport d'Achevement par rapport au Rapport d'tvaluation).
II est souhaitable aussi que les criteres de performances soient discutes et introduits dans le rapport
d'evaluation.
6. Performances des entreprises
6.1 Relation avec les entreprises
Sauf une exception (entreprise CTL pour les travaux "Tete morte du canal GR"), les entreprises ont
respecte leurs engagements et les seules resiliations ou non-approbation de contrat sont intervenues du fait
de la suppression des credits. Avec aucune entreprise, il n'y a eu de contentieux ouverts.
6.2 Refalisation des etudes
Les etudes institutionnelles sont apparues satisfaisantes (Societes d'exploitation et maintenance, Cadastre,
Pression Fiscale .. .) meme si elles nront pas generalement evalue toutes les difficultes rencontrees lors de
la mise en place et surestime les possibilites de recouvrement des redevances.
Par contre, il est apparu a la realisation beaucoup d'insuffisance dans l'etablissement des avant-projets
detailles (APD) qui ont servi de supports a l'etablissement des marches: protection contre les crues (les
APD sont en rdalitd du niveau APS), Plaine Sud (erreurs dans le dimensionnement des routes) reseaux
d'egouts (non realisables economiquement), amenagement de la ddcharge et des dep6ts d'ordures menageres
(nombreuses reprises avant travaux), voies d'acces et sites de dep6ts de sable (estimation trop faible).
6.3 Realisation des travaux
Les resultats des petites entreprises ont ete peu satisfaisants car le BPPA soumis aux regles administratives
n'6tait pas organise comme l'AGETIPA pour assurer leur encadrement et surtout leur paiement rapide, ce
qui a conduit souvent a des arrets de travaux pour insuffisance de tresorerie.
Les grandes entreprises ont du resoudre de nombreux problemes: travail dans 1'eau, emprises non liberees,
impossibilite d'interrompre la circulation en ville, existence des reseaux urbains (conduites d'eau de la
JIRAMA en particulier), reactions parfois menacantes des personnes expropriees, evincees ou simplement
-27-



genees par les travaux.
La plupart des bureaux de contr6le ont aide a la solution des problemes d'execution des travaux
et correctement assure le suivi des travaux.
Sous l'impulsion du BPPA, les entreprises ont, chaque fois que cela dtait possible, donne la preference A
l'utilisation de main d'ceuvre (travaux HIMO Haute Intensite de la Main d'Oeuvre). De mai 1998 A
juin 1999, la main d'cnuvre utilisde a atteint pres de 22.000 hommes/mois et les salaires correspondants A
6,5 milliards de FMG, soit 12% du montant des marches.
D. IMPACTS DU PROJET
Les impacts ne sont, normalement, mesurables que quelques annees apres la fin du projet. Neanmoins, if
est possible de constater des efforts du projet des maintenant.
1. Impact sur les risques d'inondation
Pour la Plaine, il y a lieu de distinguer les risques dus aux crues des rivieres (submersion ou rupture des
endiguements) et ceux dus aux inondations par la pluie.
La commune urbaine d'Antananarivo ne sera plus inondee par effet de debordement ou de rupture de digue
pour une crue centennale augmentant de 50 A 100 ans la periode de retour d'inondation de la majeure partie
de la plaine. Le reseau de drainage du polder avec la station de pompage d'Ambodimita permet d'abaisser
les niveaux d'inondation par les precipitations de 0,80 A I m pour des pluies decennales.
Par contre, la rehabilitation de la digue rive droite de l'Ikopa provoquera une augmnentation des inondations
sur le val rive gauche de l'Ikopa, pour des pdriodes de retour comprises entre 50 et 100 ans.
2. Impact sur l'hygiene dans les bas quartiers
L'abaissement des eaux du canal Andriantany evite non seulement le debordement du canal et l'inondation
des habitations riveraines mais aussi pennet le denoyage des egouts qui debouchent dans le canal.
La rehabilitation du reseau d'assainissement des eaux usees avec les differentes stations de pompage, a
permis d'assainir les bas quartiers (Place Andrianjaka, Isotry et 67 ha ...). La remise en fonctionnement du
rdseau separatif d'eaux usdes en canalisations etanches a donne A ces quartiers A forte densite de population
des conditions sanitaires meilleures, et a contribue A enrayer la pollution des lacs, bassins et canaux A ciel
ouvert. La pollution du canal Andriantany sera diminuee, surtout en periode d'tetiage, par l'injection d'un
debit sanitaire de 2 m3/s. Par contre, le rejet direct sur l'Ikopa, sans traitement ni meme pre-traitement,
augmentera substantiellement la pollution de cette riviere.
Un meilleur impact du projet sur l'assainissement aurait ett obtenu avec une extension des travaux de
rehabilitation au reseau d'assainissement des eaux pluviales.
3. Impact sur la qualite des eaux d'argile des rivieres
Les rizieres, auparavant irriguees par le canal Andriantany devenu un collecteur d'assainissement urbain,
recoivent maintenant les eaux du canal GR directement alimente par la riviere Ikopa A l'amont du polder,
et ne sont plus polluees par les eaux d'egouts. Cela reduit les risques pour les exploitants agricoles qui
travaillent dans l'eau et pour les cultures.
4. Impact sur le risque paludeen
Les canaux et les bassins ont un impact sanitaire positif en contribuant A la lutte contre le paludisme. Le
maintien d'un plan d'eau permanent avec une profondeur minimale et le contr6le du systeme hydraulique
freinent la prolifdration des moustiques en favorisant les organismes predateurs de larves.
-28-



5. Impact sur la nappe phreatique
L'abaissement du niveau de I'Andriantany, le dragage des egouts et la reduction de la pollution des lacs,
bassins et canaux reduisent les risques d'infiltration d'eaux polluees dans la nappe phreatique.
Le niveau general de la nappe n'a pas ete modifie car le systeme de drainage n'a d'effet que localement sur
les eaux superficielles.
6. Impact sur la securisation des quartiers
Malgre le bouleversement social occasionne par le deplacement de population, il faut noter que le projet,
par l'enlevement des habitations illicites le long du canal Andriantany et du canal des 67 ha qui sont parmi
les plus precaires et insalubres de la capitale, a contribue a la securisation de certains quartiers a hauts
risques en ce qui concerne le banditisme et la drogue.
7. Impact sur l'urbanisation
La polderisation de la Plaine d'Antananarivo garantit sa protection contre les crues centennales au lieu de
cinquantennales. Le canal C3 et tous ses ouvrages sont dimensionnes pour 1'6vacuation des eaux de pluie
de toute la Plaine Sud pendant la pdriode de fermneture des vannes le long des digues de l'Ikopa, de la
Mamba. La station de pompage d'Ambodimita permet d'abaisser le niveau des plus hautes eaux dans la
plaine polderisee de 0,80 a 1,00 metres. Les consequences sont une amrlioration du niveau de securite
pour tout investissement existant ou futur. Les investisseurs qui voudront construire sur
les parties autorisees de la plaine apres amenagement pourront reduire la hauteur de remblai, de meme
grandeur que l'abaissement des eaux.
En contrepartie, l'inflation galopante des prix fonciers fait craindre actuellement la speculation.
L'administration doit etablir au plus vite les regles pour creer des reserves foncieres pour les ouvrages
d'utilite publique.
L'administration a declare la totalite de la plaine sud urbanisable au fur et a mesure de la realisation des
infrastructures d'assainissement pluvial. Mais, deux casiers seulement sont actuellement draines (casiers
d'Andavamamba et d'Anosibe) et les autres casiers sont menaces par une urbanisation anarchique qui
rendra difficile, voire impossible un drainage satisfaisant comme il a pu etre constate pour la Plaine Nord.
La bande de roulement des voies digue qui delimitent ces casiers, malgre une emprise de 20 m, a ete limit6e
a 6 m. L'impact positif sur la circulation dans la capitale n'est pas a demontrer. Par contre ces routes en
ville sont tres dangereuse en raison de leur largeur limitee et de la presence d'un talus en contre bas.
8. Impact sur le cadre de vie
Le curage du lac Anosy a un effet positif sur sa fonction de bassin d'orage. Mais la proprete du site a
surtout un effet psychologique favorable sur les gens de la capitale. De meme la rehabilitation des bacs a
ordures a aussi permis de sensibiliser la population a la proprete de la ville.
E. CONCLUSIONS
Malgre les resultats ddja obtenus grace au projet, il est important de completer ou poursuivre certains
travaux pour que les objectifs puissent etre effectivement atteints globalement.
1. Securisation contre les inondations
La correction de l'impact negatif pour la rive gauche de la protection de la rive droite est une mesure
indispensable. Elle comprendra:
-29-



1.1 Projet institutionnel de reglementation des zones inondables
Un appui aux communes riveraines de I'Ikopa pour la mise en cnuvre de la reglementation des zones
inondables a la suite de l'etablissement de la cartographie de ces zones par SOGREAH sur fmancement de
l'AFD.
1.2 Projet d'amenagement du Val d'Inondation Rive Gauche
Differents travaux de renforcement de digues de construction de sections fusibles, d'amenagement de
chenaux d'dcoulement de crues, allongement de ponts, passages d'eau et reamndnagement de perimetres
irrigables A conserver pour I'epandage des crues.
2. Am6lioration de 1'environnement urbain
Compte tenu de l'importance des programmes concernant l1environnement urbain qui etait neglige depuis
des annees, il faut programmer immediatement de nouvelles tranches si l'on ne veut pas retomber dans la
situation de stagnation qui a precede le projet.
2.1 Interventions urgentes
Deux operations urgentes qui n'ont pu etre realisees dans le cadre du projet ont fait d'une requete de
Monsieur le Maire aupres de l'IDA:
-  la mise en place d'au moins un pre-traitement des eaux usees avant rejet dans l'Ikopa (objet de
l'tude de TECSULT);
- I'acquisition d'un pousseur pour la decharge d'Andralanitra (une des conclusions de N&tude
faite par Didier ROUMENS sur l'expertise sur les ordures menageres).
2.2 Projet d'assainissement des zones urbanisees
L'amelioration de Vassainissement urbain dans la zone polderisee doit comprendre
en priorite l'assainissement pluvial des casiers de la Plaine Sud en cours d'urbanisation, et la rehabilitation
des rdseaux unitaires non concernes par les travaux du BPPA dans les quartiers centraux (TsaralalAna,
Behoririka) dont le programme a etd etabli conjointement par la Commune, le SAMVA et le BPPA.
2.3 Projet d'amenagement des casiers urbanisables
II faut envisager la poursuite de l'amenagement des casiers de la plaine Sud selon le schema d'urbanisation
etabli et selon le rythme d'urbanisation des casiers amenagds, ainsi que leur extension a la Plaine Nord
etudiee par BCEOM sur financement AFD.
3. Perennisation des infrastructures
La mise en place de societes d'exploitation et de maintenance n'est que le premier pas dans l'objectif
prioritaire de perennisation des installations existantes qui doit aller de pair avec la realisation de nouvelles
installations. II faut actuellement consolider leurs ressources, developper leurs competences dans leurs
domaines des infrastructures hydrauliques et des services publics et parallelement obtenir une meilleure
implication de la Commune Urbaine d'Antananarivo en matiere d'urbanisme.

Note de commentaires de I'Agence
sur l'ICR de la Banque Mondiale concernant
le Projet de D6veloppement de la Plaine d'Antananarivo
1. Nous ne partageons pas forc6ment l'avis qu'il <n'6tais pas judicieux de
s'aftaquer A tous les problemes dans le cadre d'un merne projet >>.
Le fond du probilme est que tout ce qui touche a I'amenagement de la plaine exige
de prendre en compte une multitude d'aspects (hydraulique d'assainissement,
gestion de l'urbanisation, hydraulique agricole, s6curite civile, organisations
institutionnelles diverses, fiscalite, etc.). Aussi, le point central ne nous semble pas
d'agir en un seul ou en plusieurs projets distincts, mais bien de disposer pour
l'am6nagement de la Plaine d'Antananarivo d
coordination op6rationnelle des actions.
Le BPPA a au moins dispose au cours du projet d'une certaine vue d'ensemble des
problemes et d'une capacit6 de coordination. Nous parlons d'une capacite, car
dans les faets, cette coordination fonctionne tres mal. Vouloir A I'avenir intervenir
par des projets distincts et multiplier les interlocuteurs risque de ne pas faciliter le
renforcement de cette capacite de vision globale et de coordination.
2 Nous sommes tout A fait d'accord que le dispositif institutionnel tel qu'imagin6
initialement ne donne pas de bonnes garanties de viabilit a moyen terme des
investissements consentis.
Concernant le r8le des associations d'usagers pour la maintenance des r6seaux, il
nous semble  important de considerer que  I'agriculture dans  la plaine
d'Antananarivo est avant tout l /e partenaire d'une operation dans laquelle elle joue
un role qui n'est pas seulement de production, economiquement d'ailleurs aux
limites, mais aussi [et surtout] d'amenagement '. Par ailleurs, il convient de
rappeler que le choix de maintenir une fonction agricole dans la plaine repondait
aussi A un objectif social de maintien de revenus peri-urbains (la suppression de la
fonction d'irrigation du canal Andriantany k des fins d'assainissement sans
proposition de remplacement revenait a condamner a court terme la production de
4500 a 6000 tonnes de riz paddy par an)
Dans le cadre du projet sous revue, la logique d'amenagement de la plaine
consiste A maintenir le plus longtemps possible des zones agricoles d'epandages
de crues. Toutefois, tous le monde convient que l'urbanisation de la plaine
(particufierement au sud de la riviere Mamba) paraTt aujourd'hui ineluctable, et qu'il
s'agit donc d'une approche dynamique : on cherche A gagner du temnps en facilitant
l'agriculture qui maintient des points bas ouj les crues trouvent A s'(pandre.
Extrait du premier Rapport de l'AREF par M.COULBOIS - < ETUDE PROSPECTIVE DE UORGANISATION A
METTRE EN PLACE A UACHEVEMENT DU PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DE LA PLAINE DANTANANARIVO  - Juillet
1999.
00312000                                       -                   NOTEAU-1

AFD                                                                      2
Par ailleurs, il paraft evident aujourd'hui que les agriculteurs ne peuvent a eux seuls
assumer des engagements financiers generes par cette fonction de maintien de
points bas qui profite par ailleurs a l'ensemble de la collectivit urbaine2.
i1 semblerait donc plus equitable que le coat de maintenance des infrastructures
hydro-agricoles soit pris en charge par Ia collectivit6.
De meme faire supporter aux seuls auteurs de remblais de la plaine la charge
d'entretien d'infrastructures de protection contre les inondations qui b6n6ficient A
l'ensemble de la collectivite parait particulierement inequitable (en plus de ne pas
generer de ressources financieres suffisantes).
3. Selon nous les enseignements A tirer et les recommandations que l'on peut
emettre pour I'avenir pourraient 6tre aussi les suivants
- Necessit6 d'une capacit6 de reflexion prospective pour l'am6nagement de la
grande agglomeration d'Antananarivo.
A ce jour il n'existe pas de document de o< reflexion d'ensemble sur le
d6veloppement d'Antananarivo ) et encore moins de a document ayant un poids
juridique suffisant pour s'opposer aux pratiques d'urbanisation sauvage )).
- N6cessit6 d'une concertation I coordination au plan local malgache des
initiatives entreprises par tous les intervenants (institutionnels et de la
socitei civile - ONG -) concemant la grande agglomeration d'Antananarivo
dans des domaines tres divers.
* hydraulique de plaine (drainage et irrigation),
* hydraulique urbaine,
* voiries de desserte, de contournement et de liaison avec le reseau national,
* implantation de logements sociaux ou non,
* renovation des quartiers degrades,
* mise & des conditions sanitaires convenables de lthabitat existant.
* Etc.
En outre ce processus de concertation doit mecaniquement d6boucher sur des
mesures de coordination, de sorte qu'il manque A l'agglomeration d'Antananarivo
un centre de decision capable de promouvoir ou de s'opposer a des initiatives
selon qu'elles sont favorables ou nWfastes A la coherence des actions deja
entam6es.
Par ailleurs, une concertation ne peut-Atre valablement menee sans syst6me
d'information permettant de connaitre et de suivre les intervenants en presence et
le resultat de leurs actions. Or ('agglomeration d'Antananarivo ne dispose toujours
pas d'un vrai systeme de suivi 6valuation de l'am6nagement de la plaine.
2 a C'est a ce stade qu'il faut alors se pencher sur [les] facu(tAs contributives [du FIBTAMA, du Faritany et
des agriculteurs] et faire le constat qu'aujourd'hui, seul I'Etat et la CUA ont des budgets [..] qui sont
compatibles... >. M.COULBOIS opus cit6.

- Monter et faire fonctionner un dispositif op6rationnel pour assurer la
maintenance, le suivi et la police des ouvrages.
Outre la mise a disposition des budgets n6cessaires, il convient de mettre en place
a un service de capacite suffisante o pour etre l'interlocuteur de lAPIPA et du
SAMVA afin d'assurer (( un contr6le et un encadrement strict de leur mode de
fonctionnement )>.
4. Concemant le chapitre 7.5. a performance de I'Emprunteur en matiere
d'execution x, on peut quand mdme regretter la faible capacite de coordination et
de mise en commun de l'information de l'Etat malgache, qui dans un projet
multisectoriel comme celui de I'am6nagement de la plaine d'Antananarivo a port6
pr6judice a la rapidite et I'efficacite d'execution des investissements..
5. Concernant la gestion du projet avec les co-financiers, on peut regretter que les
missions de supervisions de la Banque Mondiale et de I'AFD ne soient jamais
parvenues A partir de 1998 a se coordonner pour etre r6alisees au meme moment
et donner lieu a des revues communes.
6. Remarques de forme:
Dans tout le texte il convient de remplacer par <<AFD > les sigles <( CCCE > et
<( CFD > qui correspondent a ses d6nominations anterieures.
