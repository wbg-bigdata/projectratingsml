                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress is satisfactory and it is anticipated that the development objectives would be achieved by the closing date. Due to its inclusive approach, the project directly
                         targets 4,552 beneficiaries in 138 chiogs in the nine project-funded geogs. Documentation of SLM best practices has been completed and provides a valuable tool in the
                         understanding, replication and promotion of SLM practices in Bhutan. The targets for converting degraded and vulnerable forest, grazing and agricultural lands, and shifting cultivation
                         lands to more sustainable forms of land use have been met or exceeded.
