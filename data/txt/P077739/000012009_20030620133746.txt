                  SECONDPOVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                     PROGRAMDOCUMENT

1.     The Government of Albania realizes that continued progresstoward its reform agenda is
needed to promote economic growth and to reduce poverty and has requested assistance from
IDA for the implementation of its associated National Strategy for Social and Economic
Development (NSSED, the Government's designation for its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper).
The purpose of this Program Document (PD) is to seek the approval of Bank management to
proceedwith the appraisal of the Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-2, P077739)
for Albania in the amount of US$l8.0 million equivalent. This operation is consistent with the
Country Assistant Strategy (CAS) of the World Bank Group for Albania (Report no. 24189-
ALB), datedMay 28,2002.

2.     This Program Document discusses Albania's recent economic performance and its
prospects. It then elaborates the objectives and policy measures included in the Government's
NSSED,progressinimplementationofthe PRSCprogram supportingthe NSSED,andactionsto
be supported by the PRSC-2.             Finally, the PD presents an overview of the rationale,
arrangements, benefits, andrisks of the proposedoperation.

                                         I.THEPRSC-1PROGRAM

3.     The PRSC-1 (P069935) was the first of three single tranche programmatic operations,
and was approved by the Board on June 20, 2002 (Report No. 24175-ALB). It supported the
Government's National Strategy for Social and Economic Development' (November 200l),
which focused on the creation of private sector opportunities, human capital development, and
public sector reform. The basic design of the PRSC-1 aimed to address cross-cutting issues in
policy development and public expenditure management, as well as sectoral reform priorities to
improve critical dimensions of social service delivery.

4.     The mainachievementsunder the NSSEDandPRSC-1 programsinclude:

           Maintenance of a satisfactory macro-economic framework, which continues to be
           supportedunder the IMF's PRGF program (see SectionI1below).

           Satisfactory implementation of a pension reform package, including substantial
           increasesinthe normal retirement age and other parametric reforms to support system
           sustainability (these initial changes will reduce the pension related deficit by a
           projected 1.2percent of GDP annually over the longterm).

           Strengthened capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda, including
           institutional reforms and preparation (and recent delivery) of the country's national
           census andfirst Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS).

1Albania's PRSP was prepared as the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) and then launched in
November 2001as the National Strategy for Social and Economic Development.

5.      The longer term impact of these reforms will be assessed as the PRSC program
progresses. There i s no doubt that substantial gaps remain inthe capacity o f the Government to
formulate and implement its policy agenda, and the focus o f the PRSC program (and the current
CAS) on public sector reforms therefore remains a critical element o f Bank involvement in
Albania. This particularly pertains to Bank support for the Government's efforts to strengthen
policy monitoring and evaluation (with increasing reference to the Millennium Development
Goals - see Box 1) as well as the continued progress the Government has made in increasing
accountability, including the internal audit law, and in strengthening the public expenditure
management process, in particular the implementation o f the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF). Civil service reform and fiscal decentralization continue to present major
challenges, and there are pressing issues and investment needs inmany o f the key economic and
social sectors.

6.      Similarly, there are concerns that while an increase for the priority NSSED sectors of
education and health was budgeted for FY02, the executed budget for FY02 appears below that
inFYO1, inpart due to a major revision inthe fiscal framework (agreed with the IMF) due to
lower than expected receipts from privatization.     The Government appears to have made some
efforts to protect the relative position o f those sectors inthe budget, though it did put a higher
priority on strengthening local accountability through an increase in the unconditional grant to
local governments. The Ministry o f Finance submitted a letter to IDA on May 8,2003 outlining
the most recent information on public expenditure trends, including expenditures on priority
NSSED sectors. The overall trend since 2000 has been to increase expenditures on NSSED
priorities, despite the 2002 drop, and there are new commitments in the downstream MTEF
program to address under-financing. While some o f the causes behind the reductions are
understandable (especially weak public expenditure monitoring systems, rapid changes in the
2002 fiscal position, and reductions in foreign financing for the social sectors), the PRSC
program has been modified to strengthen oversight o f the NSSED expenditure program,
including the introduction o f newpublic expenditure tracking surveys inhealth and education.

7.      Still, Bank staff working on the PRSC program view the PRSC-1 as a step forward
towards diagnosing and addressing the main socio-economic issues facing Albania.               The
Program Document o f PRSC-1 contained not only actions agreed to be taken under that
operation, but also measures to be taken duringthe subsequent PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 operations.
The PRSC-2 will seek to build on the progress made under the PRSC-1, while addressing any
shifts inpriorities impliedby the NSSED Update. Inother words, the PRSC aims to consolidate
and strengthen the reform program and its further development is being reflected inthe NSSED
update.

8.      Fulfillment o f the triggers for PRSC-2 and proposed changes in actions for Board
presentation are summarized inTable 1. These are largely as follows:

  Development The proposed measuresrelatedto private sector and rural development
  have been strengthened, based on the results of the "Administrative Barriers Study"
  and the new Albania Rural Development Strategy. Both documents were finalized
  after Board presentation o f PRSC-1. For presentational reasons, the social insurance
  reforms have been shifted, in agreement with the authorities, to Component 3, but no
  changes instrategy have been introduced.

  Obiective 2: Strengthening Capacitv to Monitor and Evaluate the Policy Agenda The
  proposed actions were updated as presented in Table 1 to reflect the Government's
  rapidprogress on the NSSED monitoring agenda.

0 Obiective 3 Improving Service Delivery and Social Safety Net Effectiveness The
  component has incorporated the social insurance reforms as noted above, and those
  reforms have beenpresented insome further detail.

  Obiective 4: Improving Core Public Sector Functions and Institutional Arrangements:
  Additional measures have been proposed, with the objective to increase the
  accountability o f high public officials. Other measures were modified to reflect the
  progress inthe relevant reform areas. Those are summarized inTable 1.

A.       Economic Policies and Performance

9.       The Albanianeconomy has gone through different phases of development since the beginning
of its transition to a market economy in 1991. The early transition years experienced a sharp
contraction of real GDP and high inflation. This was followed by a significant economic recovery
and declining inflation, with both the current account balance and the fiscal deficit improving
significantly. The collapse of the large pyramid investment schemes in 1997 brought a sharp
contraction in growth and a large increase in inflation. The economy rebounded inthe aftermath of
the 1997 crisis and inflation was brought under control with the adoption of a post-crisis recovery
program supportedby the international financial community. In 1999, the influx of Kosovo refugees
put a heavy strain on Albania's economic and administrative capacity. However, the economy was
able to weather the storm with strong support from the donor community. By the end of the 1990s,
Albania had roughly regained its 1990 GDP level, inflation had been brought under control and the
current account and the domestically financed fiscal deficit had improved significantly (see Figures 1
and 2).

10.      Despite the macroeconomic achievements, poverty remains pervasive. Per capita income in
Albania (around US$1,380 in2002), is one of the lowest among transition economies. This reflected
Albania's difficult conditions at the outset of the transition, the drastic recessioninthe early years of
the transition (of about 40 percent of 1989 GDP), and the 1997 civil unrest and the resulting




 For a detailed discussiono f the Albanian economy during the early years of transition see "Albania Beyond the Crisis,"
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), December 1998. The "Public Expenditure and Institutional Review", April
2001, elaborates on the more recentdevelopments inthe economy since the CEM, in particular fiscal developments.

contraction in GDP. Even the sustained estimated annual growth o f 9 percent during 1993-96 and 7
percent during 1998-2001 provedunable to overcome these handicaps3.

11.       Structural reforms have also advanced significantly since the late 1990s. Immediately after
the 1997 collapse, a new banking law was passed and a privatization strategy was developed. Since
then, trade has been liberalized,             the privatization o f small and medium enterprises has been
completed, and there are only few enterprises inthe services sector that need to be privatized. These
include the fixed-line telecommunication company; the Savings Bank, the largest state-owned bank;
and the INSIG, the state-owned insurance company. The privatization program for these enterprises
i s currently under preparation in close consultation with international financial institutions.
Privatization o f these enterprises would not only attract foreign investors, but would in many cases
also improve the condition of infkastructure services, which are crucial for attracting foreign and
domestic private investors. The Government has also adopted a new bankruptcy law and a deposit
insurance scheme. The registry on movable property has been established and progress has been
made in developinga land market. Significant steps have also been taken in the area o f public
administration: a comprehensive civil service law has been adopted; a wage structure has been
developed; a medium term expenditure framework has been put in place; the legal and judicial
capacities have been strengthened; accountability rules have been tightened; and an anti-corruption
action planhas been revised andi s under implementation.

12.       Albania's strong macroeconomic performance has continued over the last three years. GDP
registered a 7.7 percent growth in 2000, but declined 6.8 percent in 2001, due mainly to power
outages and the slowdown inthe world economy after September 11. GDP growth further declined
to less than 5 percent in 2002, due to a reduction in public investment, continuation o f the energy
crisis, political uncertainty, and a slow down in reforms, including the privatization o f enterprises?
Cost push factors have put upward pressure on prices since mid 2001. Inflation, which was 3.5
percent in 2001, peaked to 7 percent in early 2002, due mainly to higher fuel prices and some food
items. Inflation declined to 2.1percent by end 2002 and i s projected to amount to 3 percent in2003.




  Albania's GDP figures should be treated with caution; they are not based on any national accounts, and there are
no reliable private sector activity and investment data.
4 The official GDP figures only cover inadequate private and informal sector activity. Government has recently
changed its methodology for calculating GDP. While agriculture production is directly estimated, the growth in
other sectors is measured on the basis o f a new sales index, supplemented by several sector specific indicators (e.g.
electricity).

13.     The fiscal deficit and money supply have remained well within the agreed monetary and
budgetary targets in the recent years. Despite slippages in revenue collection and shortfalls in
privatization receipts, the overall fiscal deficit has been on a declining trend from 8.9 percent of
GDP in 2000, to 8.2 percent in 2001, and to 6.9 percent in 2002. As a result, domestic borrowing
has been contained at around 3 percent o f GDP.                                              The 2003 budget assumes lower tax and
privatization receipts than originally anticipated, with the overall budget deficit falling to 6.4 percent
of GDP. On the external sector, stronger than expected imports (of fuel and electricity generators)
ledto aworsening of the trade balancein2001. However, the current account balance improved due
to exceptionally high private remittances stimulated by the inflow of euro area cash held by
Albanians working abroad. With remittances projected at a normal level, the current account deficit
increasedfrom 6.1 percent of GDP in2001, to 9.1 percent o f GDP in 2002, and is projected at 8.6
percent of GDP in 2003. Albania's balance of payments continues to rely heavily on remittances
and official capital flows, which are prone to politicaland external shocks.

B.      Key Issues

14.     One o fthe key aspects o f economic policy inAlbania has beenthe strict maintenance o f fiscal
discipline since the second half o f the 1 9 9 0 ~As a result, the fiscal deficit has been reduced and
                                                           ~
there has been a significant decline inthe level o f domestic financing o f the budget deficit, resulting
from a moderate increase in revenues and strict limits on expenditures. Despite these improvements,
a number o f fiscal challenges remain. Direct taxes constitute a small share o f total taxes, and the
collection o f the VAT has fallen short o f its potential in recent years. Total revenues as a share of
GDP remain significantly lower in Albania than in most other transition economies, despite
comparable tax rates. This i s a reflection o f poor tax administration and significant tax evasion.
Total expenditures have been on the rise, butthe quality o f expenditures, particularly those insupport
o f poverty reduction objectives, needs significant improvement. Interest payments on domestic debt,
although declining steadily, still account for a large share (14.5 percent) o f current expenditures6.

15.     Albania needs to maintain fiscal sustainability to ensure sustained growth and steady decline
inpoverty. Continuedadherenceto fiscal disciplineto further reduce the budgetdeficit isnecessaryin
the coming years. The challenge is to sustain a fiscal deficit that i s compatible with low levels of
inflation and public debt, while allowing the necessary financing for key investment expenditures,
social services, and targeted support for the poor and the vulnerable. To ensure fiscal and debt
sustainability, there is a need to further reduce the budget reliance on domestic borrowing inorder to
lower the highdomestic debt burden. Reduced interest expenditures will free additional resources for
priority areas without increasing the overall expenditures. This will require strong revenue efforts as
well as inflows o f foreign assistance to support Albania's public investment needs. Fiscal
sustainability also requires development and implementation of a comprehensive pension reform
program so as to reduce its reliance on budgetary transfers. A second-round o f pensionreform started
in2002 with the objective to address the overall long term problems of the coverage, affordability,
equity, and adequacy. These would require appropriate measures to improve the efficiency of
operations o f the institutions in charge o f the public pensions, introduce changes in the structure o f
rural pensions, and create incentive for private organizations that offer voluntary and supplementary
pensions.

 16.     Strict fiscal discipline needs to be combined with better allocation and more efficiency of
public expenditures. Within the overall resource envelope, there is a need to improve the allocation
o f expenditures in line with strategic objectives identified in the NSSED.                     The Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF), adopted in 2000, which aims to improve the strategic resource
allocation and the efficiency o f resource use, needs to be fully integrated with the NSSED process
and other initiatives, such as the Stabilization andAssociation process and the fiscal decentralization.
Efforts should be directed at improving service delivery and at better orienting public spending
toward NSSED priorities. While education and health care expenditures need to be given more
priority, social protection transfers need to be rationalized to ensure the delivery o f effective social
 assistancethrough cash and community-based service programs.



  For detailed analysis of fiscal developments during the 1990s see "Albania-Public Expenditure and Institutional
 Review" World Bank, April 2001.
  In 2002 the share of interest expenditures in current expendituresdropped to 14.4 percent, after averagingmore
 than 25 percent during 1997-2000.This reduction was largely due to significantly lower interest rates on treasury
 bills.

                                                        10

17.     Concurrent with these measures, capacities for policy development and monitoring need to
be strengthened to improve policy evaluation, while closer linkages between policy objectives and
expenditures needs to be developed and strengthened. Accountability mechanisms need to be further
strengthened to allow Albania to fight corruption, encourage highlevels o f investment, particularly
foreign direct investment, maintain fiscal discipline, and ensure that resources are used efficiently
and transparently.    Attainment o f these objectives would be crucial not only to sustain growth and
reduce poverty but also to facilitate integration into the European economy.

18.     The political and administrative changes in mid 2002 temporarily slowed down foreign and
domestic investment as well as reform efforts directed at strengthening governance and increasing
private sector growth. Concerns about continued weak governance and the poor business climate
were fwrther supported by recent data from the second Business Environment and Enterprise
Performance Survey (BEEPS), covering the period 1999-2002, which showed an increase in
perceived administrative corruption and state capture inAlbania compared to the first BEEPS, which
covered the period 1996-1999. Continued implementation and deepening o f key reform measures are
critical for improving the overall climate for growth andprivate sector development. The weak world
markets together with legal and financial disputes have slowed down the privatization o f the Savings
Bank and Albtelekom. The Government needs to resolve these disputes since privatization of these
institutions is key to improving their services. As part o f efforts to increase private sector activities,
the Government also needs to continue strengthening the supervisory capacities of the Bank o f
Albania while encouraging more competitionamong the banks.

19.      Reforms inthe energy sector are also necessary for improving the performance and efficiency
o f that sector as the extensive load shedding and power outages cause a fall in industrial production
and national output. The Government has adopted an action planto reduce losses, increase collection,
modify tariff structure, and promote the use of alternative energy sources including gas (LPG). The
Government has made progress inreformingthe sector, but a serious draught has caused considerable
disruptive outages during the last two years. As a result, higher than plannedelectricity imports have
put additional pressure on the budget. Actions are being taken to ensure a reliable supply of
electricity, lack o f which has become an obstacle to growth more recently. In particular, the
Government needs to accelerate installation o f meters and sustain the efforts for disconnection o f
non-payers and illegal connections, and for organizational improvements o f the power company. The
Government also needs to gradually phase out the subsidy for electricity imports.


C.       Macroeconomic Outlook

20.      Albania's prospects for growth, development and poverty reduction are good, especially in
view o f a more favorable and stable political climate inSoutheastern Europe and enhanced prospects
for a closer association with the European Union. Further slowdown inmajor world economies is not
expected to have a significant short-term impact on Albanian growth prospects, because Albania's
exports and private capital inflows are still limited.       In the medium term, economic growth is
projected to remain strong, with GDP growing by about 5 percent a year (Table 2). An increase in
exports and private sector activities i s expected to lead growth in the next three years. Albania's
strong growth should contribute to attracting more investment, generating income-earning
opportunities and reducing poverty (see Box 1). Prospects for growth, however, critically hinge on:
addressing the energy sector problems and continued implementation o f structural reforms,


                                                   11

particularly those directed at improving governance, removing obstacles for businesses, and fostering
greater private sector activities.

21.     Export growth is expected to strengthen following the transfer o f key enterprises to strategic
foreign investors as well as increases in exports o f manufactured (e.g. shoes and textiles) and
agricultural products. Albania's trade regime is open and the Government has developed an export
promotion strategy to boost the level o f exports. Albania is finalizing the Free Trade Agreements that
it has signed with 7 o f its neighboring countries. Increases intrade as a result of these agreements is
expected to promote domestic production and also help increase exports.            Imports are projected to
grow, but at a slower pace than exports, reflecting a higher demand for capital equipment associated
with stronger investment activities. As a result, the current account deficit is projected to decline to
more sustainable levels duringthe next few years.

22.     The overall fiscal deficit is projected to decline from 6.9 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 5.3
percent in 2006. With the expected reduction inthe inflow of grants and concessional loans, Albania
will need to rely on increased domestic revenues to sustain an adequate level o f public investment
and to increase spending on priority sectors.                Budget revenues, which are significantly below
potential, are expected to increase by 3 percentage points of GDP during2002-2006 due to continued
efforts to improve tax and customs administration. As a result, there would be a significant reduction
indomestic borrowing to under 3 percent of GDP, which will reduce the domestic debt burdenfrom
38.4 percent o f GDP by end 2002 to about 33 percent by end 2006.

                                           OnPoverty Reduction


The implications of the PRSC macroeconomicframework on Albania povertyreduction have beenassessed by
using the Poverty Analysis and MacroeconomicSimulator (PAMS) model, preparedby PRMPR. The model
links projections of the macro framework of PRSC2 to the Albania's household consumption distribution
pattern. This patternhas beengenerated from the 2002 LSMS inAlbania. Based on that survey it is estimated
that about 25.4 percent of the population, about 780,000 individuals, live in poverty. Poverty intensity and
severity are estimated at 5.7 and 1.9 percent respectively (see tables 3,4,5).

Based on the PRSC2 macro framework, GDP is projectedto grow by 5 percent a year during 2003-06 (see
table 2). Implications of this growth rate on poverty depends on how growth is distributed across all
consumptiondeciles. Simulations prepared, using the above mentionedmodel, indicate that with the 5 percent
growth, and based on current consumptiondistribution pattern, poverty incidence would likely drop from 25.4
percent in2001 (base year) to 19.4 percent in2006. Similarly, poverty intensity and severity is likely to drop
from 5.7 percent and 1.9 percent in 2001 to 3.8 percent and 1 percent respectively in 2006. The simulations
also indicate that if the projected growth rate is not matched by a corresponding increase in employment,
poverty would likely decline at a much lower rate.

23.      ResourceRequirements Inthe next several years, Albania will need substantial financial
resources to complete its economic reform program and to maintain output growth and
 investment as well as a prudent level o f international reserves. The preliminary estimates
 indicate that between 2003-06, the external financing needs would be about US$2.2 billion to
 finance non-interest current account deficit (of about US$1.9 billion), to honor debt service
 payments (of US$185 million), and to maintainnet international reserves to about 4.5 months o f
 imports. These figures are also consistent with the balance o f payment financing gaps estimated
 by the Government and the IMF. The financing requirements for the 2003 budget amount to
 $353 million. O f this, external sources are expected to contribute $196 million. This amount
 includes donor grants and multilateral and bilateral support, o f which IDA financing is $58
 million.    Domestic resources (including privatization revenues) are expected to provide the
 remainder. Although the medium term external debt is expected to increase in the next few
 years, debt indicators will remain manageable since much o f it will remain on concessional
 terms. The Government policy is to limit external borrowing mainly to sources that offer

                                                        13

financing on concessional terms.      The authorities have also started negotiations with the Paris
Club and other external creditors and plan to speed up these efforts to regularize arrears with
those creditors.


        111. SUPPORTING ALBANIA'SCOMPREHENSIVEPOVERTY                 REDUCTIONSTRATEGY

A. Poverty inAlbania

24.     A 2002 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) has been completed, and the
data is now available.    This i s the first nationally representative household survey for Albania
collecting comprehensive information for the construction o f a full monetary measure o f welfare.
The data from the LSMS cannot be used to set trends with earlier incomplete survey efforts, but
it is a major step forward inestablishing a solid baseline for poverty monitoring and inhelpingto
understand householdbehavior and evaluate social policies. Usingan incomplete income-based
measure o f welfare, the 1998 Living Conditions Survey (LCS) estimated that roughly one-third
o f Albanians were poor, with about half o f them in extreme poverty.           These figures were
reported inthe November 2001 NSSED. The recently available estimates from the 2002 LSMS,
as reported inthe NSSED update, suggest that based on a consumption-based money metric o f
welfare and an absolute poverty line anchored to a representative basket o f basic needs,        25.4
percent o f Albanians, or close to 780,000 individuals, fall below the poverty line (see Table 3).
Extreme poverty - as defined by the food poverty line - amounts to less than 5 percent o f the
population who are unable to meet basic food requirements. Consistent with previous studies,
poverty is higher in rural areas - at almost 30 percent - with a poverty headcount 50 percent
higher than other urbanareas. Although the difference remains significant, the magnitude o f the
urbadrural gap i s smaller than estimated by the LCS 1998, largely due to differences in
methodologies, rendering impossible any meaningful comparison. The Gini coefficient i s 0.28,
roughly in line with other countries in ECA, and with little variation across regions. It i s worth
noting that a 2001 Qualitative Poverty Assessment found that transition is also giving rise to new
vulnerable groups such as street children (in urban areas) and recently transplanted poor
households in peri-urban areas. While we can hypothesize that growth in Albania has had a
beneficial impact on household welfare, there i s no quantitative basis for establishing with
confidence the magnitude and trend o f the past growth effect. This information gap should no
longer be an issue as the five-year household survey program continues implementation, as
described below.

25.     As reported in previous studies, the non-income dimensions o f poverty compound the
reported low-income levels. The situation is particularly disconcerting inrural and most remote
areas o f the country. A study carried out by the Ministry o f Health in2000 on public perceptions
o f health care services highlights the existence of physical and economic barriers to access health
care. With the exception o f Tirana, people reported having limited access to hospitals; in rural
areas, people also reported limited access to ambulatory facilities. Many reported economic
barriers to access health care. The study also reports a widespread perception o f poor quality in
both ambulatory and hospital care. In the case o f education, although Albania started the
transition with highlevels o f participation, enrollment rates in all but tertiary level o f education
have declined since. This decline has been specially marked in upper secondary education,
affecting enrollment in vocational schools the most. Additionally, enrollment in rural areas has

                                      Albania and the MillenniumDevelopmentGoals

The MillenniumDevelopment Goals(MDGs) aim to increase access to educationand healthcare; preserve the environment; and
halve, from 1990to 2015, the proportion of peopleinextremepoverty worldwide. Inthe case of Albania, there are efforts to: (i)
verify the availability and quality ofMDG-related data; (ii)set appropriateintermediateand final targets for indicators most relevant
for Albania; and (iii) assesshow well the Government'sNSSED and supporting externalaid are positionedto help Albania meetthe
broadMDGs. The Govemment has startedto align its monitoringpriorities with the MDGs with Bank andUNDP assistance.

Albania boastedrelatively good performanceon a number of social indicators when the transition began. However, economic, social,
and political upheavalsduring the lastdecadeof economictransition have impactedthe population's welfare. The country cannot
afford to maintain some of its social infrastructure, especially inregionswith high levels ofout-migration. Settingbaselinesat 1990
canthereforebe misleading, becausethat year roughly correspondsto when the population's welfare startedto decline.
Furthermore, Albania's current status vis-a-vis some MDGs needs to take into accountunderlying trends. For example, althoughthe
reportedincidenceo fHIV/AIDS is low, there is a rapid increase inrisky behaviorssuch as drug use and prostitution, compounded
by the deterioration o fthe public health system. PreventingHIVIAIDS is therefore a healthcarepriority.

The following representsome preliminaryobservations on Albania's progresstoward the MDG's:

          incomepoverty:The MDGtarget ofhalving the proportion of peoplewhose income is less than one dollar aday will be
          measuredbeginning in2002, when the LSMS yields the first reliable dataofthis kind.Albania will also monitor the
          number of peoplewith incomes less thantwo dollars per day. The PRSC is assistingthe Governmentto set appropriate
          MDGtargets with the new data, to undertake simulations ofthe impact of growth and other policies on poverty, and to
          adjustthe policy agendaaccordingly.

          Social Sectors:Albania is currently moving away from the MDGtarget of full primary educationfor all boys and girls. Net
          primary enrollment rateshavedropped.As aresult, the CAS supports-through the PRSCsandeducationreform
          programs-the Government's efforts to improve sector managementandto develop and apply for resources as a fast track
          country under the Educationfor All program. Under the NSSEDandMTEF, the Governmentis committed increase
          resources to the educationandhealth sectors. Although Albania has madeprogresstoward the MDGtarget to reduce the
          under-five mortality rate, there are wide regional disparities that could underminefurther progress. The MDGtarget to
          reducematemal mortality by 75 percentwould unrealistically decrease Albania's ratio to near that of industrialized
          countries, and is also complicatedby the poor stateo fthe public health system. As with HIV, both child andmatemal
          mortality are healthcarepriorities.

          Gender: The MDGtargetto eliminate gender disparity ineducation does not appearto be amajor concernfor Albania at
          present. However, there may be a problem of boys leaving school early.

          EnvironmentalSustainability:The ruralwater strategy is likely to improve access to safewater, but the MDG is ambitious
          and may be difficult to achieve.There is still much to be doneto improve access to water and sanitationespecially inrural
          areas. Deforestation and land degradationare concems, and environmental management institutions remain weak.

          GlobalPartnership:Albania hasmade progresstoward developing an open, rule-based, predictable, and non-
          discriminatory trading andfinancial systemand is committed to good govemance andpoverty reduction.


    urban areas give reasons to believe that low participation in education might be a problem in
    peri-urban areas. This is the case not only because the new settlers are poor, but also because the
    education system inlargecities is not sufficiently prepared to absorb the newcomers.

    26.       The 2002 LSMS shows that only one infour rural households has accessto runningwater
    inside the dwelling, and more than 50 percent have no running water at all. The broad coverage
    inurban areas of major basic services like water and electricity hide an equally disconcerting
    scenario in terms of service quality.                Only one in four households in Tirana believe that the

                                                                   15

water they use i s o f drinking quality. Among the households that do receive running water,
nearly one third o f those inother urban areas (one fourth inTirana) report having had water for
less than six hours each day. Only 42 percent o f rural households have a toilet inside their
dwelling, with almost half o f the rural population not having any access to a piped toilet.
Electricity is another case inpoint. While the coverage o f the network is virtually universal, the
delivery o f the service i s highly unreliable, with the situation being worse inrural communities.
Only 14.3 percent o f Albanian households report receiving electricity continuously (30 percent
inTirana, 7 percent inrural areas). O fthose reporting interruptions, electricity was not available
for as long as 8.5 hours on average on a typical day. The LSMS shows that the poor are twice as
likely to lack access to key public and private services. Only 2 of 10 poor children enroll in
secondary education, versus 5 o f 10 among the non-poor.

  27.      Based on the 2002 LSMS, unemployment stands at 10 percent. The discrepancy with
  other reported figures, such as the unemployment levels presented in official statistics (15
  percent) and the 2001 census (22 percent) is due to differences in definitions7 and in the
  reference universe.      However, only 22 percent o f individuals age fifteen or older reported
  holding a full time job in the 2002 LSMS, with part-time employment and underemployment
  most widespread inrural areas. Infact, if we adopt a relaxed ILO definition o f employment in
  the LSMS by including those working less than five hours per week among the unemployed,
  the overall unemployment rate raises to almost 19 percent. The recent data appears to highlight
  the importance o f developing more stable, non-farming employment opportunities as a
  component o fAlbania's poverty reduction strategy.

  28.     Finally, analysis o f the LSMS highlights some o f the main poverty correlates (note that
  many areas are still being worked out by INSTAT, such as gender and malnutrition correlates).
  Poor households appear to be (i)      larger, with an average household size o f 5.7 (compared with 4
  among non-poor); (ii)      less educated, with on average two fewer years o f schooling than non-
  poor; (iii) younger, with household heads 5.4 years younger than non-poor; and (iv) rural, with
  four out of ten rural children in poverty, and many poor concentrated in the remote districts o f
  the nortWnortheast o f the country. Elderly in Tirana have some of the lowest overall poverty
  rates, likely because o f their access to social insurance transfers and other family support
  mechanisms. About one halfo f the poor inAlbania are below the age o f 21.




    The 10 percent estimation from the 2002 LSMS is based on the one-hour ILO definition of employment in the
  referenceperiod of oneweek prior to the survey.

29.     Bank staff are completing an FY03 Poverty Assessment which will, inter alia, finalize
the poverty profile and mapping, examine the non-income dimensions of poverty, and further
examine the linkages between policies and poverty. It will also provide a preliminary
assessment, to the extent possible, o f the welfare impacts o f key macroeconomic and structural
reforms and identify mechanisms to mitigate the negative social impacts o f these reforms on the
poor. The preliminary findings o f the LSMS are already informing the PRSC-2, while the final
Poverty Assessment will clearly play a major role inthe identification o f complementary policy
measures to be supported by the PRSC-3. For example, the preliminary analysis o f the LSMS
data suggests that a large number o f households are clustered around the poverty lines. This
implies that continuing the NSSEDPRSC growth-based emphasis, coupled with improved
targeting o f transfers to those in severe need, would lead to more than proportional changes in
the overall income poverty picture. The program's focus on the non-income dimensions o f
poverty (health, education and other basic services) also remains o f critical importance to a large
proportion o fthe population.

B.      TheNational Strategyfor Social and Economic Development

30.     As articulated through its National Strategy for Social and Economic Development
(November 2001), the Government i s strongly committed to a sustained and inclusive
development strategy that brings Albania's living standards and per capita income closer to the
levels o f its neighboring European countries. The NSSED rests on two main pillars-improving
governance and sustaining high economic growth-and         emphasizes education, health care, and
infrastructure as priority areas for policy intervention. The NSSED identifies Albania's main
development challenges: weak law enforcement; corruption; an unattractive investment climate;
low quality and inaccessible social services, especially education and health; poor infrastructure;
and a shortage o f basic necessities, including water, sanitation, and heating.       The NSSED
recognizes that weak governance and institutions are at the root o f Albania's developmental
problems. It also acknowledges that economic growth will be the main instrument to reduce
poverty in Albania. Maintaining macroeconomic stability and adequate social protection are
cited as preconditions for implementing the strategy. The NSSED also emphasizes stronger
public accountability and increased public participation indecisionmaking to empower the poor.
The NSSED has five main goals for the three-year period: (i)    achieve real GDP growth o f -18-21
percent; (ii)  reduce the number o f people living in poverty, particularly extreme poverty; (iii)
make tangible improvements in infrastructure and related services, such as electric power,
potable water supply, and sewerage, increasing the poor's access to these services; (iv) reduce
infant and maternal mortality rates and the incidence o f infectious diseases; and (v) increase
elementary and secondary school enrollment rates andthe average schooling period.

31.     The NSSED was Albania's first attempt to elaborate a comprehensive national
development strategy that focused on results. As pointed out in the Bank-Fund Joint Staff
Assessment o f the PRSP (Report No. 23469-ALB), the NSSED represented an impressive effort
by Albania. Its main strengths included an unprecedented participatory process and a close link
to the MTEF. Unfortunately, however, the NSSED process slowed after the strategy was
launched in November 2001, mainly due to political uncertainties. Rivalries within the ruling
 Socialist Party led to three changes o f Government between mid-2001 and mid-2002. The
unsettled political environment distracted the Government and hampered its ability to focus on
the NSSED, buildonthe initial participatory process, and strengthen institutionalcapacity o fline
ministries. Political stability has increased following the election o f a consensual President in

                                                 18

June 2002, and the appointment o f the current Prime Minister in July 2002. InFall 2002, the
Government made efforts to revitalize the NSSED process. Government and civil society
representatives participated in a Southeastern Europe Poverty Reduction Strategies Forum
organized by multilateral and bilateral donors, and the Government organized an NSSED
monitoring workshop inTirana. To strengthen NSSED institutional arrangements, a Decision o f
the Prime Minister elevated the status o f the NSSED technical secretariat in the Ministry o f
Finance to a Department, and ordered line ministries to establish monitoring and evaluation
functions. Also, the Government organized a high-level conference inNovember 2002, at which
line ministriespresented their actions to date andtheir plans for the future.

32.    At the end o f 2002, recognizing the need to make up for lost time, the Government
accelerated its efforts to advance the NSSED. The Government elaborated a detailed time table
to prepare a first Annual Progress Report and an updated NSSED, including a revised matrix of
public priority measures. An interministerial NSSED working group met on a weekly basis to
receive instructions from the Ministry o f Finance and discuss progress. The Carter Center and
other partners assisted the Government with a public consultation process. The Government also
prepared, with support from the UNDP and the Bank, detailed sectoral monitoring and
evaluation plans that reference and incorporate the Millennium Development Goals. In April
2003, the Bank team provided detailed technical comments on a first draft o f the NSSED
Progress Report. The Government transmitted the final Progress Report inMay 2003.

C.     Implementation Hurdles and ChallengesAhead

33.    TheNSSED is a comprehensive and cross cutting program, The Government is strongly
committed to implementing the NSSED, but also i s aware o f the difficult implementation
bottlenecks that it will need to overcome. For the PRSC program, these have been presented
underthe PRSC-1 (see June 20,2002 Program Document) and include:

            Policy monitoring and evaluation. At a time o f rapid and profound change, the
            Government i s still developing reliable statistical and other information to develop
            policy andto evaluate policy effectiveness.


        0   Policy formulation process. Related to the above, the policy process, while having
            most o f the basic elements required for effective strategic prioritization, fails in
            practice to achieve that ideal.


        0   Governance. Poor governance and weak institutional capacities remain a bottleneck
            inAlbania.

            Public expenditure management. While there have been recent improvements inthe
            budget management process, including timeliness o f information to make budget
            decisions, more is needed to ensure that a transparent and contestable budgetdecision
            makingprocess become self-sustaining andthat budget execution and accountability
            mechanisms, including audit mechanisms and procurementpractices, are improved.




                                                 19

           Human resources within the public administration. There is a limited ability o f
           Albania's public administrationto attract, motivate, retain and effectively manage the
           humancapital skills requiredto meet its ambitious NSSED objectives.

            Quality and Access of Social Services: Education, health and social protection
            services are o f low quality, ineffective, inequitable or unaffordable (often benefiting
           the relatively well off more thanthe poor), andnon-transparent.

           Migration.     There has been a major transition in the rural sector, with major
           population movements out o f the countryside towards urban centers.                   This
            complicates the ability to design effective economic and social policies.

           Rural-urban divergence. Recent trends in migration and developments in service
            delivery have resulted ina gap between rural and urbanareas. Poverty inrural areas
           remains considerably higher thaninurban areas.

            Decentralization. The Government is in the process o f implementing a National
            Strategy for Decentralization and Local Autonomy and intends to move a large array
            of functions from the central to local levels. However, capacities at local levels are
            extremely limited to take on new responsibilities. Furthermore, the ongoing
            decentralization process poses questions related to revenue sharing, expenditure
            assignment, andperformance at the local level.

            Informal Economy. A significant portion of economic activity inAlbania takes place
            outside o f the formal economy. The principal barriers to the creation o f a robust
            private sector reside primarily in the absence of a favorable business climate, which
            continues to encourage gray market operations.

34.    While these challenges are complex, substantial progress inaddressing the above areas is
needed to consolidate and deepen ongoing structural reforms, and to put growth and poverty
reduction issues at the center o f economic decision making. The Government program to be
supported under the PRSC is expected to cover the above agenda by (i)       identifyingandresolving
cross-cutting issues that affect multiple sectors, (ii)selecting a subset o f primary priorities within
and between sectors, and ensuring that those priorities are ultimately achievable; (iii)linking,
where possible, priorities to required donor support for implementation; and (iv) developing and
implementing a comprehensive monitoringplan.


                     IV.      SECOND POVERTY      REDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT

35.     Objective. The objective o f the PRSC program is to develop and implement policies and
structural reforms that are consistent with and supportive o f the Government's poverty reduction
and economic development strategy, as highlighted in the NSSED. The PRSC program is
structured around four components:

        a         Promoting sustainable growth and supporting private sector development;
        e         Strengthening capacity to monitor andevaluate the policy agenda;

                                                   20

        a          Improving service delivery and social safety net effectiveness; and
        a          Improving core public sector functions andinstitutional arrangements.

                                                   DEVELOPMENT

Performance and RemainingIssues

36.     InAlbania, there is the urgent need to create opportunities for employment and income
growth to improve the economic well-being and living standardo f the population. Furthermore,
these opportunities should be equitably distributed, with a wide distribution o f its benefits to the
entire population, so that growth can have maximum impact on poverty reduction. Without an
increase ingrowth, the Government will find it difficult to raise the required resources to finance
social expenditures and redistribution policies needed to protect the poor. As discussed inpart
11, the prerequisite for such growth is reform o fthe energy sector and continuedmacroeconomic
stability. Albania has been successful inmaintaining overall macroeconomic stability since 1997,
but further efforts are neededwith respect to fiscal consolidation. Inparticular, Albania needsto
increase expenditures in a number o f priority sectors (e.g. health, education, operations and
maintenance). Inaddition, a pensionreform that aims to reduce reliance o f the pension system on
budgetary transfers, while promoting adequate incomes, should be a key aspect o f fiscal
consolidation (see Objective 3).

37.      Rural Economy. Development o frural economy, and increased role o f the private sector
(see below) are critical for maximizing potential for job creation, reducing poverty, and
sustaining growth. Around fifty percent o f Albania's population live in rural areas, with most
living on the approximately 400,000 small farms carved out o f the former system of collective
farms. Agriculture has been a major force behindAlbania's growth since transition andcontinues
to be an important sector - accounting for about 34 percent o f GDP.' Over the next few years,
the rural sector will continue to be a significant portion o f the national economy and the main
source o f employment and income growth for the poor. Non farm rural activities linked to
agriculture will become increasingly important. Similarly, increased productivity and
employment opportunities in rural areas, as well as improved access to social services and
financial institutions, are critical for reducing poverty inthe rural areas.

38.      Inthe recent years, the Government has improved the environment for the development
o f the rural sector through the landreform program, rehabilitation o f rural infrastructure, notably
irrigation, and liberalization o f trade andprices. Despite these improvements, yields are still low,
physical infrastructure is poor, private sector activity has yet to replace the defunct state
processing and marketing agencies, and excessive fragmentation o f land ownership makes
efficient farming difficult.          O f equal concern i s the severe environmental degradation o f
Albania's natural resources. Further efforts are needed to finalize the land reform process, to




 8The contribution of the agricultural sector to the GDP has been estimated at around 50% inthe past. However, due
to an increase inthe share of services and construction sectors as well as the new methodology used the estimating
the GDP, the shareof agriculture inthe GDP is estimated at about 34 percent.

direct research and extension efforts toward small holder farmer's needs, and to allow stronger
focus on market links andnatural resource management.'

39.     Private Sector Development. The evolution and development o f the private sector in
Albania i s a key element for fostering growth, creating employment and reducing poverty.
Albania presently has a burgeoning private sector, and i s a highly entrepreneurial society.
However, the size of informal sector in Albania is disproportionately high (40-60 percent o f
GDP) compared to other countries, and represents a major impediment to increasing budget
revenues. Furthermore,           the majority o f businesses are small, concentrated in the trade and
services sectors (76 percent o f firms have less than one employee while more than 50 percent are
estimated to be informal). Albania needs to encourage the transformation o f existing informal
firms into formal and robust enterprises. The principal barriers to the creation of a robust private
sector reside primarily in the absence o f a favorable business climate, which continues to
encourage informal market operations and discourage movement o f resources to activities that
are most productive.

40.      Among the chief obstacles include a weak competitive environment, aggressive and
unfair tax enforcement mechanisms, cumbersome and unnecessary administrative procedures in
customs, and minimal enforcement o f legal decisions.                    One o f the major disincentives for
businesses to operate outside the informal economy is the tax system. Taxpayers tend to avoid
policies and practices that are perceived to be unfair and unreasonable. As a result, the tax base
has remained small, relations with taxpayers have been poor, and there has been a notable trend
towards the growth o f a cash economy." Key problems in customs administration include an
import clearance process that i s overly cumbersome, a valuation system that gives rise to
opportunism on the part o f customs officers, and a poor working relationship with the private
sector.l1

41.      It is also essential for private sector development that the enforcement and
implementation o f laws, particularly with respect to commercial disputes, become more
objective, predictable and timely.              Presently, legal procedures exist for the execution o f
judgments, but are not fully enforced in practice. Inpart, this can be attributed to a lack o f
competence and appropriate structure for the Bailiffs office to execute judgments against
individuals, businesses, or the state. Furthermore, inthe event that private sector parties want to
settle out o f court, appropriate mechanisms need to be established.




9 Details o f these are elaborated on inthe Rural Development Strategy, August 2002.
lo The mostcritical tax issues facing enterprises include delays inrepayment o fthe VAT, inflexible and
inappropriate mechanisms for the pre-payment o fprofit taxes, overly aggressive and punitivemeasuresenactedin
the event of atax dispute, anda lack of capacity oftax inspectors inassessingliabilities andconductingaudits.
Underlying these specific issues is an overall focus on meeting short-term, and decentralized revenue targets at the
expense of longer term growth and investment.
11 The averagetime of 5.3 days for each import clearance is way too longfor investors, and it certainly compares
unfavorably with many other countries inthe region. For instance, it is 1.2 days for Bulgaria, 2 days for Romania,
2.6 days for Ukraine and4.3 days for Moldova (FIAS Removing Administrative Barriers Study, 2003).

Reform Program

42.     The Government intends to maintain macroeconomicstability, which is the backbone of
its growth and poverty reduction objectives. For this purpose, it has agreed with the IMF on a
three-year PRGF program starting June 2002. The objectives of this program are to keep the
annualrate of inflation at around 3-4 percent, to maintain the momentum of growth at around 5-6
percent a year, and to keep the foreign exchangereservesat about 4.5 months of imports. These
objectives are expected to be achieved through the reduction infiscal and balance of payments
deficits and continued prudent monetary policies. As part of its fiscal consolidation, the
Government is focusing on developing a comprehensivepension reform program. The objectives
are to implement a comprehensive pension system that addresses the overall, longer-term
problems of coverage, affordability, equity, andadequacy (see Objective 3).12

43.     In the area of rural development under PRSC-1, the Government made substantial
progress inrestructuring agricultural researchinstitutions and in land registration activities. The
Government's program under PRSC-2 andPRSC-3 focuses on two broad areas: (a) reduction of
rural poverty and continued growth in employment and income earning opportunities; and (b)
sustainable management of natural resources, including forests, pastures, and water. More
specifically, efforts on rural developmentaim at:

        0     Improvingfunctioning of the landmarket andproperty rights.
        0     Strengthening community-based rural infrastructure, including irrigation, rural water
              supply, andruralroads.
        0     Orienting rural support services towards the needs of the rural community and
              increasing the focus of non-agricultural services, such as business advice and legal
              support.
         0    Providing effective services for smallholder farmers, including adaptive research and
              extension programs and to poor farmers through appropriate public veterinary and
              plantprotection control.
         0    Expanding rural financial services and foster expansion of the banking network into
              rural areas.
         0    Improving consumer protection and food control mechanismsfor food products.
         0    Streamlining natural resource management activities in rural development and
              addressingthe continuous problem of illegallogging.

 44.     The Government aims to finalize the first time registration of land over the next two
 years. Most of the agricultural landregistrationhas been completed andthe remaining work will
 concentrate on the peri-urban and urban areas. In addition, the registration system will be
 modernized to allow the establishment of a functioning land market. As part of PRSC-2, the
 Government has consolidated different legislation on land and is proceeding with first time
 registration of 168 cadastral zones. The Government will also develop Regional Development
 Plans to coordinate activities of various Ministries and institutions as well as to set priority
 development goals in the regions. Planning on a regional basis will allow intergovernmental
 investmentsandconcentration ofresourcesinareas ofpotential growth andof specific supportto

 12The Government's program also aims to mitigate the immediate power shortage andto reduce losses dueto illegal
 use andpoor bill collection. The IDA Power Rehabilitation and RestructuringProject, approved inJune 2002,
 supports the Government's reform program inthe energy sector.

                                                       23

disadvantaged areas. To prepare Regional Development Plans, the Government, as part o f
PRSC-2, has established a National Task Force on Rural Development, which includes key
Ministries as well as delegates from Local Government. The work would initially concentrate on
some pilot regions before being expanded to the national level.

45.     The Government intends to strengthen agriculture research and extension activities to be
more responsive to farmers' needs and to improve the transfer o f adapted technologies to small
holder farms. The Council o f Science plans to organize a national workshop on the Albanian
research structure. Improving community-based initiatives that would provide essential services
to the rural areas, combined with programs to improve access to and quality o f rural health and
education services, are expected to contribute to employment and income growth and to poverty
reduction in rural areas. In addition, the Government recognizes that rural institutions and
association, like Water User Associations and Savings and Credit Associations, are key for
developing rural areas.13

46.      The measures for private sector development (PSD) under PRSC-1 mostly focused on the
adoption o f amendments o f relevant laws to ensure harmonization o f the bankruptcy framework,
and to undertake the `Administrative Barriers' study, with the goal o f identifying barriers to
private sector development. The Government's strategy to further promote private sector during
PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 concentrates on promoting growth, reducing poverty and helping people
improve their quality o f life. The Government recognizes that promotion o f a healthy and viable
private sector inAlbania requires complementary actions by the public sector, the private sector,
andthe donors. The role o fthe Government, however, would be partial andonly as a catalyst for
the development o f this sector. The Government i s aware that such development will require a
judicious refocusing on the role o f the state, and the development o f policies that provide room
for private initiative. Institution and capacity building are sine qua non to this process, but are
best left to the donors and civil society.

47.      The Government program supported by the PRSC is therefore a reflection o f this partial
role o f the government in private sector development, and focuses on promotion o f policy
reforms that will create an overall favorable climate inwhich the private sector can do business
within a regulatory framework which channels private initiative inways that benefit society as a
whole. The PSD strategy o f the Government, supported by PRSC-2, focuses on promoting
 business entry, reducing compliance cost for business operations, and facilitating exit. A second
 objective i s to create incentives for the private sector to operate transparently, and within the
 framework o f the formal economy, rather than through gray market operations. This i s an
 important element for promoting economic growth, since it will lead to: (i)increased budget
 revenues which can be allocated towards basic services that will empower the poor; and, (ii)                        an
 increase in overall economic efficiency resulting from a decrease in unproductive rent-seeking
 that generally results from regulatory avoidance.

 48.     The private sector development program spans a multitude o f sectors, includingjudicial,
 fiscal (tax, customs), and financial, as well as the overall governance related to the public sector.
 Thus the PSD components o f the PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 primarily focuses on key administrative
 barriers in customs and tax, and on the strengthening o f the judicial sector in order to increase


 l3The Government will strengthen its efforts for consumer protection and food control for food products by
 strengtheningthe public responsibilities of veterinary control o f public health diseases, and food safety controls.

                                                          24

security o f property rights and contract enforcement. Under PRSC-2 the Government's program
concentrates on improving the legal and institutional framework related to the business
environment. In this regard, the Ministry o f Economy has taken the lead in implementing
recommendations o f the Administrative Barriers Study through an interministerial task force.
The priority actions focus on: (i)improving business entry through abolishing license
requirements for non-food industry; and (ii)            reducing compliance costs for business operations
by reducing the on-site arbitrary inspections by electricity, water, police, and tax inspectors, and
by improving the appeals system andprocessesinCustoms. The task force will also design a set
o f indicators to monitor the progress. An inter-ministerial effort i s necessary because policies
related to private sector development are cross cutting, and go beyond the technical andjuridical
capabilities o f the Ministry o f Economy. Their principal role will be to advocate for policy
reform, to monitor progress, to benchmark outcomes, and to report to the Council o f Ministers.
The Government also plans to continue on its laudable path of improving the dialogue between
the public and private sector by building political consensus within the Government and with
private sector partners and civil society.

49.      As part o f an overall strategy for private sector development, the Government under
PRSC-2 addresses the most pressing constraints for the enterprise sector by implementing short
term measures in tax and customs administration. In particular, the Government adopts risk-
based auditing procedures to reduce the frequency o f tax audits, particularly for smaller firms,
and begins implementing the newly published tax procedure manuals on registration, collection,
enforcement, and audit.         The Government also continues its progress on speeding up and
correctly rebating VAT reimbursements, as well as on implementing revised procedures on
freezing o f bank accounts in the event o f an unresolved tax dispute. In addition to the above
measures, the Government undertakes steps to strengthen the capacity o f the judicial system, in
particular Bailiffs (enforcement) office to enforce judicial decisions. The MOJ also intends to
adopt a fee structure that provides improved incentives to the enforcement offices to actually
enforce a deci~ion.'~The Government also creates mechanisms for alternative (out o f court)
dispute resolution for commercial disputes by revising the legal framework for arbitration and by
preparing a law on Mediation o f Commercial Disputes. The establishment o f the center for
mediation and arbitration o f commercial dispute is expected the contribute positively to a better
climate for resolving such disputes. These measures will be followed inPRSC-3 by specific and
time-bound initiatives to further reform tax, customs, and the judicial system.

Expected Outcome

50.      By the end o fthe three-year NSSED/PRSC period, Albania expects to have:

         0    Sustained satisfactory macroeconomic performance with low levels o f inflation,
              around 3-4 percent, and with continued growth at around 5-6 percent a year.

              Reduced public sector impediments to private business development as reflected in a

 14Currently, the Law imposes tariffs o f 3 percent (individuals) and 7 percent (enterprises) before Bailiffs services
 can be retained. There are, however, no guaranteeso f performance on the part o fBailiffs. This tariffstructure
 should be revisedto create incentives for Bailiffs to carry out execution order.

OBJECTIVE 2: STRENGTHENING CAPACITY TO MONITORAND EVALUATE THE POLICY AGENDA

Performance and Remaining Issues

52.     Policymakers need reliable information on the costs and social impacts o f policies in
order to inform policy deliberations. While the Government is beginning to gather more data
and information necessary to develop and monitor policy, it is still lacking the capacity to
evaluate that information in order to strengthen the strategic orientation o f its overall policy
agenda. In the past, the Government has had difficulty setting and tracking those monitoring
priorities that are o f primary interest to key stakeholders (within and outside o f the Government)
as well as the broader public. However, over recent months there has been significant progress
towards strengtheningmonitoring and evaluation o f the NSSED, helped in no small measure by
the commitment and relative stability o fthe current Government. The likely effectiveness o fthe
NSSED and related legislative agenda critically depends on the continued improvement in the
Government's institutional reforms inpolicy development, monitoring and evaluation.

53.     While sustainable capacity to undertake policy monitoring and evaluation remains weak,
there have been some promising developments to improve the situation (see below). There are
sources o f administrative data available, but they are not o f uniform reliability or relevance and
often cover only the people receiving services while excluding those who miss out.             Line
ministries and agencies do not always fully appreciate the importance and usefulness of
statistical information to policy and program development and implementation. When statistical
information is available, there is little internal expertise and inter-agency coordination available
to undertake the requisite analysis. The planned ministerial policy analysis and development
departments remain promising venues for developing analytical capacity in the longer term in
view o fthe wealth o f informationbeing generated bythe program. Finally, the ultimate intended



                                                   28

beneficiaries o f public policies and programs are rarely significantly involved in providing
feedback on the implementation and impacts o fthose policies andprograms.

Reform Program

54.     The PRSC component objective supports the development and implementation o f new
policy initiatives through improved and policy-relevant monitoring of the impact and
effectiveness o f Government programs. This requires both: (a) development o f institutional
arrangements and practices that facilitate reaching agreement among key stakeholders regarding
what impacts should be monitored and how; and (b) development o f the capacity to collect,
analyze and disseminate reliable, useful and timely statistical and other data to monitor and
evaluate the effectiveness o f the Government's policy agenda. Such data should include trends
in household consumption, income and other key socio-economic indicators, as well as other
aspects o f economic and social activity. The component also supports instruments, such as
datalindicator mapping exercise, that can be usedto assist central and local authorities to allocate
resources more effectively. This component has also evolved to include development o f a plan
to monitor the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a part o f the overall monitoring
strategy, incoordination with the UNDP.

55.     One important element of strengthening policy monitoring and evaluation is developing
the executive branch's capacity to produce reliable statistical information on a regular basis to
measure and monitor poverty, inequality, and other key social indicators. As part o f this effort,
inthe Spring of2002 INSTAT,withtechnicalassistanceprovidedbythe World Bank and DFID,
designed and completed a Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS) - the first o f what i s
expected to be a regular system o f household-level data collection. The Data User Group, formed
during the preparation o f the 2002 LSMS, with the participation o f several line ministries and
research institutions, helped to enhance the relevance o f the information to be collected,
 strengthen analytical capacity among potential users and improve cooperation among the
 different institutions. Based on the proposed poverty monitoring system, the 2002 LSMS is to be
 followed by annual panel surveys on a sub-sample o f households and will be repeated after three
years. The 2003 panel survey has been designed and piloted by INSTAT, in collaboration with
 the World Bank and the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) o f the University o f
 Essex, and field work i s expected to start inMay 2003. Based upon information obtained during
 the 2001 census and the 2002 LSMS, a poverty profile and poverty and inequality mapping are
 being completed by INSTAT and the World Bank. The mapping exercise will provide an
 invaluable tool to support and inform the decentralization process, and to improve the targeting
 and assess the impact o f Government programs and budgets. INSTAT, incollaboration with the
 World Bank and other donors, i s also conducting additional analysis on the 2001 Census and
 2002 LSMS and a number o f publications are being prepared to disseminate the results. The
 dataset and documentation o f the 2002 LSMS has also been finalized and it has been made
 available to researchers and stakeholders, bothlocal and international.

 56.    The Government, with IDA support, is establishing a pilot participatory monitoring and
 evaluation (PM&E) system inthe healthcare sector. This exercise (to be known as a Qualitative
 Stakeholder Assessment or QSA), aims to establish a baseline qualitative study on access and
 quality o f health services (primary, secondary and tertiary) which relate to one o f the three major
 health objectives inthe NSSED, by interviewing key stakeholders ranging from community level
 patients to health care providers and administrators. Qualitative data will be collected and the

                                                 29

results will be communicated to key decision makers to enable them to take appropriate actions
to improve the access and quality o f health care services. Insupport o fthis initiative, support for
training in monitoring and evaluation (using both qualitative and quantitative methods) will be
provided for staff from policy level to those working at health facilities. The main government
institution responsible for the QSA is the newly established Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of
the Ministry o f Health, which will also share key QSA results and policy implications with the
NSSED Directorate o f the Ministry o f Finance. Focused on the Tirana Region, the first phase of
the PM&E system has already started. Key stakeholders incentral and local government and in
civil society were fully consulted in the design o f the QSA plan. An international expert in
health qualitative research was just recruited by the M O H and will soon be able to provide
technical assistance andtraining for the whole exercise. The views and experience o fhealth care
administrators are being collected by a local consultant. Finally, a local consultancy firm
responsible for collecting the views o f community level patients and providers will be retained
shortly. Based on the learning o f the first phase o f the QSA, a second phase should start inthe
second half o f 2003. It would focus on other selected regions o f the country. Fundingfor this
second phase will be mainly provided by the Multi-Donor Capacity Building for Poverty
Reduction Strategy Trust Fundimplementedby the Ministry o f Finance.

57.      Complementary to this, the Prime Minister issued an Order in September 2002 that
required each o f the 12NSSED Ministries to establish a monitoring and evaluation function and
elevated the Technical Secretariat within the Ministry o f Finance to a larger Directorate with
overall responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the implementation o f the NSSED. This
 Order signaled anincreased commitment by the Government to monitor and evaluate the impact
o f its policies.   To explain the importance o f the Prime Minister's Order and to provide
 assistance to those Ministries which need to get geared up for NSSED monitoring, the Ministry
 o f Finance and the World Bank co-hosted a NSSED monitoring and evaluation workshop in
 October 2002.       The workshop was attended by over 40 counterparts (predominantly
 representatives from the 12 NSSED ministries). The NSSED Directorate is now operational and
 its Terms o f Reference have been developed with a view to ensuring that it supports the
 fundamental objective o f coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the NSSED and
 helping to establish sustainable capacity throughout the public administration for policy-relevant
 monitoring and evaluation (see Objective 4). The key positions o f both the Director and Chief o f
 Sector were officially filled in March 2003. While monitoring and evaluation plans have been
 recently sent to the Bank from twelve line ministries, the World Bank is continuing to work with
 a number o f ministries (including MoAF, MoES, M o H and MoLSA) to help them improve the
 monitoring andevaluationtables for their sectors.

 58.     To encourage the development o f more transparency and accountability in local service
 delivery, a pilot project (known as the Tirana Transparency project) has beendeveloped with the
 assistance o f the Government o f the Netherlands and the World Bank to assist the municipality
 o f Tirana to improve information flows to both sides o f the public information loop. The
 Information Office was officially opened inFebruary 2003 and ten staff are providing citizens o f
 Tirana with information on available services, procedures, and also providing consultations to all
 citizens on obtaining specific information relevant to their individual needs. The information
 provided relates amongst other things to licensing and permit procedures (for transport,
 construction etc), urban development (Tirana city plans and maps) and social services (such as
 birthcertificates and identification cards). Inorder to monitor service delivery and the needs of
 citizens and also alert local government to trends, issues and needs o f citizens, a "citizen report

                                                  30

  card" i s beingcompleted and the results will be made available soon. A communication strategy,
  that aims to improve the communication between the Municipality and citizens, is also being
  prepared by the Municipality staff and international and local consultants. Depending on the
  outcome of the pilot, it is hoped that the project could be fine-tuned and scaled up to cover more
  municipalities inAlbania.

    OBJECTIVE3: IMPROVINGSERVICEDELIVERYAND SOCIAL SAFETY NETEFFECTIVENESS

    Performance and Remaining Issues

    61.    Albania's ability to ensure the health andwelfare o f its populationhas been compromised
    by a weak physical infrastructure, major shifts in demography including significant population
    movements, internal and regional instability, limited governance capacity, poor resource
    management and weak technical capabilities. Restructuring and reform o f basic social services i s
    therefore a priority element o fpoverty reduction.

    62.    Education: The primary issues inthe education sector are: (a) gross enrollment rates at
    the basic and secondary levels of education, especially inthe rural and peri-urban areas; (b) the
    financing and management o f the sector; and (c) the transparency o f key decisions for the sector.
    Since the transition, Government enrollment and census data indicate that gross enrollment rates
    have declined at all levels of education, exceptfor higher education. Enrollment rates in basic
    education are going in the wrong direction, and enrollment rates for upper secondary schools
    have declined dramatically, partly because o f closures o f most secondary agricultural vocational
    schools that resulted in declines in vocational/technical enrollment rates. The LSMS paints a



                                                       32

more positive picture for basic education and less positive for secondary education than
Government's calculations.

63.      Except for the extremely poor, net enrollment rates in basic education do not differ
significantly by poverty, gender, or residential location. Poverty and residential location, but not
gender, significantly affect secondary enrollment rates. Those living inTirana and the non-poor
have 2.8 times the chance o f enrolling in secondary education as those in rural areas and 3.6
times the chance o f extremely poor families. Parental education is a good predictor o f children's
educational attainment, and 75 percent o f rural household heads have completed only basic
education or less, as opposed to 34 percent o f household heads in Tirana. Interms o f average
years of education completed, rural areas lag Tirana by 3.5 years (7.4 yersus 10.9 years,
respectively); they lag other urbanareas by two years.

64.      Although the LSMS does not measure enrollment rates in peri-urban areas, qualitative
data indicate that peri-urban residence depresses enrollment rates. These areas are populated
largely by immigrants from the rural areas. Rural parents and their children arrive with less and
poorer quality education, both o f which depress parental demand for education. O n the supply
side, facilities are inadequate to accommodate the burgeoning school-age population in these
areas, resulting inovercrowded classrooms and restrictedhours o f instruction. The consequence
is increasing rates o f social pathologies among youth, such as drugs and delinquency.

 65.     Education spending has been limited to the bare essentials. This fiscal policy degrades
 the value o f physical assets, human capital, educational quality, and the demand for education
 that i s sensitive to quality.   Inadequate public spending simply increases private costs for
 participating in education and shifts long-run costs, such as school rehabilitation, to future
 generations. To contain costs, Albania inthe 1990s allowed teachers' salaries to deteriorate from
 1.36 the average public sector wage in 1989 to below the average public sector wage by the end


                                                  33

o f the 1990s. By 2002 salaries o f teachers in advantaged areas were only 70 percent o f the
salaries for the lowest rung o f the civil service; for teachers in disadvantaged areas, 84 percent.
Government maintained efficiency by closing low quality agricultural vocational schools and
reducing the number of schools, classes and teachers to accommodate declining enrollments.
However, these actions were often unguidedby policy or data and resulted inlarge disparities in
access to schools, school programs, and studentkeacher ratios, depending on location.

66.      The education sector needs more resources and better management to make effective use
of additional resources. Education spending has been limited to the bare essentials. This fiscal
policy degrades the value o f physical assets, human capital, educational quality, and the demand
for education that is sensitive to quality. Inadequate public spending simply increases private
costs for participating in education and shifts long-run costs, such as school rehabilitation, to
future generations.

67.      In2002 public expenditures on education were 2.9 percent of GDP, significantly below
investments o f a number o f other countries in the region and a decline from the 3.3 percent o f
GDPinFYOl. Although the approved total education budget increased 24 percent between 2000
and 2003, 82 percent o f this increase was attributable to increases inthe capital budget. Since
Albania's educational facilities are either in the wrong places or often in poor repair and the
quality o f facilities affects students' enrollment, attendance, and learning, the increase incapital
budgets is important. However, inthis time period the total approved recurrent budget increased
by only 5 percent: a 14 percent increase for personnel and a worrying 32 percent decrease for
other recurrent costs. These costs include complements to teachers and facilities that affect their
value in the educational process-for      example, school maintenance, utilities, didactic materials
such as textbooks, other teaching materials, and teacher training.

 68.      Duringthe 1990sthe MoESwas also poorly structured and staffed to planandimplement
 change in the sector, and its role relative to other levels o f government and players was poorly
 defined.

 69.      Social assessments have shown that beneficiaries and other stakeholders at community
 levels distrust decisions in the education sector. The public lacks credible statistics and
 information on the performance o f the sector. It perceives that school heads are not selected on

                                                   34

merit grounds. The alienation o f the public from the sector undermines demand for education
and families' participation in the provision and financing o f education that can strengthen
students' school attendance and learning outcomes.

70.      Health: The Ministry o f Health has prepared a revised and expanded ten-year strategy,
which provides a situational analysis outlining in detail the many financing, quality, efficiency,
and sustainability of the existing health system. While the ten-year strategy describes the many
constraints in the system, much work remains to translate these broad goals into specific and
feasible actions for implementation in the short and medium-term. Under the NSSED, the
Government has identified three strategic approaches to addressing these problems: (a)
improving efficiency o f the system through better planningand resource allocation; (b) investing
in priority health delivery system to improve access to care and quality of services; and (c)
targetingpublic resources for priority public healthprograms that have the most impact on health
outcomes.

71.      M O H i s in the process o f strengthening its policy, planning and budget management
capacity with technical support provided by a number o f donors, including DFID, WHO,
USAID, and IDA (Health System Recovery and Development Project). While these technical
assistance activities are identifying specific resource requirements for upgrading national
capacity in planning, management and monitoring and evaluation, the PRSC provides an
opportunity to complement them by increasing the budget allocation to the health sector to
implement these programs. There is also an urgent need to clarify the responsibilities o f the
Ministry o f Health, the local government and Health Insurance Institute with respect to public
health programs and primary care services under the proposed fiscal decentralization process.
The public health system, which had been previously supported through the district health
 offices, will need to be reorganized to be consistent with the new administrative structure.
 Secondly, there is a need to harmonize the respective roles o f the local government and the
 Health Insurance Institute in the financing and management o f primary health care services.
 Finally, investments inhealth services will need to be planned monitored carefully to ensure that
 the under-served communities and vulnerable households will need to be given a high priority
 for receiving the benefit o fthese investments.

 72.      Albania embarked on the transition with a relatively healthy population, but life
 expectancy has fallen and under five mortality rates and infant mortality rates remain relatively
 high, especially in the rural communities. The children are more vulnerable to            infectious
 diseases thanadults due to poor living conditions and lack o f access to proper health care. At the
 same time, the country faces new emerging health issues - such as the rising incidence o f
 chronic diseases, road accidents, and high risk o f HIV/AIDS and related infectious diseases -
 that are likely to add to the burden o f disease and cost o f health care, and will require the
 development o fnew public health strategies and capacities.

 73.      Albania currently has a low level o f HIV seroprevalence (78 confirmed cases as at 27
 June 2002) compared with other regional countries. While the epidemic is at an early stage and
 relative numbersare low, significant conditions exist for a major increase. These include a young
  sexually active population, considerable economic hardship, a large mobile population, high
 levels o f trafficking inwomen and children, high levels o f STI, increasing evidence of injecting
  drug use with sharing o f needles and low condom use. Inrecognition o f the risks, considerable
  activity has been initiatedto prevent the the epidemic, including the establishment o f a highlevel
                                                   35

national steering committee, development o f education programs, establishment o f harm
reduction strategies, conducting rapid assessment and response, establishing safe blood supply,
surveillance and other related activities. However a number o f these mainly donor sponsored
initiatives, have proven to be unsustainable and have either ceased operation or exist in a
diminished capacity. There is an urgent need to strengthen the coordination of HIV-related
activities and develop a nationally sustainable strategy for addressing this serious and emerging
public health problem.

74.      Pension Reform: A second-round pension reform was launched in 2002, with support
from PRSC-1, to improve the performance o f the pension system established in 1993. That
system has distinct schemes for employees, urban self-employed workers, and rural self-
employed workers (farmers).      The reform aims to reduce the reliance o f the pension system on
budgetary transfers, while promoting adequate incomes. It i s therefore a key aspect o f fiscal
consolidation as well as o f social protection. Inpensions, five key issues need to be addressed
by an appropriate medium to long term pension strategy. First, prior to the reform, the pension
system's deficit amounted to about one percent o f GDP and projections suggested that this
deficit would worsen over time. The overall pension system deficit is effectively financed
through the state budget. Second, although rural pensions (which are extensively cross-
subsidized) accounted for one-fifth o fthe pension system deficit, they also play an important role
inpoverty alleviationandas a social safety netfor older people inruralareas. Third, contribution
compliance i s low, and high social insurance contribution rates discourage willing participation
in the pension scheme and in formal employment.             Fourth, there seems little prospect o f
establishing supplementary private pension funds for higher-income employees within a short-
term framework. This is because o f the lack o f satisfactory regulatory capacity to oversee
dependable accumulation o f assets and payment o f pensions by institutions managing such
funds. For the same reasons, and the additional reason o f affordability, there is no scope to
create a second-pillar fund for rural farmers. Fifth, the share o fthe retired population covered by
the pension system will drop substantially inthe longer term (30-40 years), raising a longerterm
issue with respect to the protection o f future retirees. This is because work prior to 1993 was
deemed to be contributory but a large part o fthe current workforce does not contribute.

 75.      Social Assistance: Social assistance policy concerns center on cash assistance and social
care services. Concerning social assistance, the primary challenge i s to overcome obstacles to
 improved targeting o f ndihme ekonomike, a means-tested cash benefit for the poorest families
that roughly one-fifth o f all families receive. The program provides conditional grants that local
 governments are to administer using nationally specified eligibility and benefit rules. A 1998
 assessment, based on 1996 data, found that 36 percent o f all program expenditures went to
 families whose per capita incomes placed them in the lowest decile, and three-quarters went to
 families inthe bottom four deciles. However, half o f all families inthe lowest decile received no
 assistance; the allocation o f central government funds to local governments was less well
 targeted than the local governments' allocation o f funds to families; and local governments that
 received relatively higher levels o f funding used this primarily to extend coverage to less needy
 families rather than to raise benefits to the poorest families. More recent anecdotal accounts
 suggest that targeting by local governments has deteriorated since 1996. The key policy
 requirements now are processes (a) to determine when the allocation o f ndihme ekonomike
 systematically disregards intended targeting criteria and (b) to intervene to achieve appropriate
 targeting practices. Those requirements sit uneasily with the Government's new decentralization
 policy, under which it is transferring additional responsibilities to local governments. In2002,

                                                  36

the Ministry o f Labor and Social Protection began an ongoing administrative review of the
eligibility o f existing recipients o f ndihme ekonomike, which has so far reduced the total caseload
by 8,000 families (5.6 percent). In 2002, averaged across all households, public and private
transfers reported in the LSMS survey represented 36 percent o f household income. Public
pensions and private transfers from Albanian relatives abroad dominated, with ndihme
ekonomike contributing substantially less (3.1 percent). Nevertheless, ndihme ekonomike was
the single most important source oftransfer income for poor and extremely poor households, for
whom it provided 26 percent and 32 percent respectively o f all transfer income. Three-quarters
of all households receiving ndihme ekonomike were poor. However, poverty did not assure
receipt o f ndihme ekonomike. Fully 69 percent o f households in severe poverty and 75 percent
o f all poor households did not receive ndihme ekonomike. Many o f these, o f course, might have
been ineligible. Conceming social care services, Albania recently committed to a significant
expansion o f community-based services with support from the recently approved SSDP project.
Policy makers need to develop a policy framework and a sustainable financing system for these
services.

Reform Program

76. The Government's program to improve service delivery i s reflected inthe 2003-05 MTEF.
The PRSC focused on the key social sector specific issues that have been identified as MTEF
priorities, and is supporting the line ministries in their implementation o f the new framework.
The aim i s to assist with the follow-through o f the MTEF/sector strategies inthe critical social
services sectors. For each sector, the MTEF has aimed to narrow the list o f proposed expenditure
areas to a realistic subset o f 2-4 key priorities for the MTEF period. The PRSC will support the
 Government in implementing those priorities through the identification o f related triggers for
 each round o fthe Program.

 77.    Education: The strategy o f the Government for dealing with these issues duringthe period
 o fthe PRSC is to:

 78. Improve the management of the sector by building four capacities: policy analysis,
planning, and monitoring; financial management; human resources management; and
 textbook management. This priority fits Albania's public administration reform and the primary
 objectives o f the Education Reform Project. Despite a high tumover o f ministers (3 ministers
 between September 2001 and February 2002), the management o f the MoES is now
 demonstrably improving:

         a.   DOPAand the Prime Minister's office have approved a proposed restructuringof the
              MoES that has been based on a careful functional analysis. The approved proposal
              includes a new Ministry structure, staffing requirements, job descriptions, and costs;

         b. The Ministry is reassigning current staff to better match skills and tasks, replacing
              unproductive staff with more competent individuals competitively selected, and
              competitively hiringstaff for newly approved functions;

         c.   A performance audit that meets international standards is in process for the
              management, finance, education (including textbooks), and human resources o f the


                                                    37

             MoES. The audit defines performance baselines against which future progress can be
             monitored; and

       d.    An initial human resources policy framework has been developed, and a plan for
             further elaboration is inplace.

79. Improve thefinancing of the sector. To address under-funding o f the sector, Albania is
committed under the MTEF to increase expenditure allocations for education between 2002 and
2004 by about 20 percent inreal terms. The table presented earlier on expenditures and planned
expenditures between FYOO and FY03 shows uneven budgetary performance. Constant Lek
expenditures declined-between FYO1and FY02, including reductions inboth the wage recurrent
and non-wage recurrent budgets, in part due to the revised fiscal framework. The planned
education budget for FY03 is expected to increase relative to the FY02 budget, with a 14 percent
increase inthe wage bill. However, the planned non-wage recurrent budget shows a decline o f
32 percent. Albania hasjust been selected as one o f 18 countries for the Education for All Fast
Track Initiative (EFA FTI). Albania's application for EFA grant funds will be scrutinized for
evidence o f its fiscal commitment to education, especially basic education.          The PRSC-3
program has introduced a public expenditure tracking survey (PETS) for education to identify
issues related to the budget formulation andexecution.

80. Increase affordability and quality of basic and secondary education, especially in rural
andperi-urban areas where educational demand is significantly lower andpoverty is significantly
higher. Increasingparental demand involves a multi-pronged approach.

         a. Prepare an application for the Education For All Fast Track Initiative (EFA FTI) that:
             (i) causalpathsbetweenobstaclestoaccess,interventionstoaddressobstacles,
                 traces
             and increased enrollment rates; and (ii) financing gaps between available
                                                          models
             resources and the fiscal requirements for meeting enrollment and completion targets
             by 2015.

         b. Increase compulsory basic education from 8 to 9 years to begin increasing the total
             years o f education that the average student completes.

         c. Introduce the MoES' new textbook policy that includes free textbooks for all students
              inbasic compulsoryeducation

         d. Circumvent some of the resource constraints on providing high quality VET
              programs for secondary students by working with MoLSA to create a single national
              VET authority, starting withaformal agreement to share VET facilities.

 81. Increase the transparency of decisions made inthe sector. Two actions are planned here,
 but more progress is needed. One is to publishthe first Annual EducationPerformance Report,
 statistical analyses o f the adequacy o f inputs, processes, and outcomes inthe sector, and to make
 non-technical versions o f this report widely available through the media. The second i s to
 publish annually in the newspapers the list of schools rehabilitated in the previous year,
 including inter alia, information on the school's location, the amount invested, the amount
 invested as a percent o fthe average investmentper school, and financing source.

82.     Health: The Government has harnessedthe NSSED process to consolidate the priorities
identified inthe earlier strategy, and intends to use the PRSC to support the most critical areas.
Those areas are as follows:

        a. Improving the Effectiveness of theResourceAllocation System -- Under MTEF, the
            Government i s committed to modest increase expenditure on healthto compensate for
            the current low expenditure levels. Between 2002 and 2004, expenditure allocations
            for health are programmed to increase from 2.8 percent o f GDP to 3.2 percent of
            GDP. However, the increase inbudget allocation will need to be accompanied by a
            more in-depth analysis on workforce planning and recurrent cost requirements to
            assure that the increased resources are contributing to improved efficiency and quality
            o f services. The Government will also introduce an improved budgettracking system
            and National Health Accounts (NHA) to monitor and track the budget and assure
            effective and efficient use o fresources for the intended outputs.

        b. Reform of Overall Health Financing System: One o f the pillars o f health sector
            reform in Albania consists of the introduction o f a Health Insurance Institute (HII),
            whose functions will be gradually expanded to become the foundation for a national
            health insurance system which will ensure universal health coverage based on the
            principles o f equity, efficiency and quality o f services. At present the HI1coverage
            is very limited (reimbursements are available only for General Practitioner
            consultation and prescription drugs), and its revenue and co-payment structures do
            not provide adequate protection to the poor. The current pilot programs with the
            Tirana Region HealthAuthority andDurres Hospital are intendedto develop a model
            for performance based reimbursement system, respectively, for the primary care
            network and the hospital system. The lessons from these pilot programs will be
            applied towards the design o f a more comprehensive health insurance systemthat will
            begin to replace the current fragmented and bureaucratic budget allocation system
            (MoH, HI1 and local government) to a coherent, performance-based and modern
            health financing system, with greater managerial autonomy and responsibility
            accorded to the providers, and a more flexible staff remuneration system. As a first
            step toward capacity building o f the HI1operations, in 2003 the focus will be an
            upgrading the Management Information System at the pilot clinical sites and the HI1
            branch offices to support the primarycare payment system,

        c. Primary and Public Health Financing. During the October 2002 PRSC mission, the
            issue o f primary health financing was discussed extensively with the MoF, MoLG,
            MoH, IMF, and US-AIDNrban Institute. Primary and public health services have
            deteriorated significantly since the operations and maintenance financing was folded
            into the unconditional grant to local governments. This threatens national capacity to
            deliver priority public services that have an important bearing on the overall health
             status o f the Albanianpopulation. Further, these fiscal responsibilities are planned to
            be included under the health insurance scheme under the national reform - not to
            remain under local discretion. In October, it was agreed that beginning in January
            2003, primary health care operations and maintenance expenditures would be pulled
             from the unconditional grant, and will be earmarked, in order to improve the
             likelihood that those funds reach the primary and public health care service providers
             (see October 24 Aide-Memoire). However, the mission was informed that a decision

                                                  39

  was made in December 2002 to leave this finding under the unconditional grant
  mechanism. The World Bank was not informed o f this change, and the mission has
  not been provided with a clear explanation as to why this would improve service
  delivery. The Government has made extensive investments in developing a national
  primary and public health care system. These investments received major support
   from the external donors, including the World Bank. Placing the operations and
   maintenance financing o f these services in the hands o f the communes and
  municipalities has clearly had negative effects on service delivery -the localities lack
   capacity to manage these expenditures, and in many cases are diverting the funds to
   other local purposes. This is occurring even as the Government has worked to
   increase the national health budget. Given its importance, the PRSC-2 program will
   therefore include a condition o f Board presentation that requires the Government to
   adhere to its prior commitments regarding the agreed policy on primary and public
   healthoperations and maintenance.

d. Rationalization of the Health Delivery System. Due to the rapid out-migration and
   changing socio-economic conditions inthe rural and urban areas, the existing health
   delivery system no longer matches the population needs. New investment plans are
   needed based on agreed services standards and priority benefits, projected population
   movements and needs, and expected expansion inbasic infrastructure such as roads,
   electrification and watedsanitation services. Inparallel with the reforms inthe health
   financing system, there is a need to undertake a comprehensive review o f the current
   status and utilization o f health services, including appropriate referral systems, and to
   develop a health investment plan that addresses the major gaps between the quality
   standards and the existing services. In 2002, the Government established a working
   group and prepared a work program for the preparation o f a detailed master plan in
   Tirana Region for rehabilitation o f selected facilities and projections o f staffing, staff
   training and recurrent budget requirements to ensure sustainability o f these
   investments. Under PRSC-2, the first phase o f the Regional Health Plan, involving
   the establishment o f service standards and guidelines, will be completed by first
   quarter 2003. This activity will be replicated in other regions in subsequent years,
   and will include training and capacity building o f the national and regional/local
   authorities inplanningfor health care services.

e. Targeted Public Health Interventions:           While the above activities address the
   systemic problems to improve the quality and efficiency o f the health care delivery
   system, a number o f critical public health interventions have been identified that
   require special attention. These activities will involve strengthening o f critical public
   health programs through (a) increased budget allocation to priority public health
   programs, including maternal and child health, immunization, health promotion, and
   HIV/AIDS, STD and TB control; (b) qualitative improvements inthe program; and
   (c) improved monitoring and surveillance system to measure the impact o f the new
   policies and programs on outcomes. In 2002, the Government has developed a
   National Strategy for Public Health and Health Promotion, and conducted a national
   workshop to review the priorities and proposals with the stakeholders. The strategy
   includes proposed budget allocation for the priority programs to be supported by the
   Government over the next three years.        The priority areas identified inthe Strategy
   include: (i)health promotion and prevention programs for HIV/AIDS, control o f
                                          40

            smoking, hypertension, healthy eating, healthy lifestyles, cancer screening for
            women, and traffic safety (see below); and (ii)improved health information and
            surveillance system to monitor and track changes in critical health outcomes
            indicators, such as child malnutrition, tuberculosis prevalence, and STD/HIV/AIDS
            cases. The National HIV/AIDS Multisectoral Committee, chaired by the Vice Prime
            Minister, has been established, and a national core team already exists within the
            Institute o f Public Health, but requires further strengthening o f its capacity towards
            organizing and implementing HIV/AIDS control and prevention strategies and inter-
            sectoral cooperation.

83.     Pensions. The Government has begun to develop and implement a comprehensive
pension reform program as part o f its programs to consolidate fiscal resources and strengthen
social protection. In2002, it introduced a major package o f marginal parametric changes to the
system. These included: (i) increases in retirement ages o f five years over a ten-year
                                 further
period (with legislative proposals submitted by December 2002 on the detailed structure of a
parallel option for limited early retirement);I6      (ii)67-percentincreaseintheceilingincome
                                                          a
level on which contributions are assessed; (iii)a reduction o f four percentage points in
contributionrates for employees' pensions and other social insurance benefits; (iv) elimination of
price-compensation elements o f pensions in excess o f EU guidelines; (v) legislative measures
and enhanced inter-agency cooperation to improve performance in collecting pension
contributions owed to SII; and (vi) narrowing the gap inpension levels for self-employed rural
andurbanworkers, as well as increasing rural pensionlevels inreal terms. Additional objectives
o f the ongoing reform program are: (a) to develop and introduce a second-round package of
comprehensive pension reforms that addresses the overall, longer-term problems o f coverage,
affordability, equity, and adequacy; (b) to improve the effectiveness and efficiency o f operations
within the Social Insurance Institute (SII), including further improvingperformance incollecting
mandated contributions; (c) to reassess the structure o f rural pensions and income support for
elderly people in rural areas and to introduce appropriate changes inthe short-to-medium term;
and (d) to lay the groundwork for the creation o f private organizations that offer voluntary,
supplementary pensions by identifying legislative, regulatory, fiduciary, and administrative
prerequisites for their establishment and by proposing a strategy for putting these necessary
safeguards inplace. The PRSC-2 program will achieve financial strengthening by introducing a
legislated requirement that SI1 have its financial statements audited, at least once every five
years, by a team from an international auditing firm who have expertise inpensionand insurance
auditing. It will also pursue improved operational efficiency through automation o f periodic
processing o f pensionpayments on a pilot basis at the SI1headquarters and inone region, which
i s expected to improve financial controls and reduce payments that are invalid. (A cost-benefit
analysis o f the results will be conducted.)      Concurrently, work will continue, for completion
under PRSC-3, on a further legislative package that: (i)      defines the future basis for indexation o f
pension levels; (ii)specifies a 10-year schedule for future reductions in social insurance
contribution rates; and (iii)  enacts and gradually implements a decision already taken to transfer
the contribution collection function of SI1 to the General Tax Directorate in MoF. SI1 also
expects to produce an initial triennial report in2003.




l6 Pension benefits would be reduced by 0.6 percent for each month before the standard retirement age that the
individualretired.

                                                     41

84.    Social Assistance. The Government's strategy for decentralization will need to address
the issue of accountability for use of funds in nationally funded but locally administered
programs designed to accomplish nationally specified social protection objectives. The policy
choices are to introduce new evaluation and compliance processes or to devolve responsibility
for goal-setting as well as for program administration. Drawing on the recent LSMS, the PRSC
program will support a study of how pensions and ndihme ekonomike affect poverty and
contribute to the multiple objectives of social assistance. The study will be used to reassess the
design of both cash assistance and rural pension programs, and to serve as the basis for
downstream policy changes. Following the Government's review of policies on accountability
within a decentralized system, the delivery of effective social assistance through cash and
community-based service programs, and a framework for the sustainable financing of those
programs, the Program will assist the Government in designing a program to strengthen the
capacity ofthe administrative systems responsiblefor delivering these programs effectively.

  OBJECTIVE 4: STRENGTHENINGTHE POLICY FORMULATION PROCESS, PUBLICEXPENDITURE
                     MANAGEMENT AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL RELATIONS

Performance and theRemaining Issues

87.      The promotion o f growth and poverty reduction requires strong public andprivate sector
institutions that operate in a transparent and accountable fashion and that are accessible to all,
including the poor. During the 1990s, Albania's development and growth was constrained by
weak institutional capacity and by a lack o f transparent and accountable public administration."
These same factors also contributed to increased corruption in Albania.                          Therefore, policy
formulation and monitoring, human resource management, public expenditure management,
financial accountability, and fiscal decentralizationare among the core capacities that needto be
strengthened so that the Government's programs o f poverty reduction can be effectively
implemented.

19See Albania Beyond the Crisis:A Strategyfor Recovery and Growth, World Bank report, December, 1998. Since the
1997 crisis, progress has been made in building a framework for improved and transparent public organizations. The
Government is also taking a number o f actions aimed at enhancing the inclusiveness and citizen-responsiveness o f
Albania's public institutions. These actions include establishing a fully functional People's Advocate (ombudsman),
establishing a Civil Service Commission, and launching systematic consultations with the citizenry as part of the NSSED
process. In addition, complementary measures are being taken to improve the delivery of health, education, and social
services.

                                                         47

88.     Policv Formulation. Policy formulation and performance management capacities are
keys to designing sound policies and ensuring their effective implementation. The Government
has launched a number o f initiatives inrecent years that aim to strengthenvarious aspects o f its
policy formulation and performance management capacities. The Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (see below), as well as the NSSED process, have both helped to develop important
policy formulation and performance management capacities. But these initiatives need to be
complemented, reinforced and better integrated. They need to be supported through procedures
and organizational structures and arrangements that institutionalize key aspects o f the NSSED
process and enhance contestability o f the policy formulation process and that create capacities
and incentives for management o f public programs, policies and services that focus managers
and their staff on results. They need to be complemented with strengthening o f policy analysis
capacities, as well as capacities to figure out what needs to be monitored, how to do so, and what
systems need to be created for such monitoring.

89.     Public ExDenditure Management. Effective delivery o f public services requires not only
well designed macroeconomic and fiscal policies, but also well functioning institutions -- rules,
procedures, and organizational arrangements that govern the budget process and shape the
incentives that influence the size, allocation, and use o f budgetary resources.                        Since the
introduction the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) the Government has begun to
address the significant shortcomings inthe budget management process. Continued support and
assistance i s needed to make the MTEF process more efficient and to enable the Government to
follow through on public expenditure reforms and to complement them with other measures to
improve budget execution andmonitoring.

90.     Periodic evaluation o f budget outcomes and integrating the findings into the next year's
budget formulation are key ingredients for improving the overall efficiency o f public
expenditures.*' Reporting and recording o f all foreign financed projects including those financed
by grants needs to be improved. There is also a need to establish an investment budget database
containing commitments, disbursements and expenditures. The MoF receives many transfer
requests during the course o f the fiscal year and spends substantial amounts o f time on such
requests instead o f spending time on analyses o f budgetary links with sector policies. There i s
also a needto review timing cycle o f the MTEF process to allow line ministries adequate time to
better prepare their budget proposals, which currently takes place during the months o f July-
August.

91,     Human Resource Management. If these institutional reform efforts are to achieve their
objectives, they need qualified, motivated and meritocratically managed civil servants to do the
work - analyze policy options, prepare budgets, manage finances, undertake audits, deliver
public services, etc.      The Government has recognized this need and has enacted a Law on the
Status o f the Civil Servant (CSL) in November o f 1999 to this end.                    Substantial progress has
been made in implementing that Law and its subsidiary legislation, but important challenges
remain.


2o Budget evaluation i s currently primarily focused on collecting regular accounting reports on budget execution and
ensuring compliance with spending limitations. The controls are mostly input-orientedrather than outcome-oriented,
with no measurable monitoring indicators.


                                                         48

92.      The longstanding effort to establish a meritocratic, depoliticized civil service has made
important strides. The due processprotections provided by the Law on Civil Servants (CS Law)
and its subsidiary legislation, andthe fact that they are actually functioning, even ifimperfectly,
are widely recognized among civil servants as a significant achievement. However, various
actions give cause for concernabout integrity ofthe legal underpinning of the civil service:


         0    The Law on the Competences for Setting Salaries assigns responsibility for setting
              salary structures within the public administration to the Ministry of Labor and Social
              Affairs (MoLSA), in direct contradiction to the provisions of the organic CS Law
              assigning that responsibility to the Department of Public Administration. It also
              assigns responsibilities for setting salary structures within local governing bodies to
              MoLSA, in direct conflict with provisions of the Law on the Organization and
              Functioning of Local Governments.


         0    Frequentresort to Decree No. 46921for appointment procedures different from those
              requiredby the organic CS Law for certain positions covered by that Law, despite
              the fact that the CS Law requires competitive recruitment procedures for positions it
              covers, and states that all other provisions of laws or decrees that are inconsistent
              withthis CS Law shall berepealed.


         0    Replacement of key personnel not covered by the CS Law, but through procedures
              andunder circumstances that, at a minimum, raise questions about the commitment to
              transparent,merit-basedmanagementof key public sectorpositions.22


93. The risks facing the CS Law for creating a professional, merit-based, depolitiziced civil
service fall into the following broad categories:

                     i. WeakcommitmentbytheGovernmenttotheunderlyingobjectivesofthe

                     ..     civil service reformefforts.

                     11.     Contradictions and lack of clarity in the legal framework governing the
                            civil service.
                    iii. ImperfectunderstandingofalltherequirementsandimplicationsoftheCS
                            Law and its subsidiary legislation by both civil servants and the political
                            leaderswith whom they must work.
                    iv.      Inabilityto attract qualified personnel into the civil service.
94.      There is a need to address these risks. The first of these risks is not amenable to a
technical solution. What is requiredis an action by the Government that would send a signal of
credible commitment to those objectives. The second risk requires revision of the legal


21DecreeN.469 (14 August 1995) provides that appointments and dismissals of Directors inMinistries and other
central institutions shall be made by the Prime Minister, at the recommendation ofthe head ofthe Ministry or
institution within which that position exists.
22Examples include replacements o fthe Director General of Customs, as well as the replacement ofthe Director o f
the Port ofDurres,the Customs Chiefat Rinas IntemationalAirport, the Director General ofKESH,the Director
General ofAlbtelecom, and, most recently, the Director General of INSIG.

                                                          49

framework including rescinding o f the Amendments to the Law on Competences for Setting o f
Salaries. The third risk i s one that will requireproviding training needs, on an ongoing basis, to
all civil servants, to increase the understanding o f the CS Law and the various requirements and
procedures mandated by that Law and its subsidiary legislation. The fourth risk requires two
sorts o f actions. First, salaries within the civil service need to remain competitive. Second, the
competitive, merit-based civil service management due process requirements need to be
respected, in order to make a civil service career attractive. It i s now time to review whether
there i s a need to increase salaries again, (either in 2004 or 2005). Moreover, the Government
needsto systematically assess whether certaintypes o fpositions remain more difficult to fillwith
qualified personnel than others. Ifso, the structure o f salaries withinthe civil service would need
to be reviewed.23 Inaddition, actions are also needed to ensure adequate oversight o f the civil
service reform effort. These include monitoring o f key indicators o f the reforms, as well as
completing the central registry o f personnel that DOPAhas been developing, largely with
assistancefrom the European Union.

95, Public Sector Accountabilitv. To date, Albania's ongoing anti-corruption program has
largely focused on measures to address weaknesses in state institutions. This was appropriate
given the extreme weaknesses o f its state structures inthe past. The analysis o f the results of the
1999 BEEPS24(a firm-level survey on governance and corruption issues o f more than 3000
enterprise owners in 22 transition countries) unbundled the phenomenon o f corruption, placing
primary emphasis on the distinction between administrative corruption -referring to the
intentional imposition o f distortions inthe implementation o f legislation and policies to benefit
individual officials- and state capture -referring to actions by political and business elites to
influence the formulation of legislation and governmental policies to benefit a narrow range of
beneficiaries--.

96.      In 1999, Albania emerged as a country with high levels of administrative corruption,
while the level o f state capture was among the lowest inthe region. However, with the gradual
strengthening o f Albania's state institutions, state capture has become more o f a risk. The 2002
BEEPS shows that Albania's perceived state capture level has increased compared to 1999.
Increasing transparency and improving the accountability o f has become a priority and requires a
greater attention on the part o f the Government to increase accountability o f High Public
Officials.

97.      Overall Fiduciarv Assessment. At present, there is clearly a moderate to highdegree o f
fiduciary risk in the use o f public resources, given the weak institutional arrangements for the
assessment o f effectiveness o f implementation o f budget programs, weak internal controls
coupled with weak internal audit function, and weak capacity inseveral institutions to implement
and enforce laws and regulations, including the Parliament that is supposed to provide legislative
oversight over the executive. In the past few years, under external pressures and on its own
volition, Albania has established a legislative and institutional framework in the area o f public
financial accountability. However, as many of these accountability institutions are o f recent

23The review would address both the levels o f CS salaries by position classification as well as options for ensuring
competitiveness o f specialist salaries within key positions. Any revisions to the salary structure that would allow
highersalariesfor such"key specialist positions" would needto carefully define the criteria andprocedures for
classifying a position as a "key specialist position", inorder to prevent unwarranteduse o f such a mechanism for
providing higher salaries to certain positions.
24Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey

origin and lack exposure to best practices intheir area of operations, they have not been able to
fully achieve the set objectives. Another critical factor in the effective functioning of
accountability institutions is the political commitment. For instance, Albania has established a
Supreme Audit Institution, the High State Control, that is accountable to the Parliament. The
High State Control has adopted internationally recognized INTOSAI guidelines and standards.
However, it lacks capacity to implement these guidelines and standards. The parliament also
lacks capacity to analyze the audit reports and to ensure that the government takes appropriate
action to address the issues raised in the audit report. Due to weak legislative oversight, the
executive has little incentive to address the issues raised inthe audit report. The challenge now is
to build capacity in several institutions to effectively implement and enforce existing laws and
regulations. This will require significant capacity building efforts over a sustainedperiod of time
anda substantialpolitical support andleadership.

98.     The recent Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) report25highlights a
number of areas that require attention in order to strengthen the public accountability
arrangements. Inaddition to those mentioned above, the systemic issues include: inadequatecash
management practices; absence of a mechanism to identify and enforce compliance with the
existing rules and procedures; lack of consolidated financial statements for the government as a
whole; and, weak external audit capacity. A sound cash management system to ensure fiscal
sustainability is lacking, which is partly due to the circular financial arrangements the state-
                                                                                          -
owned Savings Bank gets reimbursedfrom the central bank payments made by it on behalf of the
government, the central bank issues treasury bills- to finance the cash deficit which are fully
                                                                                       -
subscribed by the Savings Bank. Regular reconciliation of treasury data, data from the agent
banks and the central bank is not carried out to contain the risk of float with the agent banks.A
solid legal framework for the internal audit function is lacking. There is a need to provide
detailed methodological guidance on accounting to the budget institutions and to update the chart
of accounts to provide proper linkages with the budget classification. Consolidated financial
statementsthat could provide useful managementinformationsuch as accumulatedliabilities are
not prepared. Maintaining independence and avoiding politicization of the Supreme Audit
Institutioni s also important.

99. Under PRSC-1, IDA, in close cooperation with the Government, conducted a stakeholder
workshop to discuss various issues highlighted inthe CFAA and to preparean agreedaction plan
to implement the recommendations. The Government has already undertakenseveralmeasures to
address the issues identified inthe CFAA. By enacting a Law on Internal Audit, the government
has taken concrete measures to address the core weakness in the public financial management
viz. absence of internal audit function in the public sector. The Treasury has started collecting
 financial data from the regional treasury offices, agent banks, andthe Central bank. However, the
treasury needs to start daily reconciliation of consolidated treasury payment requests from the
 regional treasury offices with the reimbursement data provided by the Central bank. The
 Accounting Department, withinMoF,has prepareda first pro-forma ofthe consolidatedfinancial
 statements. However, it is more of a simple addition of financial statements of line ministries
 than a proper consolidated financial statement that eliminates transfers and provides proper
 information on assets and liabilities.

100.     Public procurement practices are also weak and lack transparency. The findings o f the
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) on Albania, indicate that, while the Law on
Public Procurement, which governs expenditures by public institutions on the acquisition o f
goods and services, was fairly comprehensive, enforcement o f the law was beingundermined by
the absence o f detailed implementing regulations, which are needed to define the specific
procedures to be followed in the application o f the procurement law. A further weakness
identified by the CPAR is the absence o f high-quality standard procurement documents and
forms o f contract, which are neededto introduce uniformity o f interpretationand applicationand
to provide a reliable contractual basis on which public purchasers may award contracts. The
CPAR also identified a lack o f transparency in Albania's procurement system. Public officials
generally have a low level o f awareness o f the current legislation governing public procurement
and bidders, both local andforeign, and complain o fthe difficulty they have infinding out about
contract opportunities and awards.

101.     Related to the issues o f public expenditure management and fiscal transparency is the
Government's decision to implement a decentralization strategy. As mentioned in PRSC-1
document this requires designing appropriate laws and regulations governing its structure. The
introduction o f the "block grant" in 1998, to cover operations and maintenance, led to a small
increase inthe fiscal autonomy o f local governments. In2001, a number o f exclusive functions
o f local governments continued to be financed as conditional grants from the line ministry
budgets, but in2002, they have been transferred to the general budget o f local governments.


Reform Program

102.     The Government's program focuses on simultaneous reforms inthe following key areas:
(i)policy formulation; (ii) resourcemanagement; (iii) expendituremanagement;
                                human                                   public
(iv) public sector accountability; and, (v) fiscal decentralization. The objectives are to improve
the functioning o fthe public sector and to improve the use o fresources to deliver public services
more efficiently. These reforms will also contribute to improved governance and increased
transparency and accountability in the public sector, and will help create an institutional
environment withinAlbania's public sector that is less conducive to corrupt behavior.

103.     Introducing a more contestablepolicyformulation process. The recent improvements
inthe budget formulation process need to be reinforcedby reforms ofthe process by which all
policy proposals, notjust budgetproposals, are prepared and, ultimately, vetted with the Council
o f Ministers and Parliament. Several careful analyses o f Albania's policy formulation process
and practices provide a firm basis on which the Government can begin to build a more
contestable policy formulation process.26 Such a process would ensure (a) systematic analysis of



26 "Aide Memoire: Albania Poverty Reduction Support Credit Monitoring and Evaluation Component Support
Mission," (World Bank: December2-9,2002); "Strengthening EconomicManagement," reportpreparedfor UNDP
EconomicManagementFunctionProject-Albania, preparedby Hendrik KoppenandMauroNapodano(December

Administration and the World Bank (Gary M. Kelly, June 2002). "Guidelines for Methods and Implementation of

important policy issues raised by proposed laws, including: alternative means o f addressing the
objectives o f the proposed legislation, likely impacts, tradeoffs, and implementation challenges.
It would also ensure that (b) policy proposals are subject to systematic review by key
stakeholders or their representatives, including the proposing agency (e.g., a line Ministry), the
Ministry o f Finance (on fiscal impacts), as well as policy analysis professionals within the
Council o f Ministers. Under PRSC-1, the Government submitted to Parliament a Law on
organization and functioning o fthe Council o f Ministers designed to establish a legal framework
more supportive o f a contestable policy formulation process.

104.     Under PRSC-2 and PRSC-3, capacity needs to be developed to ensure that the policy
formulation process actually i s more contestable. Accordingly, the Government and Parliament
have designed a course o f actions aimed at (i)           improving the capacities o f line ministries to
prepare policy proposals based on clear objectives and built upon well conceived and carefully
analyzed sector strategies, and to ensure that those strategies include systems designed to
generate systematic, probative information on the outputs and outcomes o f their implementation;
(ii) establishing at the center o f government the authority and capacity to ensure that policy
proposals forwarded to the Council o f Ministers provide the supporting analysis and
documentation required to facilitate informed, rational deliberations by the Council o f Ministers;
and (iii)establishing within Parliament capacity to undertake professional analyses of the
substance o f policy proposals and assessments o f the impacts achieved during their
implementation. More specific actions to be supported by PRSC-2 include: (i)                  preparation o f a
strategy and action plan for building a more contestable policy formulation practices within the
executive branch, as well as launching implementation o f that action plan by establishing a
unified, civil-service-staffed Departmental structure with responsibility for effecting this
function; (ii)  completion o f a review o f functions currently lodged within the Council of
Ministers (CoM) and make preparations to relocate any that are either not essential for the core
policy functions o f the C o M or need to be located within the C o M because o f their importance
 and cross-cutting nature; and (iii)   preparation with Parliament o f a strategy and action plan for
 strengthening professional policy analysis and oversight capacities withinthe Parliament.

 105.    Human Resource Management. The Government's strategy for addressing the human
 resource management reform challenges mentioned above has the following elements:

 106.    Ensuring credible commitment to underlying human resource management objectives.
 Under the PRSC-2 the Government has made a credible commitment to the underlying
 objectives o f its human resource management reform effort. The Government has provided
 evidence that personnel actions inkey positions are consistent with the objectives o f the relevant
 legislation as well as with the principles embodied inthe draft Code o f Ethics. Such evidence has
 demonstrate that: (i)dismissals or appointments have occurred in compliance with procedural
 due process requirements o fthe relevant legislation.; and(ii) appointments have beenmade o f
                                                                        no
 persons who are unqualified, a close relative o f persons involved in their selection and
 appointment decision, or inviolation o f conflict o f interest principles.

 107.    Establishing a clearer legal Jiamework In order to remove ambiguities in the legal

analyzed problems in that legal framework to ensure effective implementation o f the Civil
Service Law (CSL) and its subsidiary legislation. Accordingly,.                       Based on that analysis and
advice already provided by IDA and the EU, the Government will, by PRSC-3, forward to
Parliament a package o f legal revisions which are requiredto address the problems identifiedin
that legal framework.

108.     Ensuring greater understanding of the human resource management reform requirements
and implications: This will require varied and continuous efforts to overcome. Poorly specified
requirements o f the CSL and its subsidiary legislation need to be spelled out in more detail.
Training needsto be provided, on an ongoing basis, to all civil servants, as well as to the political
level staff.     The challenge is to increase the understanding o f the CSL and the various
requirements and procedures mandated by that Law and its subsidiary legislation, as well as to
continuously enhance the professional and managerial skills of civil servants. Accordingly, the
Government will undertake the following actions to help address these challenges:

              Issue decree clarifying the roles, responsibilities and functions o f Secretaries General
              andDeputyMinisters, as well as the missions ofMinisters.

              Issue decree abrogating Decree No. 469 (14 August 1995) and establishing
              transparent, competitive recruitment and selection procedures, and transparent,
               contestable      disciplinary procedures for higher officials within the public
               administration.

               Submitto Parliament a Code ofEthics.

               Submit to Parliament amendments to the Law on Competences for Setting of Salaries
               which      re-establishes      the      public    administration       salary-setting     institutional
               arrangements specified in the Law on the Status o f Civil Servants (Law no. 8549,
               dated 11November 1999).


 109.     Enhancing the attractiveness of a civil service career: This challenge requires two types
o f actions. First, salaries within the civil service need to remain competitive. Second, the
competitive, merit-based civil service management due process requirements need to be
respected, in order to make a civil service career attractive.                     The Government will review
whether there i s a need to increase salaries. Moreover, the Government needs to systematically
assess whether certain types o f positions remain more difficult to fill with qualified personnel
than others. Ifso, the structure of salaries within the civil service would need to be reviewed.
Accordingly, the Government will undertake such a review prior to PRSC-3 and, if there i s a
need, revise the salary structure to address those needs.27 Inaddition, as noted, the competitive
recruitment and selection procedures, as well as the due process protections afforded civil
servants, are already making a civil service career more attractive. DOPA needs to continue
preventingthe proliferation o f requests to recruit persons on contract to civil service positions,


2' The review would addressboththe levels of CS salaries by position classification as well as options for ensuring
 competitiveness of specialist salaries within key positions. Any revisions to the salary structure that would allow
higher salaries for such "key specialist positions" would needto carefully d e f i e the criteria andprocedures for
 classifying a position as a "key specialist position", inorder to prevent unwarranted use of such a mechanism for
providinghigher salariesto certain positions.

which occurred shortly after the competitive recruitment and selection procedures were
introduced.

110.    Strengthening feedback mechanisms: The Government will also undertake actions aimed
at ensuring effective feedback on the civil service reform effort, so that it can be continuously
improved. These include monitoring o f key indicators o f the intermediate impacts o f these
reforms, as well as completion o f the central registry o f personnel that DoPA has been
developing for some time, largely with assistance from the European Union. DoPA continues
publishing, on a quarterly basis, ministry specific data on incidence of contract arrangements (vs.
civil service appointment) for staffing o f civil service positions. Itwill also help line ministries in
implementingthe legal framework governingthe civil service.

111. PubZic Expenditure Management Process. The Government has made the MTEF
framework the centerpiece o f its budget formulation process to prioritize expenditures more
efficiently and to strengthen the linkages between policy objectives and budget planning. The
Government realizes that achieving sustained economic growth and poverty reduction requires a
larger allocation to health and education, as well as to operations and maintenance expenditures.
Higher levels o f capital expenditures are also needed to improve the country's infrastructure in
order to support a rise in private investment. These priorities have been deliberated in the
context o f the ongoing (2003-05) MTEF and will be further emphasized in the subsequent
MTEFs .The Government has closely linked the preparation o f the NSSED with the preparation
o f the MTEF. As part o f the MTEF process, the key line ministries -agriculture, education,
health, labour and social affairs, public order, public works, and transport -have               started
incorporating growth and poverty reduction objectives in the preparation o f their sector
expendituresstrategies, which feed directly into the budget preparation process.

 112.    To improve further the budget management process and to increase the effectiveness o f
the NSSED programs, the Ministry o f Finance, as part o f the PRSC-2, has communicated a
report to IDA evaluating the 2002 budgetperformance, and evaluating 2003 budget consistency
withNSSED andthe 2003-05 MTEF.Inaddition, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has established
 in all ministries database on public investment projects, both domestically and externally
 financed. It has also finalized and implemented procedures for recording disbursement and
 expenditures on all foreign financed projects, including those financed by grants. MoF has also
 issued guidelines to line miniatures for reporting o f budgetary commitments. Further measuresto
 improve the public expenditure management process will be followed inPRSC-3. Key measures
 include finalization o f operations and procedures manual for budget management and for
 selection, appraisal, and approval o f public investment projects. Given the scarce foreign
 financial resources for financing capital investments, it is essential that a transparent criteria i s
 established for selection o f capital projects specifying technical, economic, financial,
 environment, and social criteria. The DFIDwill continue to provide assistance inthese areas.

 113.    Public Sector AccountubiZity. Creating an accountable public sector to improve its
 performance i s a major challenge for the Government. The Government's program includes
 several measures to strengthen financial control and accountability mechanisms. The objectives
 are to increase transparency, to control waste, and to combat corruption. The program envisages
 policy actions inthree key dimensions: (i)   increasingthe accountability o f HighPublic Officials;
 (ii)strengthening internal controls and audit mechanisms and capacities; and (iii)        establishing
 transparent procurement practices.

                                                   55

114.    Increasinz the accountability of High Public Officials. The Government is determined to
increase the accountability o f high public officials. In view o f the recent BEEPS I1trends the
Government intends to take urgent and bold actions to reverse these trends, which could put at
risk Albania's future growth and development, as well as its prospects for closer alignment with
European structures. With the perceived rise in the state form o f corruption, the Government
recognizes that changes inits anti-corruption program are critical. Transparency through public
scrutiny has provento be one o fthe most powerful forms o f monitoringpublic officials. Inorder
to undertake suchcloser public scrutiny, the Government has enacted a revisedAsset Declaration
Law, that envisages declaration o f assets by high public officials, politicians and judges.
Furthermore, declarations will be monitored and verified by a newly established independent
inspection unit, and will be made available publicly. As a prelude to the implementation o f this
law the Government has decided to disclose publicly financial assets o f Cabinet members, on the
website o f the Council o f Ministers, ahead o f the deadline set by the law. These actions will be
followed by others inPRSC-3, including preparation o f a separate law on conflict o f interest as
well as an external audit o f all 2003 Government transactions on real estate and the sale or long
term lease o f land.

115.    Public Financial Accountability. The Government has set up a highlevel working group
Chaired by the Minister o f Finance and comprising senior officials to monitor the progress on
implementationo fthe CFAA. The reformprogram includes:

        Internal Audit and Internal Controls. Under PRSC-2, a law on Internal Audit has been
        enacted. The Ministry o f Finance has started implementing the law by adopting internal
        audit standards, establishing directorate o f internal audit in line ministries, establishing
        criteria for selection o f internal audit staff, and establishing national internal audit
        committee. These procedures and institutions would become fully functional under
        PRSC-3. To strengthen internal control framework, under PRSC-2, the Government will
        also compile an inventory o f all internal controls, identify gaps in internal controls, and
        prepare recommendations for addressing these gaps. The Government will then issue
        (under PRSC-3) decree or regulations and/or take other appropriate measures in areas
        where internal control gaps are identified.

        Consolidated Financial Statements. The Accounting Department, which is responsible
        for compiling the consolidated financial statements, needs technical assistance in this
        area. To this end, the government is discussing with donors to seek technical assistance.
        Under PRSC-2, the Government, with technical assistance from donors, will prepare
        consolidated financial statements for the year 2002. Extensive training will be provided
        to the budget institutions accounting staff in the preparation and interpretation o f
        financial statements.

        Cash Management and Treasury Controls. The Treasury Department, under the Bank-
        financed Public Administration Reform project, is establishing a modern information
        systems inthe treasury area that will facilitate efficient cash management. Inaddition, it
        will establish procedure for daily reconciliation o f treasury data and reimbursement data
        provided by the Centralbankto avoid float inthe system.



                                                  56

       High State Control. Considering low skills-base and exposure to modern audit
       techniques, the Government would facilitate under PRSC-3 for the High State Control
        (HSC) to enter into twinning arrangements with another well-established SA1 so that
       HSC staff could learn latest techniques in risk-based auditing and recent advances in
        government auditing. HSC is discussing with the EU for obtaining funding to finance
        such twining arrangements.

116.    Public Procurement. Under the PRSC-1,following the recommendations o fthe Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), the staffing o f the Public Procurement Agency (PPA),
has been brought up to full strength. The PPA now issues a bi-weekly Public Procurement
Bulletin, which publishes quantitative indicators o f the actual performance of public
procurement, covering both central and local government levels. The indicators report on
expenditures on procurement by different levels o f government and break down those
expenditures by procurement method (Open Tendering, Restricted Tendering, Request for
Quotations, Direct Contracting) for each procuring entities. This development represents a
significant increase intransparency, as it opens the competitiveness o f procurement transactions
conducted by public institutions to public scrutiny.

117.     Under PRSC-2, the Government has enacted an amendment to the Law on Public
Procurement, which remedied the key weaknesses o f the law and added improvements in
transparency, particularly by introducing a requirement that bids for public contracts should be
evaluated onthe basis o f objective, quantifiable criteria which must be disclosed to the bidders in
advance o f submission o f their bids. The susceptibility o f the Public Procurement Agency to
political interference has also been reduced by amending the procurement law to bring its
management and staff within the scope o f application o f the Civil Service Law, those affording
them the protection offered by that law.

118.     Under PRSC-3, it i s plannedthat the legislative framework for public procurement will
be substantially completed by the promulgation o f a comprehensive set o f implementing
regulations, which will underpin and clarify the application o f the procurement law, and a set o f
standardbiddingdocuments and standard forms o f contract for the procurement o f goods, civil
works and services, as well as a User's Manual to offer public officials guidance on their
application. Finally, in order to build the capacity o f public institutions to conduct procurement
in an accurate and cost-effective manner and in accordance with the updated legislative
framework, the Government will provide a graduated series o f procurement training courses for
staff o f the Public Procurement Agency, key procuring entities and the Supreme Audit
Institution. Inorder to build a sustainable source of procurement training, a training o f trainers
course will also be delivered. These new legislative instruments and training services are being
developed with assistance from international procurement consultants financed under the Public
Administration Reform Loan.

 119.    Fiscal Decentralization. The Government program also requires defining and assigning
 specific responsibilities to local levels to enhance local fiscal autonomy, expenditure efficiency,
 and accountability.     To help achieve these objectives, the Government has approved a
 decentralization strategy and has taken major steps insetting up the basic legal framework for its
 implementation. Consistent with the European Chart o f Local Self Governments, the 1998
 Constitution o f Albania defines that local government is founded upon the principle of


                                                  57

decentralization, and establishes that the relationship between the State, regions and local
governments is based on the principles o f autonomy, legality and cooperation. The law on the
organization and functioning o f the local governments (July 2001) establishes that the
relationship between levels o f Government will be based on the principle o f subsidiarity, which
assigns public functions to the lowest level o f government, whenever possible. This organic law
also sets forth the principles o f local government functions, powers, rights and duties, while a
basic strategy and an institutional arrangement for decentralization implementation has been
established by the Government at the outset.28 Important legislationon the role o f Prefect vis-a-
vis local governments and on immovable State property and on transfer o f part of these assets to
local government has been approved, and the Agency for Inventory and Transfer o f Public
Properties has started implementation o f its action plan. Moreover, recent legislation has been
passed (December 2002) on the establishment o f the Local Business Tax, on the System of the
Local Charges2' and on the introduction o f the Simplified Profit Tax as sources o f revenues for
the local government budgets.

120.     While a basic legal framework i s already in place, complementary regulations for an
effective and sustainable decentralization program are still lacking. The Government's program
under PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 thus envisages designing and implementing a sequenced set of
policies that can complete the basic regulatory framework by: (a) assigning specific competences
and expenditure responsibilities that would take into account the peculiarities of each sector
(education, health, social security, public works) and the geographic areas inthe country; and(b)
assigning additional revenue sources including shared taxes and transfers, which preserves tax
effort incentives while taking into consideration equity concerns.

121.      The Government realizes that an effective fiscal decentralization should take into
account a proper balance between the indispensable central government oversight power and
capacity and the fundamental fiscal autonomy at local levels. The reform program under PRSC-2
thus aims at: (i)    completing the basic legislative framework on the territorial administration; (ii)
proceeding with the action plan to complete implementation o f transfers o f State properties to
local governments; (iii)assigning specific expenditure responsibilities among levels o f
government; (iv) identifying, evaluating and consolidating the prevailing rules for the concession
o f specific grants, including capital grants, by the line ministries to the local governments; (v)
identifying and assigning autonomous revenue to local governments; and (vi) training local
public officials on a uniform system o f accounting, forecasting, reporting, and management. The
Government is aware that in the present circumstances, successful implementation o f fiscal
decentralization that protects the poor will need considerable capacity building efforts.30Actions
o f the Government inthis regard include the adoption of a new Law on Prefects, a new Law on
Local Taxes, Charges, and Fees (including Land Tax) a Small Businesses Tax as a local tax; and
an amendment to the Income Tax Law, introducing the Simplified Profit Tax as a source o f
revenue for the local budgets. As part o f the PRSC-2, a progress report has beensubmitted to the
National Committee for Decentralization on the transfer o f public properties to local

28 "The Strategy o fDecentralization andLocal Autonomy" (November 1999),preparedby the Technical Group of
 Experts on Decentralization(GED), proposed by the National Committee on Decentralization(NCD), and approved
b the Council ofMinistries on September 9,2000
 "   This Law regulates several localtaxes, fees and charges, such as on small business, on buildings and agriculture
 land, on hotel services, on new construction, on transfer o f property rights, on vehicles, on the use o f public spaces,
 on plates and announcements, andtemporary charges.


                                                           58

governments including the accomplishments o f the Agency for Inventory and Transfer o f Public
Properties, and a strategy to complete the devolution process (including the water supply and the
wastewater companies). The Government has also provided funding in the 2003 budget.for
training local government officials and staff involved in implementing the decentralization
strategy.

122.    These actions will be followed by other actions in the PRSC-3 focusing on assigning
specific functions and responsibilities (including the shared functions) and revenue sources
(included shared taxes) to local governments; and complete identification o f capacity needs and
implement training programs for local and central government staffs involved in the
implementationo f decentralization strategy.

Expected Outcome

123.    By the end of the three-year GPRS/PRSC period, Albania is expected to have achieved
the following:


        0   A more contestable policy formulation process as demonstrated by a risingincidence
            o f policy proposals reaching the Council o f Ministers that have satisfactory budget
            impact analyses.


        0   A more stable cadre of civil servants as measured by a reduction in spikes in the
            incidence o f contract employees in civil service positions relative to civil service
            positions and in civil service turnover rates during quarters following changes in
            political leadership,


        0   Increased transparency and accountability in the management o f public resources as
            reflected inimproved quality and coverage o f audits, enforcement o f improved public
            procurement practices, and enhanced transparent reporting and recording o f financial
            statements.

            A budget formulation and implementation process, basedon amediumterm financing
            planand sector programs, which will make the budget an efficient policy tool for the
            Government


        0   A decentralized fiscal system with a well-defined fiscal structure which allows local
            governments to plan and implement their responsibilities in a more effective,
            efficient, and accountable manner.


Actions under the PRSC-2

8449, dated 27 January 1999), Law on the Police (Law No. 8553, dated 25 November 1999), and Prime Minister
Decre No. 469 (14 August 1995).

35 The business plan would establish TIPA's primary role as a facilitator of training, rather than as a training
provider. It would provide TIPA with a structure that is responsive to the training needs of both the central
administration and local governments. The arm of TIPA dedicated to facilitating training for local govemment
personnel might be overseen by a Board which included the Association of Municipal Mayors. The business plan
would also be designed to ensure that donor-financedtraining is provided in a way that creates sustainable capacity
within Albania's public administration to provide similar training after any given donor-financed training event is
completed. This might involve both a training-of-trainers element, as well as building a library oftraining materials,
which would include materials developedas part of any such donor-financedtraining activities. The businessplan
would also include a strategy for developing a full range of curriculumover a 3-5 year time horizon, addressing, at
a minimum, training in all common functions of the public administration (e.g., human resource management
including civil service legal framework and procedures, financial management, MTEF procedures, budget
execution, procurement, accounting, intemal auditing, etc.), as well as meeting specific training needs within the
centraladministrationor among local governments.
36 The review would addressboth the levels of Civil Service salaries by position classification as well as options for
ensuringcompetitiveness of specialistsalaries within key positions. Any revisions to the salary structurethat would
allow higher salaries for such "key specialist positions" would need to carefully define the criteria and procedures
for classifying aposition as a "key specialistposition", inorder to preventunwarranteduse of sucha mechanismfor
providing higher salaries to certainpositions.

                        A.       Relationsto the CountryAssistance Strategy

125.   The proposed credit focuses on cross-cutting issues inpublic sector, policy development
and monitoring, public expenditure management, financial accountability, and improving service
delivery in social sectors. The proposed PRSC is fully consistent with the Bank Group's
assistance strategy for Albania, as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the
World Bank Group for Albania and approvedby the Board inJune 2002.

126.   The Bank Group strategy presented in the CAS i s geared toward strengthening
govemance, institutional reform andhumandevelopment so that the Governmentcancontinue to


37Progress in meeting social sector conditions on decentralization will be covered under Objective 3, and closely
monitored under the overall decentralization strategy.

implement its agenda of restoring sustained growth and alleviating poverty. More specifically,
the strategy aims to promote sustainable private sector growth and the alleviation of poverty in
order to ensure the social sustainability of the reform process. Policies supported under the
PRSC to improve the capacity of the public sector to carry out its functions more efficiently
(particularly in the social sectors) and reduce corruption are essential to the implementation of
the poverty reduction programs. Measuressupportedby the PRSC are also key to improving the
environment for private sector growth andto maintaining macroeconomic stability.

127.    The measures supported by the PRSC complement other IDA assistance programs to
Albania. Inparticular, it supports componentsdevotedto the social sectors (especially education
andhealth), as well as on support to basic infrastructure (transport, water supply, and sanitation).
A Public Expenditure Support Credit of US$30 million equivalent was approved inMay 1999.
Other credits approved in 1999 included an IrrigationI1Project, a Structural Adjustment Credit,
a Micro-credit Project, a Community Works Project, and an Emergency Road Repair Project.
These were followed by new operations in2000 supporting education reform, legal and judicial
reform, public administration reform, financial sector development, and rehabilitation of the
water supply.       A Social Services Delivery Project (SSDP) supporting the provision of
community basedsocial care for those most inneed was approvedby the Board inMay 2001.

 128.   The CAS base-case lending scenario (the status quo) provides for up to US$131 million
in lending, consisting of about four projects per year to support the NSSED, leverage the
remaining reform agenda, and move Albania toward financial sustainability necessary for
creditworthiness. The remaining PRSCs would anchor the Bank's lending program, maintain
NSSEDmomentum, and support key reforms, especially thematic and cross-cutting reforms best
addressed through a single adjustment operation. The PRSCs will not displace investment
 lending, which has proven effective inbuilding capacity and pioneering innovative community-
based approaches. A low-case scenario, not to exceed US$70 million, would be triggered by
poor macroeconomic performance, failure to implement the GPRS, or a sustained decline in
portfolio performance. Albania would be eligible for a higher IDA allocation (up to 30 percent
 more than the base case) in the second half of the CAS period in the event of an outstanding
 track record in meeting NSSED targets and measurable improvements in areas such as
 governance, rule of law, and access to social services, which would be detailed in a CAS
 Progress Report.     Analytical and advisory activities (AAA) will strengthen the NSSED,
 analytically underpin IDA operations, and provide important policy advice. Fiduciary AAA is
 up to date. The Bank will systematically address fiduciary issues, incorporating them into the
 PRSCsand other operations.

 129.    Albania's sixth Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) inMay 2001, notedthat
 the overall portfolio has stabilized andis ingood shape, and recommends a number ofmeasures
 to strengthen project implementation in Albania. At the level of project lending the Bank
 financial management staff will ensure that the relevant agencies discharge their fiduciary
 responsibility in a satisfactory manner and that the financial management system in place for
 each project i s in accordance with standard international practices. It should be noted that the
 Government is beginning implementation of an FYO1 Financial Sector Institution Building
 Technical Assistance Project (20397) which supports strengthening of the country's financial
 infrastructure includingimplementation of aninter-bankpayments system; provision of technical
 assistance to develop national accounting standards, revision of the chart of accounts for the
 enterprise, banking, insurance sectors, and budgetary institutions to comply with the new law;

                                                66

carrying out o f an operational and financial audit of the loan collection agency; and
establishment of a credit information bureau. The Bank completed the analytical work on a
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review in Albania in April 2001. This analysis includes
recommendations to improve public expenditure management and budgeting planning and to
increase transparency and accountability in the fiscal process. The analysis also includes
macroeconomic and fiscal developments during the second half of the last decade and makes
recommendationsto further improve fiscal discipline.

                                B.      Coordination with the IMF

130.      The PRSC is being prepared inparallel with the IMF's three-year Poverty Reductionand
Growth Facility (PRGF) program, approved by the IMF Board inJune 2002. The objective is to
ensure the consistency of the macroeconomic and structural policy package supported by both
programs and to ensure the coordination o f the contents of PRSC and PRGF.               The two
institutions have collaborate closely both at headquarters and inthe field. A Statement o f Fund
Relations is attached.


                              C.     Coordination with Other Donors

131.      The work on PRSC is also being coordinated with the activities o f the other donors in
Albania, to minimize the overlap inour programs, to reduce the likelihood o f critical gaps, andto
identify areas o f comparative advantage in providing support to the Government. The PRSC
team has been meeting regularly with key donor counterparts to exchange information on our
respective programs, to identify areas where the PRSC might be more selective, and to finds
ways to support the Government in implementation o f its poverty reduction strategy.          This
coordination has included work with UK-DFID on the policy monitoring and evaluation
program, as well asjoint efforts with the UNDP onthe Millennium Development Goals.

 132.     Stabilization and Association Process. Inparallel with the NSSED, Albania is aiming to
enter into a Stabilization and Association Process (SAP) with the European Union.              Key
outstanding issues for SAP accession are macroeconomic stabilization, security, governance, and
law enforcement. Primary aspects o f the SAP policy dialogue include provisions to support
internal and external security, regional cooperation (Le., through enhanced trade with bordering
 states), reduced barriers to trade and external investment in Albania, strengthened financial
 infrastructure, and approximation o f Albanian legislation to EC legislation in a wide range o f
 areas.     European Community assistance to Albania has recently been concentrated on: (i)
 strengthening the state and the rule o f law (including customs, police andjudiciary), democracy,
 and human rights; (ii) infrastructure (roads, water and ports, airport); (iii)
                          large                                                     agriculture and
 local community development; (iv) education; and (v) humanitarian assistance. The next round
 o f assistance under the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and
 Stabilization (CARDS) program will focus on public administration reform and the rule o f law
 (`judiciary,  customs, police, and statistics), and investment in infrastructure and economic
 development.      The NSSED will be closely linked to the SAP goals o f closing Albania's
 development gap with other European countries, and will also focus on related policy
 development issues (Le., legislative convergence), monitoring capacity (to allow the Government
 to     disseminate     accurate  assessments      on   key    accession   indicators    such    as
 employmenthnemployment          levels),   and public     administration   reform    (to   support
 implementation and enforcement o f the agreed legislative framework).

                             D.       Implementation and Monitoring

133.     The Government has appointed the Minister o f Finance as National NSSED Coordinator
to manage the overall implementation o f the PRSC. The MOF has recently replaced its NSSED
Technical Secretariat with anNSSED Directorate, with a Director and staffjust appointed. The
primary implementing line agencies will be the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic
Cooperation and Trade, Ministry o f Education and Science, Ministry o f Agriculture and Food,
Ministry of Health, Ministry o f Local Government and Decentralization, Ministry of Labor and
Social Affairs, the Department o f Public Administration, andthe INSTAT.

134.      Overall monitoring o f the program will be through regular reviews, incollaboration with
the NSSED Technical Secretariat, and in the context o f the preparation and supervision o f the
subsequent PRSCs.        The NSSED will include a monitoring plan that will summarize the
principal indicators to be tracked during the program, the related data sources, and the
responsible parties. Simple input/output indicators will largely be tracked through administrative
information and program reviews.        Outcome and impact indicators will largely be tracked
through survey data, especially through the forthcoming LSMS and follow on panel surveys that
are an integral part o f the NSSED program. The overall monitoring plan will regularly update
the program indicators and targets, utilizing new data such as the recent LSMS and forthcoming
qualitative studies such as the health stakeholder analysis. Key Albanian counterparts have been
attending the International Program for Development Evaluation Training courses in Ottawa,
Canada (in FY02 through Multi-sector Team Learning Initiative support, and in FY03 through
other sources o f finds).

 135.     The proposed Credit is SDR 13.1 million (about US$18.0 million equivalent). The Credit
would be released in one tranche, expected by August 2003. The Credit would be on a 20 year
maturity including a 10 year grace period.

                                          F. Disbursement

 136.      In accordance with the Operational Directive on the Simplification of Disbursement
 Rules under Structural Adjustment and Sectoral Adjustment Loans (February 8, 1996),
 disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, and there will therefore be no
procurement requirements. Disbursements of the Credit will be subject to a standard negative
 list o f ineligible goods and countries o f origin. Disbursements will be made by payments to a
 deposit account o f the Ministry o f Finance inthe National Bank o f the Republic o f Albania.   If
 after deposit inthis account, the Credit proceeds are used for ineligible purposes, the Association
 will require the Borrower to either (a) return that amount to the account for use for eligible
 purposes; or (b) returnthat amount directly to IDA, inwhich case IDA will cancel an equivalent
 undisbursed amount of the credit. The Borrower will provide, on a quarterly basis, a statement
 o f the payments into and from the deposit account and the deposit account will be audited by an
 independent auditor acceptable to the IDA in accordance with terms o f reference acceptable to
 the IDA.The CY2002 audits o fthe most recent IDA adjustment credits to Albania, PRSC-1 and
 the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, are to be received by June 30, 2003. The expected
 closing date o fthe proposed PRSC-2 is December 30,2004.

                                G.       EnvironmentalAssessment

G.      Environmental Aspects

137.    The proposed operation has been rated a structural adjustment credit governed under
Operational Directive 8.60,    and does not require an environmental assessment rating. The
project team has endeavored to identify any areas that may require particular attention with
respect to environmental issues.

138.    InAlbania there is an increasing appreciation of the country's environmental problems.
TheNSSEDmentions the following as beingofparticular concern:

            Access to adequate quality pipedwater and sewerage connections, especially inrural
            areas.
            Insufficient availability o fkey natural resources among rural poor, including land,
            water, pasture and fisheries.
            Affordable commercial energy for the poor.
            Inadequate infrastructure for illegal dwellings with consequent environmental
            degradation andhealthhazards.
            Presenceo f environmental `hot spots', where individuals face serious healthrisks
            from landand water contamination.

139.    These emerged from an active dialogue between the Government and NGOs, partly
facilitated by the Bank and DFID. Indeed, the discussion o f environmental issues inthe NSSED
is more comprehensive than one finds inthe same document in most other countries. Recently
the role o f the environment has received a boost by the upgrading o f the former National
Environmental Agency to a Ministry o f Environment, with an enhanced role in national policy
makingand anincrease inits budget.

140.     At this point, the new Ministry remains a relatively weak organization that lacks the
capacity to enforce environmental laws and formulate policy effectively.           Furthermore, its
mandate vis-&vis other ministries with environmental responsibilities i s not entirely clear and
indeed its internal organizational structure has yet to be established. Some support in setting up
these institutional arrangements will be required. Fortunately, there are a number o f donors
willing to provide that support.      The Ministry will receive some external support from the
British, Italian, Swedish, Dutch and Canadian governments. The Bank is also considering a
project that will, inter alia, provide assistance in areas where other donors are not active:
increasing environmental awareness, the use o f economic instruments for environmental
protection, strategic environmental assessments, improved monitoring and compliance, and
improvements inthe system o f setting o f standards and issuance o f environmental licenses. This
will bedecided inthe context o fpreparingthe upcoming CAS.

 141.    Inaddition to the above and to ongoing projects inthe forestry, fishery and water and
biodiversity sectors the Bank will develop programs inthe following areas:

            The Government is addressing the problemo fthe handling and disposal ofmedical
            waste by introducing anEnvironmental Management Plan and Medical Waste

                                                  72

           Management Planinto the Master planand Designo fTirana UniversityHospital,
           which will subsequently be adapted as a facility standard for all future healthfacilities
           investment. This initiative is being supported under the IDA Health System
           Recovery and DevelopmentProject (Cr. 30670).

           A plannedPower Rehabilitation andRestructuring project will makeanassessmentof
           the environmentalimpact o f the investment to be undertaken by the project.

142.   The new Bank project referred to above will also provide direct support for remediation
for one of the five most urgent environmental hotspots and for mobilizing other donors to assist
withthe remainingsites.

                                    H.      Poverty Category

143.   This program is designed to have a beneficial impact on medium term poverty trends in
Albania by:

           Strengthening the prospects for private sector development, employment creation,
           and growth;

           Strengthening the Government's capacity to monitor and evaluate poverty trends in
           Albania, and to formulate effective policy responses;

           Enhancingaccess to and quality o fkey social services currently incrisis, especially
           education andhealth;

           Improvingthe sustainability and adequacy o f social insurance programs;

            Improving the targeting efficiency and impact o f social assistance and social care
            services; and

            Increasing accountability o fhighpublic officials and contestability o f policy
            decisions.

                                             I. Gender

 144.  As noted above, gender issues have been considered duringPRSC preparation giventheir
importance to growth and poverty reduction. They will also be reviewed duringthe forthcoming
poverty assessment (FY03). It is expected that this operation will address a range o f gender
issuesthrough activities such as:

        a   Ensuringthat educationandhealthpolicy provides equal access across genders.
            Improving the provision o f reproductive andfamily health services under the health
            care reform
        a   Reviewing the equity o f the pension system, including the gender dimension

J.       Analytical UnderpinningsIncluding Poverty and SocialImpactAnalyses

145.      An energy sector Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) was completed in2003, and
i s informing the current dialogue on options for tariff increasesthat will mitigate the impact on
the poorest. Other key PSIAwork is underway (see Table 6). An FY04transport sector PSIA is
also being conducted to examine ways to, inter alia, reduce transport costs and raise the
reliability of vehicular access (reduce the risk of impassability) and thereby to expand markets
for agricultural and non-farm products, while integrating poorly accessible zones with regional
economic centers. As noted above, the NSSED andPRSC programs will develop much needed
local capacity in undertaking analyses of program related policy impacts on social groups
through support of a 2002 LSMS and poverty assessment, a five year household survey strategy,
including follow-on panel surveys and a second LSMS, development of poverty monitoring
capacity (drawing inpart on the data to be available from the LSMS), development of local data
user groups, establishment of a poverty monitoringunit, and strengthenedcapacity of policy and
planning units inthe line ministries (see Table 7). A comprehensive dialogue on the link of the
programto the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDG's) has been initiated.

 146.     The primarybenefits o fthe proposed operation are:

              More efficient and effective policy formulation, monitoring andevaluation insectors
              that have a major fiscal and social impact (Le., education, rural, health, social
              protection), and that account for a large percentage o f GDP and budgetary
               expenditure;

               Through the supported public administrationreforms, redeployment andreorientation
               of line ministry staff to better deliver services and implement policy;

               Improvedtargeting of benefits through better policy monitoring;

               Improvedpublic expenditure management and accountability as well as strategic
               allocation ofresources through MTEFmechanism;

               Through implementationo f the MTEF sector strategies, improved quality and access
               o f key social services (especially education and health);

               Meaningful involvement of civil society andthe private sector inthe formulation o f
               policy priorities; and

               Support for anti-corruption efforts through: (i)    the transparency o fNSSED
               preparation and active civil society involvement inprogram development and
               monitoring; (ii)  reforms inservice delivery that give greater voice to communities in
               decision-making (ie., education, social services); and(iii) administration
                                                                               public
               reform, especially through development o f a professional civil service, increased

          transparency and accountability, and improveddecision makingat different levels o f
          government.

147.   The primary risks o fthe proposed operation are:


       0  The multi-sectoral nature o fthis operation presents implementation risks, as it will
          require close cooperation betweenthe line ministries. Care i s beingtaken to ensure
          the maximumpossible ownership o fthe NSSED/PRSC agenda, and to ensure that the
           Government is on boardwith the agreed Program andthe policy agenda.


       0   The line ministries are heavily burdened and have a tradition o fhighturnover and
           weak capacity, which could further complicate implementation. The Program will
           aim to be realistic, andstrengthen capacity through targeted institutionalreforms.


       0   Policymakers may not utilize the enhanced policy development capacity -traditional
           political considerations could outweigh sophisticated policy analyses. This riski s not
           uniqueto Albania, and canbemitigatedthrough effective communication strategies
           (i.e., by appending convincing andclear analyses to legislative proposals sent to
           Parliament) andthrough continued IDA participation inthe broader policy dialogue.


       0   Failure to maintain macroeconomic stability could result inhigh inflation and interest
           rates. Reductioninthe interest o f foreign investors inthe few remaining privatization
           projects (such as Savings Bank andAlbtelecom) could leadto lower budgetary
           resources andlarger budgetdeficits inthe short term. Also, political economy
           constraints could delay the reformprocess o fthe pensionsystem, public
           administration, and fiscal decentralization. These could be mitigatedthrough further
           fiscal adjustment, and through public information efforts coordinated by the
           concerned line ministries.


        0  The regionremains unstable, with low level conflicts continuing inMacedonia. There
           has been a clear shift towards increasing regional stability, butthe potential for
           renewedconflict should not be entirely ruled out.


        0  The Programwill require sufficient donor support and alignmentwiththe agreed
           strategy. The Government and the IDA team have worked hardto ensure close donor
           coordination through the development o fNSSED donor's group meeting.

148.    To reduce these risks, the IDA would deepen the ongoing dialogue with the Government
on structural reforms necessary to increase growth and reduce poverty. Subsequent IDA
operations would sustain and deepenthe reforms initiated under this operation. Inaddition, IDA
would continue to work closely with the other donors andthe NGOs to assist the Government in
mobilizing the technical assistance needs to adopt and implement the policy measures supported
by this Credit. The technical assistance being provided under the Judicial and Public
Administration Projects would also help the Government in implementing the needed
institutional reform measures. The inter-ministerial and technical working group that have been
established for updating the NSSED and enhancing private sector activities will assist improving
coordination among the implementing agencies.

                         LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY


1. Goal. The goal o f the proposed PRSC is the formulation and implementation of
policies and structural reforms inline with the National Strategy for Social and Economic
Development (NSSED). The PRSC contains four main components:

             Promotion o f sustainable growth and support for the private sector
             development;

             Strengthening o fmonitoring and evaluationcapacities o fpolicy agendas;


        0    Improvement o f service delivery and efficiency of the social safety net;


        0    Improving the main functions o f the public sector and institutional
             arrangements.

2. Giventhat the scope o f action o fthe NSSED i s broad, the PRSC identifies only some
areas o f this strategy, which are spelled out inthe components o f this credit. The team for
the PRSC preparation identified the main areas under the NSSED: (i) are priority
                                                                          which
areas with regard to economic development and poverty reduction; and (ii)          which are
currently being supported by creditshnterventions o f IDA or other donors.


Objective 1: Promotion of sustainable growth and support for the private sector
development

Issues

3. Albania has been successful in maintaining the overall macro-economic stability in
the recent years, thus making efforts and ensuring progress with regard to fiscal
consolidation. Structural reform i s aimed at fostering and ensuring sufficient budgetary
revenues, and have an impact on the further fiscal consolidation. Albania needs to expand
its budgetary revenues from year to year in order to increase the financing resources for a
series o f priority sectors. Thus, the budgetary deficit will be continually reduced and at
the same time the dependency o f our budget from grants and conseccional or non-
consesional     loans will be reduced too. Economic growth and improvement o f tax
administrationwill be a guarantee for our objectives.

4. The energy sector has made serious endeavors to come out of the crises, and the
emergency situation has been overcome. In general, the energy problems have had a
negative impact on the general production, and in particular in the industrial generation
and the overall investments climate. The situation inthe energy sector is mainly related
to:




                                                1

                                                                                                  Annex 1
                                                                                              Page 2 o f 28

        0    very high demand for power consumption and failure to fully pay the
             electricity bills;


        0    generation o f electricity based mainly on hydro resources; and



        0    high import costs and relatively low tariffs for the sale of electricity, which
             has substantially increased the demand for subsidies.

5. Despite the small size o f agricultural farms and the problematic infrastructure,
agriculture continues to contribute substantially in the economic growth o f the country,
thus coming out as an important sector- which is responsible for approximately 34% o f
the GDP3'. For some additional years, it i s estimated that the agriculture sector will
continue to be one o f the main sources for employment and generation o f income. The
small agro-processing industries and the rural non-agricultural activities are expected to
become ever more important inthe increase o f revenues, while improved access to social
services and financial institutions remains an important element for economic growth and
poverty reduction.

6. The comments o f international organizations on the Law "On Immovable Properties
Restitution and Compensation" are being taken into consideration during the revision o f
the draft-law in the Parliament, while this process is also being coordinated with the
OSCE. The Government on its side i s committed to approve a law ensuring broad
political consensus, which would address the property problems and the rights o f the ex-
owners.

7. Despite the challenges and the problems, the private sector has witnessed remarkable
progress. Meantime, the government of Albania is committed to create a favorable
business climate for the private sector, aiming at the formalization o f the economy.

 8. Albania has made progress with regard to collection o f tax revenues, as well as inthe
formulation o f advanced tax legislation. The taxpayers in case o f disputing the decisions
made by the tax authorities can address the Appeals Committee, which passesjudgment
on the claims/complaints o f the subjects. The committee comprises representatives from
the business community as well.

 9. In addition to addressing the property issues, in line with the Constitution, there i s
 need for fine-tuning the system for the registration o f immovable properties, increase the
 safety/security o f the (land) titles, take measures for the settlement o f disputes with
 regard to property, as well as for the illegal constructions. Albania has made progress
 with regard to rural sector development through the land reform programme,
 rehabilitation o f rural infrastructure and liberalization o f the prices and business. But,

 38The contribution ofthe agriculture sector to the GDP inthe past has been assessedat 50% ofthe GDP.
 However, as a result o f an increase inthe percentage ofthe other sectors (Le. construction), and
 introduction of a more accurate method for the calculation o fthe GDP, the percentageo f agriculture to the
 GDP has fallen to approximately 34%.

                                                                                 Page 3 o f 28

there is need for efforts to continue for the finalization o f the land reform, identification
o f the needs o f small farmers andnatural resources management.

10. The Government is of the opinion that the improvements in governance, financial
sector and infrastructure are needed to generate a better climate for private investments,
which would lead to privatization o f the Savings Bank, INSIG, Telecommunication etc.
The Bank o f Albania aims to strengthen the regulation and supervision o f the Credit
Savings Associations inorder to finance rural areas, as well as to increase the distribution
o f the latter.


Reformagenda

11. InJune 2002, the Government and the IMFagreedto a three year Poverty Reduction
Growth Facility (PRGF), aiming at maintaining macro-economic stability as a pre-
requisite for a sustainable growth and social development. The main macro-economic
objectives include: keeping annual inflation within the 2-4 per cent range, maintaining
economic growth at approximately 6% per year, and maintaining Foreign Exchange
reserve at about 4.5 months o f imports. These objectives will be met through reduction o f
fiscal deficit, ando f the balance o f payments andthrough the continuation o f the cautious
monetary policies. As part o f the consolidation o f the fiscal system, the Government i s
committed to formulate a complex agenda for the pensions reform. The objectives of this
agenda are related to the establishment o f a comprehensive system of the pensions reform
that would address all o f the long-term issues o f inclusion, equity and sufficiency (see
Objective 3).

12. In the area o f infrastructure, the programme o f the Government is aimed at
alleviation o f power cuts and reduction o f losses, while stopping illegal connections o f
electricity, as well as rehabilitation of the distribution network and continuation o f
increasing the level o f collections. The IDA Power Rehabilitation and Restructuring
Project approved in June 2002 will support the reform agenda o f the Government inthe
energy sector. The power sector study also makes an evaluation o f the tariff structure,
while taking into account and evaluatingthe impact o f the energy price for the vulnerable
groups o f populations.

13. The program o f the Government inthe area o f rural development shall focus in two
areas:

         (a) sustainable management o f natural resources, including land, forests, pastures
         and water; and (b) poverty reduction inthe rural areas and generate revenues and
         employment.

         More specifically, efforts inthe area o f rural development shall concentrate on (i)
         improving the functioning of the labor market and consolidation o f
         property/ownership     rights;   (ii)strengthening         community-based      rural
         infrastructures, including irrigation, water supply to the rural areas and rural

                                                                                Page 4 o f 28

       roads; (iii) orientation o f supportive rural services towards the needs o f the rural
        community and increase the focus o f non-agricultural services such as: business
        counseling and legal support etc; (iv) delivery o f agricultural services to a large
        number o f small farmers, support to poor farmers through improving extension
        services, as well as providing veterinary services and control for the protection of
        plants; (v) extension o f rural finance services and fostering expansion of the
        banking network to the rural areas as well; (vi) improving consumer protection
        and mechanisms of food control for food products; (viii) support to institutions
        and associations that operate in the rural areashpace such as: Water Users
        Association and Credit Savings Associations as important structures for the
        development o f rural areas; (viii) planning and definition o f activities o f natural
        resources management in the rural development, as well as addressing the
        continuous problem o f illegal logging.

14. The Government aims to finalize the first land registration during the two coming
years. 90 per cent o f the agricultural land registration i s complete, while the rest will be
concentrated in the peri-urban and urban areas. Also, the Government aims to formulate
the Regional Development Plans inorder to define the priority aims for the development
o f the regions. Initially, these centers will focus on some pilot zones and will be
expanded later on, by focusing investments and budgetary funds in the disadvantaged
areas, and to the areas which have a potential for growth.

15. The Government aims to intensify activities related to research in agriculture and
extension services to better respond to the needs o f the farmers and improve the transfer
o f applied technologies to the small farms. It also aims to improve natural resources
management.

16. Inorder to totally stop illegal constructions, the Government aims to: (a) review the
status o f such activities and update informationrelated to them; (b) draft a plano f actions
to enforce urban planninglegislation; and (c) stop illegal constructions. The Government
has approved the relevant decision to stop illegal logging and improve natural resources
and has set up a task force to see to its implementation. Also, the formulation of the law
on the transfer o fthe forestry use rights to the communes i s underway.

17. Inorder to encourage andfoster private sector development based on a FIAS "Study
on administrative barriers", the Government will draft an agenda for the implementation
o f reforms with a monitoring system that will make the necessary evaluation o f the
impact on the private business community.

18. The Government will take concrete actions with regard to tax and customs
administration through speeding up the VAT reimbursement, and enforcement o f new
procedures approved by the Minister o f Finance for the revision o f procedures to freeze
bank accounts etc. Meantime, the newly published manual on the tax procedures for the
registration, collection, implementationand auditing will begin to be enforced.

Export Promotion Agency can be merged withinthis structure.

22. The Government aims to increase tax revenues through economic growth and
through tax administration in order to reduce fiscal evasion, and fight smuggling and
corruption. Concomitantly, the Government will be working to find appropriate
mechanisms to settle all disputes with the business community in line with generating
facilities and conditions for the development o ftheir businesses.

Objective 3: Improving Service Delivery and Efficiency of the Social Safety Net

Issues

36. Restructuring and reform o f the basic social services is a priority element for ensuring
poverty reduction.

37. Education: Since the start o f the transition, school attendance has fallen at all levels
o f education, except for university. At all levels o f education, children coming from poor
households, rural households and households living inthe peri-urban areas also account
for the lowest attendance rates. Expenditures for education are limited. The budgetary
policies thus far will be reviewed in order to increase financing allocation for the
education sector and the material values, develop human resources and the quality o f
education. The education sector requires more funds and a better management of the
latter.

38. Health: The Ministry o f Health has drafted the revised strategy, which encompasses
a 10 years period, and which takes into analyses the situation in the sector, including
detailed challenges relatedto financing, quality, efficiency and sustainability o f the health
system. Yet, still a lot remains to be done to translate these objectives into actions and
specific programs for implementation inthe short-term to medium-term. According to the
NSSED, the Government has identifiedthree strategic models to address these issues: (a)
improving the efficiency o f the system through better planning and allocation of funds;
(b) investment inpriority health services to improve access to health care services and
quality; (c) planningpublic funds for priority programs inpublic health.

                                                                                    Annex 1
                                                                               Page 11 of28

39. In line with the fiscal decentralization reform, there is need to clarify the
responsibilities of the Ministry o f Health, local government and Health Insurance
Institute with regard to public healthprograms andprimary healthcare services.

40. Pensions reform: A medium-term and long-term strategy on pensions needs to
address five important issues: ( i)ensuring financial sustainability o f the pension system
before the reform; (ii) pensions shall play an important role in poverty alleviation,
                         rural
and as a social safety net for the elderly inthe rural areas; (iii) percentage of persons
                                                                  the
who contribute in the social insurance scheme i s low, and the high percentage o f
contribution inthe social insurance scheme does not promote/foster willing participation
inthe pensions scheme for employees with highearningdincome for the short-term. This
is due to lack o f satisfactory regulatory capacity to supervise the accumulation o f assets
and payment of pensions from the institutions that administer these funds. For the same
reasons mentioned above, there i s no space to generate a second fund for the population
o f the rural areas; (v) the percentage o f pensioners covered by the pensions system will
drop substantially in the long-term (30-40 years), thus bringing up a longer-term issue
with regard to protection of future pensioners. This is because before 1993 the work was
inthe contribution, butnowmostofthe labor force doesnotpay social insurance.

41. Social Assistance: The social assistance policy is focused on "cash" assistance and
social services, improving targeting o f "ndihma ekonomike" for the poor households, that
compose approximately one fifth o f the households. The main policy requirements
include the following processes: (a) to define the criteria for the allocation o f social
assistance in line with the targets, and (b) to intervene in achieving the appropriate
targeting practices. The Ministry o f Labor and Social Affairs has also beganto review the
criteria for the allocation o f central funds to the local government. Other issues related to
social assistance are the employment policies for the households included in the social
assistance scheme, measuring the income o fthe households and defining the way how the
social assistance program shall better respond to migration. Rural pensions might play a
role like the "cash" social assistance for the pensioners in the rural areas, where the
Social Insurance Institute is runningthe programme mainly financed by the state budget.
With regard to social protection services, Albania has recently been involved in the
expansion o f community-based services supported by the just approved Social Services
Delivery Project (SSDP).

Reform agenda

42. The goal of the PRSC is to assist ministries in their preparation o f the MTEF/sector
strategies inthe critical sectors o f social services. The PRSC will support the Government
inthe implementation of 2-4 key priorities through identification of objectives that are
conditions for each round o fthe program.


43. Education: The strategy o fthe Government to address these issues i s the following:

Improving sector management through building of four capacities:
analyses, policy planningand monitoring;financialmanagement;human
resourcesmanagement;andtextbookmanagement.

           DOPA and the Prime Minister's office have approved a
      restructuring o f the Ministry o f Education, which includes a new
      structure inthe Ministry, personnel requests, job descriptions and costs;
      The Ministry is making personnel moves inorder to better match their
      skills with the tasks and to this end a preliminary program has been
      draftedfor the humanresources policies and a plan with further details.

           The Ministryo f Education i s inthe process o f selecting consultants
      that will do the performance auditing, which includes management,
      financing, education (including textbooks) and human resources o f the
      MinistryofEducation.

Improvingfinancing of the sector.Inthe context o f the MTEF, and inline
with the budget performance, expenditures allocation for education for 2002-
04 are expected to increase by approximately 20% inreal terms. Albania has
just been selected as one o fthe 18 participating countries inthe EducationFor
All (EFA FTI) initiative. The application of Albania for grant money under
the EF context will be carefully monitored to see facts o f fiscal commitment
to education, and inparticular to basic education.

Expanding opportunitiesfor education and increasingthe quality of gth

                      the vocational schools through formal agreements to share the
                       inventory.

44. Increase transparency o f decisions39.Two actions are beingtaken to this regard. The
first is the publication o f the First annual Report on the Education Performance, and the
second is the annual publication innewspapers of the list o f the schools rehabilitated the
previous year, with complimentary information.

45. Health: The Government has launched the NSSED process to consolidate the
identified priorities inthe previous strategy, and aims to use the PRSC in support o f the
following critical areas:

              improving the efficiency of the system for the allocation of resources- In
              the context o f the MTEF formulation, the Government i s committed to ensure
              an increase inthe health expenditures allocation to compensate for the current
              low level o f expenditures. Also, the Government shall introduce an improved
               system to track budgetary expenditures and open a National Health Account
               (NHA) to monitor andtrack the budget, and to ensure the efficient use of the
               funds inorder to attain the desired results.


          0    Reform of the health financing system. The functions o f the Health
               Insurance Institute will gradually expand to become the pillar o f a national
               health insurance system, that will ensure universal health coverage based on
               the principles o f equity, efficiency and quality o f services. As a first step with
               regardto the capacities buildingo f the Health Insurance Institute in2003, will
               be the establishment Management Information System in pilot areas and the
               branches o f the Institute to support the payments system o f the primaryhealth
               cares.

 46. The Government believes that new institutional, organizational andfinancial relations
 need to be defined between the TRHA and the SI1 in support o f the primary health care
 services and public health program with the current process o f decentralization, in
 particular for the definition o f the relevant roles and responsibilities o f the central power
 (MinistryofHealth), local government (prefecture andthe district administration) andthe
 Institute o f HealthInsurance.

 and the Ministry o f Education website capital investments o fthe govemment for the rehabilitation and
 construction o f new schools for a period o f five years (199x- 200x). These data indicate the school location,
 the invested amount, the invested amount as a share ofaverage investments for the schools andthe source
 of financing for each investment.

        0   Financing primary health care and public health. There is place for
            improvement in the public health and primary health care services, in
            particular with regard to transfer o f budgetary funds from the central to the
            local budget according to the unconditional grant mechanism, thus making
            difficult the distribution o f services to the right destination. The Government
            o f Albania with the support o f many donors including here the World Bank
            has invested to develop a national system o f public and primary health care.
            Consequently, the Government needs to ensure the transfer o f the financing to
            the local government accordingto the conditional grant mechanism.


        0   Rationalizationofthe healthservices deliverysystem.The Government has
            identified the need for new investment plans based on given standard o f
            services and priority benefits, foreseen moves and needs o f the population, as
            well as the expected expansion o f the basic infrastructure such as: roads,
            electrification andwater supply and sanitation services.

            Designed interventionsfor the public health:These activities will include
            strengthening o f critical programs in public health through: (a) increased
            budgetary allocations for priority programs; (b) improving the quality o f the
            program; and (c) improving the monitoring system to measure the impact o f
            policies and newprograms for results.

47. Pensions. The Government has launched the preparations and has began the
implementation o f a program on the pensions reform as part o f its programs for the
consolidation o f the fiscal funds and strengthening o f social protection. The Government
aims at developing a further legislative package that: (i)    defines the future bases for the
indexation o f the level of pensions; (ii)      specifies a deadline o f 10 years for future
reduction in the percentages o f the social insurance contributions; (iii)      determines the
measures that need to be taken to increase the contributions; and (iv) specifies the
reductions inbenefits for the early retirement.

48. The Government aims (i)       the financial strengthening through auditing at least once
infive years ofthe SI1balance-sheets by aninternational company withexperience inthe
area o f pensions and insurance auditing ( to this end, there i s need to look into the
necessary legal aspects); (ii)  improve the operational efficiency through computerization
o f the periodical processing o f payments o f pensions on pilot bases in the SI1
headquarters and inthe region.

49. Social assistance. The strategy for decentralization aims at addressing the issue o f
accountability in the use o f funds for programs financed at the national level, but
managed at the local one. This objective will be carried out for all the objectives, but at
least for the area o fthe social protection. The government through its PRSC programwill
support a study on the way how pensions (and inparticular rural pensions) and the social
assistance impact the poverty reduction and the role o f the social assistance. The
Government will revise its policies related to accountability within the system o f
decentralization, delivery o f efficient social assistance through "cash" programs and

Objective 4: Improving essential functions of the public sector and inter-
institutional relations.

Problems

52. The policymaking, the management o f human resources, the financial management
and accountability, as well as the fiscal decentralization are some o f the essential
institutional capacities that the Government is aiming at strengthening, so that the
programs o f the economic and social development o f the country can be applied in an
effective way. Albania has made progress regarding the reforming o f the budget
management, introducing even a updated legal framework, the improvement o f the
macroeconomic capacities and the fiscal management, as well as the improvement o f the
procedures for the preparation o f the budget. The adoption o f the MTEF has helped find
solutions conceming certain shortcomings noted before in the process o f the budget
management. A special attention has been attached to the process o f the MTEF revision,


                                               17

                                                                                         Annex 1
                                                                                   Page 18 o f 28

insuring in this way that the process in question be integrated into the cycle o f the
drafting o f the annual budget. The MTEF i s already transformed into a sustainable
instrument, guidingthe process o f the preparation o f the annual budget. The development
o f sectoral strategies o f budget expenditures in the framework o f the MTEF aims at
makingpossible that the distribution ofpublic expenditures be guidedby sectoral policies
andthe already programmedpriorities, identifiedby the NSSED andthat the resourcesbe
utilized inan efficient way withinthe sectoral programs.

53. The Government thinks that continuous support and assistance i s important so that it
can carry out the reforms to the end and accompany themwith:

             The improvement o fthe monitoring andthe assessment o f results;
         0   The results, the impacts o fpolicies, andprograms;
         0   The improvement o f the capacity to draw, maintain, and motivate qualified
             and professional humanresources;
         0   The consolidation o f the mechanisms to increase the responsibility of the
             government before its citizens in the fulfillment o f the objectives o f the
             policies and programs, in particular, those that contribute to the economic
             growth and poverty reduction.

54. A periodic assessment o f the results o f the budget and the inclusion o fthe conclusions
in the process of budget preparation for the next year are important elements for
improving the general efficiency o f public expenditures and the increase o f the
responsibility o f the managers.

 55. The experience hitherto from the introduction o f a medium-term framework budget
method and its link with the NSSED has however identified the fact that the MTEF
process has undergone considerable improvement. Such improvements will focus both
 on the time aspect o f the drafting o f the budget, leaving the ministries sufficient time to
prepare better their budget proposals. The MTEF document has started to be distributed
to parliament once it was approved by the Council o f Ministers. The Government will
take such measures like: (i) preparation o f a new organic law onthe budget inorder to
                               the
 update it with the current reforms inthe context o f the MTEF and the establishment o f a
 suitable legislative environment for the future development o f the MTEF process, (ii)        the
 establishment o f a better link between the MTEF and the budget cycle to ensure that the
 priorities identified in the NSSED are reflected in the MTEF and then in the annual
 budget.

 56. The Program o f the Government o f Albania on the fight on corruption targets
 measuresto strengthen the state institutions.

 57. The program o f the Government o f Albania has identified the fact that regarding the
 Financial Accountability for Albania (CFAA4 there are still some areas where special
 improvements need to be made: insufficient capacity in some institutions, weak internal

control, improper management o f the cash money.                The government will aim at
enhancing the      external auditing capacity.     Instructions for accounting methods for
budgetary institutions must be given and accounting plans should be updated to establish
the necessary links with the budget classification. The Treasury Department has started
and will continue to prepare daily regular reconciliation o f the data from the secondary
banksandthe Banko fAlbania inorder to ensure the proper management of cash.

58. Inorder to create a sound legal basis for internal auditing inthe public sector, the law
on Internal Auditing has entered into force, which clearly lays down the roles and the
responsibility o f central internal auditing, while the internal auditing units at the line
ministries should have the capacity to implement international auditing standards. The
auditors o f the Supreme State Audit [SSA] need training and experience for the full
implementation o f these standards. Another problem is also the independence and
neutrality o f the SSA, which are indispensable prerequisites for an objective and effective
external auditing.      The SSA has adopted international instructions and standards
INTOSAI, but it should enhance the capacity to implement them. The Assembly also
aims at enhancing the capacity to analyze the auditing reports o f the SSA and to make
sure that the measures taken by the government are in conformity with the problems
raisedinthis report.

59. The law on Public Procurements, which governs the expenditures o f the public
institutions for the procurement o f goods and services is comprehensive, but its
implementation is incomplete due to the lack o f a complete framework o f detailed
regulations, which are needed to define the specific procedures that will be followed in
the application o f the law on procurements. The government, with the assistance o f the
World Bank:      is revising the existing legal framework and i s drafting a series o f high
 quality standard documents for public procurements regardingthe procurement standards
 and the forms o f contracts that are needed for a uniform interpretation and application
 and to ensure a reliable contractual basis according to which the public procurers can
 award contracts. The public servants ingeneral have very little knowledge o f the current
 legislationthat governs public procurements and both local and foreign bidders complain
 o f difficulties they encounter in getting information about various possibilities to get
 contracts. Regarding the issues linkedwith the management o f public expenditures and
 fiscal transparency, the existing government decree on the implementation o f a
 decentralization strategy requires further improvements inthe legal framework.

 60. In the context o f the efforts for making successful institutional reforms and o f the
 demands to have qualified and motivated civil staff, who can deserve their work places,
 parliament has approved a law on the Status o f Civil Servants (CSL), but this law and
 other bylaws issued further to it have not been very successfully implemented inpractice
 andhave to face major challenges regardingits implementation.

61. Finally the government is committed to facing a number o f challenges and finding
suitable solutions regarding (i) building o f confidence to implement the objectives o f
                                  the
the laws that are linkedwith the public sector, (ii)  the revision o f the legal framework in
order not to have contradictions among various laws that are linked with the law on the
public service; (iii) understanding o f the demands o f the Law on the Civil Service
                      the
both by the civil workers and the political leaders; (iv) the respect by all officials o f the
provisions o f this law and its bylaws in defining clearer objectives that regulate the
relations between the political and the civil functions and in a more specific way the
clarification o f the powers and tasks o f the general secretary and his relations with the
minister and (v) the employment o f qualified staff.


                                      Reform Agenda

62. The Government reform agenda focuses on four areas: (i) formulation; (ii)
                                                                     policy
humanresources development; (iii) sector accountability, including strengthening
                                       public
financial reporting, internal audit and procurements; and (iv) fiscal decentralization.

63. Introduction of a process with broader consultation and exchange of opinions on
the policy formulation. Such as process would ensure (a) a systematic analyses o f the
important policy issues deriving from the proposed laws; (b) policy proposals that were
subject o f systematic reviews o f a broad range o f stakeholders or their representatives.

64. Consequently, the Government, and the Parliament have envisaged a series o f actions
aiming at: (i)improving capacities o f the line ministries to develop proposals based on
clear objectives and supported on carefully studied and analyzed sectoral strategies; ( ii)
raising at the central level o f the Government the authority and capacity to ensure to the
Council o f Ministers the professional and policy-making competency related to policy
proposals rather then legal formulation only; and (iii)   establishing with the Parliament the
capacity to make a professional analyses o f the substance o f the proposals and
evaluations o f the policies o f the impacts achieved during their implementation. Through
these actions the Government aims to: (i)prepare a strategy and an action plan to
strengthen the debate with regard to practices o f policy formulation within the executive
branch. To this end, the Government will establish a unifiedstructure, with civil servants
at department level accountable for carrying out this function; (ii)     finalization o f review
o f functions that are currently under the Council o f Ministers domain and then further on
transfer those that are not important for the main functions o f policies o f the Council of
Ministers or those that remain with the Council o f Ministers because o f their importance
and inter-sectoral nature; (iii)  formulation o f a strategy and an action plan to strengthen
capacities for professional analyses o f the policies and supervision policies in the
Parliament.

 65. Human Resources Development. The strategy o f the Government o f albania with
regard to issues o f the human resources management reform comprises five elements: (i)
 credible commitment o f the Government o f albania to the objectives o f the public sector
 laws on job recruitment. This is going to be achieved through recruitment o f officials


                                              20

                                                                               Page 21 o f 28

who are employed inkey positions to act in line with the legislation, as well as through
the principles o f the draft Code o f EthicsAegislation on conflict o f interests; (ii)
formulation o f a clear legal framework; (iii)understanding the requirements and
consequences o f the human resources management reform. In order to ensure the
effective implementationo fthe civil service legal framework, the Government o fAlbania
will issues a decision that clarifies the roles, responsibilities, and functions of the
Secretary Generals and o f the Deputy Ministers, as well as the functions o f the Ministers;
the Government has issued a decision that establishes the hiringprocedures based on the
principles o f transparency, competition and debate for the public administration high
officials; GOAhas prepared and submitted to the Parliament the Code o f Ethics and
recently has submitted in the Parliament the law on the "Competencies in setting
salaries"; (iv) attracting qualified staff. This will be achieved through: first, making
salaries competitive and second the job hiring process needs to be more competitive and
merit-based. In 2002 there was in increase in salaries for the civil servants fine-tuned
with the enforcement of the CSL requirements for hiring; (v) strengthening mechanisms
to attract opinions on the human resources reform. The Government will continue its
efforts to monitor and publishthe specific data o f the ministries every three months.

66. In order to develop a transparent and competitive remuneration system, the strategy
o f the Government to improve salaries throughout the public administration was spelled
out in the Medium-Term Expenditures Framework document for 2002-04. In order to
ensure the fiscal feasibility and sufficient increase o f the salaries, the strategy defines
 orderly increase of salaries that target specific segments o f the public administration,
 always within the general fiscal limit inthe context o f the MTEF. In line with this, the
 DoPA will finalize puttinginthe data inthe employees central data base, which has been
 formulated inthe recent years with the assistance o f KE (PRSC-2). Also, DoPA and the
 Ministry of Finance will prepare and launch the implementation of a strategy and an
 action plan that will ensure the credibility and timely submission o f monitored
 information onthe employees central data base (PRSC-3).

 67. However, the public administration reform still encounters challenges that require
 attention, such as: (a) adoption o f the composition o f the civil servants to the changing
 requirements for different skills, especially in establishing contemporary capacities for
 the analyses and management o f policies; and (b) increase productivity o f the civil
 servants and public administration ingeneral; (c) a realistic evaluation o f the performance
 ofthe civil servants.

 68. DoPA (i) cooperation with the World Bank and SIGMA carried out a review of the
               in
 legislationinorder to see whether the recent changes inthe CSL legal framework address
 properly the need to strengthen the practices o f the due process in the CSL context, and
 continues with preparation o f proposals for amendments to the CSL or its by-laws to
 address the weakness and gaps; and ( ii)provide technical assistanceto the line ministries
 inorder to ensure efficient implementationofthe CSL legalframework anditsby-laws.

 69.Public Sector Accountability. The agenda o f the Government includes a set of
 measures to strengthen financial control and accountability mechanisms. The objectives


                                             21

                                                                                            Annex 1
                                                                                      Page 22 o f 28

are increase o f transparency and fight against corruption. The agenda o f the Government
includes actions with regard to policies in three main dimensions: (i)              improving the
process of budget administration and making the financial statements more
transparent; increase accountability o f the public sector senior officials; (ii)
strengthening mechanisms and capacities o f the internal control and audit; and (iii)
formulation o ftransparent practices inprocurement.

70. Increase accountability of the Public Sector Senior Oficials. The Government is
committed to strengthen its anti-corruption program, and in concrete terms it has drafted
a Draft Law on declaration o f assets o f high officials, politicians, andjudges, which has
just been approved by the Parliament. Also, the publications will not only be monitored
and verified by an independent unit, but also will be made public in line with the
legislation in force about the public's right for information, as well as use o f various
methods o f data publication. Taking into account the public requirement for more
transparency on the state transactions, the Government is looking into the possibility for
an external control o fall Governmental transactions for 2003 inall the areas.

71. Public Expenditures Management Process. The Government has made the MTEF, the
nucleus o f its process for the budget formulation in order to prioritize expenditures in
accordance with the NSSED priorities more efficiently, and to strengthen the connection
between the policy objectives and budget planning. The Government has ensured a close
relation between the preparation o f the NSSED with the preparation o f the MTEF for
 2002-05. As part o f the MTEFprocess, the line ministries- agriculture, education, health,
 labor & social affairs, public order, public works, and transports- have integrated their
 economic growth and poverty reduction objectives in the formulation o f their sector
 expenditures strategies.

 72. Formulation o f an action plan to strengthen the budget systems and procedures
 (including monitoring o f budget results), as well as training staff o f the MoF budget and
 line ministries will assist in improving further improving the budget management
 process. Also, MoF has taken measures to generate in two pilot ministries, i.e. the
 Ministry o f Transport and Ministry o f Agriculture & Food, a data base on budgetary
 investments, including commitment, disbursement and expenditure details for all the
 internally and externally-financedprojects4'. Also, it has planned to improve recording o f
 committed assistance and disbursements, as well as to strengthen the procedures
 according to which local and central institutions report treasury expenditures. the
 Ministry of Finance has drafted procedures for the registration of disbursements and
 expenditures for all foreign-financed projects, including grant-financed projects. Also, in
 the context o f the inter-institutional cooperation and transparency, the MoF in the last
 half o f January 2003 made available to the Economy & Finance Commission in the
 Parliament the MTEF for 2003-05. given the limited external funds to finance capital
 investments it is very important that these criteria be transparent for the selection o f
 capital projects, while specifying the technical, financial, environmental and social

 Finance, andwill be accompaniedby a study for the formulation of a comprehensive system of a data base
 that will be generate inallthe line ministries by end 2003.

criteria, the Ministry o f Finance i s working to draft the relevant instructions that define
these criteria.

73.ImprovingPublic FinancialAccountability.The Treasury will enforce established
mechanisms for reconciliation and shall perform regular reconciliation o f consolidated
treasury payment requests with the regional treasury offices with reimbursement by the
Central Bank to the agent banks. Also, the Treasury will address the issues o f securing
regular information from the Tax and Customs departments. Consolidated financial
statements. The Accounting Department can not focus on this activity given that it i s also
responsible for the function o f accounting and auditing for the private sector. Duringthe
PRSC 11, the Government should look into the possibility o f the split-up o f the two
functions intwo separate departments given that there i s little consistency between these
two functions. Also, there is need for this department to get technical assistance for the
development o f methodologies and skills.

74. Law on Internal Audit & Internal Control. The President has just decreed the Law
"On Internal Auditing". The Ministry o f Finance has began the preparations for the
necessary by-laws to ensure its full implementation. The InternalAudit Department inthe
MoF has finalized the inventory o f all internal controls inthe public sector, including the
description o f the source document (law, decree, regulation), and has identified the gaps
inthe internalaudits, andhasissuedthe relevantrecommendations to addressthem.

75. Supreme State Audit. The SSA would benefit from a twinning arrangement with
other SSA institutes that would assist the staff o f the SSA in learningthe most updated
techniques inrisk-based auditing andthe last progress on the auditing o f the Government.
The SSA has established contacts with several Audit Institutes and is talking to the EU
and OECD to identify fundingsourcesto finance the twinningarrangement.

76.Public Procurements. Since the finalization o f the Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) inJanuary 2001, the staff o f the Agency has increased from 5 to 20, thus
meeting the staffing requirement41.

77. The Public Procurement Agency (PPA) has taken care o f the regular publication o f
the Public Procurement Bulletin, and has added to it the publication o f the quantitative
indicators o f achievements inpublic procurements, which comes out every ten days, thus
covering the central and the local levels. Indicators speak o f expenditures on procurement
at various level o f government, and detail the expenditure according to the procurement
method used (i.e. open tendering, request for quotation, direct contracting, restricted
bidding etc). since September 2002, the PPA has started the regular publication o f the
standard bidding documents and the public procurement law. while, the PPA i s working
with full capacity, measures are being taken with regardto its efficacy and independence.
The PPA spends most of its time and resources inthe administrative revision o f bidders
claims with regard to ongoing procurement procedures. It i s clear that one o f the areas

41The Public Procurement Agency (PPA) now has a Director and 5 units: Procurements and Control ( 6
person), Legalunit (4); statistics & finance (4); external affairs (1); the rest will be administrative support

that the Government is committedto seriously tackle is with regard to measuresto reduce
concerns regarding subjective and unclear methods, which i s the perception that it the
way bids are evaluated.

78. The bases o f this subjectivism i s some of the provisions o f the current law "on Public
Procurements", which provides for the bid evaluation based on the merit point system,
where 80% goes for the price, and 20% to other non-price evaluation criteria. Giventhe
subjectivity that comes from the meritpoint based evaluation systems, the evaluators may
change the allocation o f points in the course o f the evaluation process to award the
contract to a favorite bidder, thus making the evaluation process less transparent and
credible. Inorder to correct this functioning failure, there might be a need to amend the
public procurement law in order to suspend the use o f the evaluation system based on
points for the procurement o f goods and civil services and replace them with a system o f
bid evaluation based on objective criteria, measurable and expressed inmonetary terms.
In December 2002, the Government approved decision no. 675 with regard to
introduction o f a new system o f data registration both on public procurement practices,
and on the procedures o f centralized bidding for certain expenditure categories. Based on
this system, after the approval ofthe budget based onthe requests andapproved funds in
the budget for goods, services, and constructions, the institutions prepare and fill inthe
registry o f the plannedprocurement their projections for public procurement according to
the from and manner specified by the Public Procurement Agency. By the year's end,
these institutions shall have to fill in the Registry o f the Accomplished Procurements
their achievements on the tendering procedures. A copy o f these two registries has been
submittedto the Treasury Department inthe Ministryo f Finance.

79. Fiscal Decentralization. The Constitution (October 21, 1998) establishes that the
local government functions based on the principles o f decentralization, and the relations
between the state, regions and the local government is based on the principles o f
autonomy, law and cooperation.

80. The Government o f Albania has approved the decentralization strategy and some
laws to create the legal base. In concrete terms, the law "on the functioning and
organization o f the local government" (July 2001) determines the principles o f the local
functions, the rights and obligations; at the same time, the Government has drafted the
basic strategy for the enforcement o f decentralization42. Some other achievements o f the
Government o f albania include the approval o f the law "On the Prefects", the law "On
immovable state property and transfer o f a part o f these assets to the local Government",
the law on "local business tax", on the system of local obligations, and introduction of the
simplified profit-tax as a source o f revenues for the local government budget. Although
there is now a basic legal framework, there are no complimentary rules to make the
decentralization process sustainable. The Government is aware o f the fact that inorder to



42The strategy of decentralization and local autonomy (November 1999)has been put together by the
 Technical Group o f Expertsofthe Decentralization(GED); it has been proposed by the National
 Committee for Decentralization (NCD), andhas been approvedby the Council of Ministers in September 9,
 2000.

IMFConcludes 2002ArticleIV ConsultationwithAlbania


On February 26, 2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Albania."

Background

Sound financial policies and market reforms during most of the 1990s have fostered
growth and macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, poverty remains pervasive, and the
sustainability of growth i s dependent on the expansion of tradables, inparticular industry
and mining. However, investment in these sectors is hindered by a deficient business
climate including administrative barriers and electricity shortages. The authorities'
November 2001 poverty reduction and growth strategy contains wide-ranging measures
for the promotion of private sector activity and poverty alleviation. Within this
framework, the current Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement
supports efforts to ensure a sound macroeconomic environment. Monetary policy aims at
maintaining inflationwithin a 2-4 percent range, within a floating exchange rate system.
To promote fiscal and external sustainability, the overall deficit is to be lowered from 8.5
percent of GDP in2001 to 5.8 percent o f GDP by 2005.

Economic growth appears to have fallen below the 7 percent estimatedhistorical average,
to 4.7 percent in 2002. High foreign investments and private remittances in 2001 have
maintained robust import demand, reflected in a widening trade deficit in 2001 and the
 first halfof 2002. The exchangerate has remained fairly stable.

 The fiscal deficit has remained well within the budgetary limits, despite serious tax
 collection shortfalls since end-2001. The latter have likely reflected lower-than-expected

 '' Under  Article IV of the IMF`s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateraldiscussions
 with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collectseconomic and
 financial information,and discusseswith officials the country'seconomicdevelopments
 and policies. On returnto headquarters,the staff prepares a report,which forms the
 basisfor discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusionof the discussion,the
 Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizesthe views of Executive
 Directors, and this summary is transmittedto the country's authorities.

                                                                                  Annex 8
                                                                               Page 2 o f 4

GDP growth, delays in reform, and managerial changes, in the context o f ambitious
collection targets. The overall deficit (excluding grants) declined to 8.5 percent o f GDP
in2001 andis estimated at 7.5 percent in2002. Combinedwithexternal debt forgiveness,
this has reduced total public debt to about 64 percent o f GDP from about 72 percent at
end-2000.

Concerns about rising inflation-which       peaked at 7 percent in early 2002-prompted
some tightening o f monetary policy. The increase inthe rep0 rate since mid-2001-from
6.5 percent to 8 percent-was     also motivated by highcurrency incirculation-in  part due
to sizable deposit withdrawals from the largest two banks, in March and April 2002,
based on unfounded rumors o f solvency problems. Stability has since returned and
deposits have been recovering.

Structural reforms have slowed since mid-2001,with delays in privatization and, since
mid-2002, slippage in electricity sector reform. Political changes, together with the
weakened global market, hindered the planned mid-2002 sale o f the Savings Bank and
Albtelekom. While the authorities have made significant progress inreforming the ailing
energy sector, drought has caused severe electricity shortages in recent years. Moreover
recent slippage inmeetingtargets for bill collection and losses could prolong the crisis.

Executive BoardAssessment

Executive Directors commended the authorities' efforts to make progress toward a
market economy through sound macroeconomic management as well as actions to revive
the reform process since the elections in 2002. Inthe context o f the recent slowdown in
 activity, Directors noted that impediments to private sector development threatened the
 prospects for growth and poverty alleviation. They stressed that, in order to promote a
 business-friendly environment, it i s necessary to accelerate the implementation o f
 structural reform, improve the physical and financial infrastructure, and strengthen the
 enforcement o f the rule o f law and governance, including by fighting corruption.
 Directors considered that the prospect o f a Stabilization and Association Agreement with
 the EU provides a strong framework and a unique opportunity for pushing ahead the
 reform process.

 Directors welcomed the observance o f fiscal deficit targets in 2002 and supported the
 budgetary framework for 2003. Inlight o f the weaknesses inrevenue collection last year,
 they concurred with the more cautious approach followed by the authorities inprojecting
 revenues in 2003. Inthis context, they also emphasized the continuing need to focus on
 sustainable improvements in revenue collection,           by broadening the tax base,
 strengthening administration, and combating smuggling, while at the same time ensuring
 a fair application o f the tax law. For the medium term, Directors considered that raising
 revenues remains key to permitting the needed expansion in social expenditures, while
 also keeping the fiscal balances within prudent limits and offsetting the likely decline in
 external concessional financing. Directors also underscored the need for careful
 prioritization and management o f spending to avoid ad hoc cuts in public investment,
 should revenues fall short o ftargets.

                                                                               Page 3 o f 4


Directors expressed concern that electricity shortages continue to seriously constrain
growth and pose risks to private sector development, and therefore urged the authorities
to bringthe electricity sector reforms back on track, inclose collaboration with the World
Bank. They reiterated their support for the authorities' commitment to phasing out
subsidies for electricity imports before 2005. Directors recommended that the authorities
should continue with their efforts to put in place a price mechanism to reflect market
conditions and enhance the financial viability o f the electricity company. It was also
suggestedthat the authorities should consider over time how best to diversify their energy
sources. Directors also stressed the importance o f a timely settlement o f inter-enterprise
arrears within the public sector, and o f the adoption o f strategies to prevent the
accumulationo f new arrears.

Directors commended the authorities' prudent monetary policy, which had been critical
incontaining inflationary pressures, and the progress to an indirect control regime. They
supported the recent introduction o f a deposit insurance system, with the aim o f
promoting financial sector confidence. Directors also encouraged the Bank o f Albania to
closely monitor the increasing dollarization and the rapidforeign currency growth.

Directors emphasized the importance o f financial sector reform, and welcomed plans to
strengthen and modernize the financial system. They encouraged the authorities to give
the highest priority to the successful privatization o f Savings Bank, which could be
facilitated by some restructuring and improved marketing. This, and other actions, are
required to help improve competition inthe banking system and more generally allow a
larger role for banks in private sector development. Directors encouraged further efforts
to strengthen bank supervision. They commended the authorities' efforts in blocking
finding for terrorists, and encouraged the authorities to improve implementation of the
Money LaunderingLaw.

Directors urged the authorities to persevere with legal and institutional reforms to
improve the climate for business and investment. In this context, they welcomed the
authorities' commitment to combating corruption and the ongoing implementation o f
their anti-corruption program. These actions would also help reduce the size of Albania's
large informal sector. Directors, however, noted that, as stressed in the staffs analysis,
much remains to be done, and urged the authorities to intensify efforts inthis area. They
underscored, also, the importance o f high-level resolve and broad political support to
ensure that these efforts are successful. Directors commented on the need to modernize
the operation of public enterprises, wherever necessary, and to move ahead with the
privatization program.

Directors commended the authorities for maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime and
an open trade system, and for making progress in negotiating several regional free trade
 agreements. They noted that, while a more rapid expansion o f exports was primarily
 constrained by non-price factors, the authorities should also closely monitor price
 competitiveness.
