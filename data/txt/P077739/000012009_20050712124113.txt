3. Program Description

3.1. Concise Description of the Overall Program:
The Government program, articulated in the National Strategy for Social and Economic Development
(NSSED), is organized around two pillars: public sector governance and strong economic growth. It
emphasizes policy interventions to improve education, healthcare, and infrastructure, to address the key
non-income dimensions of poverty, and to provide a sound basis for long-term growth and
competitiveness. It also recognizes the need for stronger public accountability and increased public
participation in decision making to empower the poor. The NSSED had five main goals for the 2002-2004
period: (i) to achieve real GDP growth of 18-21 percent over the 3 year period; (ii) to reduce the number
of people living in poverty, particularly extreme poverty; (iii) to make tangible improvements in
infrastructure and related services, such as electric power, potable water supply, and sewerage, increasing
the poor's access to these services; (iv) to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates and the incidence of
infectious diseases; and (v) to increase elementary and secondary school enrollment rates and the average
schooling period.

3.2. Brief Description of the Operation and its Relationship to the Program
PRSC-2 was the second of three single tranche programmatic operations designed to support the
Government's NSSED. Within the broader NSSED, the PRSC program aimed to develop and implement
policies and structural reforms that improve transparency and the effectiveness of public sector
management and to improve the effectiveness and equity in access to social services with a high poverty
impact. It also aimed to support sustainable growth through private sector development, particularly in
rural areas, and to develop capacity in the Government to monitor and evaluate policy implementation
and feed results back to policymakers to help inform their decision making process. To this effect the
program was structured around four components and envisaged as a three year support program, with
yearly operations expected to provide budgetary support. The program's four components were:

        · Promoting sustainable growth and supporting private sector development.
        · Strengthening the capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda.
        · Improving service delivery and social safety net effectiveness.
        · Improving core public sector functions and institutional arrangements.



                                                            2

The PRSC2 continued the reform program initiated by PRSC1, but with a somewhat stronger emphasis
on strengthening the business environment as a necessary engine for continued growth. It continued to
support policy actions under all four pillars, with a program of sixteen core policy actions, further
supplemented by thirty seven non-core conditions designed to either continue reforms initiated under
PRSC1 or initiate work expected to culminate in core policy actions under PRSC3. The core policy
measures supported under PRSC-2 are listed below.

                             Table 1: Policy Actions under PRSC2

Component/Sector                      Policy Action
I. Promoting Sustainable Growth and Supporting Private Sector Development
1.1 Macroeconomic Framework               Maintain a satisfactory macroeconomic framework
1.2 Private Sector Development            MoE to take the lead in implementing recommendations of the
                                          `Administrative Barriers Study' through an inter-ministerial task force.
                                          The priority actions should focus on:

                                          (i)   Improving business entry through abolishing license
                                                requirements for non-food industry

                                          (ii) Reduce compliance cost for business operation by reducing the
                                                on-site arbitrary inspections by electricity, water, police, and tax
                                                inspectors, and by improving the appeals system and processes in
                                                Customs

1.3 Rural Development                      No core policy measures under PRSC-2, but non-core conditions
                                           focusing on continuation of property registration and legislation to
                                           settle restitution of non-moveable assets.

2.2 Poverty Monitoring                   No core policy measures under PRSC-2, but non-core policy measures
                                         supported continued progress on poverty monitoring
3. Improving Service Delivery and Social Safety Net Effectiveness
3.1 Health                               2003 health budget increases in real terms relative to 2002 consistent
                                         with MTEF and based on a satisfactory human resources management
                                         plan and health facility recurrent cost analysis, including an increase in
                                         targeted public health programs.

                                         Government (i) issues revised Instructions on the Delegated Functions
                                         in Healthcare for the Year 2003 to ensure that municipalities and
                                         communes (excluding those covered by TRHA) collectively budget no
                                         less than Lek 375 million for the second and third trimesters of 2003,
                                         with a schedule of a base budget for primary and public health for each
                                         commune and municipality attached; and (ii) allocates a minimum of an
                                         additional Lek 200 million to be earmarked for priority operations and
                                         maintenance expenditures in primary and public health for the
                                         remainder of 2003.

                                         Satisfactory measures to strengthen primary and public heath care
                                         service delivery implemented, including:

                                         (i)   maintenance of satisfactory level of child vaccination and female
                                                TT coverage by increasing budget allocation to the program to
                                                compensate for phased reduction in donor contribution.

4. Improving Core Public Sector Functions and Institutional Arrangements
4.1 Civil Service Reform                 The Government provides evidence, satisfactory to IDA, that personnel
                                         actions in key positions are consistent with the objectives of the relevant
                                         legislation, as well as with the principles embodied in the draft Code of
                                         Ethics. Such evidence would demonstrate the following:

                                         Dismissals or appointments have occurred in compliance with
                                         procedural due process requirements of the relevant legislation.

                                         No appointments have been made of persons who are (i) unqualified, (ii)
                                         a close relative of persons involved in their selection and appointment
                                         decision, or (iii) in violation of conflict of interest principles

                                         Enact and Implement the Law on Internal Audit by adopting internal
                                         audit standards, appointing directors of internal audit in line ministries,
                                         establishing criteria for selection of internal audit staff, and establishing
                                         internal audit committee

                                         MoF to establish procedures for reconciling, on a daily basis,

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

The overall outcome is rated satisfactory, though, were the six point scale available, it would be rated
moderately satisfactory. Achievements were mixed. Significant progress was made in the areas of civil
service reform, social protection (particularly pension reform) and reforms in support of rural
development (land registration, regional development plans) and, as the program moved closer towards
PRSC-3, also in education. Progress was mixed in the areas of public expenditure management and fiscal
accountability and modest in the health sector. While measures to reduce the cost of business were
implemented as foreseen, their effects could not be evaluated until 2005, due to lack of data. Encouraging
progress was made with introducing monitoring and evaluation functions into essentially all line agencies
and developing a more credible data base to evaluate the effectiveness of NSSED-promoted policies for
socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation. However, performance under two core conditions
slipped during the course of implementation. A Government commitment to allocate an additional 200
million Lek from the general budget for priority operation and maintenance expenditures in primary
health care was only executed in the amount of Lek 52 million and the increase in health expenditures
was not supported by a comprehensive human resources strategy. A commitment to initiate daily
reconciliation of consolidated payment data with reimbursement data from the Bank of Albania could not
be implemented because the information technology infrastructure did not allow for it.

Macro-economic stability was maintained, with growth recovering to six percent, inflation at 2.4 percent,
and an improvement in the fiscal balance. The latter was led by an improvement in tax collection.
Nevertheless, revenue collection projections that overestimated privatization revenues at the outset of the
year called for fiscal adjustment during the year. Fiscal adjustments were made across the board and
included the priority education and health sectors ­ although expenditures in these priority sectors posted
a real increase compared to 2002, so that the Government maintained its expenditure commitments made
for these sectors under PRSC-2. Table 2 below summarizes key macro-economic indicators for the
PRSC-2 period and the years leading up to it.

Real GDP Growth                                                     7.2            3.4            6.0
Inflation                                                           3.1            5.2            2.4
Current account balance (%GDP, excluding official transfers)       -6.4           -9.7           -8.2
Fiscal balance (% GDP, including grants)                           -7.9           -6.6           -4.4
Exchange rate Leke/US$ (year average)                              143            140            122



PRSC-2 achievements against the monitoring indicators that had been agreed upon at the beginning of the
PRSC program are presented in table 1 of Annex 1. It must be stressed that these indicators were not
always the best choice to monitor performance of what the program set out to achieve. This is, for
example, the case for education. Furthermore, targets were set for few of these indicators and for many a
baseline was not established, thus making it difficult to use the indicators to gauge progress since the
outset of the PRSC program. Indeed, progress against indicators was only monitored as of PRSC-3
appraisal.

The next operation, PRSC-3, was approved by the Board on December 7, 2004. Efforts were made to
focus the reform program on a more limited number of core issues under PRSC-3, thus reducing the
number of core conditions vis-à-vis the originally specified triggers. However, the substantial unfinished
agenda in the overall broad PRSC program left significant loose ends to be finalized under PRSC-3.



                                                       5

These were mostly included as non-core conditions in this follow-up operation. PRSC-3 carried the
reforms further in the following areas:

          Private Sector Development: Focus on further progress with land registration and
              consolidating the legislative framework for restitution of immovable property.
          Public Administration and Civil Service Reform: Consolidation of the legal and regulatory
              framework governing conflict of interest and, strengthening transparency of public
              expenditure management and procurement.
          Social Service Delivery: Continued focus on protecting priority expenditures in health and
              education, implementation of a revised textbook policy ensuring access to free textbooks by
              vulnerable groups; clear assignment of responsibilities in social sector service delivery to
              local governments and further consolidation of the pension reforms.

In view of the substantial progress achieved under the policy monitoring and evaluation component under
PRSC-1 and PRSC-2, PRSC-3 did not include any core conditions in this area. It focused on core policy
conditions under the other three components where further action was required to advance
implementation of the NSSED. Table 3 summarizes triggers under PRSC-3.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

The main factors which affected the performance of the PRSC-2 program, particularly in the period
leading up to PRSC-2 appraisal, were the continued political instability and frequent government changes.
There were three changes of Government in 2002 and although each government expressed its
commitment to the NSSED, the uncertain political situation impeded its implementation and
institutionalization. Ownership of the NSSED was limited during the PRSC-2 preparation process until
appraisal. A Bank organized stakeholder workshop helped bring NSSED back on track and helped
provide impetus for the Government to take stronger ownership during the time of the preparation of the
first NSSED progress report. The situation improved following appraisal, when the Ministry of Finance
started taking a more active leadership role and ensured better coordination across the various line
agencies. Political instability led to further key cabinet changes in early 2004, with the period leading up
to that again reflecting a slow down in implementation. Another factor which affected the PRSC program
was conflicting advice given to the Government by external advisors regarding decentralization in the
social sectors. This had a particularly negative impact on the financing of primary health care. Two
factors which positively influenced the program were the complementarity between the PRSC program
and a number of Bank supported investment operations which allowed for the necessary technical
expertise to support policy reforms in public administration and public expenditure management,
education and health. The other positive factor was the continuous engagement of the Bank's Tirana
office in the dialogue with Government on the NSSED in general and PRSC supported reforms in
particular.


6. Bank and Borrower Performance

6.1. Bank Performance:
Bank performance is rated satisfactory both during preparation and implementation. The Bank team made
considerable efforts to help improve Government ownership and understanding of the PRSC program
following the political upheavals and Government changes which followed approval of PRSC-1. The
team secured a team learning grant and organized a two day workshop with counterparts from all
implementing agencies concerned. This has been widely acknowledged as having contributed
considerably towards building an improved working relationship between the Bank team and Government
counterparts, as well as among Government counterparts. This was particularly important, as many of the
counterparts were new to the PRSC process following Government changes. It also helped bring to the
forefront the importance of coordination by the Ministry of Finance, which henceforth assumed a more
active coordination role. The Bank team also helped the Government secure a PHRD grant for project
preparation, which was to support technical work in a number of crucial reform areas. However,
substantial delays in the Government approval of the grant led to the grant being cancelled without any
disbursements. The continued active involvement of the Bank's Tirana office both during preparation and
supervision of the PRSC program was critical to a continuous effective dialogue on the wide range of
policy reforms tackled under the PRSC program.

There are two areas where the Bank's performance could have been stronger. First is the coordination
and interaction between the social sector and the economic management teams, particularly on core cross-
cutting issues like decentralization and the definition and subsequent follow-up of performance
monitoring indicators. Second, design issues also affected implementation to some extent, as the overall
ambitious scope of the PRSC program as a whole led to a substantial number of non-core conditions not
being met and slipping into the following PRSC. This led to an overload of areas to be completed during
PRSC-3, despite concerted efforts to narrow down the focus of that operation to a more tangible set of
core issues.

6.2. Borrower Performance:
Overall borrower performance is rated satisfactory, though it would be rated moderately satisfactory,
were the six point scale available. This is mainly due to significant low periods during preparation. These
were mainly driven by political instability and government changes following approval of PRSC-1. These
changes brought into the process a significant number of new Government staff who were not familiar
with the PRSC process and as a result did not exhibit much ownership of the reforms until the above-
described workshop during the appraisal mission. Bank-Government cooperation prior to appraisal was at
times affected by the Government's reluctance to share information necessary to gauge the progress
made. There was little coordination among implementing agencies and the Ministry of Finance only
assumed an active coordination role following appraisal. Following the appraisal mission, however, the
process gained considerable momentum. Increased Government commitment towards bringing NSSED
back to the forefront was demonstrated by the inter-sectoral preparation of the first NSSED progress
report and MoF's commitment to dedicate permanent Ministerial staff to overseeing and coordinating the
NSSED process year round. Several difficult policy measures were taken during this time period,
including actions to increase transparency in the public sector (e.g. enactment of law on asset declaration,
legislation on internal auditing requirements, revisions to the public procurement system) and to
consolidate pension and education sector reforms. Towards the end of 2003, progress slowed down again
on many fronts owing to renewed political instability which culminated in changes in several key cabinet
positions in January 2004. One result of this was the substantial delay in securing Parliamentary
ratification of the PRSC-2 legal agreement. This then resulted in several months delay of credit
effectiveness.


7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

There are three main lessons which can be drawn from PRSC-2 (and from the PRSC series as a whole).
First, the number of policy reform areas tackled under such operations should be limited, particularly in
an environment of political instability. The program for the series should be left more flexible, so as not to
overburden the last of the series with an excessive unfinished agenda. A programmatic series with
rotating focus from year to year might better serve this purpose than a series attempting to tackle a large
number of areas over a 3 year period. Second, performance monitoring indicators should be limited to a
core set of indicators which reflect what the program aims to achieve and then closely monitored, and
attention needs to be paid to setting up clear baselines from which to measure progress. Third, the
presence of a strong country office which continuously engages in the dialogue and provides support for
implementation is critical to maintaining momentum for such operations, as the experience of PRSC-2
has clearly shown.
