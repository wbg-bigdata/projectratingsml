MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THREE PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY. TSKB. AND SYKB
FOR Ax INDUSTRIAL EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on three proposed loans amounting to US$ 300
million equivalent is submitted for approval. They consist of a loan of
JS$ 150 million equivalent to Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi (TSKB), a loan
of US$ 50 million ecuivalent to Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB), and a
loan of US$ 100 million equivalent to the Government of Turkey (GOT) for
on-lending to eligible commercial banks. The loans would help finance an
industrial export development project through a network of private and
public banks. The three loans would carry the Bank's standard variable
interest rate. TSKB and SYKB would repay the Bank on the basis of composite
amortization schedules of sub-loans. The loan to GOT would have a fixed
amortization schedule of 17 years including a grace period of 4 years.
2.       Back8tound.  Since 1980, the Government has been implementing a
new economic strategy aimed at stabilizing the economy, placing greater
reliance on market forces and encouraging the efficient growth of the
private sector. The main elements of the new strategy are: (i) maintaining
a competitive exchange rate; (ii) import liberalization; (iii) export
promotion; (iv) deregulation of the financial system; and (v) public sector
reforms with emphasis on price deregulation. The impact on the economy of
the above mentioned policy measures has been very positive. Between 1981-86
GDP increased at an average rate of 4.9b p.a. The private sector's response
to the Government's program has been impressive. The adoption of a
realistic exchange rate and complementary export promotion policies led to a
marked increase in manufacturing exports which grew from US$ 1.1 billion in
1980 to US$ 5.3 billion in 1986, an increase of 31% p.a. in real terms.
Private sector industrial investment has been growing at a rate of 6% p.a.
in real terms since 1983, though it appears to have slowed down in 1987.
Inflation as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) declined from a
level of 107% in 1980 to 29.6% in 1986.
3.       Turkey's future export growth, however, faces some uncertainties.
The increase in industrial production as well as export growth thus far have
been achieved mainly through increased capaciiy utilization, with



- 2 -
manufacturing investments proceeding at a much slower pace. Turkey's
exports are also relatively concentrated, with five countries (West Germany,
Italy, Iran, Iraq, and U.S.A.) accounting for about 502 of exports.
Furthermo-e, about half of the exports are consumer goods, mainly textiles
and leather goods, which are vulnerable to rising protection in major
importing countries. To sustain its export drive, Turkey would need to
increase industrial capacity, improve the quality of its products, diversify
its exports to new markets, provide adequate export finance, and intensify
marketing efforts especially in highly competitive markets. Capacity
utilization, especially in industries with strong export performance has now
reached high levela. Without new investment in these i.dustries Turkey's
export drive is likely to falter.
4.       Project Objectives. The proposed Project is designed to support
Turkey's drive for expanding industrial exports and to improve the policy
and institutional framework relevant to export finance. This will be
achieved by: (i) providing financial support to private export-oriented
projects in key industrial sub-sectors where Turkey has a comparative
advantage; (ii) improving the institutional framework for export finance and
simplifying export finance procedures; (iii) supporting TSKB, the major
private development bank in its financial restructuring and operational
diversification program; (iv) improving the credit delivery system for
industrial investment by including commercial banks in the Project; (v)
intensifying exnort marketing and promotional efforts by strengthening the
Export Promotion Center (IGEME) through greater private sector involvement;
and (vi) creating a computerized trade and export credit information system
at the Ex-Iz Bank of Turkey.
5.       Project !!tspStion.  The entire amount of the two proposed loans
to TSKB and SYKB (US$ 200 million) will be used by these two institutions as
lines of credit to finance private export-oriented investments. The credit
component (US$ 98.5 million ) under the proposed loan to the Government will
be used for the same purpose but will be channelled through TSKB and SYKB,
acting as Administrating Institutions (AIs) on behalf of the Government, for
use by eligible commercial banks in the provision of credit. The
eligibility criteria for participating commercial banks would include: (a)
sound financial conditions and results; (b) an unqualified audit by external
auditors approved by the Central Bank; and (c) project appraisal capacity or
an agreement to build up such a capacity in a reasonable period of time.
All sub-projects financed under the Project would be expected to meet the
agreed target of exporting at least 20% of incremental production within 3
to 5 years after start-up. All participating banks will be responsible for
appraising investment projects in accordance with agreed procedures and the
appraisals will include calculation of the internal financial and economic
rate of return. A minimum projected economic rate of return of 15% in real
terms would be required for all sub-proJects financed under the Project.
The appraisal reports will also include a statement on the environmental
impact of each sub-project and, when warranted, the appropriate remedial
actions. The sub-borrower under the Project will have an option to borrow
either in local or foreign currency. In case of th3 loans denominated in
local currency the sub-borrower will borrow on a fixed rate with the



exchange risk covered under the Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme
(FERIS). The fixed interest rate under FERIS is reviewed twice a year and
is currently 34% including a spread of 4? p.a. for participating banks and a
commission of 2% p.a. This rate is positive in real terms (as of October
30, 1987) and is projected to be positive during the life of sub-loans. In
the case of the loans denominated in foreign currency, the participating
banks will on-lend the funds at the Bank's rate plus a spread of up to 42
p.a. The Government has agreed to consider by June 30, 1988, the merit of
introducing a floating interest rate under FERIS. If a floating interest
rate is introduced then it would be available to sub-borrowers as an option.
6.       The Project includes a technical assistance component of us$ 1.5
million for strengthening the Export Promotion Research Center (IGEME), and
assisting the Turk Ex-Im Bank ir setting up a trade and export credit
information system, and carrying out a study of the credit delivery system
for industrial finance. A breakdown of costs and financing is shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and
disbursement schedules are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Turkey are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6885-TU dated December 14, 1987, is also attached.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Since 1980, through the five SALs,
and the first Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL), the Bank has played a
key role in assisting the Government in re-orienting its economy and
strengthening the financial sector through policy and institutional
reforms. The impact of the policy changes on the manufacturing sector,
especially manufactured exports, has been especially impressive during the
1980-86 period. The Project will enable the Bank to assist the Government
in further improving the export environme-'t and strengthening institutions
engaged in export finance and trade promotion. Since the scarcity of
long-term finance at a reasonable cost is a major impediment to private
industrial investment, the availability of long-term funds from the Bank,
which is the main source of such funding, will be very important in terms of
creating additional capacity in efficient export industries. Also, the
Bank's involvement is crucial in introducing commercial banks to term
finance. The proposed Project will complement the proposed Second FSAL
which would focus on issues pertaining to interest rates, money and capital
markets, and the health of the financial system as a whole.
8.       Agreed Actions.   During negotiations, an agreement was reached
with the Government that the following actions will be taken prior to the
effectiveness of the loans: (i) signing of fund management agreements
between GOT and the Administrating Institutions (TSKB and SYKB) on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank for the administration of the credit
component under the loan to the Government; (ii) signing of a subsidiary
loan agreement between GOT and the Turk Ex-Im Bank on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. Agreements were also reached with the Government
that: (i) only participating commercial banks which satisfy the agreed
eligibility criteria would have access to funds provided under the



-4 -
Bank loan, and the initial maximum limit per participating bank would be
US$ 15 million; (ii) the maximum aggregate amount per sub-project under the
three loans would be US$ 15 million; (iii) the Government would by June 30,
1988, consider the merit of introducing the floating interest rate under
FERIS; (iv) the proposed changes in IGEME's management strueture and
procedures will be effected by December 31, 1988; and (v) the Government,
with the assistance of consultants, will carry out a study of the credit
delivery system for industrial finance by December 31, 1988. Agreement was
reached with TS'B that it would: (i) ensure that full payment of the second
tranche of the capital increase of TL 12 billion takes place by September
30, 1988; (ii) implement the agreed operational restructuring program by
December 31, 1988; and (iii) maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at
least 1.1:1 and a maximum debt/equity ratio of 10:1 at all times. An
agreement was reached with SYKB that it would maintain a debt service
coverage ratio of at least 1.1:1 and a maximum debt/equity ratio of 1001 at
all times.
9.       Benefits and Risks.  The principal economic benefits under the
proposed Project would be: (i) an increase in export capacity; (i")
provision of more efficient financial services to investors through the
involvement of commercial banks in the Project; and (iii) better export
market information and advisory services to exporters. The minimum economic
rate of return of sub-projects financed under the Project would be 152.
Based on the experience of previous industrial projects in Turkey, the
Project would create about 20,000 new jobs at an investment cost per job of
US$ 30,000. The potential project risks would be: (i) unwillingness of the
private sector to invest if the investment climate becomes less favorable;
(ii) introduction of inappropriate trade policies resulting in reduced
incentive to export; and (iii) excessive caution among the commercial banks
because of lack of familiarity with project finance and the Bank's
procedures. However, given the safeguards, conditions and commitments
received from the Government and the Administrating Institutions, the
Project risks are acceptable.                                     I
10.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the loans.
