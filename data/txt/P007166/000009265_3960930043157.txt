STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:            Republic of El Salvador
Amount:              US$75.0 million equivalent
Executing Agency:   Government of El Salvador
Terms:               Repayment in 20 years, including five years of
grace at the standard variable interest rate.
Description:         The proposed loan would support the Government's
structural adjustment program, which is designed to
(i) improve incentives to stimulate savings and
investment in more efficient export oriented and
import-substituting activities, (ii) increase tax
enforcement capacity, (iii) improve the efficiency
of financial intermediation, (iv) improve
productivity in the agricultural sector, and (v)
prevent a deterioration in the nutritional status of
the poor during the adjustment process.
Project Benefits:   The adjustment program would promote export
growth and diversification, a more efficient
allocation of domestic resources, improved fiscal
control and a reduction in absolute poverty. It
also would improve El Salvador's creditworthiness,
facilitating access to external finance needed for
long-term sustainable growth.
Project Risks:       The principal risks are contirnued domestic political
instability and potentially adverse developments in
the international oil market. Two other risks are
insufficient institutional capacity to carry out the
complete program and inadequate external financing,
should bilateral donors reduce their support.
Schedule of
Disbursements:       The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed in three
equal tranches of US$25 million equivalent eath: the
first tranche upon effectiveneness (withi retroactive
financing of up to US$15 million), the second
tranche after a satisfactory performance review
around September 1991, and the third tranche after a
satisfactory performance review to be held in the
last quarter of CY92.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$75.0 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$75 million to the Republic of El Salvador.
The loan would support a structural adjustment program aiming to achieve
balanced and sustained economic growth and to reduce absolute poverty.
The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with
interest at the Bank's standard variable interest rates.
2.        Between 1978 and 1985, El Salvador's real per-capita GDP
dropped by 252 as a result of civil strife, capital flight, terms of
trade shocks and inadequate economic policies. In October 1986, a
severe earthquake struck the city of San Salvador, greatly damaging
urban infrastructure and placing a heavy burden on public sector
finances. Despite massive infusions of foreign aid and partial
stabilization attempts, the economy did not recover from these shocks
and continued to stagnate for the rest of the decade. By early 1989,
serious balance of payments and fiscal disequilibria developed, and the
authorities resorted to the accumulation of arrears with most external
creditors, including the Bank, which suspended its disbursements to the
country on April 18, 1989.
3.        In June 1989, a new administration led by President Alfredo
Cristiani assumed office and introduced a far-reaching economic reform
program emphasizing the reactivation of growth and the reduction of
absolute poverty as its top economic priorities, while initiating
negotiations with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in an
attempt to achieve a peaceful solution to the decade-long civil
conflict. Despite two severe setbacks -- a collapse of international
coffee prices in June 1989 and a major urban guerrilla offensive in
November 1989, the Government's economic program remained on course,
attesting to the strong commitment to reform by El Salvador's
policymakers. Soon after taking office, the Government also reinitiated
debt service payments to the Bank and other creditors, clearing all
overdue obligations to the Bank on January 31, 1990 and to the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) in February 1990. The Board of the
International Monetary Fund (IMP) approved an upper-tranche Stand-by
program for El Salvador on August 27, 1990, and a Paris Club agreement
was reached on September 17, 1990.
4.        With the exception of a US$65 million Earthquake Reconstruc-
tion Loan approved on September 15, 1987, and modified on July 18, 1990,
the Bank has not made any new loans to El Salvador since 1979. A
Country Economic Memorandum on El Salvador (No. 7818-ES) was circulated
to the Executive Directors in August 1989. The Government formally
requested a SAL to support its stabilization and adjustment program
during the 1989 Bank/Fund Annual Meetings.

PART I - THE ECONOMY
A. Background
5.        With a current population of 5.2 million and a land surface of
21,000 square kilometers, El Salvador is one of the most densely
populated countries in the Western Hemisphere. It has limited natural
resources and no remaining agricultural frontier. In the 1960s and
1970s, rapid real GDP growth averaging 5.4Z annually was made possible
by favorable agricultural commodity prices, an expanding regional market
for manufactured goods following the creation of the Central American
Common Market and an accomodating international financial environment.
Considerable improvements also took place in health, education and
literacy standards. Nevertheless, by the end of the 1970s, El Salvador
still remained a relatively poor country, with social indicators that
continued to rank among the lowest in Latin America.
6.        In 1979, El Salvador's simmering social and political
tensions, exacerbated by an inflexible political system, erupted into an
open civil war. At the same time, the external economic environment
deteriorated sharply with the second oil price hike, a steep decline in
world coffee prices, higher international interest rates and the
contraction of the regional market for manufactured goods, as the other
Central American trading partners experienced similar terms of trade
shocks. These events led to severe macroeconomic imbalances, resulting
in a drop of real GDP by 222 between 1978 and 1982. Economic stability
was partially restored after 1982, but efforts to reactivate growth
remained unsuccessful. In 1983-84, a stabilization program was carried
out with IMF Stand-by support, leading to substantial reductions in the
fiscal and balance of payments deficits. Fiscal retrenchment largely
was achieved, however, through reductions in public investment and
social sector expenditures, while the balance of payments gap was closed
through more restrictive trade policies and increased external transfer
inflows. This adjustment response did not augur well for future growth,
which averaged less than 2Z per annum for the rest of the decade.
7.        A massive outflow of Salvadorean emigrants after 1980
(estimated at one million, or almost 20? of the population) helped
relieve domestic population pressures and their remittances became an
increasingly important credit item in the balance of payments. Private
transfers, which represented less than 12 of GDP in 1980, have remained
above 42 of GDP since 1986. Official grants also increased
significantly, from less than 12 of GDP in 1980-81 to over 52 of GDP in
1986-89. A positive consequence of these inflows has been that El
Salvador's total external debt burden remained relatively low compared
to most other Latin American countries. (The total external debt
reached close to US$1.8 billion in 1989, representing 33% of GDP, while
total debt service represented 222 of exports (G&S) and 41 of GDP.)
Despite this low debt burden, the inward-oriented interventionist
policies of past administrations prevented a reactivation of economic
growth and maintained the economy's vulnerability to destabilizing



3
shocks. In early 1989, a bad coffee harvest and expansionary fiscal
policies led to a rapid decline in foreign exchange reserves and debt
service to external and internal creditors was halted; by mid-year.
total medium and long term external debt arrears reached US$165 million
and disbursements from the Bank and IDB had been suspended.
8.        The new Government led by President Alfredo Cristiani assumed
office in June 3989 and introduced a comprehensive economic
stabilization and structural adjustment program designed to create a
more market-oriented and private sector led economy, capable of rapid
sustained growth, while seeking to eliminate absolute poverty. The
achievement of a negotiated end to the civil conflict also represented a
top priority in the Government's policy agenda, and peace negotiations
with the guerrilla forces began in September 1989. Soon after the
program was introduced, however, the International Coffee Agreement
collapsed, leading to a 452 fall in El Salvador's principal commodity
export, and in November 1989, violence escalated, as the guerrillas
launched a major armed offensive that resulted in considerable human and
material losses. A further economic shock occurred in early 1990, when
changing aid priorities and budgetary constraints prompted a US$ 50
million reduction in USAID's economic assistance to El Salvelor. These
events seriously disrupted the incipient stabilization process, but the
Government's economic team remained in control and continued to pursue
its reform program.
9.        By December 31, 1989, the Government had succeeded in reducing
the stock of outstanding medium and long term overdue obligations from
US$ 165 million to USS 109 million, with the intention of eliminating
the remaining arrears by the end of 1990. Major economic reforms also
were initiated: by mid-1990, the exchange rate was unified and floated,
most non-tariff import barriers and price controls were eliminated and
most tariff rates were reduced below a maximum of 352, interest rates
and public sector prices were raised, major tax reform legislation was
passed through Congress and parastatal monopolies in the marketing of
sugar, coffee and grains were abolished. An emergency social program
was introduced to provide minimum incomes to the poor through a series
of rural public works and municipal construction projects. Peace
negotiations were resumed under United Nations auspices in April 1990,
with six rounds of negotiations completed through November 1990. In
August 1990, the IMF approved an upper-tranche Stand-by program for SDR
35.6 million, and in September 1990, a Paris Club agreement to
reschedule US$135 million in outstanding arrears and upcoming
obligations on favorable terms was concluded. Finally, on December 13,
1990, El Salvador became a signatory to the GATT.
B. Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
10.       The economic policy measures taken by the Government since
June 1989 have begun to yield important results: the Central Bank's
index of economic activity points toward a significant reactivation of
growth in 1990, with real GDP likely to increase by at least 2.52
(compared to growth rates of 1.62 and 1.12 in 1988-89). Agriculture and



4
commerce have been the main source of increased activity, with basic
grains production heading toward a record harvest during the 1990-91
season. This reflects the relative price corrections induced by more
flexible trade and exchange rate policies as well as favorable weather
conditions. In real effective terms, the Colon has depreciated b) 202
between December 1989 and November 1990.  Exports have responded
strongly to the trade measures: in the period from January to August
1990, the total value of merchandise exports increased by 11% compared
to the same period in 1989, with the volume of sugar exports increasing
by 882 and of coffee exports by 582 (which more than offsets the decline
in international coffee prices). The value of non-traditional exports
to countries outside Central America has been 602 higher over this
period.
11.       Merchandise imports also grew by 10% during the January-
September 1990 period, however, so that the current account deficit
(excluding grants) for the entire year may reach US$350 million
(compared to US$465 million in 1989). The strong growth of imports is
explained by the more liberalized trade regime and the faster than
expected reactivation of economic growth. Nevertheless, the overall
balance of payments situation has improved, as net international
reserves have risen strongly during the second and third quarters of
1990, in conformance with the IMF Stand-by targets. The main cause for
this improvement has been a substantial inflow of private capital and
remittances, attracted by an improved business climate, tighter domestic
credit policies and the liberalized exchange system.
12.       The deceleration of inflation appears to have contributed to
the improved confidence that motivated these inflows. The annual
inflation rate fell from a peak of 302 in April 1990 to 2OZ in October.
Furthermore, the annualized inflation rate during the six months ending
in October 1990 has been about 1OZ. During that period, the floating
Colon/US$ exchange rate rose by 52, while the six-month commercial
interest rate for colon deposits was maintained at 181, yielding an
annualized rate on the order of 82-92 in dollar terms. The monetary
aggregates, M-2 and M-3, grew by 242 and 25Z over the last 12 months
ending in September 1990, reversing the declining trend in real balances
over the preceding three years. Thi3 process of disinflation resulted
from the rigorous application of a restrictive monetary program, a
tighter fiscal policy stance, less expansive public sector wage
increases and an exceptional agricultural harvest.
13.       The fiscal deficit declined significantly during the first
nine months of 1990, partly as a result of the tax reforms introduced at
the beginning of the year, but primarily through reduced spending.
Current Central Government revenues increased by 222 during January-
September 1990 relative to the-revenues collected over the same period
in 1989, or roughly eqtal to the average inflation rate prevailing over
that period. In contrast, current Central Government spending increased
by only 5.6? in nominal terms, while capital spending declined by 9.6X.
This represents a 342 nominal decline of in the consolidated Central
Government deficit (excluding grants) or a reduction of about 1.3X of



5
GDP. The rest of the nonfinancial public sector is expected to yield a
small surplus of 0.12 of GDP. The authorities made important price
adjustments during the year for services provided by the public sector
enterprises, raising water and sewage service rates by 402 and 25%,
telephone connection fees by 142, and residential and commercial
electricity rates by 45Z and 30Z. In October 1990, the Government
responded to the current oil crisis by raising domestic consumer prices
of oil and derivatives an average of 43?, corresponding to an average
price of crude oil of US$31 per barrel. These deficit reducing measures
should yield an overall non-financial public sector deficit of about
3.62 of GDP (compared to 5.92 in 1989), which is consistent with the
1990 Stand-by targets. The main concern in this area, however, is that
tax revenues have remained below expected levels, so that the brunt of
the adjustment was borne by further cuts in spending, which is already
at very low levels.
14.       In summary, the economy has stabilized considerably during
1990, with output growing above projected levels. In view of the
ongoing Gulf crisis and still unsettled domestic conflict, this
stability could be fragile, however. The economy's positive performance
in 1990 was made possible by large inflows of private capital and
remittances to finance the additional imports that helped sustain the
higher output growth in a non-inflationary manner. A sudden revision of
the public's exchange rate and inflationary expectations, due to
unforeseen shocks, could lead to a rapid reversal of these flows. In
the event of such a reversal, the authorities will have to be prepared
to respond rapidly and decisively to prevent renewed destabilization. A
major step in this direction was taken with the adoption of a unified,
market-determined exchange system.  Equally important will be the
continued maintenance of sufficient fiscal and monetary control. The
ability to maintain such control will depend critically on the
Government's capacity to raise taxes and on allowing interest rates to
adjust quickly in response to market pressures.
PART II - THE GOVERNMENT'S ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
15.       The stagnation of the Salvadorean economy throughout most of
the 1980s was aggravated by adverse exogenous events, but the more
fundamental factors were the widespread structural weaknesses of the
economy and continuing civil strife. To reactivate economic growth, the
Cristiani administration initiated a major stabilization and structural
adjustment program in July 1989. This program aims to create a more
liberalized, private-sector led economy and focuses on reforms in the
external, fiscal, monetary, financial and agricultural sectors, with
special attention on poverty alleviation.



A. The External Sector
16.          As a small economy,  El Salvador's best prospects  for economic
growth lie in the expansion of international trade. Yet during the
1980s, the economy became more closed: merchandise exports declined by
about half in dollar terms between 1980 and 1989, and as a share of GDP,
from 302 in the 1970s to less than 102 in 1989. Another key problem is
the lack of export diversification: coffee accounts for over 50t of
total merchandise exports, which has kept the economy highly vulnerable
to international commodity price fluctuations. Despite the sharp
decline in merchandise exports, imports rose slightly in dollar terms
over 1980-89.   This was made possible by increased transfer inflows as
the economy increasingly relied on  'oreign assistance and the export of
labor services to balance the current account.

17.          The decline in exports  largely resulted from the collapse of
intra-Central American trade and the decline in commodity export prices.
By maintaining high import barriers, however, El Salvador prevented the
structural adjustments needed to reorient its exports from the regional
market toward third countries and to diversify its extra-regional
exports away from coffee. Tariffs and exchange controls represented the
most important trade barriers, while quantitative restrictions and other
non-tariff barriers have played a relatively minor role since 1987.
Export taxes also have not been important, except for coffee, sugar and
shrimp. In 1988, tariffs and other duties ranged from 12 to over 3002,
with an unweighted-average ad-valorem rate of 37Z. The highest rates
were applied to final consumer goods, averaging 59Z, while intermediate



7
and capital goods received 22?; see Table 2. The disparity in nominal
protection rates led to extremely high effective protection rates,
averaging over 100? for the manufacturing sector and rendering it
uncompetitive in third markets. The cascading pattern of import duties
also encouraged the use of capital inputs and intermediates at the
expense of labor, which constitutes El Salvador's most abundant factor
of production.

18.      To reduce the distortions caused by the high level and
dispersion of tariffs, the Government initiated a major trade reform in
September 1989 by eliminating all non-tariff duties, reducing all
tariffs to a maximum of 502 and raising the tariff floor to 52, with the
exception of wheat imports, which receive 12. Also, the number of
tariff categories was reduced from 25 to 7 rates. These reforms had the
effect of reducing the unweighted average rate of nominal protection
(derived from tariffs and other duties) from 372 to 20X. Equally
important is the reduction in tariff dispersion; the standard deviation
of rates fell from 43Z to 172. In April 1990, the tariff ceiling was
further reduced to 352, except for a limited number of luxury items
(referred to in Annex 3 of the Central American Tariff Code), comprising
less than 5Z of all tariff positions. This had the effect of further
reducing the unweighted average tariff rate to 182 and the standard
deviation to 14X. To continue the process of trade liberalization, the
Government has announced a schedule of annual adjustments to
progressively unify tariff rates toward a tariff floor of 102 and a
ceiling of 202, to be reached by end-June 1993.
19.       The anti-labor bias generated by the old tariff structure was
aggravated by import duty exemptions, mainly granted for imported inputs
and capital through a variety of incentive schemes intended to promote
industry, non-traditional exports and selected agricultural sectors.
These exemptions did little to prevent the stagnation of these sectors
and represented a significant fiscal loss; although the import-weighted



a
rate of all duties averaged 12.5Z in 1988, only 8.8t was actually
collected. To remove this source of distortions and fiscal losses, the
authorities eliminated most tariff exemptions (together with other tax
exemptions) in the second semester of 1989, by abolishing the special
incentive schemes for industry. In April 1990, the system of incentives
for non-traditional exports also was abolished and replaced by a simpler
system designed to resemble a drawback system. Under the new system,
eligible exporters receive a cash payment equivalent to 82 of the FOB
value of exports upon deposit of the foreign exchange receipts. (This
82 rate roughly corresponds to the average import content of non-
traditional exports (402), multiplied times the average tariff rate
(20%) prevailing at the end of 1989.) The only major tariff exemptions
remaining at the end of 1990 pertain to public sector imports. The
Government recognizes that these exemptions run counter to its reform
program, which relies heavily on private sector development, and intends
to eliminate most of them by mid-1991.
20.       With the recent tariff reforms, the Government also eliminated
most quantitative restrictions applied for other than health and
national security reasons: by mid-1990, only 62 tariff positions (out of
1700) were subject to import permit requirements (comprising about 112
of total 1989 merchandise imports) and 49 tariff positions required
export pc.imits (comprising 2.5% of total 1988 merchandise exports).
About half of the imports and exports subject to these permits consist
of agricultural products that are governed by PL-480 agreements with
USAID. The Government intends to eliminate most permit requirements for
products not covered by PL-480 agreements, such that by end-1992, at
most 16 tariff positions (0.7Z of 1989 imports) would require import
permits and 4 tariff positions (0-1Z of 1988 exports) would require
export permits. With respect to those products ruled by PL-480
agreements, the government intends to seek USAID's approval to replace
the import and export permits by a registration requirement.
21.       In parallel with the trade barrier reductions in mid-1989, the
Government also eliminated most price controls, which previously covered
aj,'roximately 240 products. Currently, only seven groups of products
are subject to price controls, comprising cement, wheat flour, instant
coffee, edible oils, sugar, cotton seeds and oil derivatives.
22.       Prior to July 1989, the authorities maintained a fixed
exchange rate policy, coupled with exchange controls.  Exchange
controls, consisting of import licensing and prior deposit requirements,
constituted the main non-tariff barrier to trade. In granting import
licenses, the Central Bank established a system of foreign exchange
allocation that favored imports of essential foodstuffs, medicines, raw
materials and capital goods in declining order of priority. With
manufactured goods last on the priority list, the system of exchange
controls reinforced the distortions created by the tariff structure.
Since mid-1989, the monetary authorities have progressively allowed the
exchange rate to become more market-determined and have eliminated
exchange controls. The exchange system was effectively unified in June
1990. Under the current system, export proceeds (except coffee) and



9
merchandise imports are transacted through the commercial banks, while
other transactions take place through freely operating foreign exchange
houses (Casas de Cambio), which were legalized in April 1990. Coffee
export proceeds and official payments must be transacted through the
Central Bank, which sets its rate as an average of the market-determined
rates prevailing in the Casas de Cambio and commercial banks. Since
June 1990, the spread between these two rates averaged less than 2?, and
the Government intends to continue managing the exchange rate in a
flexible and unified manner as stated in its Letter of Development
Policy.
B. Public Finances
23.       The fiscal deficit (before grants) of the consolidated non-
financial public sector progressively deteriorated since 1987 to almost
62 of GDP in 1989.  Mainly responsible for this deterioration has been
the steady decline in tax revenues collected by the central government,
from 13.32 of GDP in 1986 to 7.62 in 1989. This decline reflects two
important structural weaknesses of the tax system: a heavy reliance on
trade taxes, particularly on coffee export taxes, and a weak system of
tax administration that facilitates evasion. During 1980-87, the share
of coffee export tax revenues in total revenues averaged 232, but ranged
from 172 to 372, reflecting the volatility of coffee prices and domestic
coffee production. In 1989, coffee taxes declined to less than 6Z of
total tax revenues, due to a weather-related decline in production
followed by a sharp drop in international coffee prices.

24.      The decline in coffee taxes accounts for a large portion of
the recent fiscal revenue erosion. Also worrisome has been the erosion
of direct taxes and the sales (Stamp) tax. Various factors have
contributed to the government's inability to increase revenues from
these last two sources, including (i) limited administrative and
monitoring capacity, coupled with a high disparity in tax rates, (i )
inefficient tax enforcement, (iii) the proliferation of tax exemptions
granted through various incentive schemes, and (iv) a long lag between
the time when taxes fall due and are paid. The operating surplus of the
public sector enterprises also have fallen during the latter half of the
1980s, mainly as a result of inadequate pricing policies, thereby also
contributing to the weak fiscal situation, but not to the extent of the
tax revenue declines.

25.      With the decline in fiscal revenues, total expenditures of the
nonfinancial public sector fell significantly, from over 202 of GDP in
1986 to 162 in 1988. The cutback ir. expenditures largely was achieved
through a decline in public sector wages and through the squeezing of
public investment. Public sector investment, which had averaged 11X of
GDP during the early 1980s, fell to 4.42 during 1984-88, reaching a
decade low of 2.32 in 1988. This investment decline represents a
significant sacrifice of future growth.
26.      Total employment in the central government fell by 7.62 from
1981 to 1988, while the public enterprises maintained their labor force
more or less the same. The largest fall in public wage costs, however,
occurred through a decline in real wages, which fell by about 582 during
the same period. Despite the fall in real wages and public employment,
however, the total wage bill increased as a share of total public
current expenditures from 52Z in 1980-83 to 572 in 1985-88, while the
share spent on goods and services declined from 342 to 282. Over this



11
period, wage differentials within the public sector have shrunk by about
50%. While this has mitigated the impact of the real wage decline on
employees at the lower end of the wage scale, it has adversely affected
the public sector's ability to retain qualified personnel.
27.       The past decline in total spending also was accompanied by a
significant shift in the allocation of resources toward national defense
and public debt service and away from education, health and housing. In
1978-79 spending on national defense accounted for 9% of total
expenditures and debt service accounted for 4?. while during 1986-87,
these shares accounted for 202 and 21Z. Over the same period, spending
on infrastructure development fell from 19% to 9Z, and on social
programs from 40% to 24%, representing a 402 decline in real percapita
social welfare oatlays.
28.       Public spending on the social sectors and infrastructure has
fallen to extremely low levels, and further cuts would seriously
jeopardize El Salvador's future growth prospects and efforts to
alleviate poverty. The main fiscal adjustments, therefore, must be made
on the revenue side, through increased tax collection3. A strong effort
also needs to be made, however, to reallocate existing public resources,
both sectorally (toward targeted social services and investment) and
functionally (toward goods and services and away from salaries),
especially during the initial transition period when tax reforms are
still being introduced.
29.       To reverse the decline in tax revenues, the Government
introduced a major package of tax reforms that became effective in early
1990. These reforms were aimed mainly at simplifying the tax system to
reduce tax administration costs and raising the tax base. They included
(i) a reduction in the dispersion of personal and corporate income tax
rates, (ii) the elimination of low yielding excise taxes and export
taxes for sugar and shrimp, (iii) the elimination of the legal bases for
most tariff and tax exemptions, (iv) a reform of the coffee export tax
structure, and (v) the unification of the sales to 52. Preliminary
evidence for 1990 shows that these measures have been successful in
stopping the past tax erosion, with total tax revenues in 1990 estimated
at 8.3Z of GDP (compared to 7.6% in 1989). This increase fell short of
initial expectations, however, largely on account of a weak performance
in sales tax collections.
30.       In view of this disappointing tax performance, the Government
has recognized the need to quickly strengthen its tax enforcement
capabilities. To achieve that objective, it has defined a short term
program to (i) make the legal changes needed to abolish existing tax
loopholes, raise penalties for tax evasion and charge interest on
overdue tax payments, (ii) reorient tax audit procedures toward
increasing the coverage of audited taxpayers and devoting fewer
resources on the excessive scrutiny of individual cases, (iii) force the
commercial banks to remit tax payments to the Treasury in a more timely
manner and (iv) create a special task force within the Office of the
Finance Minister that would be responsible for monitoring the tax



12
enforcement effort. These measures should lead to a significant
improvement in tax collections from all sources, while improving the
basis for introducing a value-added tax.
31.       The Government intends to introduce a value-added tax to
replace the existing sales tax by mid-1992. This change is expected to
yield two major benefits: one is that the value-added tax has a far less
distortionary impact on production and consumption incentives and the
other is that it enhances the Government's ability to monitor taxpayers'
declarations. In preparation of the VAT, the authorities have developed
an action program to train and equip the personnel needed to administer
the VAT and to expand the number of taxpayers registered for the sales
tax. This program is being supported by technical assistance from IMF,
IDB and USAID.
32.       On the expenditure side, the Government is concerned about the
past declines in public investment and social sector expenditures
resulting from budgetary constraints. To help improve the allocation of
investment expenditures, the Government completed a public investment
review with technical assistance from UNDP in December 1990. To
facilitate higher public investment, public savings were increased
from -1.6Z of GDP in 1989 to an estimated -0.lZ in 1990, and a target of
1.71 has been incorporated into the 1991 ordinary public sector budget.
33.       Two other weaknesses in fiscal policy to be addressed are (i)
the Central Government's limited control over the budgets of
decentralized public sector institutions and enterprises and (ii) the
separation of the Central Government's ordinary budget from the
extraordinary budget, which mainly comprises funds from USAID and
finances most of the public investment program. To improve overall
expenditure control, the Government has submitted to the National
Assembly a draft law that would create a National Public Investment
System, which subjects all public investment projects to a common
evaluation and selection procedure and ranks these according to national
priorities. This system is expected to yield a considerable improvement
in public investment planning. Also, the Government intends to present
a consolidated (ordinary + extraordinary) budget to the Legislative
Assembly, starting with the budgeting exercise for fiscal year 1993,
which should yield better insight into public expenditure patterns and,
thus, improve the information basis for public spending decisions.
C. The Financial Sector
34.       The success of the structural adjustment program, which aims
to create a more open, less regulated and more private-sector-based
economy, depends critically on the existence of a sufficiently flexible
and competitive financial market. The process of structural reform
calls for a major reallocation of resources within the economy that, in
turn, requires adequate financial support for new investment
opportunities created by the realignment of relative prices and
incentives. In this context, a well-functioning financial system plays
a crucial role in mobilizing, both domestic savings and external



13
capital, and in allocating those financial resources toward the most
profitable activities.
35.       During the past decade, El Salvador's financial sector has
been extremely repressed and rendered incapable of fulfilling its
intermediary role in the adjustment effort. Nine commercial banks, a
mortgage bank and seven savings & loans associations represent the
backbone of the financial system. All except the mortgage bank were
nationalized in 1980 and placed under the control of the Central Bank.
In recent years, the financial situation of these institutions
deteriorated steadily, both because of bad management under state
control and as a consequence of the deteriorating economy. The high
operating costs of the commercial banks, which vary between 5 and 8Z of
total asset value, reflects their inefficient management, and in
December 1989, between 301 and 40% of the total commercial bank loan
portfolio was assessed as non-performing. (The privately-held mortgage
bank faced the same problems and was intervened by the monetary
authorities in October 1989.) The low quality of banking supervision in
large part is responsible for the weak state of the banking system. The
Superintendency of Banks currently constitutes a department within the
Central Bank, without independent legal standing or resources, and does
not have the capacity, either legal and material, to diagnose potential
banking problems, regulate banking risks and enforce remedial actions.
36.        Since the early 1980s, all commercial lending and deposit
rates have been set by the Central Bank, often on the basis of political
criteria rather than in response to market developments. This has led
to negative real rates over prolonged periods, which discourages
domestic financial savings and stimulates demand for non-productive
assets. As a result, between 1986 and 1989, total bank deposits fell by
almost 30Z in real terms, while the velocity of M-2 increased by 25Z.
Since the Central Bank fixes all interest rates, there are no financial
instruments through which it can accurately gauge overall market
liquidity. Also, it has made the Central Bank a focus of interest group
pressures, resulting in the proliferation of special credit lines with
differentiated interest rates that hamper effective monetary management
and distort the allocation of credit. In 198°, the credit granted
through the Central Bank rediscount lines accounted for almost one-third
of the total credit extended to the private sector through the banking
system.
37.       Monetary and Credit Policy Reform.  The medium term economic
program announced by the Cristiani Government includes the privatization
of the banking system as one of its key objectives. Recognizing that
the current system of interest rate controls and directed credit is
incompatible with a well-functioning privately-owned banking system, the
Government intends to progressively liberalize the financial market.
The ultimate goal is to eliminate all interest rate controls, but the
authorities feel that the liberalization process must take place
gradually. The reasons for choosing a gradual approach are (i) the
current fragility of the nationalized banks and savings & loans
associations, (ii) the underdevelopment of financial markets, which have



14
grown accustomed to fixed rates over the last decade, and (iii) the need
to spread out the fiscal costs of financial liberalization. Since the
Government is simultaneously carrying out major stabilization measures,
the authorities fear that too rapid a liberalization of interest rates
could cause unnecessary disruption of economic activity and further
weaken the commercial banks before they have been reformed and have
adapted to the workings of a freer market.
38.       A rapid interest rate liberalization could also hamper the
stabilization process itself, by raising the fiscal costs of reform
during the initial period when tax reforms are still underway: the total
cost of recapitalizing the commercial banks, savings & loans
associations and the Banco lipotecario is estimated at 3.13 billion 1990
Colones, of which 720 million Colones are expected losses of the savings
& loans associations, based on a 7 percentage point real interest rate
increase. This total recapitalization represents 82 of GDP, which is to
be financed through bonds issued by the Central Bank. Assuming that
these bonds mature in 10 years and have a 32 real interest rate, then
with zero inflation, the annual cost to the Central Bank would amount to
370 million colones or 0.91 of GDP. But if inflation were to remain at
15?, the real cost of servicing the debt would be front-loaded,
amounting to 1.82 of GDP during the first year and 0.4? of GDP for the
tenth year. By decontrolling interest rates more gradually in
anticipation of declining inflation rates, the total real cost of
restructuring the financial system remains the same, but the share borne
by the Government, especially during the initial period, would be lower.
39.       In this context, the Government has defined a three-part
action plan of gradual financial market liberalization that encompasses
(i) the progressive elimination of controls over different segments of
the financial market, (ii) the application of a systematic interest rate
adjustment rule to avoid negative real rates for those segments of the
market that are not yet decontrolled, and (iii) a reduction in the
Central Bank's financial intermediation role and provision of subsidized
credit.
40.       A first step to eliminate interest rate controls was taken in
September 1990, when the Central Bank eliminated such controls on
interbank loans. The Government intends to eliminate interest rate
controls on commercial bank deposits and loans with maturities of more
than one year by mid-1991, and on bank deposits with maturities of more
than 180-days by mid-1992. In 1993, all remaining interest rate
controls are to be eliminated.
41.       During the transition period until all interest rate controls
are eliminated, the Government intends to establish an interest rate
band for the controlled segments of the market, such that banks will be
free to set their deposit and lending rates within that band. The floor
of the interest rate band will serve as a lower limit for the 180-day
deposit rate (TIBP), while the ceiling of the band serves as an upper
limit for lending rates on transaction with maturities up to one-year
(TIBA). The Central Bank will review the interest rate floor at least



15
every semester, starting in January 1990, and .; just it if necessary so
that TIBP would not be less than the past annual inflation rate. The
floor would be at least equal to the past inflation rate plus one
percentage point by the third quarter of 1991, and to the inflation rate
plus two percentage points by the third quarter of 1992. (In view of
the rapid decline of inflation during the second half of 1990, the
Government may choose to define past inflation as the annualized
inflation rate over the preceding six months in setting the interest
rate floor during the first six months of 1991.) Beginning in January
1991, the ceiling of the interest rate band is to be set equal to the
interest rate floor (TIBP) plus an intermediation margin of 4 percentage
points. This intermediation margin is to be raised to 5 percentage
points by the third quarter of 1991, and to 6 percentage points by the
third quarter of 1992.
42.       Since December 1989, the number of rediscount credit lines
offered by the Central Bank, as well as the dispersion of interest rates
charged, has decreased. The Government intends not to create any new
lines financed from its own resources in addition to those that were in
place on October 1, 1990. Furthermore, by mid-1991, all new credits
extended by the Central Bank through its rediscount lines to
intermediary institutions are to be made at an interest rate not less
than the interest rate floor applicable to the 180-day deposit rate,
while the lending rate to the final user will be subject to the same
norms that apply to commercial loans. (Central Bank rediscount lines
financed by foreign assistance loans or grants with specific provisions
for onlending these funds at preferential rates may be exempt from this
general rule.)
43.       To facilitate a more competitive banking system, the Central
Bank intends to reduce the required reserve ratio from the current level
of 192 toward a target level of 152 by mid-1992 and to rely increasingly
on open market operation for purposes of controlling liquidity. This
measure has the added advantage of making the banks more attractive to
potential buyers.
44.       Institutional Reforms.   The first steps to restructure the
banking system were taken in the second half of 1989, when the
government conducted various studies with external technical assistance
to assess the solvency of the banking system and financial viability of
each of the nationalized banks. Based on these assessments, the
monetary authorities decided in February 1990 on a strategy to
recapitalize six of the nine commercial banks (of which two are to be
merged) and to liquidate the rest. In July 1990, the authorities began
closing the banks to be liquidated and transferred their assets to the
remaining banks. Finally, the Government prepared a package of three
draft laws with assistance from the Bank and IDB that provide the basis
for (i) recapitalizing the commercial banks and savings & loans
associations, (ii) reforming the Banking Superintendency and (iii)
privatizing the nationalized banks. This draft legislation was
submitted to the National Assembly in October 1990 and approved in
November 1990.



16
45.       According to the draft law, the recapitalization of banks is
to take place through a newly created fund, which will purchase the non-
performing bank debts at their face value in exchange for existing bank
debts to the Central Bank, and the remainder for tax-exempt Central Bank
bonds with a variable rate (such that the net yield equals the 6-month
deposit rate plus two percentage points) and a maturity of ten years.
In recapitalizing the banks, the Government's objective is to raise each
bank's net worth to at least 10% of the value of its total assets prior
to being sold to the public. Although the Government acquires ownership
of the non-performing portfolio, this portfolio will continue to be
administered by the banks for a small commission. At the same time, the
banks will be offered an incentive to recuperate the non-performing
assets or transform these into performing assets, through a fee
amounting to at least 10X of the amount recuperated. When a loan is
converted into a performing asset, the bank acquires ownership in
exchange for the counterpart bond emitted through the capitalization
fund.
46.       To promote widespread ownership, the law to privatize the
banks gives small sharehcoders and banking employees the opportunity to
purchase shares on a first-option basis for a period of 120 days after
the bank has been offered for sale. Furthermore, small shareholders may
have preferential access to credit for up to 100,000 Colones (or about
US$ 12,500) for this purchase, using the shares as collateral. Another
element in the law is the limitation on the percentage of shares in a
bank or set of banks owned by any one person, which cannot exceed 5Z.
(A higher limit of 20% has been set for ownership by multilateral
international institutions.) This limit was introduced to prevent
excessive concentration of ownership, but may have the drawback of
rendering bank ownership less attractive for potential investors. The
Government's assessment is that the introduction of this limit has
allowed a broader political consensus in favor of bank privatization,
which outweighs the potential drawbacks of this restriction.
47.       Under the new law, the Banking Superintendency obtains
independent legal standing from the Central Bank, as well as financial
independence. This represents a first institutional step to strengthen
the Superintendency. To improve the Superintendency's capacity to carry
out its supervisory, diagnostic and legal enforcement functions, the
Government also has prepared an action plan to train personnel, purchase
adequate equipment and review the operating procedures. To implement
this plan, the Superintendent has submitted an official request for
technical assistance to USAID, which has expressed interest in
supporting these actions, and the IMF is providing assistance through a
resident representative. (The adoption of this action plan and the
identification of a financing source for technical assistance were
conditions for Board Presentation of the SAL; see para. 93.)
48.       The Government intends to have completed the recapitalization
of at least two banks and initiated their sale by mid-1991. If these
banks have not been privatized 18 months after the initial solicitation,
a public auction will be held to speed up the sale. By the end of 1991,



17
the Government intends to have completed an action plan to recapitalize
and privatize the savings & loans associations and the mortgage bank, to
be implemented in 1992. The action plan to fortify the Banking
Superintendency is to be implemented in early 1991.
D. Agricultural Pricing and Marketing
49.       The coffee sector accounts for about one-third of El
Salvador's agricultural GDP, generates over half of the country's
merchandise exports and provides approximately 100,000 rural jobs.
During the 1980s, coffee production declined on average by 2.3Z per
annum, mainly as a result of a substantial appreciation of the real
exchange rate applicable to coffee, the decline in international coffee
prices, an outdated export tax structure and the inefficient commercial
operations of the Instituto del Cafe (INCAFE), the parastatal monopoly
in charge of coffee marketing. Other cash crops also were subject to
monopolized marketing, especially sugar (through the parastatal
INAZUCAR) and cotton (through the producers' cooperative, COPAL).
Guerrilla activity also had a disruptive effect on coffee production,
but this was minor in comparison to the disruption to cotton production.
50.       Domestic production of basic grains (maize, beans, rice,
sorghum), which represents the main source of food in El Salvador, did
not decline as much as the rest of agriculture during the 1980s, but its
economic situation also deteriorated dramatically, with real domestic
basic grains prices falling by about 50Z. On the consumer's side,
developments have been equally dismal; although grains imports increased
by 402 from 1978-80 to 1984-86, total food availability decreased by 20Z
during that period. The main factors responsible for this deterioration
are the appreciation of the exchange rate, a discriminatory tariff
structure that maintained basic grains prices artificially low relative
to manufactured products, incentive distortions caused through price
controls and the inefficient marketing operations of the state-owned
Instituto Regulador de Abastecimientos (IRA), which was primarily
responsible for regulating the domestic supply of grains and stabilizing
producer and consumer prices. The state agricultural development bank
(BFA) also intervened as a buyer and seller in basic grains, but to a
lesser extent than IRA.
51.       The Government's policy reform program aims to reduce the role
of the state in agricultural markets and to improve production
incentives by eliminating the past policy discrimination against
agriculture. In the coffee sector, three basic reforms have taken
place: coffee exports are transacted at the same exchange rate as other
sectors as of June 1990, while the coffee export tax structure was
reformed and the parastatal coffee marketing monopoly was eliminated in
December 1989. (The marketing monopolies of INAZUCAR and COPAL were
also eliminated at the end of 1989.) The previous coffee export tax
structure had been in place since the 1950s, which resulted in an
increasing tax burden over time. The current tax structure consists of
a straight 30t rate applied to the total export value in excess of US$45
per quintal (100 lbs.). Compared to the old tax system, the new one has



18
the advantages of lowering the average tax burden for the coffee
producer, while incorporating a rising marginal tax schedule that
stabilizes after-tax producer incomes, and being easier to administrate.
The basic grains sector benefitted from a similar set of reforms: IRA
ceased to intervene in the domestic grain market in 1989, domestic price
controls were suspended and tariffs on grain imports were raised toward
the average levels applicable to other imports. In the case of maize, a
price band mechanism was introduced to stabilize its domestic price in
dollar terms through a variable tariff structure yielding an average
nominal protection rate of 202. These reforms have significantly
improved the incentives facing coffee and basic grains producers and
contributed to the exceptional harvests expected for the 1990191 season.
52.      . To avoid distorting producer prices through cheap food aid,
the Government is seeking an agreement with USAID to ensure that all
imported grains (including donations) will be subject to the same tariff
and exchange rate regime as all other imports, with the exception of
food reserved for specifically targetted lower income groups. As part
of this agreement, the Government also is seeking to eliminate all
import and export permit requirements on grains covered by PL-480
covenants. Another important step to be taken in this area is the
divestiture of the assets (warehouses, mills, land) of the parastatal
marketing companies, (IRA, INCAFE and INAZUCAR). Studies to divest the
assets of IRA and ISIC (the parastatal coffee research institute) has
been completed with assistance for U-SAID, and their assets are to be
offered for sale by September 1991. At the same time, the Government
intends to have completed the necessary preparations for divesting the
assets of INCAFE, INAZUCAR and the marketing activities of BFA, by end-
1991, and to initiate their sale by mid-1992.
E. Poverty Alleviation
53.       A surprising feature of El Salvador's development record
during the 1980s is that basic social indicators generally do not seem
to have deteriorated much despite the economic and social crisis. For
example, infant mortality fell from 74 per 1000 births in 1980 to
57/1000 in 1988 and life expectancy rose from 58 in 1975 to 61 in 1986.
Nevertheless, El Salvador's social indicators continue to rank among the
worst in Latin America and the incidence of poverty remains very high.
Malnutrition among school age children is between 50Z and 75Z in the
poorest departments of the country. In 1988, one-third of the country's
urban population was estimated to live in extreme poverty (i.e., with
incomes that barely suffice to purchase a standard food basket yielding
2,200 calories per day), while another third earn incomes of at most
twice that amount. About 36Z of the adult population is illiterate.
54.       The poorest of the poor are concentrated in the rural areas.
The rural/urban split of the population is approximately half and half,
but 74Z of all persons in the lowest quintile of the income distribution
live in rural areas. The same uneven distribution is also observed in
other social indicators; For example, illiteracy is 50Z higher in rural
than in urban areas and the shares of rural households without running



19
water is 722, and with dirt floors is 802, as compared to share of 62Z
and 322 for urban households. Among the rural poor, 702 of those in the
poorest quintile are engaged in basic grains agriculture (primarily
corn), while the rest are informally employed in industry (9X) and
services (122). Among the urban poor. 50? of those in the lowest income
quintile are employed in services and commerce, 252 in industry and the
rest in agriculture. While El Salvador's average real income per capita
declined by a cumulative 17? between 1981 and 1989, the real incomes of
the poor are likely to have declined even more, as minimum wages and
basic grains prices did not keep pace with aggregate inflation.
55.       On the consumers' side, the decline in real basic grains
prices cushioned the impact of declining real incomes. It is estimated
that the poorest half of the population spends about 70X of its income
on food, with basic grains as the main item in their consumption basket.
A reversal of the declining trend in grains pricies, therefore could
worsen the real incomes of those poor groups not engaged in agriculture.
On average, the rural poor can be expected to gain from rising
agricultural prices, since must are directly or indirectly engaged in
that sector, but the urban poor would be affected adversely by rising
grains prices.
56.       To reduce the incidence of absolute poverty, the Government
has designed a set of measures as part of its structural adjustment
program, with the aim of providing a safety net for the most vulnerable
groups of society in the short term and of improving their human capital
in the long term. As discussed below (Part III, Section C), the
Government's adjustment program is expected to have an overall positive
impact on poverty alleviation, primarily by raising the average incomes
of the poorest members of society. To provide minimum incomes to the
chronic poor and those adversely affected by the economic reforms, the
Government had introduced several rural public works projects in the
provinces of Oriente and Chalatenango and initiated locally managed
construction projects in 239 rural and urban municipalities, both as
part of a short term Social Emergency Program. The Government, with IDB
assistance also has finalized preparations for introducing a three-year
Social Investment Fund (SIF), as a more flexible mechanism for
channeling donor funds toward urgently needed projects. The creation of
the SIF was approved by the National Assembly on October 31, 1990, and
will begin operations in early 1991, initially with domestic resources
to be supplemented by external concessionary funds from the IDB and
donors.
57.       To improve the nutritional status of the most vulnerable
groups, particularly children under 12 years and lactating mothers, the
Government has already identified the target population groups to
receive assistance. Following up on this initial step, three pilot
projects, identified in a strateg,y report prepared jointly by RUTA, the
World Food Program and Government staff, are to be introduced over the
course of 1991 (MIPLAN, La Ayuda Alimentaria en El Salvador: Elementos
para una Estrategia, October 10, 1990). These projects involve (i) the
distribution of nutritionally fortified cookies to primary



20
schoolchildren, (ii) the distribution of weaning formula through health
posts and (Iii) the distribution of food coupons. The Government has
finalized the preparations for the pilot project involving fortifled
cookies and will begin implementation when the current school year
starts. If the pilot project proves sucessful, the project will be
expanded by end-1991 to one-third of the 78 municipalities identified as
having the worst incidence of malnutrition, and expanded to the rest of
these municipalities by mid-1992. The other two pilot projects will be
initiated in the latter half of 1991 and early 1992, and will follow the
same expansion pattern if proven successful. Implementation of these
nutrition projects will be closely monitored as part of the proposed SAL
conditionality (paras. 93-95). The Government also hopes to phase out
ongoing food-for-work programs, which have proven inefficient, and use
those resources for cash-for-work programs and to supplement the
preceding targetted nutrition programs. This step still requires the
approval of the World Food Program, which donates the largest share of
these resources.
58.       To increase the human capital of the poor, the delivery of
basic social services needs to be greatly improved, particularly in the
health and education sectors. A critical bottleneck in this area has
been the overall decline in public sector resources devoted to social
sector services; from 3.31 of GDP on education and 1.52 on health in
1978 to shares of 2% and 0.7Z in 1988 and an estimated 1.6% and 0.5% in
1989. The Government seeks to shift public expenditures toward these
sectors, with special emphasis on the priority areas of primary health
care and education, but it has only had limited success for far. The
share of the 1991 budgeted expenditures devoted to health and education
is 23.32 of the total budget, which is slightly above the 22.9% devoted
to these sectors in 1989 but below the 25.51 budgeted for 1990, as a
result of overall fiscal constraints. (The share budgeted for defense
declined over those three years, from 24.3% in 1989, to 20.52 in 1990
and 17.822 for 1991.) The overall pattern of expenditures still remains
unclear, however, for lack of adequate information on extraordinary
budget expenditures. Also, a mere reorientation of resources toward the
social sectors will have limited benefits if it is not accompanied by
institutional improvements in the overly centralized line ministries
that administer these resources.   To address this problem, the Miguel
Kast Foundation has assisted the Government in designing a plan to
decentralize the functions of the Education Ministry (a similar plan is
to be prepared for the Health Ministry). Following these initial steps,
the Government intends to decentralize both ministries by shifting major
management responsibilities for personnel, supplies, accounting and the
monitoring of statistics to the regional level. This strategy is being
designed in close cooperation with the Bank and its implementation is to
begin in the second half of 1991, with the support of a proposed Bank
Social Sector Rehabilitation Loan.



21
F. Medium Term Prospects and Financing Plan
59.       El Salvador's economy has strong potential for achieving rapid
growth over the next decade. This positive assessment is based on three
fundamental factors: (i) the important policy reforms currently being
implemented to improve the structure of incentives and raise
productivity, (ii) the low external debt overhang, and (iii) the fact
that current output levels are extremely low by historical standards.
Until the domestic civil conflict is settled, however, this growth
potential cannot be fully realized. The chances for a peaceful
resolution of this conflict continue to be better now than they have
been in the past, but the progress made so far in the negotiations has
been slow. The Government's short run stabilization objectives, which
aim to achieve single digit annual inflation by 1992, also will place a
constraint on growth over the next two years.
60.       The Government's recent and intended adjustment measures,
nevertheless, will have a significant impact in the short run and in
preparing the ground for faster growth when the political situation
stabilizes. An indicative example is given by the strong response to
improved incentives observed in the agricultural sector in 1990. This
sector should continue to provide an important source of growth in the
medium term. The announced trade policy and agricultural pricing
reforms should help the recovery of key agricultural sectors from the
past depressed levels and gradually encourage the exploitation of export
opportunities for non-traditional agricultural products to replace the
less dynamic traditional products.
61.       The manufacturing sector represents one of the most promising
sources of growth in the longer term, in view of El Salvador's proximity
to the US market, highly competitive real wage levels and abundant labor
supply, relative to land and other natural resources. The reduced anti-
export and anti-labor bias resulting from the recent and intended trade
policy reforms, should improve the international competitiveness of this
sector considerably and encourage employment. Nevertheless, growth in
this sector is likely to remain modest in the medium term, as investors
may adopt a wait-and-see attitude with respect to future political
developments and the permanence of the recently introduced policy
reforms before committing significant amounts of capital.
62.       The gradual liberalization of interest rates together with the
strengthening of the banking system should have important productivity
enhancing effects in the medium term, and render the economy less
susceptible to destabilization through short term capital movements.
Although private agents may be reluctant to rapidly increase investment
until the uncertainties referred to above are -esolved, the reduced
distortions in the financial market should encourage a more efficient
allocation of existing resources, thus raising productivity levels.
63.       The oil price shock caused by the current Gulf crisis
represents a key uncertainty for 1991, even though it did not have a
major destabilizing impact in 1990. Prior to the Gulf crisis, oil and



22
derivatives imports were projected at US$ 100-110 million in 1990 and
1991. Based on revised oil price projections, the import bill is
estimated to increase above the originally projected level only by about
US$15 million in 1990, but by US$53 million in 1991, before declining
again to pre-crisis projected levels. The figure for 1991 is highly
tentative, however, and based on an oil price of US$25 per barrel of
crude. For every US$1 increase In the annual average price of oil, El
Salvador's import bill would rise by US$5 million or 0.1Z of GDP. The
increased import bill can be partly financed through the San Jose oil
facility, whereby Venezuela and Mexico have agreed to extend medium term
credit for up to 202 of their oil exports to Central America. Since
less than 10% of El Salvador's existing external debt.is at variable
interest rates, the indirect impact of the oil shock on the debt
servicing accounts of the balance of payments should remain small.
64.       Internally,  the Government passed th;ough the higher oil
price to consumers, thus avoiding any direct negative fiscal impact.
The oil price rise is projected to generate a once-and-for-all increase
of 52 in the domestic CPI, distributed over the course of the following
5 months, but should not reverse the underlying deflationary tr0nd, as
the authorities are expected to continue their tight fiscal and monetary
policy stance.
65.       Following the successful implementation of its reform program,
the Government will have established a positive track record by 1993, by
which time a peace settlement is expected to have been achieved. This
should have a strong growth-boosting effect. Agriculture would
experience an upswing, particularly in cotton, when lands left idle as a
result of the civil conflict are brought back into production. A surge
in manufacturing activity would be expected, as the private sector gains
confidence, repatriates former flight capital and increases spending.
The cessation of hostilities, moreover, will allow existing resources
currently devoted to defense and damage repair to be reoriented toward
more productive activities and needed infrastructure. Under this
scenario, real GDP growth should rebound to the 5Z-6Z levels observed in
earlier periods by the mid-1990s.
66.       The 1990-95 financing requirements for this scenario are shown
in Table 5, along with the likely sources. Projected financing through
unidentified sources is small, partly as a result of the more flexible
exchange rate management and adjustment policies pursued by the
Government. Official funds remain the key financing source. USAID's
Economic Support Fund grants are projected to fall from the 1989 levels,
but its Development Assistance grants remain constant. The projections
include a US$135 million rescheduling of outstanding arrears and
upcoming payments on concessionary terms agreed to at the Paris Club in
September 1990. This is expected to facilitate the rescheduling of an
additional US$45 million of bilateral debts on similar terms, while
other bilateral funds are expected to increase after a peace settlement
is achieved.  Multilateral lending is mainly expected for the IMF, IDB,
CABEI and IBRD. Private financing remains small, with financial
institutions and private non-guaranteed lending each projected to be



23
about US$10 million in 1993, and then growing in line with GDP.
Conforming with the Government's policy of improving relations with its
creditors, no financing through arrears is projected.

67.       El Salvador's weak creditworthiness position in the late 1980s
was the result of poor policies and political instability, which led to
a weak balance of payments position and the buildup of arrears. The
adjustment measures taken by the Government since assuming office in
July 1989 have helped to reduce the external financing gap. Further,
the clearance of arrears to the Bank and the IDB in early 1990,
agreement on an upper-tranche IMF program and a Paris Club rescheduling
agreement also have enhanced the country's creditworthiness. The future
creditworthiness of El Salvador will depend on the success of the
authorities in closing the fiscal gap and, in particular, on their
ability to expand the tax base. The adoption of a more flexible system
of exchange rate management should result in increased remittance
inflows through formal channels. The Government will need to generate
the necessary fiscal surplus in domestic currency to tap these flows
without excessive monetary expansion. The other critical factor
determining the country's future creditworthiness is the ability of the
authorities to end the civil conflict.
68.       The country's external debt indicators will initially worsen,
due to the real devaluation that has taken place, before improving. The
ratio of total debt service to exports (G&S) is expected to fall to 182
by 1995, from 221 in 1988 and 31Z in 1989, while the ratio of total debt
to GDP remains around 39Z during 1990-1995, before gradually declining.
Since El Salvador's bilateral debt is mostly on concessional terms



24
(about 52Z of total external debt is concessional) and commercial debt
is small (less thae 72 of total debt), the share of debt service to
multilateral financial institutions in total debt service is projected
to increase from 432 in 1989 to almost 602 in 1995, although the
multilaterals' share in total debt increases more modestly, from 452 in
1989 to 51? in 1995. The Bank Group's share of total debt is projected
to increase from 102 to 11X over 1989-95, while its share of debt
service increases from 1O2 to 14Z. However, debt service to the Bank
Group as a share of total exports would be declining, from 3.2S in 1989
to 2.62 in 1995. As creditworthiness indicators improve after 1995, El
Salvador should be able to finance transitory balance of payments gaps
increasingly through commercial borrowing.
III. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. General
69.       The Structural Adjustment Loan is proposed in support of the
Governmer.t's 1991-92 action program of economic adjustment and recovery.
In prepa7.Ation of the loan, an identification mission visited El
Salvador in April 1990 and a pre-appraisal mission visited in August
1990. Appraisal took place in October 1990. Negotiations were held in
Washington, D.C., during December 18-19, 1990. The delegation from El
Salvador was headed by Minister Mirna Lievano de Marques, of the
Ministry of Planning. The following section describes the components of
the SAL program, which are summarized in Annex IV. Annex V contains the
Government's Letter of Development Policy addressed to the Bank. The
Supplementary Data Sheet is provided in Annex III.
70.       The proposed loan of US$75 million equivalent would be
disbursed in three equal tranches over a period of 18-24 months. Its
objective is to facilitate the economic adjustments triggered by the
policy actions that have already taken place since mid-1989 and to
support the further policy actions intended during 1991. The SAL also
is needed to help the Government overcome three important adverse
developments during the last year that could derail the adjustment
program. These are the decline in the price of coffee, the reduction in
economic assistance from the United States and, most recently, the rise
in international oil prices. These three factors have created an
additional external financing gap of approximately US$140 million p.a.
The Government's program is also being supported by the IMF, through an
SDR 35.6 million upper-tranche Stand-by program, and by the IDB, through
a US$60 million Global Multisectoral Credit Loan. The IMF program
focuses primarily on aggregate macroeconomic performance issues and
targets, while the IDB loan focuses on financial sector reforms. Close
cooperation with the IMF and IDB has been essential to ensure the
consistency of this operation.



25
71.       The US$75 million equivalent loan would represent about US$7.2
per capita p.a., assuming it is disbursed over 2 years, and it would
meet about 8? of El Salvador's gross external financing requirement for
1991-92. The loan size appears sufficient to help the authorities
overcome the temporary payments imbalances occasioned by the recent
reform measures that are beginning to take effect and by adverse
external developments such as the fall in coffee prices, reduced U.S.
economic aid and the current oil price hike. By signalling the Bank's
strong support for the Government's promising program, the loan should
help attract additional donor resources in the future.
B. Program to be Supported
72.       The proposed SAL would support the Government's reform program
and maintenance of a consistent macroeconomic policy framework, with
special focus on trade policy, fiscal policy, monetary and financial
sector reform, agricultural pricing policy and poverty alleviation
measures. As a global condition for future tranche releases it is
understood that the reform measures already taken would not be reversed
and that the Government would make such policy adjustments as would be
needed to maintain the stabilization program on track in response to
unforeseen future developments.
Trade Reform Actions
73.       El Salvador currently has the most liberal trade policy regime
in Central America. Nevertheless, the authorities recognize the need to
open the economy further and diversify its export base by eliminating
remaining trade impediments and incentive distortions (paras. 18-20).
As part of this process, El Salvador finalized negotiations to accede
GATT and became a member in December 1990.
74.       The Government adjusted all tariff rates within a range of 5Z-
35?, with the exception of tariffs on wheat imports. These still
receive a tariff of 1?, which is to be raisew. to 5? by June 1991. Also,
the Government announced a schedule of calenderized steps whereby the
tariff range will be progressively reduced toward a maximum of 20? and a
minimum rate of 10? to be reached by June 1993. According to this
schedule, the tariff ceiling will be reduced to 30X in June 1991, to 25Z
in June 1992, and to 20? in June 1993, while the tariff floor will be
raised to 7? in June 1992 and to 10? in June 1993. An exception will be
made for textile, leather and shoe imports, whose tariffs will be
adjusted according to the same schedule, but with a one year lag to
allow a more gradual adjustment process. Also, the Government has
presented to the Bank a schedule for eliminating the remaining import
and export permit requirements that still apply for reasons other than
internationally recognized health and security considerations. In
accordance with this schedule, the Goverment further eliminated import
permit requirements on 26 tariff positions (leaving 36 subject to
permits; see para. 20) and export permit requirements on 6 tariff
positions (leaving 43) in the fourth quarter of 1990. These steps
constituted conditions for Board presentation of the loan.



26
75.       Continued adjustment of tariff rates and further removal of
export and import permits according to the Government's announced
program will be conditions for release of the SAL's second and third
tranches. Also, prior to second tranche release, all imports other than
investment goods carried out by autonomous public sector institutions
(which do not compete with private sector activities) would be subject
to the same tariffs as private imports. The remaining exemptions are to
be phased out once the Government has reviewed public sector pricing
policies and public sector prices are more flexibly determined. By
third tranche release, import permits should not be required for more
than 16 tariff positions (not including 8 tariff positions covered by
PL-480 agreements with USAID) and export permits would not be required
for more than 4 tariff positions (not including 12 tariff positions
where agreement with USAID is required); paras. 93-95. The Bank will be
in contact with the Government and USAID to review the progress made in
negotiations to eliminate permits on items imported under PL-480.
Public Finances
76.       To ensure the sustainability of the Government's adjustment
program, measures to improve the collection of taxes without raising the
rates are critically needed (paras. 23-25). The Government has
presented to the Bank a set of actions to improve tax enforcement and
expand the base of registered taxpayers. These actions include (i) a
directive sent to the commercial banks to remit tax payments to the
Treasury in less than 2 weeks, (ii) the presentation of a list of laws
to be changed to eliminate legal tax loopholes and to increase the
penalties for tax evasion or late payment, and (iii) a decision to
create a task force within the Office of the Finance Minister in charge
of monitoring tax enforcement. The Government also has decided on an
action plan for introducing a value-added tax to replace the sales tax
by June 1992. This plan was elaborated with technical assistance from
the IMF and USAID. The Bank will monitor the progress made in the
implementation of both programs as a condition for second tranche
disbursement. Prior to third tranche release, a value-added tax system
should be operating in place of the sales tax.
77.       The decline in public investment in recent years places a
constraint on El Salvador's long term growth potential. To enable an
adequate level of public investment expenditures without violating
overall budget limitations, the Government needs to increase its public
savings. The appraisal mission reviewed the 1991 Ordinary Budget sent
to the Legislative Assembly in September 1990 and confirmed that it is
consistent with a public savings target of 1.7Z for 1991. Compliance
with this savings target will be considered during the macroeconomic
review process that will precede each future tranche release as a
criterion for evaluating whether the overall reform program remains on
track.
78.       The Bank's assessment during appraisal of the loan was that
the Finance Ministry's ability to ensure that the expenditure and
savings targets of the total nonfinancial public sector could be met was



27
extremely limited due to lack of adequate information on spending
commitments incurred through the extraordinary budget and for lack of
jurisdiction over the decentralized public institutions. To improve
this situation, the SAL would support the regular preparation of a
consolidated budget, combining the ordinary and extraordinary budgets,
to be presented to the Legislative Assembly, beginning with the fiscal
budget for 1993. Presentation of such a budget is a condition for third
tranche release.
Monetary Policy
79.       To complement the Government's flexible exchange rate
management, flexibility in interest rates and reduction in direct state
intervention in the financial market are crucial for maintaining
adequate macroeconomic control and enabling a well-functioning
competitive financial system. Conforming with this objective, the
Government intends to have eliminated all controls on commercial
interest rates by January 1993. To facilitate the transition toward a
completely liberalized system, the SAL would support the Government's
program of gradual financial market liberalization, which focuses on (i)
the progressive elimination of controls on different segments of the
market, (ii) the establishment of a gradually widening interest rate
band within which commercial interest rates are free to move, and (iii)
the elimination of distortions through credit subsidization and high
reserve requirements.
80.       In September 1990, the Government eliminated interest rate
controls on interbank loans, as a first step toward the overall
elimination of interest rate controls. The elimination of controls on
all commercial lending and deposit rates for operations with a maturity
of more than one-year, together with a public announcement by the
Government that all interest controls would be eliminated by 1993, would
be a condition for second tranche disbursement. The elimination of
controls on deposit rates with maturity of more than 180-days would be a
condition for third tranche release.
81.       The interest rate on 180-day deposits and the lending rate for
credit transactions of up to one year are used as reference rates by the
Central Bank and would be subject to a gradually widening interest rate
band until 1993. As of January 1, 1990, the floor of this band was
above the annualized inflation rate over the preceding six months (when
the Government's deflationary program took effect), while the interest
rate ceiling was 4 percentage points above the interest rate floor. The
Government will review these rates with the Bank, using its interest
rate adjustment schedule (described in para. 41) as a reference, and
adjust them if necessary at least every semester, and more frequently if
required by macroeconomic circumstances, taking into account capital
movements, the evolution of real balances and other market indicators.
Timely adjustment of interest rates as needed in response to changing
market developments will be an important criterion in the Bank's
assessment of (i) the overall macroeconomic policy framework that would
precede each tranche release and (ii) whether the program is on track.



28
82.       For a more efficient financial intermediation, it is important
that credit subsidization be eliminated. As a condition for second
tranche release, therefore, the interest rate charged by the Central
Bank on its short term rediscount lines that depend on own resources
should be not less than the interest floor, TIBP (paras. 41-42). The
only exception would be credit rediscount lines financed with external
assistance grants or loans, which carry specific provisions that these
funds be onlent at preferential rates.
Financial Sector Institutional Reforms
83.       On October 30, 1990, the Government submitted to Congress a
package of draft laws to recapitalize and privatize the nationalized
banks and savings & loans associations, and to reform the Banking
Superintendency. These laws were approved by the Legislative Assembly
in November 1990. A well-functioning banking system is a critical
element of the structural adjustment program initiated by the
Government, and the SAL would support the recapitalization of the banks
and the rehabilitation of the Superintendency in conformance with these
laws. Prior to Board Presentation of the SAL the Government issued the
legal regulations needed to implement the law to recapitalize the Banks,
which contains the following elements: each bank is to be recapitalized
to raise its net worth to at least 102 of its asset value, the bonds
issued to recapitalize the banks yield a variable rate equal to TIBP
plus two percentage points and the banks will receive a commission to
rehabilitate non-performing loans of at least 10? of the amount
recuperated. Also, the Government has finalized an action program of
staff training and equipment procurement to strengthen the newly
independent Superintendency (para. 47), with technical assistance from
the Fund and financing from USAID.
84.       Since the public authorities are reducing their direct
intervention in the financial system and intend to decontrol interest
rates in 1993, the banks and Superintendency must be rehabilitated as
soon as possible so that they may be in a position to perform
satisfactorily in a more competitive environment (para. 48). Initiation
of sale of at least two commercial banks, adequate progress in the
implementation of the Superintendency's rehabilitation program and the
cempletion of a plan to recapitalize and sell the savings & loans
associations and the Banco Hipotecario are conditions for second tranche
release, while the implementation of this last plan represents a
condition for third tranche release.
Agriculture Sector
85.       An important constraint on the agricultural sector has been
the discriminatory treatment it received through the trade policies
pursued by past governments. The Government is correcting this problem
by incorporating the agricultural sector into the same trade and
incentive regime applicable to other products. Much of the
conditionality in this area, therefore, is already being addressed in
the trade policy conditions for SAL disbursement (paras. 73-75). With



29
respect to basic grains, import and export permit requirements are to be
eliminated for rice, sorghum and yellow maize as a condition for second
tranche release. In the special case of white maize and beans, import
permit requirements will be eliminated if an agreement is reached among
the Central American countries to, either, adopt a uniform basic grains
policy or permit the application of variable tariffs on intra-regional
imports of basic grains, while export permits are to be eliminated once
the Government's targetted nutrition programs (described in para. 57)
are fully operating. With respect to products covered by PL-480
agreements, import and export permit requirements are to be eliminated
by third tranche release, unless maintaining such requirements is part
of the agreements.
86.       The other important step in the agricultural sector supported
by the SAL is the divestiture of assets of the parastatal marketing
companies, whose monopoly rights already have been abolished and which
now constitute a fiscal burden (paras. 51-52). As a condition for Board
presentation, the Government has completed an action plan to reform IRA
and sell its assets. The implementation of this plan, along with the
completion of an action plan to reform and sell the assets of INAZUCAR,
INCAFE and the marketing activities of BFA, are conditions for second
tranche disbursement. Finally, inititating the sale of the assets of
INAZUCAR, INCAFE and BFA's marketing activities constitutes a condition
for third tranche disbursement.
Poverty Alleviation
87.       The 3-year Social Investment Fund recently approved by the
Legislature should serve as a safety net to mitigate the possible
adverse impact of the structural adjustment program on the most
vulnerable groups. The SIF is being supported through the IDB, while
the SAL's conditionality would focus on three specifically targeted
nutritional assistance programs and on public expenditures patterns in
the education and health sectors (paras 57-58). Prior to Board
presentation, the Government completed preparations for a pilot project
to distribute nutritionally fortified cookies to schoolchildren, which
is to begin in March 1991. Based on the pilot project results, the
Government will expand the fortified cookies program to to about one-
third of the 78 municipalities with the highest incidence of
malnutrition and initiate a pilot project to distribute weaning formula
through health posts by end-1991. The expansion of the cookies program
to all 78 municipalities, the expansion of the weaning formula
distribution program to one-third of these municipalities and the
initiation of a pilot project to distribute food coupons to the poor
would be conditions for third tranche disbursement.
88.       The continuous decline in real public expenditures devoted to
health and education threatens to constrain future growth by limiting
human capital formation (para. 58). Fundamental reforms of the
Ministries, needed to improve the delivery of primary health and basic
education services, will be supported by a Bank Social Sector
Rehabilitation Project that is scheduled to be presented to the Board in



30
CY91. At the same time, it is important that these sectors not be
underfinanced. The Government wi'l present a draft 1992 Budget for
review with the Bank prior to submission to the National Assembly.
Agreement with the Bank on the sectoral distributiout of planned
expenditures in the 1992 Budget, with special attention to basic health
and primary education, would be a condition for second tranche release.
C. Poverty Impact
89.       The Government's reform program is expected to contribute
significantly toward reducing absolute poverty, even in the short run.
Most important in this respect are the exchange rate and tariff-policy
reforms, which reduced the distortions in producer prices for basic
grains, and the elimination of most price controls and IRA, which had
represented major sources of inefficiency. As described earlier, three-
fourths of the persons in the lowest income quintile live in rural areas
and they are mainly engaged in basic grains agriculture. The improved
incentive environment in this sector, which already appears to be
bearing fruit in terms of higher production, is expected to be
especially beneficial to rural incomes. The improved profitability of
coffee production resulting from the exchange rate measures and export
tax reductions also should benefit the poor, given that this sector is a
major source of employment for low wage workers. The urban poor, on the
other hand, may stand to lose from higher food prices. This problem,
however, is being partly addressed by the creation of the Social
Investment Fund and specifically targetted nutrition programs. These
social sector actions are also expected to act as a safety net for poor
urban workers who may be adversely affected by adjustments in the
industrial sector as the level of protection is reduced. In the medium
term, however, these workers should also experience an income gain
through the unification of the tariff schedule, which reduces the bias
against labor in favor of capital inputs.
90.       The raising of the interest rate to reflect higher inflation
and, eventually, the higher cost of capital in a capital-poor economy,
should also benefit labor by raising incentives for producers to switch
toward more labor-intensive techniques. This process would be
reinforced by the creation of a less repressed, more competitive private
banking system that would give smaller industries, which generally are
more labor intensive and currently are rationed out of the financial
markets, better access to credit markets.
91.       The Government's tax reforms and the proposed introduction of
the VAT render the legal tax structure less progressive. This is
compensated, however, by the raising of the minimum taxable levels of
income and wealth, which should benefit lower-middle income persons and
small businesses. Marginal tax rates prior to the reforms were often
unrealistically high, with the effect that they were largely evaded,
rendering the nominal progressivity of the tax system meaningless. By
bringing down those rates, eliminating tax exemptions and simultaneously
strengthening tax enforcement, it is expected that more revenues will be
collected from higher income groups. Those living in absolute poverty,



31
on the other hand, should remain unaffected by the income and wealth tax
reforms, since they are generally not registered taxpayers. While the
VAT is not progressive, it is less regressive than the sales tax, which
it replaces, thus representing an improvement from the viewpoint of
consumers.
92.       Finally. it is worth noting that the short term stabilization
efforts of the Government on balance should have a beneficial impact on
poverty by virtue of the fact that the poor are more vulnerable to real
income erosion through inflation than the relatively better off. Lower
income groups generally hold a higher proportion of their wealth in
money, given that they are less able, both materially and as a product
of lesser education, to diversify their wealth into other productive
assets. Also, the wages of low-skill workers in the informal sector are
likely to be the least responsive to inflation. The groups that stand
to lose as a result of the disinflationary measures introduced by the
Government are medium income workers in the formal sector that may be
laid off during the adjustment process.
D. Proposed Tranche Conditionality
93.       The proposed loan would be disbursed in three equal tranches
of US$25 million each. The first tranche would be disbursed upon
effectiveness. There are no special conditions for effectiveness other
than those specified under the General Conditions applicable to the
Bank's Loan Agreement. Before presentation of the loan to the Executive
Directors, the Government has taken the following actions:
(a) unified the exchange rate and adjusted all import tariff rates
within a range of 5Z and 35?, except for tariffs on wheat
imports. Also, the Government has publicly announced a
schedule of annual tariff adjustments, whereby all tariffs are
to be brought within a range of 10? and 202 by June 1993
(except for textiles, leather and shoe imports, whose tariffs
would lie in this range by June 1994). Finally, the Government
has removed import and export permit requirements on 32 tariff
items and presented the Bank with a schedule to remove most of
the remaining permit requirements (para. 74);
(b) presented to the Bank a satisfactory action plan to improve tax
enforcement and expand the base of registered taxpayers. Also,
the authorities have adopted an action program satisfactory to
the Bank to replace the sales tax by a value-added tax by June
1992 (para. 76);
(c) submitted to the Legislative Assembly an ordinary budget for
1991 that is consistent with a pu7. c savings target of 1.7? of
GDP (para. 77);
(d) removed interest rate controls on interbank loans and
established an interest rate band, within which commercial
interest rates are free to move, and such that the interest



32
rate floor is not less than the annualized inflation rate
prevailing since June 1990 (paras. 80-81);
(e) submitted to Congress a package of laws enabling the
recapitalization and privatization of the nationalized banks
and savings & loan associations, as well as the reform of the
Superintendency of Banks. The Government will have issued
accompanying regulations defining the terms of the bank
recapitalization that were satisfactory to the Bank and
presented a plan to rehabilitate the Banking Superintendency.
with technical assistance to be financed through USAID (para.
83);
(f) finalized an action plan to reform IRA and sell its assets
(para. 86); and
(g) obtained legislative approval to establish the Social
Investment Fund and set aside sufficient funds to initiate its
operations in early 1991. Also, the Government will have
finalized the preparations for a pilot project to distribute
nutritionally fortified cookies to schoolchildren beginning
with the commencement of the school year in March 1991 (para.
87);
94.       Release of the second tranche (expected to take place in
October-November 1991) would be contingent on satisfactory progress in
the implementation of the Government's structural adjustment program,
including the maintenance of a supportive macroeconomic framework, and
fulfilling the following conditions:
(a) adjustment of import tariffs according to the announced
schedule (as set out in the program, including raising the
tariff on wheat to 5Z), together with the elimination of import
tariff exemptions for autonomous public sector institutions and
enterprises, with the possible exception of certain
(investment) goods agreed between the Government and the Bank
that are imported by ANDA, ANTEL, CEL, CEPA and ISSS.(para.75);
(b) implementation of the action programs to improve tax
enforcement and introduce a value-added tax (para. 76);
(c) public announcement by the Government that all commercial
interest rates would be decontrolled by January 1993,
elimination of interest rate controls on commercial bank loans
and deposits with maturities of more than one year, and
unification of all Central Bank rediscount rates on short term
credit lines (excluding those credit lines financed by foreign
assistance loans or grants with specific provisions for
onlending at preferential rates) to a rate not less than the
prevailing market rate on 180-day commercial bank deposits
(para. 82);



33
(d) bringing to the market for sale at least two recapitalized
commercial banks, having progressed in the implementation of
the Superintendency's rehabilitation program and adoption of
action plans to recapitalize and privatize the savings & loans
associations and the Banco Hipotecario (para. 84);
(e) bringing the assets of IRA to the market for sale and
adoption of action plans satisfactory to the Bank to divest the
assets of INAZUCAR, INCAFE, and the marketing activities of BFA
(para. 86); and
(f) agreement with the Bank on the 1992 fiscal budgetary
allocations for the social sectors (with special attention to
basic health and primary education) prior to submission of the
Budget to the Legislative Assembly (para. 88).
95.       Release of the third tranche (expected to take place in the
fourth quarter of 1992) would also be contingent on continued progress
in the implementation of the adjustment program, including the
maintenance of a supportive macroeconomic framework, and fulfillment of
the following conditions:
(a) elimination of all but 16 import permit requirements (excluding
those that may be regulated by PL-480 agreements) and of all
but 4 export permit requirements (excluding those that may be
regulated by PL-480 agreements) (paras. 75, 85);
(b) putting into effect a value-added tax in place of the sales tax
(para. 76);
(c) preparation of a consolidated budget for fiscal year 1993 and
submission of such budget to Legislative Assembly (para. 78);
(d) elimination of interest rate controls on commercial bank
deposits with maturity of more than 180 days (para. 80);
(e) commenced implementation of plan to restructure and privatize
the savings & loans associations and the Banco Hipotecario, and
of plans for divestiture of the assets of INAZUCAR, INCAFE and
the marketing activities of BFA. Also, the Government will
have ceased to hold a controlling shareholding in at least one
commercial bank (paras. 83-84, 86); and
(f) based on the pilot project results to be reviewed with the
Bank, the Government will have expanded the coverage of its
nutritional assistance programs, namely the distribution of
fortified cookies to schoolchildren and the distribution of
weaning formula through health posts, as scheduled, and will
have initiated a pilot project, satisfactory to the Bank, to
distribute food coupons to the poor (para. 87).



34
E. IMplementation Assistance
96.       The adjustment program is being coordinated jointly by the
Government's Economic Council, headed by the Minister of Planning and
including the Ministers of Finance, Economy and Agriculture and the
President of the Central Bank. The UNDP, USAID, IMP, IDB and the Bank-
supported Regional Unit for Technical Assistance (RUTA) have been the
main sources of financing and technical assistance support for
strengthening the Government's program implementation capacity. The
UNDP has been supportive of the preparation of the Government's public
sector investment review, completed in December 1990. USAID currently
is prepariiLg with the Government a program to strengthen tax enforcement
capacity (through the Programa de Mejoramiento y Modernization) and will
be financing technical assistance to help the Government's program to
rehabilitate the Banking Superintendency, liberalize interest rates and
privatize the nationalized banks. USAID also has been active in helping
the Government design a plan to divest the assets of IRA. IMF will be
financing two long term consultants; one to assist in the areas of
monetary management and banking superintendency reform, and another to
help redesign the Central Government's accounting systems through the
Finance Ministry. The IDB has been supporting the program to design a
comprehensive taxpayers' registry (Registro Unico de Contribuyentes).
Finally, RUTA has been assisting the Government in the area of
agricultural sector reform, including the introduction of a market-
oriented price band mechanism to stabilize basic grains prices, and in
improving nutritional assistance, including the preparation of the
strategy to introduce fortified cookies, weaning formula and food
coupons.
F. Procurement, Disbursement and Auditing
97.       Loan proceeds (US$75 million) would be used to finance the CIF
cost of eligible imports by the public and private sectors. Ineligible
imports comprise goods financed by other multilateral or bilateral
sources, luxury goods and goods intended for military use. Retroactive
financing of USS 15 million (20X of loan total) is recommended for
eligible imports made before the date of the agreement, but not before
December 1, 1990.
98.       Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. Imports by the public and private sectors
estimated to cost more than US$ 3 million equivalent will be procured
through simplified ICB procedures. Imports by the private sector,
valued at less than US$ 3 million equivalent would be procured following
established commercial practices. Public sector imports valued at less
than US$ 3 million equivalent, would be procured following Government
procurement practices.11 The Central Bank will carry out the screening
process to ensure that all procurement conditions have been met. To
11 A draft country procurement assessment is now under review ard
specific country procurement issues are being addressed.



35
assist with this work, the Department for Control of International
Prices at the Central Bank, which has successfully monitored USAID
programs, has been evaluated by the Bank and found to be satisfactory to
oversee procurement for the duration of the loan. In addition, the
Government has agreed to retain a procurement consultant, whose cost
would be eligible for withdrawals from the Loan Account in an amount of
up to US$30,000, to help with the processing and verification of
documentation supporting withdrawal applications under this this loan.
99.       Disbursements of each tranche would be made against import
documentation received from the Central Bank, except for items from the
standard negative list. The Central Bank will be responsible for the
coordination and collection of relevant documentation and for preparing
and submitting withdrawal applications under the loan. Disbursements
against contracts valued less than USS 1 million equivalent would be
made on the basis of a Statement of Expenditures (SOE) to be submitted
by the Central Bank, with the detailed documentation retained by the
Central Bank for review by the Bank as required. Full documentation
would be required for the approval of individual contracts exceeding USS
1 million equivalent. Application for withdrawals will be consolidated
and submitted in amounts not less than US$ 250,000 equivalent.
Expenditures for goods procured under individual contracts valued at
less than US$ 15,000 equivalent would not be eligible for financing
under the loan. In addition to standard auditing covenants, an audit
report would be submitted to the Bank no later than 90 days after the
full disbursement of each tranche.
G. Cofinancing
100.      Cofinancing possibilities have been explored with the Japanese
Eximbank and OECF, but this did not result in a cofinancing commitment
for this operation. The IDB has approved a US$60 million global
multisectoral credit operation in December 1990 that complements the
measures supported under the SAL and could provide the basis for IDB
cofinancing of a future financial sector operation. As a consequence of
the strong demand for aid among Eastern European economies, together
with the advent of the Gulf crisis, cofinancing from Western European
countries was not available for this operation. Among the non-US donor
coummunity there has been only limited interest so far in providing
additional economic aid to El Salvador. The Government has recognized
this and has attempted to improve its international image by
isseminating information about its economic and social program. A
Consultative Group has been tentatively scheduled for Spring 1991.
H. Program Benefits and Risks
101.      The main benefits of the Government's structural adjustment
program are that it would (i) accelerate export growth and export
diversification, thus reducing the country's vulnerability to external
trade shocks, 'ii) reduce direct state intervention in financial
intermediation and in the productive sectors, enabling a more efficient
allocation of resources, (iii) strengthen the public sector's fiscal



36
control, improving it's ability to deliver basic social services, and
contribute significantly toward reducing absolute poverty. These
measures would set the basis for sustained rapid growth and improve the
country's creditworthiness, facilitating future access to external
finance.
102.      There are three potential risks to successful program
implementation: insufficient Government capacity to carry out the
complete program, inadequate external financing and a volatile political
environment. The Government is firmly committed to moving away from
state intervention and proceeding with a rapid program of deregulation
and privatization and has already implemented major reform measures in
the trade, finance and fiscal sectors. While legislative approval of
further measures may prove more difficult with the approaching
legislative elections in March 1991, it is unlikely that the momentum of
the program would be slowed down significantly, especially since many of
the major legislative steps needed for the reform program have already
been taken. While further adverse developments in the oil market cannot
be dismissed, to date the Government has responded in a correct manner
to higher oil prices and we do nct project major disruptions from this
s,urce.
103.      The level and timeliness of external aid are critical elements
for the program's success and are closely linked to a peace settlement
and to bilateral donors' concerns about human rights. The increased
number of claimants for donor resources (both within Central America and
Eastern Europe) introduces additional uncertainty. New commitments, as
well as disbursements of resources already committed to the country,
have been contingent on improvements in the country's human rights
record. A minor financing shortfall could be accomodated by scaling
back growth targets, but a large scale withdrawal of international
financial support could force the Government to abandon its
liberalization and poverty alleviation efforts.
104.      Finally, domestic political stability is essential for the
successful implementation of the Government's ambitious structural
adjustment program. Although recent political changes in Central
America and the resumption of peace talks with the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front have been promising, the situation remains
volatile. As the peace negotiations center on the hard issues of
reintegration of the guerillas and the future role of the army, the
possibility of a breakdown of talks and resurgence of violence
increases. Such a course of events would impair the program's
prospects.
PART IV - COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND BANK LENDING OPERATIONS
105.      Between 1949 and 1979, El Salvador received 19 Bank loans and
4 IDA credits totalling US$235.6 million equivalent net of
cancellations. Bank group lending initially focused on infrastructure
development to support productive activities, with smaller amounts



37
devoted subsequently to the social sectors. Of total disbursements,
power projects accounted for 422, telecommunications for 182, education
for 182, transport (roads) for 132 and urban development for 9Z. An
Earthquake Reconstruction Loan (US$65 million) was approved in September
1987, complemented by a Japanese Yen Grant Facility of Y1.5 billion. In
addition to supporting physical reconstruction efforts, tne Bank
assisted the Government in designing an overall reconstruction strategy
and in coordination of foreign emergency assistance. In July 1990, the
Earthquake Reconstruction Project was modified to include financing for
the rehab..Iitation of damaged and debilitated primary schools,
especially in rural areas.
106.      The Bank's country strategy for El Salvador focuses on medium
term structural adjustment, but recognizes the need to assist the
Government in overcoming important short term constraints. The program,
which has been coordinated with the IMF and the IDB, concentrates on:
(i) addressing key policy and structural issues through quick disbursing
operations; (ii) complementing and supporting the structural adjustment
process with operations in the social sectors to support the
Government's objectives of eradicating absolute poverty and minimizing
the impact of adjustment on the most vulnerable members of the
population; (iii) developing a pipeline of project lending, particularly
in the productive sectors; and (iv) assisting the Government to mobilize
additional resources on terms as concessional as possible.
107.      At the macroeconomic level, the Bank would provide adjustment
support through two quick disbursing operations: this SAL and a
financial sector loan. In the financial sector, the SAL aims to support
the initial steps taken in the areas of interest rate liberalization and
monetary policy reform, which prepare the ground for the creation of a
well-functioning private banking system. Further financial sector
reforms would be addressed in a subsequent sector loan. Similarly, the
SAL supports critical reforms in the productive sectors, needed to
generate sustained economic growth, and the reorientation public
resources toward key social sectors and specially targetted nutrition
programs to mitigate the impact of the adjustment measures on the poor.
These policy reform efforts would be accompanied by medium term reforms
in the social sectors to be supported by a Social Sector Rehabilitation
Project, which is under preparation.   The Social Sector Rehabilitation
Project focuses on structural reforms in the ministries of Health and
Education, as well as sectoral investments, to enable a more efficient
delivery of basic social services.
108.      Preparation has also begun on the design of an agriculture
operation, which would follow up on the reforms in basic grains pricing
and the divestiture of parastatals initiated under the SAL. This
operation would be designed in parallel with an IDB-financed operation.
109.      Bank involvement in infrastructure investment will be limited
until there is a solution to the civil conflict. As a first step, a
technical assistance loan for the energy sector is under preparation.
Bank support would focus on improving pricing policies operational



38
efficiency, training needs and the preparation of feasibility studies.
In addition to policy and project lending, the Bank would provide
technical assistance in such areas as public sector management, public
investment planning and financial management. The above strategy is
conditional on the continued willingness and ability of the Government
to carry out the adjustment effort. Performance will be monitored
closely and the strategy adjusted as appropriate.
PART V - IBRD/IMF COLLABORATION
110.      The Bank and IMF have worked in close cooperation with El
Salvador during the preparation of the proposed SAL. On August 27,
1990, the IMF's Board of Directors approved a Stand-by arrangement for
El Salvador of SDR 35.6 million. An IMF mid-term review mission visited
El Salvador in November 1990 and reported that the adjustment program
remained on track: all Stand-by performance criteria through September
1990 were observed. El Salvador's quota in the IMF is SDR89 million and
its current obligations to the Fund consist entirely of outstanding
Trust Fund loans amounting to SDR 0.13 million. We will continue to
work closely with Fund staff on key issues as the economic program
progresses.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
111.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

MINISTERIO DE PLANIFICACION
Y COORDINACION DEL DESARROLLO
ECONOMICO Y SOCIAL
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
San Salvador, January 11 1991
Mr. Barber B. Conable
President
The World Bank
Washington, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. Conable:
1. El Salvadors economic activity declined sharply in the early 1980s and the weak growth rates achieved
during 1983-1989 -- despite massive aid from friendly countries - were not sufficient to enable a
recuperation to the levels reached in the 1970s. In effect, GDP contracted on average by 1.3 percent
per annum during the past decade, in contrast to an average annual growth rate of 4.5 percent during
the 1970s. This weak performance largely reflected the severe impact of the extemal crisis at the
beginning of the decade, which manifested itself in a significant deterioration of the terms of trade, a
higher cost of servicing the external debt and the collapse of the Central American Common Market.
The Salvadorean economy was further weakened by the heavy damage to the country's infrastructure
caused by the domestic armed conflict, unfavorable weather conditions that have persisted durlng
the last years, a severe earthquake in 1986, which resulted in more than US$1,000 million in losses,
and the three major reforms undertaken in 1980 - the nationalization of the financial system and of
the external marketing of coffee and sugar, and the agrarian reform -- whose economic costs were
higher than expected.
2. Faulty economic policies and the lack of timely adjustments also contributed significantly to the
economic crisis experienced during the 1980s. After many decades of stable domestic prices, the
rate of inflation reached 31.9 percent in 1985, then fell to 18.2 percent in 1988 and rebounded to 23.5
percent in 1989. At the same time, open unemployment remained at approximately 10 percent, while
almost half of the economically active population remained employed in the informal sector and
approximately one million workers emigrated to foreign countries. The pubiic sector incurred iarge
deficits. primanly on account of a marked contraction in real revenues due to i) an Increasingly
deficient tax administration and (ii) infrequent and Insufficient adjustments In the pricing of public
serices. The financing of the non-financial public sector absorbed an Increasing share of domestic
resources, displacing the private sector and placing increased pressures on domestic prices and the
balance of payments. In addition, these high deficits limited the public sector's ability to support
economicactivity. Even thoughthe Central Bank maintained strict control overthe expansion of credit,
interest rates were highly negative and the money supply declined in real terms, with detrimental effects
on the Balance of Payments. The effects of the devaluation of the Colon at the beginning of 1986 were
-1-

MINISTERIO DE PLANIFICACION
Y COORDINACI()N DEL DESARROLLO
ECONOMICO Y SOCIAL
rapidly annulled by the high rate of domestic inflation and the lack of a consistent macroeconomic
management. The Current Account deficit rose to more than 8 percent of GOP in 1989 (excluding
official transfers equivalent to almost 5 percent of GDP), while the value of merchandise exports, which
declined continuously during the decade, fell to the lowest level since 1975.
3. Confronted by this crisis situation, the administration of President Alfredo Cristiani on June 1  1989,
introduced the Plan of Economic and Social Development 1989-94. This Plan has two fundamental
objectives: (i) to create the conditions needed for strong sustainable growth and Oi) to raise the welfare
and standard of living of the population, especially of those that live in extreme poverty, as the means
of achieving a lasting social peace. The Plan's action strategy encompasses a short-term Stabilization
Program (June 1989 - December 1990), accompanied by a set of measures and compensatory social
actions to alleviate the adjustment burden of the most vulnerable segments of the population. For the
medium term (1990 - 1994), the Plan comprises a Prograsn of Economic Reorientation, which aims to
establish an economic system that is more open to the rest of the world and more competitive, and
in which P!I Salvadoreans participate within a democratic framework.
4. The cent. dl objective of the Stabilization Program is to reduce the high economic imbalances and to
reestablish a structure of relative prices that conforms to market conditions that would provide the
basis for economic reactivation. In the execution of its Stabilization Program, the Govemmert of El
Salvador has demonstrated its firm commitment to pursue this objective. The policy measures and
actions taken through the end of October 1990 include:
a) Liberalization and unification of the exchange rate and the authorization of foreign exchange
houses (Casas de Cambio).
b) Establishment of an import tariff range of 5 percent and 35 percent, with the exception of a ceiling
of 50 percent for luxury items included in Annex Ill of the Central American Tariff Code, and
reduction in the number of import tarff rates from 25 to 7.
c) Establishment of a price-band mechanism for maize.
d) Elimination of most quantitative restrictions and price controls, except on seven products (i.e.,
sugar, instant coffee, cement, oil derivatives, edible oils and fats, wheat flour and cotton seed).
e) Introduction of fiscal and administrative measures to encourage export growth and carrying out of
negotiations to accede GATT.
f) Introduction of fiscal reforms to raise revenues, adjustment of prices for public services and actions
oriented to reduce costs and improve the operating efficiency of public enterprises.

g) Elimination of various laws that had granted tax and tariff exemptions and other privileges to
particular economic activities.
h) Simplification of the complex system for the allocation of credit and raising of interest rates by up
to 5 percentage points in reponse to higher inflation.
i) initiation of a program to privatize the financial system and presentation to the Legislative Assembly
of: a draft law to rehabilitate the Banks, a draft law to strengthen the Superintendency of the
Financial System and a draft law for the privatization of the Banks and Savings & Loans
Associations.
j) Elimination of the monopoly powers enjoyed by parastatal institutions In the marketing of coffee
and sugar, and the monopoly and monopsony powers of the Cotton Cooperative (COPAL).
k) Strengthening and reorientation of various social programs so that these could serve to cushion
the impact of the Stabilization Program. Furthermore, introduction of compensatory actions
through employment programs, targetted subsidies, food for work programs, increases in
minimum wages and raising of the minimum levels of taxable income.
I) Creation of the Social Investment Fund (FIS), with initial funding from the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and resources from the Government of El
Salvador.
m) Initiation of institutional reforms in the sectors of education and health, for which further tecnical
assistance from the World Bank is expected.
5. The Stabilization Program is supported by the IMF through a stand-by agreement approved in August
of last year. It has produced positive results, which are better than had been projected and have
materialized sooner than anticipated, despite the adverse conditions that emerged during this period,
such as (i) the fall of intemational coffee prices, resulting in an annual loss of more than US$100 mHlion,
(ii) the reduction by US$50 million in the balance of payments support program with USAID, (Nii) the
urban guerrilla offensive, which led to a loss of approximately US$100 million and, most recently, (iv)
the rise in petroleum prices due to the Gulf crisis, which could represent an additional balance of
payments burden of between US$70 million and US$100 million per year. Among the most important
results achieved in 1990 are the following:
a) Economic activity has rebounded vigorously, with GDP expected to grow by 3 percent - a rate not
achieved since 1978.
-3-

MINISTERIO DE PLANIFICACION
Y COORDINACION DEL DESARROLLO
ECONOMICO Y SOCIAL
b) The inflation rate reached 12.9 percent during the first nine months of the year and was likely to fail
below the target of 15 to 18 percent set for the year. Unfortunately, as a result of the oil price rise.
inflation reached 19.3 percent at the end of the year.
c) The public sector defieft has been substantalaly reduced through a strong Increase In revenues and
the limitation of public expenditures resulting from a more austere policy stance of the
Govemment.
d) The trade balance deficit also has been reduced despite the fall of coffee prices in the international
market. Consequently, the current account deficit will be below the defiit in 1989 and the growth
of international reserves wll exceed the target of US$40 million.
e) In September. an agreement was reached with the Parls Club to reschedule US$138.8 milion In
external debts and extemal arreas were reduced as scheduled in the Govemmentrs program. In
addition, agreement was reached to refinance debts with Mexico and Venezuela.
6. In the context of the Plan of Economic and Social Development and conforming with the Stabilization
Program, the Govemment of El Salvador began implementing the Program of Economic Reorientation
toward the end of 1989, and with increasing vigor in 1990. The Govemment of El Salvador needs the
technical assistance and financial support of the World Bank to help with the execution of ts reform
program In the areas of (I) trade and commercial policy, (ii) public sector administration, (li) monetary
and interest rate policy, (iv) financial sector reform, (v) agricultural sector reform and (vi) social sector
programs. We, therefore, hereby request a Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) for a period of two years
and for an amount equivalent to US$75 m0llion. The principal components of the program and the
operational steps to execute these are summarized below and described briefly In the attached matrix
A. Adjustment Measures in Trade and Exchange Rate Policy
7.The Plan of Economic and Social Development of the Government of El Salvador considers an outward
oriented policy approach as a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustained growth overtime. The
aim of this policy approach is to generate a more dynamic base for the country's export base and to
establish better conditions to stimulate foreign Investment. In this manner we hope to expand existing
markets and penetrate new markets, improve the levels of employment and obtain a more diversified
base of production for goods and services.
8. Exchange rate policy. In view of the critical extemal situation, commercial banks were authorized to
operate in the foreign exchange market in mid-1 989, and approximately 80 percent of all transactions
were transferred to that segment of the market As a result of this liberalization of the exchange system,
the Colon depreciated from 5 Colones per US Dollar in the official market in June 1989 to an average
rate of 6.5 Colones per US Dollar in the banking market in December of that year. while the rates
quoted in the black market were around 6.7 Colones per US Dollar. This process of liberalization
continued and by mid 1990, all external transactions, except for some of the public sector, were caried
-4-



- 59 -
MINISTERIO DE PLANIFICACION
Y COORDINACION DEL DESARROLLO
ECONOMICO Y SOCIAL
out in the banking market. Furthermore. in April 1990, the Legislative Assemblyapproved the Foreign
Exchange Houses Law (Ley de Casas de Cambio), giving the market greater transparency and
flexibility. By the end of October 1990, the Central Reserve Bank (BCR) had approved more than 50
requests for establishing foreign exchange houses, which legalized and absorbed the black market;
at that time, the exchange rate stood at 8.02 Colones per US Dollar in the banking market and at 8.13
Colones per US Dollar in the foreign exchange house_, i.e.. margin of only 1.4 percent. In conformance
with its Plan of Economic and Social Development, the Govemment of El Salvador will continue to
maintain an exchange rate system with a unified rate that is freely determined by the market.
9. Tariff Policy. With the aim of facilitating a more open economy, stimulating exports and promoting
an efficient substitution of imports, the Government has adopted a program of tariff adjustments and
elimination of exemptions. The import tariff system, which initially included 25 different rates between
1 percent and 290 percent, was replaced by a system with only 7 rates in a range of 5 percent to 50
percent in September 1989. In April 1990, the range of tariffs again was reduced to between 5 percent
and 35 percent, except for goods included in the Annex IlIl of the Central American Tariff Code (which
remained within the range of 35 percent and 50 percent), wheat (which has a tariff of 1 percent) and
imports carried out under the PL-480 program (which are exempt from tariffs). The Legislative
Assembly approved a modification to the law in December 1990, such that the goods included in the
Annex IlIl of the Central American Tariff Code also are within the general range of 5 and 35 percent
The tariff on wheat will be adjusted to 5 percent by June 30, 1991; and the Government of El Salvador
will negotiate with USAID a mechanism whereby the imports carried out under the PL-480 program
will be s jbject to the same tariff treatment as other goods, so as to avoid distortions. According to
the tariff adjustment program and as agreed by the Economic Council of the Government of El
Salvador, the dispersion of tariffs will be reduced further, such that the general tariff range will be
adjusted to a floor of 5 percent and a ceiling of 30 percent in June 1991, to 7 percent and 25 percent
in June 1992, and to 10 percent and 20 percent in June 1993.
10. Commercial Policy. In conformance with the economic liberalization program, practically all
non-tariff restrictions were eliminated in 1989 and a one-stop window (CENTREX) was established for
the processing of export documents, reducing the waiting time to less than one day. The Ministries
of Agriculture and of Economy have taken steps to eliminate the remaining import and export permit
requirements, except those that need to remain for reasons of health or securitythat are internationally
recognized, and for white maize and beans, due to supply shortage problems and given that these
two grains constitute the main nutritional base of the Salvadorean people. Also, the Government has
successfully concluded negotiations to incorporate El Salvador into the General Agreement of Tariffs
and Trade (GATT).
11. External Trade Legal Regulatory Framework. To complement the preceding policy changes and
with the aim of stimulating exports, absorb new technologies, and attract foreign Investment, the
domestic legal framework has been revised to provide foreign and domestic investors better
guarantees, without endangering the county's resources. In this area, the Legislative Assembly
approved the Law of Export Reactivation (Ley de Reactivacion de las Exportaciones) and the Law of
Free Zones and Fiscal Areas (Ley de Zonas Francas y Recintos Fiscales) on March 15, 1990, both of
-5-



- 60 -
MINISTERIO DE PLANIFICACION
Y COORDINACION DEL DESARROLLO
ECONOMICO Y SOCIAL
which complements the Law to Promote and Guarantee Foreign Investment (Ley de Fomento y
Garantfa de la Inversi6n Extranjera) that had been approved on April 28, 1988.
12. Tariff Exemptions. In conformance with the tariff policy reforms, most fiscaf and tariff exemptions
were removed during the second half of 1989 and the system of revenue collections was strengthened.
Tariff exemptions for public enterprises imports are expected to be eliminated before September 30,
1991.
13. Pricing Policies. With the aim of liberalizing the market and stimulating healthy competition, most
quantitative restrictions and price controls were removed during the second half of 1989 (except for
7 products). In linewith the overall liberalization policyandtaking caretosafeguard consumers' rights,
the Government wu make necessary revisions to the Law of Commercialization and Price Regulation
(Ley de Comercializacion y Regulacion de Precios) in the context of the draft law of Quality, Weights
and Measures (Leyde Calidad, Pesos y Medidas), which will be presented to the Legislative Assembly
before September 30, 1991.
B. Policies to Modernize Public Sector Administration
14. El Salvador's public sector expanded strongly during the 1980s, carrying out both norming and service
functions, as well as adopting a more interventionist stance in the productive sectors. Since the
beginning of President Cristiani's administration, the Government has sought to change the role of
the public sector, to transform it into a more efficient and dynamic entity in conformance with a market
oriented economy. Considering that the success of the Program of Economic Reorientation in large
part depends on a significant improvement in public sector finances, the Government Is carrying out
a process of modernization by taking measures aimed, on one hand, at raising revenues and, on the
other, at containing expenditures within limits consistent with its revised and more limited role.
15. Revenue Policies. Fiscal reforms are being taken in this area with the objective of establishing a new
tax system that has a broader tax base, is more equitable and more neutral in its impact on incentives,
and would permit a significanc increase In tax collections, which are among the lowest in Latin America.
With the aim of simplifying the tax system and rendering it more efficient, a serles of specific taxes
with low yields and high administrative costs were eliminated. To expand the tax base, while reducing
tax-induced distortions, a large part of the previously exiating exemptions were abolished. Similarly,
the prices of services provided by public sector enterprises were adjusted.
16. Expenditure Policies. In this area, a policy of greater austerity and administrative integrity has been
introduced. Mechanisms have been adopted to promote a more efficient utilization of public sector
resources - such as the National System of Public Investment - and sectoral policies are being
restructured and reoriented to provide a greater and more efficient allocation of resources toward the
social sectors. The intemal debt of the Central Govemment and Autonomous Public Institutions has
been renegotiated.
-6-

MINISTERIO DE PLANIFICACION
Y COORDINACION DEL DESARROLLO
ECONOMICO Y SOCIAL
17. Tax Collection. Through an expanded tax base, strengthened tax administrations and improvement
in tax equity, the Government is seeking to raise the level of tax revenues, as the primary means of
generating greater public savings and reducing the fiscal deficit. With this objective, the Ministry of
Finance will make a major effort to increase tax revenues through the following administrative reforms,
which will be implemented before January 31, 1991.
a) specific measures to increase the number of taxpayers registered for the Sales Tax;
b) modifications to the norms that facilitate or stimulate tax evasion and tax avoidance;
c) definition of policies and programs to improve tax enforcement, with an emphasis on expanding
the tax auditing process;
d) measures to limit the recourse to tax loopholes *tat erode the tax base;
e) actions to coordinate the process of tax declarations and tax payments;
f) actions to improve the control over the transfer of taxes paid through the banking system;
g) diagnosis and reform of operating and control methods used by the Customs Office to reduce
evasion; and
h) Measures to strengthen the supervision capacity of the Office of the Minister of Finance over the
Office of Internal Tax Administration, Treasury, Customs Office and General Accounting Office.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance intends to define a program before January 31, 1991, to replace
the Sales Tax by another tax that avoids the distortions caused by the cascading nature of the Sales
Tax and that is easier to enforce. It is hoped that this new tax will be introduced in place of the Sales
Tax prior to July 1, 1992.
18. Public Savings. As stipulated in its Plan of Economic and Social Development, the Government of
El Salvador is committed to raise public savings. Its target is to increase the savings of the non-financial
public sector to 1.7 percent of GDP in 1991 (including the extraordinary budget) and to no less than
2 percent of GDP in 1992. To achieve these targets, the Program for the Modemization and
Improvement of Public Finances (PMM) is being designed with technical and financial assistance from
USAID.
19. Budgetary Policies. As part of the structural reform process, the General Budget of the Nation is to
be transformed into a more dynamic tool in the conduct of economic and social policy, to (i) achieve
-7-



- 62 -
MINISTERIO DE PLANIFICACION
Y COORDINACION DEL DESARROLLO
ECONOMICO Y SOCIAL
a more efficient allocation of the State's resources through more careful financial programming in all
public entities; (ii) promote higher public savings. thereby also ensuring greater monetary stability and
reducing pressures on the Balance of Payments; and (Hi) encouraging human capital development.
through subsidies specifically targetted to the poorest members of society. In the area of budgeting,
the Minister of Finance is committed to:
a) define by January 31, 1991, an action plan to strengthen control over the decentralized public
institutions and public sector enterprises, so that these will comply with the savings targets
established for 1991 and 1992;
b) establish by January 31, 1991, and in conjunction with the Ministry of Planning, proceedings to
coordinate the design and execution of the Ordinary and Extraordinary Budgets, with the goal of
preparing a unified budget for the Central Government by mid-i 992; and
c) apply, as of January 1, 1991, in conjunction with the Ministry of Planning, the norms and procedures
established in the Law of the National System of Public Investment, with the aim of ensuring that
the investments carried out by the institutions of the non-financial public sector satisfy minimum
quality and efficiency criteria.
20. Privatization Program. The Plan of Economic and Social Development considers the privatization
of public enterprises as fundamental in giving the State a more market oriented role. This process is
essential for establishing a clear delineation between the functions of the state and those that are best
carried out by the private sector. Among the actions to be taken are the following:
a) creation of a Privatization Commission encompassing public and private sector representatives;
b) finalization of studies and preparatory plans to transfer the assets of the Basic Grains Regulatory
Agency (IRA) by January 31, 1991. As an interim step toward the sale the IRA's assets, a program
to fortify the private sector marketing of basic grains is to be prepared by September 30, 1991,

C. Monetary and Interest Rate Policies
21. In the context of the Government's Plan of Economic and Social Development, monetary and interest
rate policies must aim to maintain monetary stability, stimulate domestic savings, encourage efficient
resource mobilization and allocation, and support the functioning of competitive, solvent and efficient
financial system. During thetransition period from a state-owned toa privately owned financial system,
the monetary authorities are committed to maintain positive real interest rates, while progressively
- reducing the state's control over the allocation of credit until the market is completely decontrolled
and establishing an environment that is conducive to the development of a private and competitive
financial system.
22. Interest Rate Policy. To attain the objectives outlined in the preceding paragraph, the basic deposit
rate (TIBP, to be defined as the minimum rate of interest on time deposits with maturity of up to 180
days) and the basic lending rate (TIBA, to be defined as the maximum rate of interest on credits with
maturities of up to one year) will be reviewed and adjusted if necessary in accordance with the following
calendarized schedule:
a) Beginning on January 15, 1991, interest rates will be subjected to a review process on a semester
basis, or more frequently if required by changing market developments, such that TIBP will be
adjusted in line with the annualized inflation rate prevailing over the preceding six months, while
TIBA will be adjusted to maintain a differential of at least 4 percentage points above TIBP (Le.,
TIBP plus 4 percentage points), with an exception made for agricultural credits and loans for
housing with a sales price of less than 60,000 Colones. Furthermore, interest controls on the
interbank lending market will be eliminated.
b) By September 30, 1991, the adjustment formula for interest rates will be revised, such that TIBP
will not be below the rate of inflation during the last 12 months plus 1 percentage point, while TIBA
will be adjusted to raise the differential to TIBP by at least 5 percentage points (i.e., TIBP plus 5
percentage points). Furthermore, the monetary authorities are committed to (i) liberate deposit
and lending rates for operations with maturities of more than one year, (ii) announce publicly that
all interest rates will be liberalized as of January 1993, and (iii) unifyall rediscount ratesfor financial
intermediaries to a level that is at least as high as TIBP, while subjecting the placement of such
rediscounted loans to the same general norms applicable to other loans. The only exception to
this last rule will be for credits to small farmers and the reformed agricultural sector, small
entrepreneurs and loans financed through external resources, whose donors insist that these be
onlent on preferential terms.
c) By October 31, 1992, the interest rate adjustment formula will be revised such that TIBP will be
equal to the 12 month inflation rate plus two percentage points, while TIBA will be adjusted to
ensure a differential of at least 6 percentage points above TIBP (i.e., TIBP plus 6 percentage points).
Furthermore, interest rates on deposits with maturity of more than 180 days will be liberalized.

reasons) according to a specific calendar of actions, with the exception of permit requirements for
white maize and beans.
F. Programs for the Social Sectors
29. Social Compensation. Programs of stabilization and structural adjustment impose social costs that
generally are borne by the most vulnerable groups in society. Therefore, since the beginning of this
administration, the Government of El Salvador has initiated a set of social compensatory programs.
Through these programs and other measures of a compensatory character, the provision of services
to the neediest groups has been improved. At the same time, the Legislative Assembly has approved
the creation of the Social Investment Fund, which initiated its activities in October 1990.
30. Reform in the Traditional Social Sectors. The Government is seeking to improve the quality,
coverage and efficiency of its social services through the introduction of structural reforms in the
traditional institutions. In this context and parallel to the SAL negotiations, the Government has
initiated a dialogue with the World Bank on a Project for the Strengthening of the Social Sectors, which
emphasizes the areas of education and health. The execution of this Project is expected to begin in
mid-1 991.
31. Nutrition. Parallel to the social compensatory programs, the Government of El Salvador intends to
introduce a pilot project to distribute nutritionally fortified cookies (ICAP) at the beginning of the school
,'ear (February 1991). and to expand their distribution to one-third of the 78 poorest municipalities (out
of a total of 262 municipalities) by September 30, 1991. Based on the initial results of this project, the
distribution of fortified cookies would be expanded to the remaining two-thirds of the 78 municipalities
by October 31, 1992. Also, the authorities are committed to introduce a pilot project to distribute
weaning formula by September 30. 1991, and to expand its distribution coverage, based on the piot
project results, by October 31, 1992. Finally, by October 31, 1992, the Government of El Salvador
intends to have completed the design and to have initiated execution of a pilot project for the
distribution of food coupons to the poor.

G. Conclusion
32. The Plan of Economic and Social Development 1989-1994 outlines the actions and policies needed
for achieving the objectives of sustained economic growth and an improvement in the standards of
living of all Salvadorans. During the first 18 months of its administration, the Government led by
President Cristiani has demonstrated its committment and political will to execute the Stabilization
Program and initiate structural reforms, despite extremely difficult conditions. To ensure a successful
completion of this Program, however, adequate financial and technical assistance from the
international community are needed. tn this context, the World Bank's support, both through its direct
assistance and indirect assistance in the mobilization of additional external resources, is fundamentally
important. In its search to bring about a peaceful solution to the domestic conflict, the Govemment
of El Salvador has established a prucess of permanent dialogue, with the help of United Nations
intermediation. For that peace to be lasting and to help strenghten our democratic processes, it is
necessary to begin now by creating the economic and social conditions needed to reduce the levels
of poverty and the inequality of opportunity that still wrevail in Salvadoran society.
