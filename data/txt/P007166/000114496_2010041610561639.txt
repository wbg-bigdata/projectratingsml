                  culation; or

                  required."
      (b)   The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of
the Guidelines:
            "As a further alternative, bidding documents may require
      the bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely
      used in international trade and specified in the bidding
      documents."
      (c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted.

and information as the Bank may reasonably request to support
withdrawal applications in respect of such contract.

shall not apply to contracts on account of which the Bank has
authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account on the basis of
statements of expenditure.
6.    In order to assist the Borrower in the processing or
verification of documentation supporting withdrawal applications
under the Loan, the Borrower shall employ consultants whose
