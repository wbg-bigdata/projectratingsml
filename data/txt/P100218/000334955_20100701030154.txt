                        Extension of Closing Date
INDONESIA -- INFRASTRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION ENABLING PROGRAM (IREP)
                                 (P100218, TF056894)


1.     This paper seeks approval of the Regional Vice President (RVP) to extend the
closing date for the Infrastructure Reconstruction Enabling Program (IREP) until
December 31, 2011.

2.     IREP is financed through a grant of US$42.0 million from the Multi-Donor Trust
Fund for Aceh and North Sumatra (MDF). The date of the grant agreement is July 13,
2006. The original closing date was October 31, 2009, and has already been extended
once until June 30, 2010. The proposed extension is for a cumulative period of 26
months, and requires approval of the RVP under BP13.30.

3.     The Government of Indonesia (GoI) sent a formal request (Annex 1) to extend the
closing dates for both the Infrastructure Reconstruction Financing Facility (IRFF)
(P101785, TF057657) project and IREP to December 31, 2011. The request to extend
the closing date for IRFF was approved by the Country Director since the cumulative
extension is less than 24 months (Annex 2).

4.      IREP's main objective is to enable the implementation of the IRFF by financing
the technical assistance needed to perform the project implementation management
activities including: procurement; financial management; quality control and quality
assurance; safeguards framework assurance and monitoring; implementation monitoring;
and the design and construction supervision of all activities under the IRFF. The IREP
and IRFF projects are designed to go hand-in-hand.

5.     IREP will also be used to finance the initial construction supervision cost for the
proposed additional financing for the IRFF (IRFF-AF) project for which the negotiations
have recently concluded and it is expected that the final package will be submitted to the
RVP for approval before June 30, 2010. Because of this connection there was a
condition of negotiation of the IRFF-AF that the GoI request the extension of IREP.

6.     IREP's PDO and overall IP ratings are moderately satisfactory. There are no
outstanding audit reports for both IREP and IRFF projects and the most recent audits for
2008 were unqualified. The project team and the project implementing agencies have
agreed on an implementation schedule to complete all project works ahead of the
proposed new closing date and the project's PDO remains achievable within that
timeframe.

7.    An INT investigation of IREP substantiated allegations of fraud on one of the
IREP contracts (IPM contract). INT completed the investigation in June 2009 and also
                                            4
provided referrals to the relevant authorities. The case is currently being prepared for
sanctions. Ineligible expenditures associated with the IPM contract have been duly
returned. The IPM contract was allowed to expire on March 31, 2010. As an alternative
arrangement to the IPM consultant, a group of individual consultants, cleared by the
Bank, were hired to carry out the IPM functions. The Task Team is satisfied with the new
arrangements to replace the IPM consultant. INT is also investigating other contracts
under IREP and IRFF.

8.      Financial management arrangements especially with respect to payment
documentation, verification, delayed submission of financial reports and audit reports
have been strengthened to overcome past weaknesses. Since mid June 2009, the PMU
has clear instructions for the FM consultant (IREP#5 contract) to review and verify all
payment requests prior to submission for payment. The FM consultant should continue to
perform such review and verification, including getting confirmations from third parties
on a small sample to ensure that the payments are genuine. No payments will be made
unless invoices are clearly verified by the FM consultant. In addition, the FM consultant
is expected to continue conducting regular internal control review at the PIUs level.

9.      Status of IRRF. Implementation of the IRFF project experienced substantial
delays related to: (i) the overwhelming size of destruction caused by the 2004 tsunami
and subsequent earthquake which required huge efforts to complete the damage
assessment and design the reconstruction program; (ii) difficult working conditions in
Aceh and North Sumatra; (iii) complicated co-financing arrangements with BRR; (iv)
lengthy negotiations with the GoI to agree on satisfactory transition arrangements after
the closure of BRR mid-stream of project implementation; (iv) weak capacity of local
government; (v) difficulties by consultants and contractors to fully mobilize appropriate
skills early on during project implementation; (vi) endemic delays in budget (DIPA)
approvals; and (viii) complex flow of funds arrangements. In spite of these difficulties,
currently, the PDO and IP ratings for the IRFF are moderately satisfactory. The revised
IRFF cost is US$207.3 million -- US$100 million from the MDF grant and US$107.3
from the government -- and disbursements are at US$68.7 million.

10.     Out of 56 sub-projects under IRFF, 45 sub-projects are completed, while 7 sub-
projects (US$75.45 million) are above 50 percent physical progress and 1 sub-project
(US$6.44 million) is below 50 percent physical progress. Moreover, due to the transition
in the implementation arrangement and the strict application of a fixed budget policy
adopted by BRR (the previous implementing agency) of not exceeding the signed
contract value regardless of approved changes in the contract, some sub-projects have
been left incomplete. The incomplete works have been appraised and packaged under the
so called "Gaps" program (about US$13m). There are sufficient funds remaining funds
in the IRFF grant to finance the "Gaps" as well as complete ongoing sub-projects. The
Task Team is satisfied that all IRFF works including the "Gaps" would be completed by
December 30, 2011.

11.    MDF Secretariat has agreed to provide supervision budget (BB) for both IRFF
and IREP for FY2011 and FY2012.



                                           5
12.     Request for Approval. Extending the closing date of IREP to coincide with
IRFF's new closing date is needed to continue providing implementation support towards
satisfactory completion of all remaining works and achievement of the development
objectives of the Aceh reconstruction.

CTRTF, CTRDM, MDF, LEG and SM.
