A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The proposed Technical Assistance loan aims at assisting the Ecuadorian government to manage and
confront the deep financial sector crisis faced by the country, and strengthening the regulatory framework
and supervisory capacity of the authorities in order to foster the long term soundness and efficiency of the
banking system. In the short term, the objectives of the loan would include:
(i) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Superintendency of Banks (SB) and the Deposit Insurance
Agency (AGD) to manage the banking crisis;
(ii) develop a comprehensive strategy that adequately links the programs for bank recovery, debt
restructuring and asset sale under a coherent framework to resolve the crisis and minimize its fiscal cost;
(iii) promote orderly and efficient recovery of assets acquired by AGD;
(iv) improve the capacity of authorities to temporarily manage the banks now under public ownership
(AGD banks); (v) reprivatize open banks under AGD control;
(vi) strengthen banking regulation, supervision and enforcement, adopting international standards; and
(vii) develop a framework for effective corporate and household debt restructuring that provides debt relief
to viable debtors while helping them to restore their long term solvency and profitability.
The longer-term objectives would include helping the banking system resume fully normal credit
operations, and establish the basis for a sound and efficient financial system.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The key performance indicators are described in matrix form in Annex 1. The main indicators of
successful management of the crisis would include:
(i) Prompt, orderly and efficient sale of impaired assets acquired by AGD.
(ii) Operational and managerial restructuring of banks taken over by the AGD, with the purpose of
preparing them for their eventual reprivatization.
(iii) Reprivatization of AGD banks.
(iv) Corporate and household debt restructuring in a manner consistent with the bank restructuring and
recapitalization program.
(v) Amendment of financial sector laws and issuance of new prudential regulation.
(vi) Gradual phasing in of compliance with the Basle Core Principles of Effective Banking Supervision.
In the longer term, indicators of the effectiveness of crisis management would include containment of the
fiscal cost of the crisis, in particular the amount of Treasury bonds issued to pay deposit insurance,
recapitalize banks and provide liquidity support to banks. Pace of macroeoconomic recovery, resumption of
the flow of bank credit to the economy, and time needed to restore the solvency and profitability of banks
and domestic firms will also be long term performance indicators of the overall technical assistance
program.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 15419                   Date of latest CAS discussion: 03/25/97
Since early 1998, Ecuador has been undergoing a deep macroeconomic and banking crisis. Five of the eight
- 2 -



largest commercial banks are now under public intervention. Further deterioration of the banking system is
likely, given the deep recession, generalized non-payment of bank loans even by solvent borrowers, and
problems of confidence in the economy and banking system. The Government's decision to dollarize the
economy, first announced in early January, has several implications for the financial sector, especially for
liquidity management. In this sense, the design of an appropriate mechanism of liquidity support to the
banking sector is an important element to maintain the stability of the system and to ensure successful
implementation of the new monetary regime. Furthermore, banks' liquidity needs will increase in March
2000 and thereafter with the gradual unfreezing of time deposits.
The CAS under preparation, that will be circulated shortly for Board discussion, sets two core objectives
for the Bank's work with Ecuador over the coming 18-24 months: (i) helping to mitigate the massive human
and social costs of the crisis -- in particular, protecting health and nutritional standards and human-capital
formation from the effects of the crisis; and (ii) supporting the authorities' efforts to bring about
sustainable economic recovery as soon as possible, mainly by helping to restore the banking system to
normal operations. This project will focus mainly on the second objective. Restoration of public confidence
in the banking system is crucial, not only to ensure sustainable economic recovery but also to support the
stabilization of the economy under a "dollarized" monetary regime and to prevent the crisis from deepening.
The main regulatory institutions of the banking sector - in particular, the Banking Superintendency (SB)
and the institutionally weak Deposit Guarantee Agency (AGD) -- need fundamental strengthening.
Banking and corporate sector recovery would also serve the first CAS objective, since this would catalyze
economic recovery, and so enable Ecuador to more effectively relieve the human and social consequences
of the crisis.
2. Main sector issues and Governiment strategy:
Since late 1997, 16 out of 40 domestic private banks have failed. Four foreign banks operate in Ecuador.
The government has become the ownler of all failed banks which together represented approximately 60%
of the banking system in terms of assets at the end of 1999. Some failed banks have been closed, but the
authorities have kept some of the larger ones open to avoid major disruptions to the payment system.
In March 1999, the authorities decided to freeze most bank deposits. Since then, they have gradually
unfrozen checking and time deposits, but now they face the need to unfreeze some US $1.3b in time
deposits. In March, 2000, authorities started to implement a program to gradually unfreeze all bank
deposits in open banks, paying the first US $4,000 in cash at maturity and any amount above it in
negotiable Treasury bonds.
The banking system is undergoing a deep crisis, with virtually no new credit operations taking place. The
existing loan portfolio is overwhelmingly non-performing, and a thorough-going process of debt
restructuring is clearly required. Throughout 1999, the Central Bank issued a massive volume of liquidity
to enable the commercial banks to meet deposit withdrawal demands. This contributed to the exchange-rate
volatility that persuaded the authorities to move to dollarization in January 2000. While dollarization
requires the Central Bank to discontinue liquidity operations in their present form, banks continue to
require liquidity. The authorities' ma.in challenge in the short term will be to find a mechanism of ensuring
that banks have adequate access to liquidity compatible with the new monetary regime.
The authorities will do a better job cf resolving the crisis to the extent (i) they improve the management of
the banks now under public stewardship; (ii) recover assets more effectively; (iii) prepare public banks for
rapid but appropriate privatization; '(iv) closely monitor operating banks to ensure that their operating
- 3 -



status is sufficiently safe and sound in terms of both liquidity and solvency; and (v) determine and
implement the best possible debt-restructuring program. In addition, they will have to ensure better
banking over the longer term to the extent of addressing underlying institutional weaknesses of the Banking
Superintendency and the Deposit Guarantee Agency. Although these objectives are part of the
government's strategy, the government lacks both the resources and technical expertise to carry them out
effectively.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
In the medium and longer terms, the proposed technical assistance is expected to have a major impact on
reconfiguring the Ecuadorian financial system. With the reprivatization of all open AGD banks, the TAL
aims at transferring ownership and management of domestic financial institutions to the private sector. At -
present the government has nationalized 60% of the banking system, measured in terms of assets. Given the
difficult situation faced by the Ecuadorian economy, the implementation of the TAL will likely result in a
higher share of foreign ownership and possible consolidation of the Ecuadorian financial system.
Also, with the sale of remaining AGD assets, the TAL aims at resolving a large part of intervened banks'
bad assets. The rapid sale of assets is likely to contribute to reducing the fiscal costs of the crisis and will
provide fresh resources to help the government to meet its financial liabilities or support further bank
restructuring and recapitalization. Moreover, sound assets' resolution, along with the proposed debt
restructuring program for debtors and households, are expected to improve the overall asset quality of the
banking system, helping viable banks to restore their solvency while providing temporary debt relief to
viable firms and households.
In addition, strengthening the regulatory framework of the financial system and the supervisory capacity of
the financial authorities will contribute to improve risk management capacity within banks, eliminate most
of the illicit or inadequate financial practices of the past, particularly connected lending, and lay the
foundations for a sound and efficient banking system. Finally, by speeding up the resolution of the banking
crisis, the TAL is expected to contribute to restore the confidence on the financial system and the overall
economy, allowing financial intermediaries to resume lending and support Ecuador's macroeconomic
recovery.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The main objective of the TAL is to assist the government to manage the financial sector crisis. In the short
term, the program focuses on strengthening the AGD's capacity to manage and dispose impaired assets, and
privatize all open banks that were intervened since the beginning of the crisis. The TAL also aims at
establishing an adequate framework for corporate and household debt restructuring that provides debt relief
to viable debtors and thus fosters macroeconomic recovery.
The TAL also aims at strengthening the Superintendency of Banks. In this component there will be joint
participation of the World Bank, the IDB, and the CAF. The Bank's part will aim at strengthening in situ
supervision by the Superintendency of Banks, providing training to bank examiners, complementary audits,
and legal reforms. The IDB program will focus on: rationalizing the organizational structure of the SB,
including human resources, strengthening prudential regulation and extra-situ supervision and upgrading
information systems. The CAF component would focus on strengthening the Project Coordination Unit
- 4 -



(UEGI). There would be parallel financing from the World Bank, the IDB and the CAF, but no
co-financing will be included and each institution will have its own operating plan and activities; however,
to ensure an adequate coordination, the IDB, the CAF and the World Bank will sign a Memorandum which
will stipulate the schedule of regular consultations among the three institutions and the coordination
regarding this particular project component.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The key policy reforms supported by the project include (i) stabilization of the economy under a
"dollarized" monetary regime, which will be difficult to achieve unless the banking system begins returning
to normality; (ii) reprivatization of banks now under public control; (iii) resolution of the large amount of
"failed assets" in the system; (iv) institution of effective banking supervision, and (v) corporate and
household debt restructuring. From an institutional perspective, to the extent the Project is successful, the
authorities will be in a better position to have an effective, respected Banking Superintendency, and a fully
capable Deposit Insurance Agency.
3. Benefits and target population:
The major benefit of the proposed TA operation would be to enable and empower authorities to act more
decisively to confront the current banking crisis. More specifically, benefits would include:
1. a more effective banking supervision including prompt corrective actions to prevent the further
deterioration of financial intermediaries;
2. a more effective Deposit Insurance Agency yielding a higher recovery of assets and a faster
turn-around of banks taken over;
3. a reprivatization of AGD administered banks and the restoration of a private banking system; and
4. a reduction of currently pervasive ad-hoc corporate and household restructuring solutions via the
development of an early comprehensive framework and its implementation.
Ultimately, the proposed.TA loan would benefit all domestic users of financial services in Ecuador,
including depositors, creditors, investors, debtors, firms and households. In the long run, a sound and
efficient financial system is an important precondition for macroeconomic stability and economic growth,
as well as the most important means to finance investment and consumption in the Ecuadorian economy.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The government agencies beneficiaries of this loan will be the Superintendency of Banks (SB) and the
Deposit Insurance Agency (AGD). Utnder the TAL project, the Government of Ecuador established the
Project Coordination Unit (UEGI) [lJnidad de Ejecuci6n y Gesti6n Institucional] at the SB and the AGD,
with participation of both AGD and SB staff. The UEGI, established on January 10, 2000, will coordinate
all the activities financed by the TAL, and will also be responsible for ensuring quality of procurement and
financial management. Project components to be implemented by the SB are strengthening of banking
supervision, and corporate and household debt restructuring. The AGD will implement the components
related to its own strengthening, asset management and disposition, and bank reprivatization. An
Implementation Agreement among the Government and the SB and the AGD will be subscribed by the
effectiveness date.
The UEGI has been created specifically to respond to the design of the project, with one Deputy
Superintendent (Intendente) acting as the General Coordinator for the Project. The UEGI itself has a very
compact organization with technical staff seconded from the Central Bank, the General Comptroller's
Office (GCO), the Superintendency of Banks and the AGD. Although the Bank will not finance any staff
for project coordination or loan administration, all technical staff such as the Coordinators of Components
were chosen competitively by their institutions ensuring a group of competent professionals. The
Procurement Officer is seconded from the GCO where he was involved in the direct supervision and control
of public and multilateral institutions procurement. Despite the good qualifications in the team and
aggregate experience of the core technical and administrative-financial team, it is expected that the project
will go through an initial learning stage where the team will have to acquire and master Bank procurement
procedures on the job.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Alternatives short of a lending operation were considered, including an Institutional Development Facility
and specific consulting activities. Bank staff have concluded that the magnitude and significance of the
problem require the resources, the continuity, the coordination, and visibility that only a project-based
approach, operating through an appropriately staffed project unit, would provide. Under the proposed
Project basic actions conducive to improve banking and corporate and household restructuring would
benefit, in addition to technical assistance, from fresh financial resources to achieve maximum benefits.
The initial idea was to prepare a TAL that would be complementary to an adjustment lending operation
which would have operated exclusively through recapitalization transactions with particular private banks,
carried out through a trust fund. Given the deep economic and banking changes that have occurred
recently, and the adoption of a new monetary regime, this approach is no longer appropriate, therefore a
much more comprehensive TAL is needed to help the government contain the crisis in the immediate term
and to develop appropriately the institutions in charge of banking supervision, regulation, and enforcement.
Also, the Bank is now developing an adjustment operation appropriate to the current circumstances. Under
any scenario, this technical assistance operation is a clear necessity, which would also serve as a basis on
which the financial sector dialogue can be continued and intensified. At a later stage, any additional
adjustment lending might extend restructuring benefits further.

Currently, the International Monetary Fund is preparing a stand-by arrangement for Ecuador. The technical
assistance program is carefully coordinated with the government program supported by the mentioned IMF
arrangement.
The Bank is also preparing a possible Structural Adjustment Loan to Ecuador which may contain a
fmancial sector component.
3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Experience shows there are no standard designs or formulas for making TA effective. In the past, attention
has been focused on addressing the main causes of poor TA performance: governance problems,
inadequate ownership, design problems, inadequate up-front analysis, weak implementation capacity, and
shortcomings of the Bank's own supervision intensity. The design of this project has benefited from intense
upstream analysis that has been undertaken since late 1998 to identify the main financial sector issues so as
to advance Bank readiness for any adjustment loan which would have followed an IMF program. This
upstream analysis was carried out in coordination with the IMF, IDB, and CAF. The Bank's own TA
implementation experience in Ecuador underscores the need to build an effective Project Coordination Unit
to monitor project development.
-8 -



The scope of the TA will give priority to crisis management and, secondarily, to longer term institutional
development. Highly qualified support has been engaged by the government in preparation for reform and
help in defining its technical assistance needs. Additional resources will be provided by FRO (Financial
Restructuring Operations) to allow for intensive supervision including, to the extent necessary, extensive
field presence, in coordination with the Region.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Ecuadorian Government at the highest levels has urged the Bank to present the proposed project to the
Board at the earliest possible date. There is a clear recognition on the part of GOE that external financial
and advisory assistance is required to strengthen crisis management to limit the adverse impact of the
banking crisis. The authorities have actively contributed to the preparation of the project, providing inputs-
at all stages of the process.
5. Value added of Bank support iin. this project:
The Bank adds value by: (a) raising international confidence in the Government's program to support
bank/corporate and household restructuring; (b) drawing on its international experience in design of
sectoral reforms and assistance strategies; (c) assisting in the identification of international consultants
with specialized expertise in the appropriate project component areas; (d) using its stature and position to
facilitate discussions and accelerate riestructuring; and (e) providing scarce resources to finance technical
assistance support.
E. Summary Project Analysiis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
o Cost benefit    NPV-US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
* Cost effectiveness
O Other (specify)
Since this is a technical assistance project focused on institution building it is not amenable to
calculation of economic rate of return.
2. Financial (see Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR= % (see Annex 4)
Fiscal Impact:
While the direct fiscal consequences of the TA lending operation and its servicing are negligible, a
successful outcome of this operation could have a substantial favorable fiscal impact. This is because it
would enable the authorities to begin and maximize asset recovery and limit the Treasury's issue of bonds
to support the AGD's recapitalization activities and payment of deposit insurance. Interest accrues on past
issues at an annual 10-percent rate, 'or at US $160m per year (roughly 1.4 percent of GDP). (By
comparison, the Central Government's entire health budget for 1999 is about US $125m and the education
budget for the same year about US $350m In a worst-case scenario, the Treasury could be called upon to
issue similar or even larger amounts in the coming months for recapitalizing banks. To the extent the
proposed operation succeeded in improving bank crisis management and supervision, and improving asset
recovery, additional issues could be significantly reduced. The total book value of closed AGD
administered banks' assets that are capable of being recovered amount to more than US $ lb International
-9-



experience suggests that recovery rates range from 5 to 30 percent in situations like Ecuador's. If the
technical assistance provided enabled Ecuador to increase its recovery rate by a mere 5 percentage points,
this would amount to more than US $50m In addition, if the open banks now in public hands could be
improved sufficiently, the Govermnent could secure significantly higher privatization proceeds.
3. Technical:
Not applicable.
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
The fundamental responsibility for carrying out the TA components will rest with the Superintendency of
Banks and the Deposit Insurance Agency, which will coordinate their activities with other entities with
responsibilities in the area of corporate and household restructuring such as the Superintendency of
Companies (see Section C.4).
4.2 Project management:
The UEGI has a Project Manager of senior rank, and a Financial Manager/Accountant and Procurement
Specialist. Both the Financial Manager and the Procurement Specialist will initially be coached by
Ecuadorian professionals active in other Bank supported UEGIs responsible for implementing technical
assistance loans. An accounting firm will be selected as project auditor. The project coordination unit will
produce and submit to the Bank a Project Monitoring Report on a semi-annual basis.
In order to avoid a proliferation of UEGIs within the same TA Project, the UEGI responsible for the
banking reform components will also oversee the components related to corporate and household debt
restructuring. Professionals knowledgeable in corporate restructuring will have to be added. Where
appropriate, coordinating committees will be established to reach out to other regulatory, conflict
resolution, and policy setting agencies, including Superintendency of Companies, the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit, the BCE, the Banking Counsel (Junta Bancaria), and the Judicial system.

social tensions and to decelerate the wvorsening of poverty levels.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
The banking crisis has severely affected Ecuadorian households, firms and financial intermediaries and the
fiscal accounts. A large part of deposits in the banking system have been frozen, reducing the disposable
income of firms and households. The: increase in interest rates has reduced the capability of most debtors to
repay their loans, converting a large part of assets into non-performing status. In the case of banks, losses
have skyrocketed, diluting shareholders' capital and turning several institutions insolvent. In addition, there
is practically no new credit being extended, which make recovery much more difficult. Finally, bank
supervisors carry a heavy personal burden in enforcing regulatory requirements and restructuring the
banking system.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The proposed project faces significant risks (see Table). The project could fail to meet key objectives.
The Deposit Insurance Agency could fall short of its asset-recovery targets, specially if general market
conditions do not begin to show some degree of recovery in the short run. Under current economic and
social conditions it may prove difficult to find highly qualified managers/managerial teams to manage the
bank appropriately under public ownership, and even good managers may be unable to achieve an early
turn-around, and banks could prove difficult to privatize. The Banking Superintendency could make
inadequate progress toward institutional improvement, and may find itself unable to overcome resistance to
implementation of Basle standards.
There are significant risks in project implementation. Country experience suggests that it may prove
difficult to contract the appropriate staff for the project unit. Project unit staff could prove less than
competent. Staff turnover has been a significant problem in many Bank projects in Ecuador. The
proposed project is particularly vulnerable to risks beyond the scope of the project itself.
The dollarization program now under way adds a number of complexities to the risks arising from the
system's weaknesses, and even the risk of deposit runs, that under the current circumstances may be
specially hard to confront, cannot be ignored. Ecuador's political system is also a source of risk: in recent
years, political interference in banking-system processes has contributed to the severity of the banking
crisis.
To reduce the risks to which the project is subject, exceptionally intense supervision is anticipated. It is
essential to recognize that, because the project is focused on the organizational improvement and
capacity-building of key public institutions and services, it remains critical to Ecuador and may be
successful even if the banks presently operating in Ecuador continue to deteriorate on account of the
economic and political context.

1.2 Modernization of legal framework  Prepare and submit legislative proposals to amend the Ley
de Reordenamiento en Materia Economica and its
secondary regulation. The purpose of these amendments
would be to grant the AGD with an adequate legal basis and
sufficient powers to restructure the banks under its control,
rapidly sell the impaired assets acquired from distressed
banks and privatize public banks as soon as market
conditions improve.
1.3 Study to identify obstacles for the sale of Prepare a study to identify legal, regulatory, and judicial
assets                                obstacles to the rapid sale of AGD-owned assets, and
propose solutions to overcome them.
1.4 Business plan imnplementation     Develop and implement a business plan for the AGD.

effectively respond to its new responsibilities in the areas of
bank restructuring, asset sales and bank privatization.
Establish comprehensive training program for all AGD
staff.
1.6 Upgrading of information technology.   Improve AGD's information technology infrastructure
(hardware and software) to allow AGD to monitor
performance of banks under its control, keep an adequate
database of all distressed assets, and organize the rapid
asset sale and disposition process. The proposed IT program
is also intended to allow AGD to regularly disclose its
financial information and rapidly prepare reports on its
transactions as requested by financial authorities.
1.7 Management and sale of assets     Maximize recoveries, in the shortest possible time, and
organize and implement a process of promotion, search for
potential buyers, marketing and sale of the loan portfolios
and other assets of closed banks under AGD administration.

the understanding that the remaining 70% will be covered
from the management proceeds or, if not sufficient, from
AGD's own resources.
1.8 Due diligence                     Carry out due diligence of significant assets conforming the
loan portfolios of closed banks controlled by the AGD.

a success fee financed out of the proceeds of the sale),
authorities will need to contract separate external audits,
legal advisors, and its own privatization advisors to monitor
the performance of the investment bankers. Bank financing
will cover 30% of all advisory fees. The privatization
advisor would be fully financed by the Bank with the
proceeds of this loan.

enforcement capacities for bank supervision  organization and human resources policies, quality
control systems, enhanced prudential regulations
that comply with Basle Core Principles,
strengthening extra-situ supervision, including risk
models and an updated chart of accounts, and the
upgrading of information systems of the
Superintendency of Banks. The CAF component
would focus on strengthening the Project
Coordination Unit. To ensure adequately
coordination, the IDB, CAF and the World Bank
will sign a Memorandum, which will stipulate the
schedule of regular consultations among the three
institutions, and the coordination of the supervision
activities regarding the component of the
Superintendency of Banks.

framework for corporate and household debt corporate and household debt restructuring to allow viable
restructuring;                         firns to rapidly restore their solvency and profitability. This
strategy should be adequately linked to the recovery
program of the financial sector. The main principles would
be to encourage voluntary market based restructuring of
corporate debt through a wide set of options including
debt-equity swaps, interest rate reduction, debt write-offs,
etc. The program would also foster operational restructuring
and the adoption of improved corporate governance in
Ecuadorian firms to improve the long term competitiveness
of Ecuador's corporate sector.
Support will also be provided to strengthen the government's
capacity to implement the corporate and household debt
restructuring program and achieve effective institutional
coordination among the different governmental institutions
involved. Improvement of coordination will be achieved
through the collection and analysis of corporate financial
data, as well as through acquisition of appropriate
equipment and provision of training.

Annex 4: Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
ECUADOR: Financial Sector TA Loan
Summary of benefits and costs:
The project is a technical-assistance operation focused on institutional-building (for the Banking
Superintendency and the Deposit Guarantee Agency), improvement of the management of commercial
banks temporarily under public control, and development of a debt-restructuring program. As such, it is
not amenable to calculation of internal rates of return. Although the benefits are indirect, if policy-makers
prove receptive, these can be expected to be high in relation to its costs. The collapse of the banking
system has had a massive cost for Ecuador, at various levels, including decreasing GDP, deteriorating
living standards, and the huge cost to the National Treasury. The Treasury has issued bonds totaling
US$1 .6b issued to cope with the crisis and is likely to have to issue more. (Annual interest of ten percent
on the bond issues amounts to US$160m, well in excess of public health expenditure totaling US$125m
and almost half of the US$355m going to education.) If the project succeeds in making the Banking
Superintendency and AGD more effective, future disasters of this magnitude can be prevented. By making
the AGD more effective and improving the magnitude of the banks temporarily under public control, the
project is expected to improve asset recovery significantly beyond what would otherwise occur. The
project should enable banks now under public ownership to return sooner to the private sector; and at a
higher price, than they otherwise would.
The project will operate through specific consultancies rather than through a single overall consultancy.
This is expected to work more efficiently and effectively. Not only would the use of specific consultancies
open a wider range of choice to the borrower, it will be able to seek the lowest-cost, highest-quality services
for each particular problem to be addressed under the operation.
The fiscal cost of the technical assistance can be expected to be marginal relative to the reduction in the
public deficit it would probably produce. In addition, by contributing to a more stable macroeconomic and
banking environment, the operation can be expected significantly to contribute to overall economic stability
and growth, with corresponding positive consequences for the public finances.
Main Assumptions:
The assumption on which the project is based is that there will be an adequate supporting economic and
political environment. While staff believe the project can proceed and have solid longer-term positive
consequences even if macroeconomic stabilization is delayed, stabilization and recovery would significantly
improve the project's ultimate effectiveness. The project would-be severely affected, however, if the
economic and political environment becomes disordered, which can not be discarded at this point.
Cost-effectiveness indicators:
Asset-recovery indicators:
Speed, efficiency and quality with which AGD banks are prepared for privatization
Indicators of the improvement of the quality of the banking regulatory and supervisory activities eventually
to comply with Basle Standards

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
ECUADOR: Financial Sector TA Loan
Procurement
The project will: (a) strengthen banking supervision; (b) strengthen the Deposit Insurance Agency (AGD);
and (c) assist restructuring debt of Ecuadorian private corporations and households. The project would be
financed in parallel by the World Bank, ADC and IDB but no co-financing will be included (see Section
C. 1). All World Bank procurement activities would be carried out by the UEGI in the SB. A procurement
capacity assessment was carried out on the implementing agency and it was concluded that the procurement
overall risk is high in this operation, particularly because of the complexity of some of the consultant
services. An Action Plan (AP) was discussed with the SB to improve upstart procurement activities and
internal instructions on procedures.
Consulting services and goods for World Bank-financed activities in the project would be procured,
respectively, in accordance with the provisions of the World Bank Guidelines for Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers published January 1997, revised in September
1997, and January 1999, and the Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits,
published in January 1995, and revised in September 1997, and January 1999. The project costs and
arrangements are described below and summarized in Tables A and B.
One ICB package is expected for several groups of computing equipment for approximately US$900,000.
No NCB is expected for contracts of goods since the World Bank loan would finance only a small amount
of computing equipment and updates to hardware and software for some offices in the AGD. However, if
at any point during the implementation, goods are required in contract packages costing more than US
$100,000 these contracts would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures.
Smaller purchases costing less than US $ 100,000 will be carried out through International/National
shopping up to an aggregate of US $ Imillion Software and information technology equipment would be
procured directly from suppliers holding proprietary rights or patents of original of equipment or software
to be updated, up to an aggregate of US $20,000
Consultants' services would be the bulk of the procurement activities in the project, with services focused
principally on legal, advisory, banking restructuring, public auditing, banking supervision, and training.
Large contracts are expected during the life of the project with several contracts above US $200,000
equivalent. Substantive work has been advanced in defining terms of reference (TORs) for critical tasks in
the project. QCBS will be the preferred methodology for contracts where the sale of public sector assets
would be involved. QCBS would also be used for all other contracts above US $75,000 equivalent.
Services from consultants' firms estimated to cost less than US $75,000 would be procured utilizing
Consultants Qualification procedures (CQ). A number of consulting services from international and
national individual consultants, up to an aggregate of US $500,000 equivalent, would be procured as
described in Chapter V of the Guidelines. The individual limit for this type of contracts will be US
$50,000. For contracts above US $30,000 Bank's prior review and approval would be required. The
Annual Procurement Plan (PAC) would identify the critical procurement activities. Counterpart funds
would finance all long-term contracts in the project and in the UEGI. Concerning operational costs the
World Bank financing will be limited to training activities of the UEGI staff and will be disbursed on the
basis of an agreed annual plan.
- 27 -



PROCUREMENT PLANNING
The Global Procurement Plan (GPAC) was presented during negotiations and will be the master guide for
all procurement activities during the life of the project. Annual PACs will be agreed upon each year based
on the Annual Action Plan (POA). Project costs by procurement arrangements are presented in Table A.
PROCUREMENT STAFFING
The UEGI will be responsible for executing all procurement activities in the project. The UEGI has been
recently organized under very strong and capable leadership. It is staffed in sufficient number of
experienced professionals competent in local and World Bank procurement. The capacity assessment
reflects minor adjustments to the intemnal arrangements which will be included in the Operating Manual
(OM) for the project. The purpose is to ensure best procurement outcomes in a project where critical paths
would depend significantly on efficiency and timing of procurement actions in the UEGI. In view of the
very intensive program in the pipeline, the UEGI may contract individual consultants to provide specific
procurement assistance at peak times.

Procurement Assessment carried out for the project revealed that special provisions, as agreed upon for
loans with Ecuador, are still applicable and are included in the legal agreement for purposes of ensuring
that contracts can be concluded and implemented in the most efficient manner.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
A LAC FMS carried out the required financial management assessment in accordance with OD/BP 10.02.
Prior to the FMS visiting the project, a qualified Consultant, under the supervision of the Bank FMS
assisted project management in establishing appropriate project financial management arrangements. By
loan effectiveness, the project will have an installed computerized financial monitoring system, capable of
producing PMRs on a regular an timely basis, observing generally accepted accounting standards and
satisfying the Bank's reporting requirements. Hence, loan disbursements will be made on the basis of PMRs
from the inception of project implementation.
A Project Coordination Unit (UEGI), already fully staffed with qualified professionals, with clear
delineation of responsibilities within an organization structure agreed with the Bank, vouches for an
efficient and effective management of all areas of project implementation, including its financial
management. The UEGI will be audited by an independent firm. The terms of reference for the independent

audit as well as the short list of firms to be invited to bid for these services will be sent to the Bank as soon
as possible, and the firm selected for performing the project audit will be hired within 90 days after loan
effectiveness.
All financial management issues of the TAL will be the responsibility of the Project Coordination Unit
(UEGI). For that purpose, an Administrative and Financial Coordination has been established within the
UEGI. The Coordination consists of a coordinator (head), a Disbursement Assistant, a Procurement Officer
and an Officer for Budget Planning and Monitoring. Responsibilities of each of them are detailed in the
Operating Manual of the UEGI, as well as in its Annex 1, the Manual for the Financial and Administrative
Coordination.
Main responsibilities of the Administrative and Financial Coordination include:
*   Manage, control and supervise the efficient use of financial resources, as well as transparency and
compliance with World Bank procedures and sound financial practices.
*   Supervise that procurement of goods and services complies with all World Bank guidelines and
procedures along with the operat ing plans of the project.
* Prepare all financial information on the TAL project including sources and uses of funds, budget
execution, transfers, etc.
*   Control and efficiently manage the budget, keep records, reports and files of the financial management
of the TAL.
Coordinate the preparation of funds' cash flows every three months, as well on an annual basis
*   Supervise the update of procedures and controls for disbursement, accounting and budget.
* Supervise the development and irnplementation of a system of financial management to administer the
Project, as well as all required procedures and controls for disbursement and budget, making sure that
the Investment Project is adequately monitored.
*   Coordinate and control the flow of funds, reporting to authorities about disbursements and any other
relevant financial information required for the adequate execution of the project.
*   Prepare and provide all the financial information required by external auditors.
*   Train all UEGI staff to ensure compliance with the World Bank guidelines on financial management,
including requests of funds, reports of expenditures, establishment of internal controls and reports on
the disbursements of the TA fun(ds.
Responsibility for managing the accounts and consolidating accounts will rest on the Accountant of the
Financial and Administrative Coorclination of the UEGI. Project management reports will be prepared
according to the agreed format (see project files). The Financial and Administrative Coordination of the
UEGI will be responsible for preparing them. Project management reports will have to be submitted
quarterly by January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year. The PMR will also serve as the
basis for disbursement.
Report formats to be used for the flow of funds have been established according to World Bank guidelines.

The Special Account:
The Agent Account will be opened in the central bank, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, in
the name of the Project Coordination Unit. This account will have an authorized allocation that cannot
exceed US$ 2,000,000. Funds to this account will be flowing based on a six-month budget included in the
PMR that will be submitted to the Bank quarterly along with a withdrawal application 1903-A.
Funds from the SA should be used exclusively for eligible expenditure under the loan. Any advance from
the special account to the project account to pay for eligible expenditures under the loan should not exceed
the necessity of 15 days of expenditures.
The counter part fund will be disbursed into a project account opened in a commercial bank.
Use PMR and supporting documentation:
Supporting documentation will be held at the UEGI, for at least on year after the end of the fiscal year in
which the last disbursement would take place, for Bank and auditors review. These documents would

Annex No.: 11
Deposit Insurance Agency
ECI;ADOR: Financial Sector TA Loan
I. PREFACE
Since the beginning of the Ecuadorian banking crisis, 16 out of 40 domestic private banks have
failed. The Government has taken control of all failed banks which together represent close to 60% of the
banking system in terms of assets. Nine out of the sixteen banks are currently in the process of liquidation,
two other banks "currently under saneamiento", are expected to be declared in liquidation by the end of
March, 2000, while the other five remain open.

The Deposit Insurance Agency (AGD), established in December 1998, is responsible for (i)
repaying the deposit guarantee, (ii) managing and disposing assets of all closed banks, and (iii)
administering the remaining intervened banks until they can be privatized. As of December 31, 1999, assets
of closed banks amounted to approximnately US$ 1 billion dollars, representing 10% of Ecuador's GDP,
while assets of remaining open banks amounted to US $1.4 billion. As shown in the table, four open banks
are in the process of merging.
Given the nature of its responsibilities, AGD will play a crucial role in resolving the banking crisis.
In particular, a rapid sale of assets, along with an expedited reprivatization of open banks would contribute
not only to reduce the fiscal cost of the crisis, but also to restore confidence in the banking system.
Moreover, if the process of asset management and disposition is accompanied by a program of debt
restructuring for domestic firms, the pace of economic recovery could be speeded up by giving enterprises
better conditions to repay their debt.
A delay in selling assets would increase the fiscal cost of the crisis and prolong uncertainty in the
domestic markets. Furthermore, if the AGD is not strict in forcing banks to execute guarantees and
foreclose assets, the current culture of non-repayment could be further extended. Such a situation, in which
solvent borrowers become unwilling to repay, would force the Government to assume and socialize banks'
losses.
At this stage of the crisis, there is limited understanding of the risks and costs of a poorly designed
or implemented program of asset management and disposition. Furthermore, asset management and
disposition are still seen as activities unrelated to the real sector recovery, and no specific program has been
established for restructuring the debt of domestic firms and households.
- 38 -



For these reasons, one of the main areas of technical assistance will focus in establishing a
business plan for the AGD that properly links asset management and disposition with the overall bank and
real sector restructuring programs, and enables AGD to establish specific targets and goals. The proposed
technical assistance for AGD will also focus in the following three areas: (i) institutional strengthening of
AGD, (ii) asset management, and due diligence and sale of assets, and (iii) administration and eventual
reprivatization of banks.
H. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHIENING OF THE AGD
During the first half of 1999, a qualified international consulting firm provided assistance to the
AGD to strengthen its institutional capacity and outline a business plan to accomplish its goals.
Unfortunately, the work initiated by the consulting firm was interrupted due to changes in the senior
management of the main financial sector Government agencies of Ecuador, including the AGD.
Since July 1999 there is a new senior management at the AGD. Under the new management, many
problems have been rapidly addressed. However, the challenges faced by the AGD are still considerable.
One of the main constraints is the lack of local expertise in the areas of asset management and sale both in
the public and private sectors. Moreover, the AGD still needs to adapt its organizational structure.
Currently, decision-making is slow and centralized. Additionally, the AGD faces budgetary constraints
derived from among other things, its extraordinary expenses to pay audits of banks during the first half of
1999.
A second major institutional weakness of the AGD is that it does not have its own information
technology infrastructure. It relies on the system of Filanbanco. The system, however, needs to be
transferred to the AGD, because Filanbanco is being merged with Previsora and the resulting bank will
eventually be sold. The AGD should have the minimum information technology infrastructure available to
support its operations in asset management and sale, ensure that all banks under its control are effectively
monitored, and disclose its financial information on a regular basis.
A third major weakness of the AGD is that it is poorly prepared to face public criticism derived
from the sale of assets at low prices. Furthermore, under current circumstances, it is highly vulnerable to
interest groups that will be affected by the sale of assets or execution of guarantees. Unlike asset
management and sales agencies of some other countries, the AGD's staff are not legally protected from
decisions that they make to rapidly sell and dispose assets.
The proposed technical assistance to the AGD will focus on improving the quality of its human
resources, developing and implementing a training program, making the minimum information technology
infrastructure available, developing an organizational structure that adequately responds to its mandate,
and securing legal protection for its staff.
m. ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SALE
As of March, 1, 2000, no assets had been sold. Given its limited capacity and lack of experience
in asset management or sale, AGD is determined to subcontract the sale, or management and sale of assets,
to the private sector.
The AGD has already established an asset inventory system using the existing infrastructure of
Filanbanco. As of March, 2000, the AGD had completed the inventory of all closed banks controlled by
the AGD.
- 39 -



AGD has announced that it will carry out the first auction of assets at the end of March, mostly
computers, automobiles, paintings and ATM. There are several steps that the AGD must undertake before
being able to sell or sub-contract the management of the remaining assets to private companies: (i)
determine those assets to be sold and prepare files of each one of them, (ii) contract international firms
companies to carry out valuations of those assets with a value greater than US $500,000 million (basically
from the loan portfolio), (iii) determine the best strategy according to the type of assets to be sold/managed,
existing market conditions and potential buyers, and finally (iv) sell the assets.
The AGD has received assistmce from a qualified international consulting firm which has helped it
to establish the asset inventory system, develop manuals for asset management and due diligence, outline a
business plan, providing direct assistance to the manaagement of AGD.
The proposed technical assistance to the AGD includes hiring a permanent resident advisor to
assist AGD in formulating a business plan and implementing it. The advisor should also help the AGD to
apply existing manuals, overcome operational difficulties, select the most appropriate strategies for asset
sale and disposition, and assist in the hiring and monitoring of audit firms and asset management and
disposition companies. In addition, the technical assistance will be used to finance valuations of the largest
AGD's assets to provide a reference price for the sale of the assets.
Rapid Sale vs. Asset Management
Given the current macroeconomic conditions, the sale price of assets are likely be low if they are
sold at this time. Theoretically, asset management is a reasonable goal when asset prices are temporarily
depressed. The problem of asset management in a crisis situation is that it is difficult to foresee when
market conditions will improve. In addlition, holding assets for longer periods entails several risks: high
costs associated to the management of assets, politicization of the asset management process, corruption,
poor results in terms of foreclosure and execution of guarantees, deterioration in asset values and delay in
obtaining sales proceeds.
The proposed technical assistance to the AGD will focus on giving advice on how to select the sale
strategy that maximizes the value of each type of asset in the shortest period of time, as well implement the
process of marketing, and search of potential buyers. Technical assistance will aim to ensure that assets
are sold as rapidly as possible and asset management is done only on a temporary basis, provided that it is
technically justifiable.
Sale of Assets
It should be clear that there are several obstacles and challenges that need to be addressed for
selling assets. Firstly, banks' lending portfolios need to be restructured, otherwise the selling price of those
assets will be extremely low. Neither the AGD nor any other financial authority has started to prepare a
scheme for debt restructuring.
Secondly, banks under control of the AGD need to start execution of guarantees of those loans
where the debtor is no longer able to repay its loan or the loan cannot be restructured on reasonable terms.
Currently, banks under AGD control have not started to foreclose loans on a large scale basis. Unnecessary
delay in executing guarantees may increase the risks of a widespread non-repayment attitude of debtors.
The proposed technical assistance will support the analysis of potential legal, regulatory, and
- 40 -



judicial obstacles for rapid sale and transfer of assets to private investors either domestic or foreign, as well
as proposals to resolve them.
IV. MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATIZATION OF BANKS
There are five banks under government control that remain open: Continental, Pacifico
Filanbanco, Previsora and Popular. Of those banks, Continental and Pacifico are currently in the process
of merging, as are Filanbanco and Previsora. The AGD aims to privatize all these banks. The
privatization of those banks may be difficult, given the current macroeconomic conditions.
For that purpose, the AGD has decided to sub-contract the management of those banks to bankers
with international experience or investment banks who will maximize their value and prepare them for their
privatization. For that purpose, the AGD will review the governance structure of those banks, and the new
management is expected to carry out the required operational and financial restructuring of those banks.
The proposed technical assistance will support the AGD in finding an advisor to identify potential
managers, establish eligibility criteria, prepare management contracts, and design remuneration schemes for
the new administrators. The technical assistance will also focus on supporting the ultimate goal of
privatizing those banks as soon as possible. In particular, the technical assistance would be used for hiring
a privatization advisor which helps the government to rapidly accomplish all the stages required to sell the
banks to qualified strategic investors.

Banldng Regulation and Supervision
ECUADOR: Financial Sector TA Loan
I. Introduction
The Government is determined to improve and accelerate the process of restructuring the
Superintendencia de Bancos (SB) thus improving its capability to carry out bank supervision regulatory
activities, to meet Basle Core Principles, including consolidated supervision. Technical assistance will
permit the contracting of expert advice, latest information technology and training, all essential to advance
improvements in bank supervision. Project components in the area of the SB have been defined in terms of
broad and indicative categories which have been analyzed for soundness and impact. The present critical
situation of the banking system, coupled with the current weak bank supervision mandate that most of the
technical assistance components be started in the year 2000.
II. Banking Supervision
The cost of Ecuador's current financial sector crisis demonstrates that the current structure of
financial sector supervision needs change. While the roots of the crisis are multiple, a lack of effective
fnancial sector supervision, especially the pre-crisis reluctance of senior management to take prompt
corrective actions in troubled institutions when problems were first detected, has greatly increased the costs
of resolution. Although there is a core competence of supervisors, fundamental changes are needed in the
managerial decisiveness and in the institutional structure of financial sector supervision.
The TAL also aims at strengthening in situ supervision of the Superintendency of Banks, providing
training to bank examiners, complementary audits, and legal reforms. This component is part of a global
project to strengthen the Superintendency of Banks led by the IDB, the CAF and the World Bank. The IDB
program will focus on strengthening prudential regulation, extra-situ supervision, human resources at the
Superintendency of Banks and information technology infrastructure. The CAF component would focus on
strengthening the Project Coordination Unit.
Areas of improvements include:
1. Strengthening of in-situ supervision
In-situ inspections by supervisors that first and foremost emphasize the quality of management
and analyze the extent of risks incurred by the institution being examined. In addition, the in-situ inspection
should analyze the credit quality of loans, the electronic data systems, the adequacy of internal controls and
the sufficiency of internal and external audits. The inspectors should in all instances analyze the
consolidated operations of a financial. institution, insuring that risks in the off-shore operations are included
in the consolidation. This should be followed by regular, systematic and timely communication of the
results, including the bank's rating, to the top management and board of directors. Training of supervisors,
including data processing specialists, will be paramount in this component.
2. Strengthening of extra-situ supervision
Strengthening extra-situ anallysis, in order to improve detection of problem banks, through better
-42 -



early warning indicators and stress testing.
3. Information Systems
Information systems based on proper accounting (including a new chart of accounts) and
disclosure standards that allow supervisors to detect weaknesses or inappropriate practices promptly, as
well as to provide accurate information to fnancial institutions, the investment community, and to the
public to assess risk in financial institutions, in solo and consolidated basis.
Financial sector supervisors do not have access to timely and accurate information on financial
institutions. As the SB information systems are inadequate and financial support is being considered by the
IDB. Currently, analysts prepare their reports based on data inputted on Excel pages and stored on their
individual PC. The data prepared by the analysts is available on a consolidated basis only after
considerable manual input, and is not always reliable. There are a few reasons for this problem, a) the
incentives, both financial and penal, to assure the provision of accurate and reliable information by
supervised institutions are insufficient, b) the SB hardware and some of its software systems are
inadequate, c) the work of the external auditors should be evaluated by supervisory officials; and d)
systematic and periodic evaluations of the information systems of financial institutions should be conducted
during on-site inspections to ensure that they meet basic standards and generate accurate information in a
timely manner.
The information systems require a thorough analysis of the output forwarded to examiners,
analysts, directors and the Superintendent. Also, additional systems hardware should be available in order
to ensure recovery of data and continuing of operations in the event of an emergency. With the proceeds of
the proposed TAL, corrective measures to address these problems could be initiated quickly. In some cases
the imnplementation period is a medium-term process, as it requires the formation of new groups/teams of
examiners. Considering the lack of expertise in the country, these groups/teams should be headed for a
period of time by international consultants. This is especially true in the area of systems analysis and
systems review by on-site inspectors. Currently the SB does not have the capability to review the accuracy
of the electronic data systems of the banks, since it does not have a single examiner with the expertise in
this area.
4. Legislative Changes
A legal and regulatory framework which creates appropriate financial incentives for prudent
practices by financial institutions and requires prompt corrective actions when problems are detected,
including a well defined process for initiating impartial remedial actions against financial institutions that
have or are developing problems that might threaten their viability and clear procedures for dealing with
insolvent banks. Laws and regulations intended to serve prudential purposes of sustaining a safe and sound
banking system need to be made more credible and compliance needs to be improved.
A series of reforms in the Ley General de Instituciones Del Sector Financiero (LGISF) and other
legislation need to be introduced to improve the capabilities of authorities to supervise the sector
effectively in the new dollarized environment (i.e. clarify the respective powers of the Banking Board and
Superintendency of Banks) and to create more effective incentives for institutions to conduct sound
financial practices. To a large degree these changes are necessary to bring supervision up to international
(Basle) standards. Institutional structure changes could consider liberalizing of bank secrecy statutes to
provide more and better information on debtors to fnancial institutions and the public at large, and to
strengthen payment culture. Additionally, regulations to the LGISF should be issued to allow efficient
-43 -



supervision of financial groups on a consolidated basis and to progressively bring the banking supervisory
activities in Ecuador up to international standards.
5. Institutional Structure
A reform of the institutional structure of financial sector supervision is needed to create an
effective regulatory mentality and capacity. Principles guiding the reform should ensure that the
supervisory body is divorced as much as possible from political intervention, that decision makers are free
of conflict of interest and have sufficient technical knowledge of banking supervision and fmancial sector
operations to provide effective leadership; and that the terms of the executive and directorate encourage
stability.
The SB in Ecuador is independent of the Central Bank and is accountable to Congress, a format
not uncommon in Latin America. The Banking Council (BC) (Junta Bancaria) is the SB collegiate body
which frames and issues regulations, and to takes the necessary actions with respect to capital deficient
financial institutions. The SB has vigilance and control over both public and private institutions of the
financial system including banks and non bank financial institutions. The Superintendent is appointed for a
four year term. However, since October 1995, the country has had five Superintendents which indicates the
lack of stability. The BC, to create a balance of key policy makers is composed of the general manager of
the Central Bank, the Superintendent of Banks, two members elected by the Board of Directors of the
Central Bank, and one member elected by the above named members. Members serve for six years.
6. Training and human resource policy
The SB has drafted, but not irnplemented, a human resource policy in which hiring is to be based
on transparent and competitive processes and promotion decisions and salary levels are based on the
function, professional merit, efficiency, as well as internal equity and external competition. In addition, the
institution has prepared profiles of all staff, based upon which their appropriateness for their specific
position will be determined.
The development of examiners is neither focused nor centralized. No formal training strategies and
programs have been developed to address the needs of entry level examiners or of analysts and examiners
with two, five or ten years experience. Plans or benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the examiners
have not been developed. More training especially in the area of risk analysis and credit analysis and for
specialized operations is needed. The training would ensure that the current manuals for on-sight
supervision are reviewed and updated. New manuals should be developed for examiners involved in the
areas of reviewing the audit coverage by the internal and external auditors. As mentioned previously, the
SB lacks expertise in the area of review of automated systems, and manuals and training should be
introduced for the examination of electronic data information systems.
In order to address the above matters, the SB needs to revisit the policy already prepared and
develop and implement a comprehensive training and human resources program.
7. Additional/ComplementaryAudits
The SB is also responsible for the supervision of the Sociedades Financieras (fmance companies)
(SF), which represent approximately 1 0% of the financial system. The SB plans to conduct on-site
inspections of these in early 2001, with the assistance of outside auditors. In addition, the International
-44 -



Audits conducted in April/May of this year carried out evaluations of 75% of the loan portfolios of all the
financial institutions audited. In order to review the remaining 25% of the loan portfolio, the SB has
assigned various examination teams. Outside consultants will serve the purpose of evaluating the loan
portfolio analysis done by the SB teams of the domestic banks and the off-shore entities, and field-test the
manual of examination. In addition the external auditors will evaluate the quality and strength of the net
worth of the financial entities and their internal controls.
m. Intensified Supervision by World Bank Staff
In light of the precarious state of banking supervision and an institutional improvement program,
closer and frequent bank supervision is warranted. It is recommended that missions visit at least each
quarter. Additionally, to ensure adequately coordination, the IDB, CAF and the World Bank will sign a
Memorandum, which will stipulate the schedule of each institution's regular consultations and supervision
activities regarding the component of the Superintendency of Banks.
IV. A Guide to Annual Evaluation of Banking Supervision
To measure institutional progress, annual indicators of performance will be used.
Performance indicators fall in two general categories: a) Objective, quantifiable measures that
focus primarily on process; b) Judgment-based, qualitative measures that focus primarily on results.

Overview of the Ecuadorian Banking System
ECUADOR: Financial Sector TA Loan
1. Introduction - The Ecuadorian banking sector is one of the smaller systems in Latin America and is
currently composed of 40 banks with a network of 1,340 branches around the country; it entails 90% of
total assets of the financial system, compared with 10% held by the NBFIs. As of September 30, 1999,
total assets amounted to US$ 9 billion and capital US$ 700 million; a decrease of $4.3 billion of total
assets and US$ 600 million in banks' equity in nine months. Four large international banks have
subsidiaries in Ecuador, with a 6% share of the banking system. Six development banks and 56 NBFI
(those not belonging to any bank group) which represent 10% of total financial sector are not included in
this overview. The Government's control of total assets has increased from 2% to 59% in the last two
years. Most lending activities involve the commercial sector and large borrowers, which are located around
the two largest cities - Guayaquil (61%) and Quito (27%).

International banks experienced during 1999 a significant "flight to quality." Since December 31, 1998,
through November 30, 1999, the deposits at these subsidiaries have increased by about 50%.

2. Off-shore banldng - Offshore banking activities play an irnportant role and represent 32% of the
-46 -



Ecuadorian banking assets. Every large and mid-sized bank controls one or more off-shore branch or
subsidiary either in tax havens or in regular financial centers. In many cases off-shore subsidiaries are just
legal names with which local banks carry out transactions without being subject to local supervision and
regulations. Both deposits and lending mostly take place within the country through these offshore
subsidiaries which at times are nothing more than a registered name in an offshore financial center. The
main incentives for the public to open offshore accounts are confidentiality and to avoid taxes; for the
banks to avoid reserve requirements. Since the SB has not been able to perform efficient consolidated
supervision, some banks have hidden their losses in their offshore balance sheets.
3. The crisis - Bank failures started over the course of 1998. In August 1998, a medium-sized bank
collapsed (Prestamos) and liquidity needs rose for the system, critically affecting the second largest bank
(Filanbanco). There were several deposit runs, and some 25% of the banks finally suffered from liquidity
shortages. Filanbanco failed then in late 1998 and was nationalized, and its owners were dispossessed.
The authorities decided to keep the bank open and over the remainder of 1999 the Treasury issued US$ 540
million to recapitalize this bank. Over the course of January and February of 1999, several smaller banks
and financial institutions failed.
In March 1999, some banks suffered intense withdrawal pressure and the Government declared
that all system deposits would be frozen for one year and that banks would undergo audits by international
firms to determine which were viable. These audits were completed in June.
Following a plan adopted by the Government, banks were classified in three groups: "A", "B",
and "C" banks. The "A" banks meeting Ecuador's capital adequacy ratio of at least 9% were allowed to
continue functioning as before (19 banks); the " B" banks, not meeting that standard but with positive
capital, were legally required to increase their capital immediately to 9%. The Government owned
Filanbanco, provided subordinated loans of US$ 147 million to the four banks that fell in that category; and
" C" banks, with negative capital, were taken over by the AGD. To date three of the " B" banks have failed
and the fourth bank repaid the subordinated loan in full November, 1999.
As a result of the situation described above as of end- 1999, five of the eight large banks are in
public hands.

Public                   4.383            Private                   1.947
The liquidity position of banks has deteriorated. The Central Bank (CB) between November and
mid-January 2000 sharply increased the interbank rate from approximately 60%, to 180% p.a.
Concurrently, the 90 day Reference Rate on deposits taken at the CB during that period increased from
around 50%, to 200%. In addition, to further tighten liquidity, the CB severely restricted its repurchase
operations which it normally conducted with the private and government owned banks. Since mid January
the interest rates have come down dramatically. The interbank interest rate at the end of February was
- 47 -



between 21% and 24%. The interest rates charged by the banks on loans fluctuates between 40 and 45%
and the interest rate paid on the liabilities is around 20% to 25%.
The quality of the credit portiolio is deteriorating rapidly, even under the somehow unrealistic
assumption that the current level of provisions is accurate. Past Due Loans represent 28% of Total Loans;
Loan Loss Reserves comprise only 75% of Past Due Loans. It is unlikely that banks' financial statements
reflect the result of recent movements in interest and exchange rates on the quality of the credit portfolio.

Deposits amount to US$ 4.67 billion, of which US$ 2.2 billion remain frozen. Deposits show a
constant decline starting from the inception of the freeze date. External credit lines continue shrinking:
since December 1998 to September I5199, international credit lines have decreased by more than 50%.
Even though the total assets of mutual funds in the system is not available, a considerable amount
of mutual fund certificates were issued in the recent years, several of them marketed by banks. At least two
banks placed market instruments for US$ 400 million each. For one bank recently taken over by the AGD,
the losses in the assets value of the mutual fund represented 60% of its book value.
4. Deposit unfreeze - On February 6, the government announced the schedule for the unfreezing of
deposits at open banks. According to the announcement, depositors will receive their resources back in the
following manner: Up to US $4,000 will be paid in cash for each depositor. Any amount above $4,000 will
be paid with bonds. Bonds will be denominated in US dollars and will pay 7% interest. Maturity period of
bonds will range from 2 to 5 years depending on the amount of the deposit and the initial currency of it.
Senior citizens will receive up to $20,000 in cash and the rest in bonds. With this measure, the government
plans to return fully the deposits of 92% of all depositors at open banks.
-48 -



5. Dollarization - Following recently approved legislation, Ecuador's monetary system has now been
"dollarized". The new monetary regime implies the adoption by Ecuador of the US dollar as the actual
currency in circulation in the country for all practical purposes even if legally the Sucre remains the
country's official legal tender. A description of the full features of the new system is clearly out of the
scope of this note, nevertheless, we need to point out that dollarization will have a significant number of
practical consequences for commercial-bank operations. For example, banks with a dollar long position
will no longer benefit from the revaluation adjustment arising from exchange-rate depreciation, and will
therefore lose what has been an important means of maintaining capital adequacy. Similarly, banks will
no longer benefit from inflation adjustment of fixed-asset values. On the contrary, repayment capacity
will improve for those debtors that did not have income in dollars. A particularly important point in the
present context, of course, is that commercial banks will no longer have access to a conventional
central-bank liquidity window. The authorities are considering various approaches to institute a
practical substitute for this "lender-of-last-resort"
Under the new legislation, the Central Bank of Ecuador will repurchase the outstanding Sucre
currency issue for dollars at a rate of S./25,000 per dollar. Interest rates in Sucres have been reset: as
sucre asset balances are redenominated in dollars, their interest rates are to be reset to 16.82 percent per
year; similarly, interest rates on liability balances are to be reset to 9.3 5 percent.

Annex No.: 14
Corporate and Household Restructuring
EClJADOR: Financial Sector TA Loan
I. General Aspects
Corporate restructuring must be integrated with the program to restructure the financial sector to
preserve employment, the productive capacity of the country and, ultimately, the revenue base of the State.
Corporate restructuring should be designed to restore firm viability, preserve employment, productive
capacity and stimulate renewed corporate growth, and reduce poverty. This includes restructuring-of the
debt, debt write-downs and stretch outs, changes in shareholdings and management and the operational
restructuring of the firm. Great care must be taken that such a program not be a corporate "bailout" with
all related moral hazard issues.
The vast majority of corporations are: privately held. Of the largest 1000 enterprises in Ecuador, 910 are
private and the rest are public or foreign; they have 75 percent of the assets, 81 percent of the equity, and 75
percent of sales. In 1998, the capital structure was 61 percent debt (37 percent short-term and 24 percent
long-term) and the share of equity was 39 percent. Thus the average debt equity ratio was about 1.6 in 1998. Of
the 910 enterprises, only 56 have any external ownership. About 29% of enterprises are dedicated to exports, 71
percent produce for the local market. The average number of employees in an enterprise is 120. The 910
enterprises have 27,400 shareholders with 76 percent being in the Sierra and 24 percent on the Coast ( the number
of enterprises is equally split between the Coast and Sierra). Only 19 firms are listed on the stock exchange.
Corporate debt in Ecuador is composed of a high level of dollar denominated debt, the bulk of it is
concentrated in a small number of enterprises (and significant amounts of lending was made to
shareholders). Widespread dollar denominated borrowing by small and medium enterprises, while small in
total amount, has caused serious distress and is a major political issue.
High Level of Dollar Denominated Debt A particularly significant aspect of the problem is that,
in recent years, Ecuadorian companies and individuals have taken on substantial dollar-denominated debt,
in most cases without having dollar-linked income flows. Also, automobile and small equipment loans
were almost all made in dollars, as are most upper-class home mortgages. Over 1999 the overall enterprise
debt burden doubled in Sucre terms with the devaluation from 6700 S/$ in December 1998 to 16700 S/$ in
October/November 1999 and went much higher with the January devaluation.
High Concentration of Loans & Sizeable Loans to Shareholders. The profile of debt shows
that a large portion of the loans are to a small percentage of customers. About 12% of debt is for loans
<$25000 but this comprises 99% of the number of borrowers. Note that 70% of debt is in loans of
>$250,000.
Widespread Non-Payment of Loans. The majority of enterprises have stopped paying debts
(particularly when the bank to which the debt is owed was intervened in by the supervisory authorities).
There is a wide spread anticipation that the GOE will do a "debt forgiveness" program as it has on 6
occasions since 1989 for CFN loans. Only a clear, national program that eliminates this possibility will
create a new imperative to make loan payments. It is estimated that 90% of SMIE debtors have stopped
repaying. The bankruptcy system in Ecuador is not effective.
During the Asian economic crisis, the bank and the IMF agreed at the most senior level that the
- 50 -



Bank would take the lead in the critical area of corporate restructuring; that leadership now clearly has
carried over to the Latin America Region
II. Corporate Restructuring Strategy Components Supported with the TA Loan
Corporate restructuring program must address the small entrepreneurs and enterprises (96% of
debtors owe loans less then $4,000, representing less then 6% of the portfolio of Banks) and allow the
financial system to concentrate on the restructuring and debt recovery of relatively few, large debtor
companies. Such triage should allow the small number of qualified debt and corporate restructuring
experts in Ecuador to concentrate on no more then 200 large debtors currently in default. The national
restructuring policy should be designed to assure equity and be, and be seen to be, designed to put the
unemployed back to work and work towards renewed economic growth.
The Bank, with the full support of the IMF and IDB, suggested an approach which favors small
borrowers and the recovery of the weakest portion of the financial sector portfolio. The Bank will assist
the Government to implement an effective and fair corporate restructuring program including broad
consultations with different sectors of the population. The key objectives and principles should include:
A corporate debt restructuring program that will aim to maintain and increase employment,
improve the liquidity position of corporates, avoid disruption in production, restore the capacity of viable
firms to repay their financial obligations and promote the growth and competitiveness of the Ecuadorian
economy.
A systematic approach to alleviate this crisis for small and medium enterprises and households,
which have been particularly hard hit by the current crisis.
A strategy for corporate restructuring and debt rescheduling in Ecuador to help ensure that
progress is made and that adequate financing is provided to viable companies while restructuring is taking
place.
The GOE role is to minimize obstacles to the restructuring process and to provide guidelines for a
voluntary but time-bound process, that debtors and creditors may follow.
Such programs must be of general application and not involve GOE bailouts of firms. The
obligation to repay and the credit risk shall remain with debtors and creditors. The Government needs to be
careful not to hold out the possibility of government funding to help finance restructuring, because the
possibility of such funding in the future can forestall restructuring today.
To be successful, corporate debt restructuring will also need to be accompanied by corporate
reorganization, including downsizing, mergers, and acquisitions and an improvement in the competitive
position of firms.
A "menu" of options is what the GOE needs and is interested in developing, with the support of the
TA Loan. The menu items will be designed so as to be easily integrated, developed and strengthened. The
menu items are outlined below:
Legal, Regulatory, and Administrative Reforms - immediate removal of a number of obstacles
to corporate restructuring and to strengthen the incentives to restructuring, a broad range of legal,
regulatory, and administrative reforms needs to be considered. This is distinct from the longer term
- 51 -



programs to strengthen the legal, regulatory and administration of justice programs of the Bank.
SME and Household Debt Restructuring - Special attention needs to be paid to the restructuring
of a large number of small and medium enterprises. Because of the extensive use of dollar denominated
loans not only in the SME sector but also in consumer loans, vehicle and equipment financing, mortgages
on land and houses, leases and other fImancial sector instruments, care must be taken to avoid partial or"
unfair" solutions for any group of debtors.
A Voluntary Framework to Facilitate Corporate Restructuring -The framework would consist
of a special regime, in the form of agreed but non-binding principles, to be established and implemented
under the guidance of a government authority, to which creditors and debtors would voluntarily subscribe.
The incentives to subscribe to these principles would consist primarily of creditors' and debtors' own
self-interest; accordingly, the regime can be viewed in large part as a coordination mechanism that would
help organize creditors' and debtors' efforts.
Restructuring Debt - Lengthening Maturity and Capitalizing Interest - The debtor will be
more likely to comply with the debt re-negotiated, including longer repayment terms and a principal
repayment grace period and a capped., maximum interest rate. The debtor may further have benefited from
a debt reduction through write-offs or other mechanisms such as debt/equity swaps or the issuance of stock
warrants.
*     3Debt to Equitv Conversions - This program would be designed to assist firms in lessening their
debt load and allow creditors to receive equity instruments which should, over the long term, increase total
debt recovery. This would also include programs to convert debts owed to shareholders to equity.
Using AGD, Private and Piublic Sector Domestic Creditor Cooperation as a Catalyst -The
mechanism we are proposing is similar to one used in the 1980s in Venezuela and other Latin American
countries to overcome the non-existence of adequate bankruptcy legislation and overcome obstacles posed
by a weak and slow judicial system. This mechanism becomes a "stick" to be used in case the "carrots"
offered under other menu items fail to mobilize a corporation to sit down and work positively work with its
creditors to reach a voluntary resolution to the problem of non-payment.
Bankruptcy Framework, including Government Supervised Corporate Restructuring - An
effective bankruptcy system is essential, both as a way of encouraging corporates to negotiate with their
creditors as well as a genuine means fbr expeditiously resolving disputes about arrears. Contested
bankruptcy proceedings and claims for unpaid obligations due are handled by Ecuador's judicial system.
Most such cases are handled by civil courts under Ecuador's commercial code, about seventy years old,
and widely regarded as outdated.
Support for this program would be funded under the TA Loan. The GOE would be able to use the
resources of the TA Loan but, it must be clear, that the Bank needs to play a major role in the short and
medium term to assure that the program is implemented as designed. We should play a role of honest
broker. The capacity of the GOE to implement such a comprehensive program, especially given the
commitment to dollarization and other structural reforms, is limited and will require significant Bank
support.
