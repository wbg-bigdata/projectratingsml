PREFACE
This report presents a Project Completion Report of the Argentina
First Railway Project for which Loan 733-AR for US$84.0 million equivalent
was approved on April 20, 1971.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Latin
America and Caribbean Regional Office. In accordance with the revised
procedures for project performance audit reporting, this PCR was read by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by
OED staff. The PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were
received.

HIGHLIGHTS
1.         The project was the first Bank loan for Argentina's
railways and was aimed at rehabilitation of the railway network.
However due to factors arising largely from the political and
economic conditions that prevailed in Argentina during the early
70's the investments and actions planned were not implemented
adequately and it was decided to cancel $27.5 million out of the
loan of $84.0 million (para. 1.03). The reduced amount of $56.5
million was used to finance 59 items which had been contracted up
to the extended project completion date of April 30, 1974.
2.         The project was based on FA's Investment Plan for the
five year period 1971-75 and comprised the first two years
(1971-72) of the Investment Plan together with a program of action
to improve the operations and financial position of the Argentine
Railways. Investments of $368 million were proposed during the
project period and the Bank loan of $84 million was to finance 23%
of the project or 49% of the foreign exchange cost. Subsequent to
the signing of the Loan Agreement, FA agreed, by exchange of
letters, to a time phased program for rationalization of services,
line closures, staff reductions, rehabilitation of diesel locos,
reorganization of workshops, and the introduction of commercial
policies and targets.
3.        The implementation of the project was adversely affected
from the start as the political and economic problems faced by the
country resulted in grossly inadequate levels of investments and
scant attention to the program of actions agreed with the Bank
(para. 3.01). Although the completion date of the project was
postponed to April 30, 1974, little progress was achieved and the
Bank offered the Government and FA one of two alternatives: a) to
renegotiate the loan on the basis of new targets and specific
actions to be taken by the Government and FA, or b) to cancel the
balance of the loan. The Government and FA chose the latter.
4.         The project was actually completed in 1980 instead of
1972, with a cost overrun of 11% (para. 3.03). As far as the loan
disbursements are concerned, it is relevant to mention that no
disbursements were made until 1973, and the year of the highest
disbursements was 1974 ($22.1 million) tapering off, in an
irregular fashion, to $1.4 million in 1979 (Table 3). Hardly any
action was taken by the Government or FA to seriously implement
any of the several action programs (para. 3.07), which showed the
direction in which the railway should have been reformed. On the
other hand substantial increases in the personnel strength of FA
took place which had no relation to the declining volumes of
traffic, and the management of FA was changed 11 times between
1971 and 1975.

5.         The economic rate of return of the project was estimated
during appraisal to be 21%. The ERR of the delayed and
inadequately implemented project has been recalculated at 10%
(Table 9) which is equivalent to the opportunity cost of capital
and represents a marginal return (para. 7.02).
6.         Other points of special interest in this project are the
following:
(i)  Although progress under the project was poor the
formation and strengthening of the central office of FA
(Oficina Central) was an unintended benefit of the
relationship with the Bank which led finally to the
creation and development of the Planning Office of FA
(para. 6.02).
(ii)  FA's report on the completion of the project concludes
that despite the fact that the project was not
implemented adequately, the Bank's contribution to the
medium term planning of FA was positive, the diagnosis
of the railway situation appropriate and that the
measures proposed were not only necessary but were
possible of implementation had the requisite political
and economic conditions existed at the time (para.
8.02).
(iii)  Bank's involvement with FA in the first railway project
tended to "orient" the railways and particularly the
Government towards judicious investments consistent with
the need for pruning and rationalization of railway
services. Those two factors in course of time, formed
the basis for the Second Railway Project currently under
implementation.



INTRODUCTION
1.01      Argentina has developed a highly diverse and extensive transport
network to integrate its 2.8 million km    of territory and to serve the needs
of its population of 28 million. The network includes 100,800 km of national
and provincial primary roads, 32,200 km of railways; 17,000 km of pipelines
for crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas; over 100 ports and 90
commercial airports. Following the worldwide trend, highways increasingly
represent the dominant mode. From 1965 to 1978, road transport's share of
cargo traffic increased from 47% of total inter-urban ton-km to 55%, while
rail's share declined from 18% to 10%. Similarly, in terms of passenger
service, roads' share rose from 76% of inter-urban passenger-km to 88%, while
rail declined from 22% to 7%, with air transport increasing its share from 2%
to 6%.
1.02      During the half century preceding the first World War, the railways
played a crucial role in the economic growth of the country by opening up new
areas to development and providing the only transport link between production
areas and the main ports. Thereafter, however, their relative importance
declined steadily with the growth in road, river and pipeline transport, and
their financial situation deteriorated. In 1946, the Government purchased the
12 private railway companies and combined them with the six it already owned
and one owned by the Province of Buenos Aires, to form Ferrocarriles Argentinos
(FA). The resulting railway had 44,000 km of lines and was one of the largest
in the world. Unfortunately, the Government failed to maintain the railway
infrastructure to provide continuity of management, to integrate fully organiza-
tions of the original railway companies, to discontinue services which could
no longer be provided economically, to insulate the railways from political
interference and to maintain adequate tariff levels. Consequently, financial
losses mounted, maintenance expenditures lagged and service deteriorated;
railway traffic declined from 16.5 billion ton-km and 32.8 million tons
in 1951 to 14.2 billion ton-km and 22.1 million tons in 1970.
1.03      The realization of the changing role of the railway has led to
several attempts at rationalizing the system and the services offered. One of
these attempts was initiated in 1970 and formed the basis for the Bank's First
Railway Project (Loan 733-AR) which is the subject of this Project Completion
Report (PCR). However, due to factors arising largely from the political and
economic conditions that prevailed in Argentina during the early 70's the
investments and actions planned were not implemented and by February 1974,
it was apparent that little or no improvement had been made by FA and that
performance was well below the established targets. In April 1974, the Bank
offered the Government and FA the alternative of renegotiating the loan on the
basis of new targets and specific actions to be taken by the Government and
FA or cancelling the balance of the loan for items not yet contracted. The
Government and FA chose the latter alternative and US$27.5 million of the
US$84.0 million loan were cancelled.
1.04      An analysis of the railways during-the period of 1970's, the time-
frame for this PCR, is complicated by the severe economic and political
crisis which came to a head by the middle of the decade. A combination of



- 2 -
domestic and international events undermined the country's economy resulting
in rising external debt and falling foreign exchange reserves; inflation
reached over 300% in 1975 and rose to an annual rate of over 800% by early
1976. The Administration which came to power in 1976 moved to stabilize the
economy. Nevertheless, in 1981 the situation was still not stable, with infla-
tion continuing at over 100% and a series of substantial devaluations and
other measures being instituted to stop the outflow of capital.
1.05      The transport sector was significantly affected by the economic
crisis. Traffic declined on much of the road and rail network (with the
exception of rail passengers) and public expenditures were drastically reduced
both for maintenance and construction. From 1976, however, as the road
subsector rebounded, with investment support in critical areas, rail freight
remained stagnant largely due to poor levels of service caused by: (a) govern-
ment apathy over the years; (b) grossly inadequate investments; (c) frequent
changes of management (between 1971 and 1979 the management of the Railway was
changed 13 times); and (d) changing geographic structure of the economy which
favored competing modes. The Government again instituted plans in 1976 to
rationalize the railways and has reduced the labor force from 157,000 to under
96,000, eliminated 7,600 km of uneconomic branch lines, recommended an addi-
tional 3,000 km for elimination, reduced service on another 13,000 km of line
and is striving to improve operational efficiency. Some of this work has
overlapped with the preparation and implementation of the Second Railway
Project (see para 1.06 below). However, though some improvements have been
achieved in railway operations, no systematic reorganization nor any significant
efficiency-oriented investments 1/ have yet been made in FA to improve its
operations. 1980 was a particularly bad year when floods and poor economic
conditions depressed traffic levels and FA's working ratio rose to 208. The
railway problem thus remains a key issue facing the Argentine Government and
its resolution represents a long term project.
1.06      Based on the lessons learned during the First Railway Project and
with the belief that the Government was committed to a substantial ration-
alization of the system, the Bank reentered the subsector with the Second
Railway Project (1677 AR) which was appraised in 1978-79 and became effective
in May, 1980.
1.07      The Bank has also been involved in other transport subsectors,
especially during the 1970's. Highway development has been supported by
the Bank over the last 20 years by four loans totalling US$228.5 million
(Loan 288-AR, June 1961, US$31 million after cancellation; Loan 619-AR,
June 1969, US$25 million; Loan 734-AR, May 1971, US$67.5 million, and Loan
1384-AR, May 1977, US$105 million). All of these projects experienced
serious delays and in many cases, substantial cost overruns mainly due to
the economic crisis of the mid-1970's. A port project was appraised in 1979
for which negotiations have not yet been held; a Fifth Highway Sector Project
has been appraised (March 1981) and is currently being processed.
1/   Such as improved telecommunication facilities, computerized wagon and
yard control systems, etc., which are producing marked efficiency
improvements on railways over the world.

In addition, the Bank has been extensively involved in sector planning culmi-
nating in the National Transport Plan (NTP) and the establishment of the
National Directorate for Transport Planning (DNPT) with financial assistance
provided under the Fourth Highway Loan.
1.08      This PCR, covering the First Railway Project, has been prepared with
the assistance of the Borrower, who provided a set of reports for the Bank's
review. These reports, together with data obtained from Bank files were
reviewed with FA by Bank missions which visited Argentina in January and
May 1981.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Background
2.01      The first loan to Argentine Railways was preceded by a long series
of contacts between the Bank and Argentina dealing with the problems of
the railways. Until 1946 the financial results for the railways were reason-
able but, thereafter, increasing road competition, political influences,
frequent changes in railway management, low staff morale, inadequate invest-
ments for the maintenance and renewal of assets and for improvements to meet
changing circumstances led to deterioration of railways services and increasing
financial difficulties. The deficits also increased the burden on the Govern-
ment budgets.
2.02      In 1960 the Argentine Government, the United Nations Special Fund
and the Bank set up a Transport Planning Group to formulate long-term
transportation plans and investment programs. The recommendations proposed
inter-alia extensive reforms and economies for the railways. The Government
attempted to implement these in 1962-63 but a drastic reduction of labor
created political and financial problems beside having an adverse effect
upon the morale and efficiency of the railways. The program was abandoned
and the only permanent result was the retirement of about 50,000 FA staff.
2.03      In early 1967, the Government embarked upon measures to stabilize the
economy, including the reorganization of the railways. The direction of FA
was placed under military control and steps were taken to restore discipline
and the morale of the staff. Design of a complete recovery program for FA was
started and, at the request of the Government, the progress made and the plans
for the future were reviewed by a Bank mission in September 1968. The Bank
recommended that the recovery measures be accelerated and that medium-term
investment and financial programs be developed. A subsequent series of missions
determined that serious efforts were being made to improve the physical and
financial position of FA. Traffic increased and deficits appeared to be
decreasing. In June 1969 the Bank sent a Project Identification/Preappraisal
Mission to Argentina which discussed conditions for Bank participation in a
project which was appraised in May 1970.
Project Description and Goals
2.04      The project was based on FA's Investment Plan for the five year period
1971-1975 and comprised the first two years (1971-72) of the Investment Plan
together with a program of action to improve the operations and financial
position of the Argentine Railways. Subsequent to the signing of the loan
agreement, FA agreed by exchange of letters to a time phased program for
rationalization of services and line closures, staff redeployment and reduc-
tions, rehabilitation of diesel locos, reorganization of workshops, and the
introduction of commercial policies and targets.
2.05      Investment of the equivalent of US$368 million were proposed during
the project period 1971-72 of which the foreign exchange component was computed
to be about US$172 million equivalent. The Bank loan of US$84 million was to
finance 23% of the project or 49% of the foreign exchange requirements. The



- 5 -
major components of the project were (a) track renewals and improvement as
well as procurement of track materials and equipment (25%); (b) signalling and
telecommunications equipment and works (3%); (c) structural civil works (8%);
(d) procurement of new locomotives and freight cars (41%); and (e) maintenance
of locomotives and freightcars (22%). The Bank loan of $84 million was
expected to finance procurement of freight cars, workshop equipment, and
components for rehabilitating and renovating locomotives and cars, track
material and track workshop equipment and signalling and telecommunications
equipment. A small portion of the loan was also expected to finance track
civil works.
2.06      Negotiations with FA and the Government were held in December
1970. The loan and Guarantee Agreements were signed on April 28, 1971 and
became effective on August 5, 1971.



III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.01      Implementation of the project ran into trouble almost frori
the start. The political and economic problems faced by the country from
the initial years of the project resulted in grossly inadequate levels of
investments and scant attention to the plans of action agreed with the Bank.
As the action taken in implementation of the agreed program was grossly
inadequate, the Bank decided, within a year of the loan becoming effective,
to stop disbursements in July 1972. In August 1972, the Bank held detailed
discussions with FA and the Argentine Government and approved of some changes
in the Project and investment figures and agreed to postpone the project
completion date to April 30, 1974. By February 1974, it was apparent that
little or no improvement had been achieved in FA's physical and financial
condition during 1972 and 1973 and that performance was well below established
targets. In April 1974, the Bank offered the Government and FA one of two
alternatives: (a) to renegotiate the loan on the basis of new targets and
specific actions to be taken by the Government and FA; or (b) to cancel
the balance of the loan. The Government and FA chose the latter, and it was
decided to cancel $27.5 million out of the loan of $84 million, agreeing to
maintain an amount of $56.5 million in the loan to finance 59 items which
had been contracted up to the project completion date of April 30, 1974.
The loan closing date was extended to December 31, 1976. Table 1 gives details
of the physical completion of each item of the project in juxtaposition with
the expected completion as foreseen during appraisal. Table 2 details the
actual costs in comparison with the appraisal cost estimates. Table 2A
details the investments in the project years 1971-72 and the Investment Plan
years 1971-1975, in physical units as well as in constant dollars.
Project Cost
3.02      Analysis of project costs for Argentina is a difficult task not
only because of the high inflation rates but also because the parity between
the dollar and the peso is rather unevenly maintained, with marked fluctuations
in certain years. However, an attempt has been made to reduce all costs
to constant dollars in terms of the 1970 rate of exchange so that resultant
figures would be comparable to appraisal estimates.
3.03      An   analysis of Tables 1 and 2 illustrates that the main features of
the project implementation were as follows:
(a) The project was completed in 1980 instead of 1972 as planned.
(b) The main reason for delay in investments was the lack of
adequate funds as reflected in the government allocations
of funds from year to year. For the project period 1971-
72 FA investments amounted to $128 million instead of
$368 million and for the 5 Year Investment Plan period
1971-1975 $268 million instead of $839 million.
(c) The cost of the project at US$406 million was 11% higher
than the appraisal estimate of US$368 million including
contingencies. Some items of the project were not implemented
as detailed in para. 3.04.



- 7 -
(d) Only 34% of the investments expected to be made by 1972
were actually made by end 1972.
(e) As far as the 1971-1975 investment program is concerned,
only 31% of the investments expected to be made by 1975 were
actually made by end 1975.
(f) Though the overall cost overrun for the 1971-72 project
was 11%, the cost overrun for the track works was nearly
25% and for the freightcars over 34% largely because of
the extended period of time over which these were
implemented (see para 3.04 below). For procurement of
electric coaches the cost overrun was 197% chiefly because
more electric coaches were purchased than foreseen
(92 instead of 42).
Project Composition
3.04      The principal changes in project scope and implementation arose from
inadequate authorization of funds for the various works and in particular a slow
rate of execution of track renewal and improvement works. Though the appraisal
report exhorted (para 5.07) that the investment plan should be carried out as
early as possible to capture traffic, the government never authorized sufficient
funds to implement the project/plan in a meaningful way. Table 1A shows the
rate at which the principal items of work were executed from the year 1971 to
1975 and this in conjunction with Table 1 gives a fair idea of the tempo of work
and time taken for the various items of work.
(a) Track Works
Track related works comprised about 25% of the project and of these
the track renewal and improvement works comprised 72% the rest being workshop
and maintenance equipment and machinery. Although 368 km of track renewal
work were done in 1971 against 450 km planned, the figure fell to 250 km in
1972 against 500 planned, 215 in 1973 against 600 planned and to 81 in 1975
against 800 planned. The average over the years 1971-1975 was 214 km per year
against 610 km per year planned, i.e. about one-third of the original plan.
It is significant to note that the 5-year program for 1971-1975 for track
renewal (3050 km) and improvement (3800 km) work    has not yet been completed
up to the year 1980 but meanwhile the second railway project was appraised in
1978 which fixed new targets from 1979 onwards. In so far as the workshop and
maintenance equipment is concerned only 4% of the equipment was procured and
installed up to 1972 and 6.5% up to 1974. The work was completed in 1980.
(b) Signalling and Telecommunications
Though Signalling and Telecommunication Works constitute a relativ,ely
small portion of the project, these were vital for improving train operations.
However no significant work was done in the years 1971-72 and by 1974 only 17%
of the works were completed. Less than one third of the Bank loan earmarked
for the purpose was utilized.



-8-
(c) Structures
These comprised various power and water installations, bridge
strengthening works, station buildings, housing and Zarate Brazo Largo Bridge.
These works were completed 20% up to 1972, 50% up to 1974 and finally completed
in 1976.
(d) Locomotive and Car Maintenance
This part of the project pertained to the purchase of spare parts and
rehabilitation of locomotives, freight cars and passenger cars. However, up to
1972 only 1% of the amount foreseen was spent and up to 1974 only 6%. This was
one of the major reasons for the fall in the availability of locomotives from
63.8% in 1971 to 55.8% in 1976, and similar deterioration in the availability
of freight cars and passenger cars.
(e) Purchase of New Locomotives and Cars
40 Broadgauge locomotives were purchased as planned from GM by 1972.
However only 40 of the 150 narrow gauge locos to be procured in the 1971-1975
period had been actually purchased by 1975.    As for the standard gauge locos,
the 20 locomotives expected to be purchased in 1972 did not show up until 1977
(18 nos) followed by 22 in 1978.   Taking the 5-year period 1971-1975, FA
purchased only 80 out of 230 locomotives programmed having had to defer the
procurement of the rest of the locomotives to later years. This was the other
principal cause of drop in locomotive availability 1/ (see 3.04(d) above).
A similar situation arose in respect of the rail tractors which were to be
supplied at the rate of 50 per year for the 4 years 1971-1974 but actually
nothing was delivered until 1979 when 39 were delivered and 1980 when 36 were
delivered, resulting in the continued utilization of obsolete steam/diesel
locos in shunting operations in the railway yards. As for freight cars of
which 4400 units were to be purchased in 1971-72 largely to replace overaged
stock, only about 2,000 were procured by end 1972. This was also the pattern
for the 5 year project for 1971-1975 during which period, 5192 freidht cars
were purchased against 10,400 foreseen during appraisal. As most purchases
were in replacement of overaged and run-down stock, the effect on loading and
handling capacity and train operations in general was negative.
(f) The case of passenger cars is rather special for here 215 cars
were purchased in 1971-72 against 175 foreseen though over the 5 year period
1971-1975 FA purchased 385 passenger cars against 523 foreseen during appraisal.
For electric rail cars FA ended up purchasing 92 rail cars against 75 foreseen
over the 5 year period (1971-1975) although for the project years (1971-72) no
purchases were made versus 42 foreseen at appraisal time. Viewed with hindsight
(intercity passenger services and suburban passenger services in cities other
than Buenos Aires were drastically reduced in 1978/79) this emerged as a parti-
cularly wasteful investment (US$14 million).
1/   One of the principal causes of the low availability of the locomotives on
FA has been the multiplicity of types (22 types in 1972) of locomotives
many of which were overaged, for which there have been severe problems in
procuring spare parts. Hence the accent on procurement of new locomotives
(to reduce the number of types) and to purchase spare parts to improve
availability.



-9-
Procurement
3.05      Slow implementation of the project resulted in curtailment of the
loan to $56.3 million to limit Bank financing to a list of 59 items ordered up
to April 1974. No disbursements were made until 1973, the year of the highest
disbursement was 1974 ($22.1 million) with $1.4 million in 1979.
3.06      The disbursement schedule is given in Table 3 which shows the actual
disbursements in comparison with the original schedule. Table 3A shows the
disbursements by category. The disbursements that dragged on the longest were
for the wagon bodies of which the last lot was delivered in 1978 and final
payments were made in 1979. In addition, spare parts for locomotives and cars
were last delivered in 1979 and the deliveries of track materials and equipment,
signalling equipment, etc. was completed in 1978. Most of the extended
deliveries were caused by budget limitations, except for small numbers of spare
parts delivered late due to supplier constraints. At one stage FA requested
the Bank to finance the purchase of locotractors which was postponed due to lack
of funds (para. 3.4e), but the Bank did not agree to this, presumably because it
meant financing a contract signed several years earlier. All procurement
financed by the Bank was done by ICB.
Action Program
3.07      The project was accompanied by a program of action agreed between FA
and the Bank inter-alia for:
(a) Rationalization of services and closing of lines aiming
at an examination and possible closure of about
6300 km of lines by 1975.
(b) Reduction of staff from 145,000 in 1970 to 120,000 in 1975.
(c) Rehabilitation of diesel locomotives to increase the
number in running condition from 900 in 1971 to 1163 in
1975, and a similar program for diesel rail cars (150
to 281).
(d) Centralization of workshops and reduction of the number
of workshops from 24 to 18 and staff strength in
workshops from 19,500 to 14,700 by 1975.
(e) A program of tariff increases.
(f) A program of marketing studies and promotion.
Hardly any action was taken either by the Government or FA to seriously implement
any of the above programs within the time-frame agreed with the Bank except tariff
increases which were carried out to an extent generally close to appraisal
expectation (see para 5.06). The management of FA was changed 11 times between
1971 and 1975. Staff strength instead of being reduced was increased from
145,000 in 1971 to 175,000 in 1975 by direct government intervention. The
number of diesel locomotives in running condition steadily deteriorated
instead of improving and locomotive availability fell from 63.8% in 1971 to an



- 10 -
all time low of 55.8% in 1976. Similarly electric coaches availability fell
from 51.8% in 1971 to 45.4% in 1975. No serious rationalization of workshops
was attempted. This state of affairs continued until the new military govern-
ment took over in 1976.
3.08      It is important, however, that the action program prepared for this
project, though not implemented, showed the direction in which the railway
should be reformed, and the management of FA initiated similar measures in
1976 when in collaboration with Bank Mission it started on a program of line
closures, staff reductions, workshop and services rationalization, leading to
the formulation of the Bank's Second Railway Project (see paras. 1.05 and 1.06).

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
Performance of the Economy
4.01      At the time of appraisal in 1971 data available indicated that the
Argentine economy was recovering from a period of slow and uneven growth
and considerable inflation. The production potential of the country was rated
as high and the appraisal report projected an annual growth in real GDP of
about 5.5% over the next five years which was expected to generate a substantially
larger demand for transport of both primary products and manufactured goods.
In actual fact, it appears from the data available that the economic crisis
during the project period affected national production in general so that no
significant growth occurred in the production of the principal commodities
carried by the railways, although between 1961 and 1970 GDP grew in real terms
at an average rate of 3.7% per year or just over 2% on a per capita basis.
Freight Traffic
4.02      The appraisal forecast assumed that with the implementation of FA's
investment plan and the program of action agreed upon with the Bank to
rationalize the railway system and to improve its operations, the freight
traffic decline which had occurred since 1947 would be arrested and that
traffic would rise steadily between 1970 and 1975 at an annual growth rate of
about 4% from 22 to 27 million tons and from 13.4 billion ton km to 16.3 billion
ton-km. However, due to a combination of factors (see para 4.03 below), the
expected traffic growth did not materialize. Freight traffic continued to
decline, and by 1975 it was 21% lower than in 1970.
4.03      The disparities between projected and actual freight traffic are
the result of the combination of three factors: (i) the country's economic
decline; (ii) the deteriorating level of service because of the lack of full
implementation of the investment plan and also of the plans for improving
operational efficiency; and (iii) the diversion of commodities which could
be more appropriately handled by other modes.
4.04     The economic crisis during the project period affected national
production in general so that no significant growth occurred in the production
of principal railway commodities such as grain, cement, wine and minerals. At
the same time, substantial delays affected the implementation of both the in-
vestment and action plans. Less than 1/3 of the investments foreseen for the
1971-1975 period (which were essentially deferred maintenance and replacement
works and equipments) were actually made (Table 2A) and some of the important
investments to be made in 1972 (e.g. for replacement of overaged wagons)
have not yet been completed. The expected actions to improve the efficiency
of operations were not taken and the end result was a continuous decline in
the quality of the service which prevented the railways from increasing their
share in the total transport of the principal railway commodities, although
the railways' share for such commodities did not decline.



- 12 -
4.05      Finally, about 70% of the decline in traffic between 1970 and 1975
can be accounted for by the reduction in the traffic of petroleum and "other"
commodities which are not considered "prime" rail traffic and were susceptible
to competition from new pipelines and expanded truck services. Also, the
average distance per ton carried increased from 637 km to 664 km which indicates
that shorter distance traffic has left the railways, again not a "prime"
target for traffic growth (the average distance for "other" commodities
increased from 600 km to 862 km). In economic terms it can be expected that
it would be cheaper to haul many of the short haul commodities by other modes
even under improved rail operating conditions.
4.06      The results of the First Railway Project illustrate the great
difficulty economists and railway planners have faced in estimating rail
traffic for projects which are expected to reverse the long term neglect of
the rail system. A major question which is important in assessing the rail
forecasts and which has implications for future rail forecasts is to what extent
the lack of traffic growth was a phenomenon which because of the changing
geographic structure of trade and the improvement of the highway network would
have occurred despite improvements in the railway, and to what extent it was
a consequence of lack of investment in the railways. The appraisal forecast
appears to have been based on the latter reasoning and concluded that increased
investment, together with improved operational efficiency, would attract
substantial traffic that had been lost, and increase railways' transport
share. The data from Argentina suggest that the "with-project" appraisal
assumption may have been over-optimistic. On the other hand, the conspicuous
difference between the actual and the planned investments and the scant
attention given to implementation of the action program (paras 3.04 and 3.07)
are important factors which are of considerable consequence. The period in
which the First Railway Project was to have been implemented was an era of
unprecedented political and economic turmoil in Argentina and perhaps clearer
answers will emerge when the Second Railway Project started in 1980 near
completion, and is analyzed in the light of the various studies included in
that project.
Passenger Traffic
4.07      The appraisal passenger forecast assumed that intercity passenger-km
would increase by 22% between 1970 and 1975 while suburban passenger-km would
remain relatively stable increasing by about 10% (Table 4A). Actual intercity
passenger traffic for this period was equivalent to the forecasts and was
apparently insensitive to the economic difficulties reaching 6.6 billion
passenger-km by 1975. The declines after 1976 were due to the reduction of
intercity passenger services. Suburban traffic declined steadily until 1974
when traffic levels rebounded to a level of about 8 billion passenger-km.
Much of this increase may be due to the rise in fuel prices in March 1974.



- 13 -
Operations
4.08     Selected operating statistics for FA for the years 1970-1979 are given
in Table 5. During the six year period 1970-1975, the total traffic units
(comprising freight ton km and passenger km) remained between 25 and 26 billion
units. No serious attempt was made to reduce staff which, on the other hand,
was increased from 145,000 in 1970 to 155,000 in 1976. The mounting arrears
of track renewal and improvement works led to a steady deterioration in the
condition of the track, leading to an increase in speed restrictions and minor
derailments. As a result the average speeds fell to an all time low of 22.8 km/hr
in 1976 and the average wagon turn around time increased steadily from 16.3 days
in 1970 to 20 days in 1976. Due to inadequate replacements of the overaged
and obsolete motive power and inadequate purchases of spare parts, the avail-
ability of locomotives dropped from 63.8% in 1971 to 55.8% in 1976. If it is
remembered that in a fleet of 1,100 locomotives this drop in itself represents
90 locomotives lost, the effect on FA's potential capacity to capture more
traffic can well be imagined. Lack of funds led to a wholesale postponement
of the purchase of locotractors to be used for shunting operations in yards
stations and sidings in replacement of the overaged and expensive steam
locomotives. As a result projected improvements in shunting operations never
materialized and FA continued to maintain unreliable steam locomotives at
exorbitant costs. Locotractors against the Belgian contract finally started
coming in 1979 at prices several times more than the planned 1971-72 purchases
Freightcar availability fell from 75.8% in 1971 to 68.7% in 1975 due to the
fact that less than half of the wagon replacement program was implemented.
4.09     The cumulative effect of the above delays and defaults was a marked
deterioration in the quality of the service provided by the railway and the
result was that instead of capturing more traffic as the project and action
program had foreseen, there was loss of traffic, and further deterioration of
the railway infrastructure. It is pertinent to note that over the years
1970-1976 manpower productivity measured in the number of annual traffic
units per employee fell from 188,000 to 162,000.
4.10     During the 30 year period 1946-1976 thus Argentina witnessed the
systematic erosion of its railway property and potential by what appears
to have been a combination of gross neglect in the period 1946-1970 and some
ill-conceived government actions during the years of political and economic
turmoil from 1970 to 1976.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      FA's financial Performance during the Project execution period
was very poor and, in fact, became the major factor which led to the Bank's
cancelling a portion of the loan. At the time of the appraisal the long term
financial objective was for FA to cover all operating expenses, including
depreciation by 1979 ie within ten years. In this context a set of financial
targets, covering the five years from 1971 to 1975, were established. The
substantial difference between these original targets and the actual perfor-
mance is shown clearly below:
1971    1972      1973    1974    1975
Working Ratio
Forecest                     126       117     108      101      98
Actual                       179       156     168      183     262
Operating Ratio
Forecast                     147       136     127      119      115
Actual                        199      180     182      193      267
5.02      The dramatic difference between the appraisal projection and what
actually happened is shown clearly in Table 6. It can be seen in 1974 1/
(when the loan was cancelled) that revenues were about 83% below the appraisal
projections and total operating costs were 25% above the appraisal estimates.
These operating cost comparisons are distorted because depreciation is under-
stated in the actual data; comparison of the working expenses (excluding
depreciation) is more meaningful and shows that costs were 40% higher (in
real terms) than the appraisal estimates.
5.03      The appraisal had projected that the improvement in financial
performance would be achieved through a steady increase in total revenues
while operating expenses were expected to be held essentially constant.
Thus, between 1971 and 1975 revenues were expected to increase by 31%,
reflecting traffic increases of 11% (in unit-km) and tariff increases of
nearly 20% in real terms. Actually total traffic declined by 10% (in unit km)
and the cumulative increase in unit revenues was about 14%.
5.04      The main reasons for the difference in the actual versus antici-
pated expenses were the higher actual personnel costs. The appraisal report
projected a 24% increase in personnel costs between 1970 and 1975 while they
actually increased by 71% (in real terms). Other costs in total increased
roughly in line with the appraisal projections but, as personnel costs consti-
tuted over 70% of local expenses, the difference in these dominated the
results.
1/   1975 data is not discussed because the extreme inflation of that
year makes the data practically meaningless.



- 15 -
5.05      The difference between the projected and actual labor costs reflect
both higher staffing levels and greater salary increases. It had been
anticipated that staff would be decreased from the 1969 level of 145,000 to
120,000 by 1975 while actual staff was reduce to only 141,000 in 1974 before
increases were commenced (after the balance of the loan was cancelled). More
importantly, average personnel costs were increased by about 50% more than
expected by the end of 1974.
5.06      The extreme difference between the actual results and the projections
raises a question as to the reasonableness of the Bank original financial
projections. Obviously, in retrospect, the projections seem to have been far
too optimistic and yet it is clear from the information in the files that a
very serious and thorough attempt was made to present reasonable financial
projections for FA. The main weaknesses in-the financial projections seem to
have been:
(i)  the assumption that the investment program and plan of
action would be carried out with resulting improvements
in operations, reductions in cost and improvement in the
quality of services. The appraisal mission did not foresee
the chaos which would overtake the political and economic
system which in turn made the execution of the project
impossible.
(ii)  the assumption that steady real tariff increases could be
implemented while at the same time, traffic increases occurred.
In fact tariff increases seem to have taken marginally short
of the assumed ones but the lower increases seem reasonable in
view of the fact that the traffic declines were so severe.
More importantly, the Bank seems to have placed great emphasis
on the need for greater tariff increases, during supervision,
in order to achieve the financial targets but it is not clear
from the limited information available on competitive tariffs
for trucks that such increases were possible without losing
significant traffic and, worsening the financial situation;
(iii)  the assumption that costs, particularly personnel costs,
would be maintained at their preappraisal levels seem to have
been unreasonable mainly because it was not possible to hold
the salary levels relatively constant. It is not clear to what
extent this need for greater increases in salaries could
have been foreseen, railway salaries were known to be low but
apparently were only felt to be 20% too low, not 50% too low.
Balance Sheets
5.07      A comparison of the appraisal and actual Balance Sheets (in comparable
unit currency) is shown in Table 7. Because of FA's extreme unprofitability
(and resultant dependence on the government budget) these figures have little
financial importance. However, it is interesting to note that FA's actual
financial position generally strengthened throughout the 1970-1974 period, in
spite of the large losses. It is particularly evident that one of the Bank's
main objectives, a strengthening in the working capital position, was achieved
a fact which shows that the government did give good financial support to FA's
operating budget.



- 16 -
5.08      With respect to the Balance Sheet, a further objection of the project
was to improve the quality of the data presented in the Balance Sheet through:
(i) determination of a more accurate valuation of FA's asset;
(ii) carrying out of regular audits by private auditors.
Both steps were carried out, at least partially while the loan was active. A
firm of private auditors was appointed and produced annual reports until 1973,
when the loan was cancelled, and a major portion of the asset revaluation was
carried out at the end of 1972 but this work was not extended to the rest of
the assets.
Financial Plan
5.09      A comparison of actual project financing in comparison with the appraisal
estimate is shown in Table 8. It can be seen that while the size of the project
was reduced there was still an increase of 11% in the funds required to execute
the project. The total cost of the project was US$407 million, of which Bank
contributed only US$56.3 million, or 14%, whereas during appraisal it was
forecast that the Bank loan would contribute 23% of the project cost.
5.10      This reduction in Bank contribution meant that other financial sources,
mainly government had to make larger contributions to the financing of the
project, it is estimated that the government contribution increased from an
estimated US$160 million equivalent to US$317 equivalent or about 100% more.
5.11      Though over the extended period of the project, government contribution
was higher than anticipated, the inadequate overall provision for investments
year by year (see Tables 2, 2A) was a serious problem that prevented the project
and the investment plan from being implemented and completed as planned.

VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      The appraisal report reviewed in a general way the organization and
staffing of FA and highlighted the need for (i) improving the administrative
control of the headquarters over the individual railways and (ii) reduction of
surplus staff and the need for government assistance in retraining and re-
employment of such staff. The formation of an incipient planning office was
touched upon. The project, per se, however, did not contain any specific
proposals for institutional reforms either within on FA or in FA's relationships
with the government. Neither did the project contain any proposals for studies
on any institutional aspects of the railway problem.
6.02      FA's report on the completion of this project, however, contains a
chapter on institutional development which refers to the strengthening of the
central organization (Organismo Central) of FA in relationship with the
different railways each of which had its own individuality inherited from the
premerger years. It does appear that during the seventies the central
organization of FA found a role for itself, albeit slowly and flatteringly at
first, and later in a surer manner, with the creation and development of the
Organization for Engineering Administration (Organismo de Ingenieria Adminis-
trativa). The latter led to the formation of the planning office which has
in recent years assumed the responsibility for preparation of FA's short-term
(one year), medium term (5 year) and long-term (10 year) investment plans. It
would appear therefore that though the First Railway Project did not contain
any specific proposals on the institutional front certain developments did
take place, largely on the initiative of the borrower, which have had a
positive effect in defining a role for the headquarters office (Organismo
Central) and in formation of the planning office, which has been playing an
increasingly active role in the making of plans and projections for the
future.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      The economic evaluation carried out at appraisal calculated the
economic rate of return for the investment plan for 1971 to 1975. Although a
technical assessment was made of individual investments, the investment plan
was economically assessed as a whole rather than by individual components and
the underlying assumption was that such an integrated plan would attract
additional traffic and stop further diversion of traffic to other modes. The
1980 freight forecasts in the appraisal report for the "with" and "without"
project situation were estimated at 18.0 billion and 4.0 billion ton-km
respectively; for passengers, 15.0 billion and 5.6 billion pass-km respectively,
The major benefits were the savings in transport costs between rail and road.
The economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 21%.
7.02      Although the original plan was not carried out, some investment did
occur and 67% of the loan funds were disbursed though with inordinate delays
(1974-1980). Applying a similar methodology, the ERR was recalculated taking
into account the actual traffic for 1971 to 1981 and revised forecasts to
2000; and the reduced investment level from 1971 to 1981. Investments beyond
1980 were derived from the recent proposals of the National Transport Plan



- 18 -
(NTP). No changes were made in the "without" project forecast. Rail and road
costs were revised based on the appraisal methodology used in the Second
Railway Project and the estimates of the NTP. Other benefit parameters
applied in the appraisal evaluation could not be included because of the lack
of data in the project file needed to reconstruct them. Instead an additional
benefit was calculated representing the savings in the maintenance costs from
track rehabilitation which was carried out. To avoid double counting of benefits
these savings are calculated on the basis of the traffic which would not have
diverted to road in the "without" case. The recalculated ERR is estimated at
10% (Table 9) which is equivalent to the opportunity costs of capital and
represents a marginal return. Given the fact that FA did not institute many
of the operational improvements originally agreed as well as the bulk of the
investment plan, and that traffic was below appraisal estimates the ERR
appears to be reasonable.
7.03      The main drawback to the evaluation methodology is that it does
not permit an analysis of the marginal impacts on project benefits when the
individual components are substantially changed as happened in Argentina.
Thus, it is difficult to assess, in economic terms, whether the type of
investment and/or the location of the investments was appropriate. System-
wide traffic loss estimates are subject to a high level of uncertainty.
The Second Railway Project was evaluated through an analysis of the marginal
benefits of specific investments and a similar methodology was applied in
developing the NTP investment plan. The ERR's calculated for types of invest-
ments in the Second Railway Project and the NTP should be indicative of the
returns on investments made in the 1971-1975 period. Thus rehabilitation
projects on the trunk lines should register ERR's of from 10% to 20%; locomotive
procurement projects from 15% to 25%; and wagon procurement projects from 12%
to 20%.
VIII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01      This Project Completion Report is being written almost ten years
after appraisal of the project, and though this has meant that retrieval of
project-related data was quite difficult because of the several waves of
changes in the management and staff of FA (and to a lesser extent the Bank),
this does give the Bank and the borrower the advantage of considerable 'hind-
sight' particularly because in the intervening years another appraisal exercise
was undertaken (1978-79) for the ongoing Second Railway Project.
8.02       FA's report on the completion of this project concludes that
despite the fact that the project was not implemented adequately, the Bank's
contribution to the medium term (5 year plan) was positive. In FA's view
the Bank mission's diagnosis of the railway situation was appropriate and
the measures proposed not only necessary but also possible, given the
indications received from the Argentine Government during appraisal. The
report further comments that the Bank supervision missions were useful and
the information requirements not particularly burdensome. It is FA's view
that the project was not implemented because of political and economic problems
that "annulled" the optimistic expectations of the appraisal for recuperation



- 19 -
of the railways and maintained the distortions 1/ in the transport sector that
supported the railways' principal competitor, the highways. It is further
argued that inasmuch as the Bank's appraisal indicated that the principal
economic benefit of the railway program was based on the avoided investments
in and higher cost of highway transport the Bank's support of road construction 2/
and general neglect of road-pricing issues (which helped the railways' principal
competitor), was in conflict with the objectives of the railway project. FA's
comment is at least partially valid. It is significant however that the Bank
has since sought to resolve such conflicts by the assignment of transport
economists on a country sector basis to ensure a more balanced approach to
intermodal issues. The National Transport Plan (financed under the 4th
Highway Project) is also expected to focus attention on the development of
evenhanded transport policies.
8.03      In conclusion FA's report states that collaboration with the
Bank was useful because (i) the plans developed for the rehabilitation of
the system (although inadequately implemented) were basically sound and
have retained their validity in as much as they are being implemented now
(with suitable mutations) as part of the ongoing railway project; (ii) the
financial participation of the Bank (although reduced from $84 million to
$56.3 million) was valuable because of the long term, low interest rates and
above all the procurement of significant volumes of railway materials at
international prices; and (iii) Bank's involvement tended to orient the
railways "and particularly" the Government towards investment plans consistent
with the rationalization and development of FA. In fact, in retrospect, this
last factor has been particularly important because the influence of the
Bank does appear to have had some effect in developing a positive attitude
towards the railways which emphasizes the need for pruning and rationalizing
the system as well as support for judicious investments in essential maintenance
and efficiency oriented projects.
8.04      The principal question that arises in this analysis however is to
what extent was the Bank's rather precipitate action in cancelling a part of
the loan in 1974 justified. It is evident from the files that the cancella-
tion of part of the loan followed a series of measures which were deliberated
within the highest levels of the Bank. Initially, when it was noted that
the financial position of FA was deteriorating instead of improving, the
Loan Committee came to the conclusion in May 1972 that disbursements should
be suspended. In August 1972 the targets were renegotiated, but in July 1974
a part of the loan ($27.5 million out of $84 million) was cancelled and the
closing dated extended to December 1976. It is clear that the Bank loan
was expected to finance purchase of railway equipment by international bidding
and thus to exert a stabilizing influence on the prices of railway equipment
in Argentina which have traditionally been considerably higher than inter-
national prices. In fact to the extent the Bank loan was disbursed, it did
finance the purchase of various items such as track and workshop machinery,
spare parts and freight cars at competitive prices, and there is evidence
that this did have a salutary effect (although not for long) on the price
1/   We presume reference here is to such factors as low diesel fuel costs,
relatively high investments in highways, etc.
2/   There were four Bank loans for highways between 1961 and 1977 ($229
million) of which two ($173 million) between 1971 and 1977.



- 20 -
levels in the indegenous industry. The cancellation of a significant portion
of the loan (33%) amounted in effect to the Bank abandoning this project, and
the question that naturally arises is whether it would not have been better
for the Bank to continue to disburse and complete the procurements planned
for the loan.
8.05      It is easy to understand the reasons that led to the cancellation
of the loan in 1974 - inadequate government funding for investments, little
or no attention to the implementation of the action programs, and above all
a political and economic climate that showed no signs of improving. As
a matter of fact the year 1975 following the year of cancellation of the
loan was perhaps the worst year of the project period. It is also clear
that proceeding with (instead of cancelling) the project would have been
inordinately expensive in Bank manpower in view of the general situation in
Argentina, and perhaps helping FA did not have a high enough priority to
warrant the Bank making such an investment of staff effort at the time. In
retrospect, however, and given the advantage of hindsight and of the knowledge
of somewhat better succeeding years, it does appear that if the loan had not
been cancelled the project would have received the benefit of closer monitoring
(both by FA and the Bank), and incidentally the procurement of some more badly
needed equipment at internationally competitive prices. Experience with
railway projects has shown that if any significant changes are to be achieved
in railways' operations and financial condition a long term association with
the Bank perhaps covering a series of carefully planned projects and action
plans is required. As it turned out, the Bank picked up the threads again in
1976 when a mission was sent to evaluate the position under the new government
regime, which lead to the appraisal of the Second Railway Project in 1978-79.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      It is clear from an examination of the data furnished by FA as well
as the supervision reports and the Bank file on the subject that the project
failed largely because of the political and economic problems which overtook
the country in the most critical years of its implementation viz 1971-1975.
It also appears that the management of FA tried as far as it could to main-
tain its relations with the Bank and feels that its association with the
Bank was beneficial even though a significant part of the loan was cancelled.
It does appear in retrospect however that the Bank's response to the poor
performance under the project was overly stern inasmuch as disbursements were
suspended almost within a year of the loan becoming effective. An attempt at
accommodation was made when targets were revised a few months later but this
was followed within 2 years by cancellation of one third of the loan. The
cumulative experience of the railway projects in the Bank indicates that
long term association of the Bank covering several projects is necessary in
order to bring about significant improvements in the financial condition and
operations of railways, suggests (with hindsight) that the objectives of the
project would have been better served if the loan had not been curtailed in
1974 but it could also be argued that Bank efforts to help FA in 1975 and 1976
would not have been effective.
9.02      One of the reasons for the overoptimistic financial forecasts appears
to have been that though measures aimed at increasing revenues (primarily
through investments for improving railway operations and increasing tariffs)



- 21 -
were included in the project, there does not appear to have been an analysis
of the railway costs or any concrete steps for reducing costs, which clearly
should have been planned concurrently with measures to increase traffic and
revenues. Although it is doubtful whether in the political conditions then
prevailing any serious consideration would have been given to cost reductions
(as indeed the experience with staff increases suggests), it is clear that the
project would have been improved by the inclusion of an analysis of and some
concrete measures for reduction of costs. While such a task would have been
difficult to achieve in one project, it seems unfortunate that no studies to
help define the appropriate dimension of the railway were supported by the
project and the Bank loan.
