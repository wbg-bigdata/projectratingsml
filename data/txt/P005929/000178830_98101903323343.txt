ARGENTINA
FIRST RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY'
i.        The proposed project, costing an estimated US$368 million equiv-
alent, consists of the first two years of the Argentine Railways (Ferrocar-
riles Argentinos, or FA) US$839 million 1971-75 Investment Plan ("Plan de
Mediano Plazo"). The foreign exchange component of the project is expected
to be between US$166 million and US!D172 million, depending on the bids won
by Argentine suppliers in international competition. The proposed loan of
US$84 million equivalent would finance about 50% of the foreign exchange
costs of the project.
ii.       This would be the first loan to FA but it follows a long series of
contacts between the Bank and Argentina on the problems of the railways.
A cycle of increasing road competitLon, political influences, poor manage-
ment, low staff morale, general ineEficiency, poor and inadequate invest-
ments and increasingly large deficits placed a burden on the Government
budgets and contributed largely to inflation in Argentina. Little change
took place until 1967 when the Government embarked on measures to stabilize
the country's economy, including a major reorganization of the railways.
FA was placed under the management of military personnel who began design-
ing and implementing a comprehensive recovery program for FA.
Mi.       At the request of the Government a series of Bank missions has
kept contact with FA and has established that serious efforts have been and
are being made to improve FA's physical and financial positions. Economical-
ly, even with the recent development of other modes of transport, principally
highways and pipelines, there remains a useful role for the railways in the
future, especially for the long-distance haulage of bulk commodities and for
urban transport in the Buenos Aires area.  The production potential of Argen-
tina is high, with a forecast of satisfactory growth in GDP, which should
lead to increasing demands for all forms of transportation.
iv.       Since 1967 much has been accomplished by the Government and FA,
resulting in an increase in freight: traffic and a reduction in the working
loss (excluding depreciation), at constant 1966 prices, from the record $a 555
million (US$158 million equivalent) in 1966 to $a 205 million (US$58 million
equivalent) in 1969. A new Enterprise Law, to enable FA to operate on
commercial lines, has been enacted; a sotnder general management organiza-
tion with more effective control over the individual railways has been estab-
lished; staff has been reduced from 171,000 to 145,000; and a preliminary
review of the future system size has been completed. Improvements in operat-
ing and co;mlercial matters have been undertaken, working capital has been
provided, and costing is being developed as a basis for commercial pricing.
v.        Considerably more remains to be done over the next several years;
on a realistic basis it is estimated that it would take until about 1975 for
working expenses to be covered by operating revenue and until about 1979 for



- ii -
all operating expenses, including depreciation, to be met. This would be a
considerable achievement and one which would have a beneficial effect upon
the country's economy. An essential condition would be the continuing
political will on the part of the Government to pursue the increasingLy
difficult steps needed to achieve FA's recovery. The efforts by the Govern-
ment and FA will require the parallel assistance and support of the Bank.
vi.       The Investment Plan is only one part of the recovery plan of FA;
this must be accompanied by continuing associated improvements in many
sectors, but principally in further selective reductions in staff, rational-
izing and reducing services, closing lines, rehabilitating existing diesel
locomotives, reorganizing and reducing the number of workshops, developing
effective commercial policies, and reorganizing the accounting and statistic-
al systems. Programs of action over the next few years have been developed
by FA and are satisfactory.
vii.      The principal items in the proposed project include new diesel
locomotives, passenger and freight cars (41%); rehabilitation and improved
maintenance of existing locomotives and cars (22%); track renewals and im-
provements (25%); bridges, station buildings and yards (8%); and signalling,
telecommunications and miscellaneous equipment (4%). The maximum foreign
exchange element is estimated at US$172 million equivalent. Up to US$84
million of this would be financed by the Bank, and another US$34 million by
suppliers. The balance would be provided by the Argentine Government. The
following items are suitable for international competitive bidding, and are
suitable for finance under the proposed Bank loan: track material, track
equipment and major civil works contracts, workshops, signalling and telecom-
munications equipment, freight car bogies and a portion of freight car bodies.
Domestic bidders for Bank financed equiDment would be accorded a 15% margin
of preference in lieu of higher import duties in evaluating bids. Components
for the rehabilitation of existing diesel locomotives now out of action will
also be eligible under the loan. They will involve negotiated contracts with
the original suppliers in seven countries.
viii.     Four thousand four hundred freight cars are required.  The bogies
are to be procured on international bidding, with 100% financing by the
proposed loan. The bodies (that is the cars less the bogies) are to be pro-
cured in two groups of equal size. The first grouo is to be procured after
international bidding; 90% of the cost of this group will be financed by the
loan irrespective of whether the orders are placed in Argentina or abroad.
The second group, bids for which will be called and opened simultaneously
with the bids for the first group, is to be for local bidders only. Contracts
for the second group will be awarded only if the lowest bidder is willing to
supply at the price within 125% of the lowest bids for similar cars in the
first group; otherwise the order will be offered to the successful bidder in
the first group. The Bank will not finance car bodies in the second group
except for those awarded to successful bidders in the first group. Should
local firms win all the contracts in the first group, the proposed loan would
be financing an estimated US$6 million of domestic expenditure. Foreign bor-
rowing by FA for the project is expected to cover only about US$118 million
of the likely foreign exchange cost of US$166-172 million of the project.



- iii -
ix.       The project as defined in, the report is technically and economically
sound. The financial position of FA, with the investment and the continuance
of the recovery program, should improve from an operating ratio of 166 in
1969 to about 115 in 197'5 with a target ratio of 100 by 1979. The internal
economic return on the whole investment is estimated to lie within the
range of 14.5 to 26.5%, with a most: probable value of 20.5%. The principal
benefit arises from the avoidance of the diversion of FA traffic to highway
transport at a higher economic cost: to the nation.
x.        A law has recently been passed modifying a previous law and re-
quiring all state enterprises to use local industry; a condition of ef-
fectiveness of the loan is the enactment of additional legislation to en-
able FA to procure goods in compliance with the Bank's normal requirements.
xi.       The proposed project provzides a suitable basis for a Bank loan to
FA of US$84 million equivalent, for. a term of 25 years, including a four-
year period of grace.






ARGEN T INA
FIRST RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of Argentina and the Argentine
Railways (FA) have asked the Bank for assistance in financing FA's invest-
ments during the first two years of its five-year plan 1971-75 ("Plan de
Mediano Plazo"). FA's investments during these two years are estimated at
$a 1,472 million (US$368 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange compo-
nent between US$166 million and US$172 million, depending on the bids won
by Argentine suppliers in international competition.
1.02      This will be the first lcan to FA but it follows a long series of
contacts between the Bank and Argentina dealing with the problems of the
railways. Until 1946 the financial results for the railways were reasonable
but, thereafter, increasing road competition, political influences, poor
management, low staff morale, and general inefficiency led to increasing
financial difficulties. Large deficits in turn led to poor or inadequate
investments for the maintenance ancd renewal of assets and for improvements
to meet changing circumstances. Thke deficits also increased the burden on
the Government budgets and thus contributed in large measure to the infla-
tion which occurred in Argentina. The pattern of decline which developed
could be broken only by decisive action.
1.03      In 1960 the Argentine Government, the United Nations Special Fund
and the Bank set up a Transport Planning Group to formulate long-term trans-
portation plans and investment programs. The recommendations inter alia
proposed extensive reforms and economies for the railways. The Government
attempted seriously to implement these in 1962/63 but a drastic reduction of
labor created political and financial problems beside having an adverse
effect upon the morale and efficiency of the railways. The program was
thereafter abandoned and the only permanent result was the retirement of
about 50,000 FA staff.
1.04      In early 1967, the Goveniment embarked upon measures to stabilize
the economy, including the reorganization of the railways. The direction
of FA was placed under military control and steps were taken to restore dis-
cipline and the morale of the stafl". Design of a complete recovery program
for FA was started and, at the request of the Government, the progress made
and the plans for the future were reviewed by a Bank mission in September
1968. The Bank recommended that ti-ie recovery measures be accelerated and
that mediun-term investment and financial programs be developed.  A sub-
sequent series of missions has kept contact with the Government and FA and
has deterMined that serious efforts have been and are being made to improve
the physical and financial position of FA.  Traffic has increased and
deficits have decreased but much remains to be done, especially in sectors
where effective action is more difficult. Programs of action for the next



few years have been developed by FA and are satisfactory. Procedures for
periodic review and revision have been agreed upon. Because of the size of
the tasks still remaining, success will not only depend on the present proi--
ect but will also require the continuing political will on the part of the
Government to pursue increasingly difficult steps. The efforts of the Gov-
ernment and FA will require the parallel assistance and support of the Bank.
1.05      Other Bank Group lending for transportation in Argentina has con-
sisted of two highway loans, the first (288-AR) of US$48.5 million equivalent
in 1961 which is fully disbursed and the second (619-AR) of UJS$25 million
equivalent in 1969. A third highway loan of US$67.5 million equivalent has
just been negotiated.
1.06      This appraisal is based on information supplied by the Government
of Argentina and the Argentine Railways and on the findings of Bank missions
in May and November 1970, comprising Messrs. Blumstein (railway engineer),
Chapman (financial analyst), Houston (consultant economist), Kesson (rail-
way engineer) and Marco (economist). This report was prepared bv them and
edited by Miss V. Foster.
2. BACKGROUND
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      Argentina with a land area of 2.8 million km2 is the second largest
country in South America and is more than twice as large as Spain, France,
and Italy combined. Its population is estimated at about 23.3 million (1970)
and has been growing at the average rate of 1.5% per annum during the past
decade. Almost one-third of the population is contained within the city and
immediate surroundings of Buenos Aires, while two-thirds is concentrated
within the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Cordoba (15, of the land
area). These provinces account for about 80% of the country's agricultural
production and almost all of its industrial output.
2.02      Argentina has an exceptionally favorable resource endowment in
relation to its population, but its economic histcry has been characterized
by slow and uneven growth and considerable inflation. Stabilization poli-
cies reduced the rise in the cost of living (20.7% per annum in the 1960's)
to 16.2% in 1968 and 7.6% in 1969. The figure for 1970 returned to about
13.5%, due mainly to an increase in the price of beef and wage awards. Be-
tween 1961 and 1970, GDP grew in real terms at an average rate of 3.7% per
annum or just over 2% on a per capita basis. Real wages rose only an aver-
age of 1.9% per annum during the same period. Per capita GDP, which grew
at 4% as a yearly average for the last four years, reached about US$82) in
1970, and is the second highest in Latin America.
2.03      The production potential of the country is high, and an annual
average growth in real GDP of about 5.5% is projected over the next five



- 3 -
years. This will generate a substantially larger demand for transport of
both primary products and manufactured goods.
2.04      Major transport flows in IArgentina consist of agricultural products
and other raw materials moving main]y from the interior to ports and popula-
tion centers on the coast. Machinery and other production inputs, vehicles,
and manufactured consumer goods move largely in the opposite directions to
the agricultural, mining, and forestry areas. All of the main transport
modes are significantly involved.
B.   The Transport Sector
2.05      The extensive railwav system (40,000 km) was built mostly in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was the only means for trans-
porting rapidly increasing quantities of grain and livestock to market. The
system radiates from the principal ports, especially Buenos Aires, to the
producing areas (Map, IBRD 2418R1).  Since then the economy has become more
diversified with emphasis on light industry concentrated in the La Plata-
Buenos Aires-Santa Fe-Cordoba corridor. Agricultural products now account
for less than half the railway freight tonnage. The railways carry over a
million passengers per day on the Buenos Aires urban services, as well as
substantial intercity passenger traffic.
2.06      Highway construction became important after the railways were
already well developed. There was a major period of building from 1931 to
1944, followed by lower levels of construction until the early 1960's when
a more active program was resumed. There is now an extensive and generally
well-maintained system of about 137,000 km designated as national and pro-
vincial primary highways, about 50,000 km of which are surfaced. In addition,
there are some 800,000 km of secondary and tertiary roads and tracks. The
vehicle fleet has expanded rapidly in recent years; in 1968 it contained over
a million light vehicles, about 27,000 buses, 650,000 trucks, and 69,000
trailers. There is now approximately one vehicle for every 11 persons (com-
pated with one vehicle for 38 persons in Brazil and one for 4.5 in France).
Road transport now provides many of the services required by industry and
agriculture, especially over medium and short distances.
2.07      Domestic transport by wat:er, both coastwise and by river, is im-
portant, accounting for about one-third of total freight ton-km, mostly in
heavy bulk commodities. Petroleum pipelines have become a major factor,
accounting for about 10% of total t:on-km, and will be expanded in the 1970-74
period. Domestic air transport has been growing rapidly; all provincial
capitals, main cities, and principal tourist areas are served. In 1969, over
1,580,000 passengers utilized these services. Extensive international ocean
shipping and air services effectively link Argentina to all parts of the
world.
2.08      Tables 1 and 2 show the weneral evolution of freight traffic, by
mode of transport, since 1950 and projections to 1974. The overall growth
of the economy is expected to result in an increase in shipments from 74,200



-4-
million ton-km in 1968 to 108,200 million in 1974 (an average annual growth
of 6.5% compared with 5.5% for GDP), with significant increase in all modes.
Between 1960 and 1967, railway freight traffic diminished and the railwav
share of total freight movements (in ton-km) declined from 32% to 16%.
Meanwhile, truck traffic more than doubled. The change in management of
FA in early 1967 has led to a considerable improvement in operations with
the result that traffic increases have been achieved in 1968, 1969 and 1970.
While the railway share of total traffic is likely to continue to decline,
the absolute volume of freight carried is expected to increase further and
that of passengers to remain at about the present level, provided that im-
proved services are offered. Details of expected traffic are given in
paragraphs 3.20 and 3.21.
2.09      The Bank Transport Mission which visited Argentina in September
1968, at the request of the Government, concluded that there would remain a
useful and economic position for the railways to fill, particularly for the
longer distance haulage of bulk commodities and for urban transport in the
Greater Buenos Aires area. More recent studies confirm the potential econo-
mic role of the railways in Argentina.
C.   Transport Coordination
2.10      Until recently, little has been done in Argentina to coordinate the
development of the various modes of transport to ensure that each performs
the functions to which it is inherently best suited. Probably the most im-
portant detriment to transport functions in Argentina has been the neglect
of the railways from 1946 to 1966. During this period, railway rates and
fares were subject to Government approval and were kept at artificially low
levels to avoid contributing directly to increases in the cost of living.
However, the deterioration of equipment and service due to lack of renewal
investment was such that even with low tariffs the railways could not main-
tain their traffic during a period in which total ton-km of freight transport
in Argentina more than doubled.
2.11      Trucks are mostly operated by owners and truckers and are not
closely regulated with respect to services offered and rates charged. There
has been a large flow of private capital into trucking, taking advantage of
improved equipment becoming available and, in recent years, of improved
roads to compete strongly with the weakened and deteriorated railways. As
a result, a considerable amount of traffic is now moving by road that could
be handled more economically by an efficient railway system, a trend which
could continue as total traffic expands in coming years. Overall, the pres-
ent system of highway user charges generates revenues which certainly cover
the relevant economic costs of providing and maintaining the road system.
The charges, however, have borne more heavily on automobiles than on large
trucks, but in January 1971, when all fuel taxes were increased, that on gas
oil was increased by a relatively much larger amount than that on gasoline,
which corrected the position to some extent. The allocation of traffic. in
any case, has been more the result of inferior railway service than of rate
differences; the recent changes in highway user charges will improve slight-
lv the competitive position of FA. A study is in progress concerning the



-5-
general influence of road user charges on vehicle ownership and use, commis-
sioned by the Highway Administration under the Secretariat of Public Works
and Transport. The Government also intends to carry out a broader economic
study of road user charges, with special emphasis on urban areas, and the
Bank will be given the opportunity to comment upon the terms of reference.
2.12      There have been recent improvements in the Government organization
for policy formation and administration of transport activities. The National
Development Council (CONADE) is intended to have an important role in major
policy and investment decisions. The Ministry Reorganization Law of October
1969 largely remedied previous divisions of responsibility between different
ministries and different Secretariats of State. Most of the agencies dealing
with transport now come under the F[inistry of Public Works and Services. A
Sectoral Development Office is functioning in the Secretariat of Public Works
and Transport and is becoming an important factor in planning and coordination.
An interagency working group has been created to evaluate proposals for clos-
ing unprofitable railway branch lines. It considers the alternatives of main-
taining railway services and of shifting traffic to road transport. Arrange-
ments can be made for continuing rail service with financial subsidy where
it is determined that the rail alternative is less costly to the country
in economic terms. The group is cLosely associated with the Sectoral
Development Office, and techniques of analysis adaptable to deeper studies
of major transportation corridors should emerge from this work.
2.13      The Greater Buenos Aires area presents special problems of coor-
dination between rail and road services for handling an intense and grow-
ing volume of traffic in goods and passengers. Planning agencies have been
established, and a transport investment plan for the Buenos Aires metropoli-
tan area is to be completed in 1971. The plan should set up priorities
among the proposed large investments in the coastal corridor La Plata-Buenos
Aires-Tigre (Map IBRD 2635) for railways, highways and subways in order to
avoid undue competition for the same passenger traffic. The railway propo-
sal is for the improvement and electrification of the urban services on the
Roca railway and the Bank has proposed that an economic study be made; the
Government is still considering the matter. There may be economic justifica-
tion on urban congestion, pollution and other grounds for subsidized railway
service to retard the growth of automobile traffic.
2.14      The Mesopotamia region, lying between the Parana and Uruguay Rivers,
also has a major transport coordination problem. The Government is building
the Zarate-Brazo Largo Bridge to provide direct access by both road and rail
to Buenos Aires. The financial implications for FA of this connection have
not been made explicit. A study of the economic roles of road, rail, and
river transport in Mesopotamia has been completed and the results, as they
will affect FA, are being examined by the Government and FA.

3. ARGENTINE RAILWAYS
A.   General
3.01      Until 1946 there were a large number of individual railway systems
in Argentina, mostly private but some owned by the Government. The private
railways were purchased by the Federal Government in that year and all were
formed into six systems, four having broad gauge (1.676i m), one standard
gauge (1.453 m) and one meter gauge (1.0 m) (Table 3). There was a small
headquarters organization but it provided only a loose control over the
individual railways. The six systems, broadly serving different geographical
areas fanning out from Buenos Aires, are noted below and are illustrated on
Map IBRD 2418R1.
Gauge           Length
System                      m               km            Area Served
Roca                       1.676          8,700        South and Southwest
Sarmiento                 1.676           3,800        Southwest to West
San Martin                1.676           4,700        West
Mitre                      1.676           6,300       Northwest
Urquiza                    1.435           3,300       North
Belgrano                  1.00           13,500        Mostly Northwest and North
Total                                    40,300
The Urquiza standard gauge system is largely isolated from the others but the
Belgrano meter gauge system is intermingled with the broad gauge railways to
some extent. All the railways carry considerable commuter traffic in the
Buenos Aires area.
B. Organization and Management
3.02      As noted in Chapter 1, the railways were placed under military
control in early 1967. The military personnel brought a new outlook to bear,
restoring discipline and morale and improving services.
3.03      As a state enterprise FA comes within the portfolio of the Minister
of Public Works and Services and, under the Enterprise Law (No. 18360 dated
September 17, 1969), the management is the responsibility of a President, a
Board of Directors and an executive Vice-President. The Board is composed of
the President, as Chairman, the Vice-President and three to six directors; 1/
at the present time these are all military. The new law gives FA greater
freedom to operate as a commercial enterprise, and Government control is now
limited to such items as investment plans, annual budgets and accounts, and
1/   Two "Sindicos" (non-voting members) additionally represent the Min-
istries of Finance and Public Works and Services.

maximum tariff levels. FA can make proposals for the closure of unremunerative
lines and services; the Government must give decisions within a time limit and,
if the proposals are rejected, determine the sources from which the deficits
shall be met. The law is provisional during the management by the military
personne:l. The loan documents contain a provision which defines as an event
of default of the proposed loan any modification affecting adversely and
substantially the conduct of FA's operation or financial condition.
3.04      A new general management organization was established in 1968 to
strengthen the central control and administration of the railways; Annexes
1 and 2 give the details. The planning division is new and has been res-
ponsible for many of the restructuring proposals and the progress made so
far in FA.
3.05      Military personnel occupy the majority of senior administrative
positions at headquarters and in the railways; they are able men, mostly
engineers with industrial management training. Senior technical posts are
held by civilians who are generally experienced and competent. Due to past
low salaries in comparison with other enterprises, there is a shortage of
good quality middle level administrative and technical staff, capable of
being trained for senior posts and particularly of replacing the military
personnel eventually. There is need for further standardization and
coordination between headquarters and the railways which, until recently,
have planned and operated individually. To improve the position, FA is
(a) increasing salaries (para. 3.09), (b) making promotions on merit rather
than on seniority, (c) improving the administrative control of the indivi-
dual railways in conjunction with reducing the number of broad gauge systems
from four to two, (d) centralizing the control of workshops (para. 3.17), (e)
improving staff administration, anc. (f) extending training facilities; and
has engaged consultants to assist with technical changes, 1/ economic and
commercial studies, 2/ and financial matters. 3/
C.   Staff
3.06      The number of staff has varied considerably from about 130,000
in 1942, to 219,000 in 1956, to 171,000 in 1966.  Since then FA has reduced
staff by attrition to 145,000 in November 1970.  FA plans to reduce the staff
further to about 120,000 at the end of 1975. Reliance on attrition has
meant that reductions have not beeni related to quality or position. Many
of those leaving have been essential personnel, because FA salaries have
not been competitive; on the other hand there are many places, such as the
workshops, where there are local st:aff surpluses (para. 3.17).

3.07      To deal with localized problems, FA will need the assistance of
the Government in the retraining and re-employment of surplus staff. FA
has made detailed reviews of future requirements, redeoloyment needed and
redundancies. With this information available, FA and the Government have
prepared realistic time-phased programs setting out the staff reductions,
and the means bv which they will be achieved.
3.08      There are five FA staff unions, the largest of which has a member-
ship of 124,000; they exercise considerable pressures and in the past have
used the strike weapon extensively.  Under the present Government, strikes
are illegal but still occur occasionally in the various state enterprises;
FA had some localized labor troubles in 1969. Wages in all enterprises
(state and private) were increased in 1969 and 1970, and the labor situation
improved. A further wage increase was made on January 1, 1971.
3.09      FA has started to improve salaries paid to managerial, supervisory
and skilled staff. In 1969, FA made increases (in addition to statutory
wage awards) of:
(a) up to 40% to about 300 high level management staff; and
(b) about 20% to approximately 1,000 professionally qualified
staff.
D.   Railway Property
(i) Railway Lines
3.10      For the traffic, present and foreseen, the existing railways are
over-large with many duplicated services and facilities. FA is carrying out
a detailed analysis and is taking simultaneous action to reduce services
and facilities to the minimum needed for expected traffic (rationalization),
and to recommend closing lines where rationalization is not adequate to
cover out-of-pocket costs. The following table summarizes the situation
assessed as at present:

- 9 -
3.11      FA has recently completed a preliminary general review of the
whole system, has rationalized services on about 3,900 km of branch and
secondary lines and has recommended to the Government about 2,700 km of line
for closure. In addition, all services on the Urquiza and freight services
on the Belgrano railways have been reorganized to improve schedules and to
teduce train-km. FA has prepared programs for 1971-75 (Table 4) to (a) carry
out further rationalization of services (18,700 km), (b) examine lines for
possible closure (6,200 km), and (c) continue the overall reorganization of
train services and facilities, both passenger and freight.
3.12      Much of the track material is old and the main traffic lines need
better standards of material and maintenance for the volumes of traffic
and speeds in force. An analysis of existing tracks by traffic volume and
approximate condition is given in Table 3. FA has been carrying out a
limited amount of complete track renewal and improvement, but the program
needs to be accelerated and subsequent maintenance to be improved. Over the
next five years about 3,000 km of complete relaying and 3,800 km of improve-
ment would be appropriate to FA's requirements and capacity to carry out
the work. The provision of mechanical track equipment is essential to
achieve the necessary quality of work. Signalling and traffic control
equipment is mostly old but some modern signalling and centralized traffic
control equipment has been installed; extensions are needed for safety and
capacity reasons in areas of high traffic density, particularly on the
Greater Buenos Aires urban lines. As part of the rationalization of serv-
ices, many intermediate yards and depots are to be eliminated and improve-
ments are to be made at those retained.
(ii) Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.13      Table 5 gives the details of the nominal fleet:  about 1,800 steam
locomotives, 1,200 diesel engines, 280 diesel railcars, 400 trailers, 760
electric railcars, 4,600 passenger and 71,000 freight cars. Utilization of
available equipment is generally gcod, with the exception of steam locomotives
and freight cars (Table 6). Availability is the key issue.
3.14      Diesel locomotives and railcars have poor availability (55%) due
mainly to a shortage of components, lack of preventive maintenance and some
unsatisfactory designs. With the assistance of SOFRERAIL, a detailed review
of the future possibilities for using the diesel fleet has been completed;
some 60 locomotives should be scrapped and 140 allotted to secondary and
shunting duties, leaving about 1,0(10 available for main line duties. A time-
phased program for increasing the availability to 85% by 1975 has been pre-
pared (Annex 3). This program is fundamental for improving operations but
is dependent upon action on (a) an adequate supply of components and (b) a
reorganization of workshop managenmnt. FA has taken appropriate steps on
both these matters.
3.15      Tn order to relieve part of the pressure on the workshops during
reorganization, to obtain early financial savings from the elimination of
steam traction, an(l to allow for the increased traffic forecast, some
additional diesel locomotives will be needed for main line operations



- 10 -
(Annex 4). In addition, diesel rail tractors should replace steam and
heavy diesel locomotives for light shunting operations. This investment,
combined with the rehabilitation program of diesel motive power, shouldt
enable steam to be phased out by 1975.
3.16      Availability of electric railcars, passenger cars and freight cars
is poor, due partly to age and partly to unsatisfactory maintenance. Re-
placement of the oldest railcars and passenger cars is proposed, the latter
at a rate of about 90 per year.  Of the 71,000 freight cars, only some 40,000
are in reasonable condition, with only 12,000 of these less than 30 years
old; most of the cars are of low capacity, not suited to modern operations or
the easy handling of bulk commodities. A systematic scrapping program for
old cars is now under way. FA obtained 1,200 new cars in 1968 and 600 in
1969 and ordered about 2,200 in 1970.  The future fleet size for 1975 traffic
is estimated to be under 60,000 cars (Annex 4) and, to enable FA to offer
satisfactory freight services, the rate of replacement needs to be maintained
at about 2,000 per year during the 1971-75 period.
3.17      There are at present 23 workshops, each working on several pro-
duction lines (steam, diesel, railcars, passenger cars, freight cars).
First, the direction of workshops is to be centralized at headquarters
during 1970/71, and next, the number of workshops is to be reduced to 18
by 1975. Associated with the reduction will be a decrease in stores and
wayside depots. The labor force, about 49,200 in 1969 (19,500 in workshops
and 29,700 in wayside depots and stores), should decrease to less than 33,700
(of which about 14,700 in workshops) by 1975. FA has prepared a detailed
time-phased program for implementation as part of the general staff redeploy-
ment and reduction (para 3.07). FA is to continue its studies with a view
to achieving additional reductions both in workshops and in staff during the
period.
(iii) Other Property
3.18      Most buildings on the railways are old and in many cases (in work-
shops and freight yards) too large for present needs. The buildings used
by the public are maintained to a good standard while other structures in
use are maintained to a lesser but adequate standard. Some reconstruction
and alterations to buildings will be needed in conjunction with moderniza-
tion of passenger and freight-handling facilities. FA is preparing schemes
for the commercial redevelopment of excess property in large centers.
E.   Traffic and Operations
(i) Freight Traffic
3.19      Freight traffic statistics for the years 1968-70 and forecasts
for the years 1971-75 are given in Table 7.  In the past, 1937 was the
peak tonnage year at 38.7 million tons. Thereafter, increasing road com-
petition and deteriorating standards of railway service caused a decline
to 16.8 million tons in 1967. At the same time, FA has become increasingly



- 11 -
a long-distance carrier, average haul increasing from 327 km in 1937 to 639
km in 1969. Thus ton-km have not decreased so much; the peak was 16.5 bil-
lion ton-km in 1951, with a low of 11.2 billion ton-km in 1967. Since then,
some recovery has taken place, reflecting improvements already achieved by
the new management.
3.20      Over the period 1971-75, tonnage is expected to increase further
by 30% to about 27.1 million tons and ton-km by 22% to about 16.3 billion
ton-km. Some decrease in the average length of haul to about 600 km is ex-
pected as a result of shifts in prcduction and consumption centers. The
traffic forecasts, developed by FA and its consultants with the assistance
of Bank staff, take account of expected further improvements in FA services,
vigorous commercial action and the costs of competing road transport.
Traffic increases are expected in agricultural commodities (better equipment
and service, grain storage facilities and special rates), minerals and
building materials (increased building and production activity nearer Buenos
Aires), and miscellaneous manufactured and processed goods (growing indus-
trialization, improved service and sales efforts). On the other hand, FA's
share of livestock traffic has fallen from 65% of the total in 1950 to about
20% at present and there is little prospect of growth even with improved
services. Oil traffic, too, is expected to decline with further pipeline
construction.
(ii) Passenger Traffic
3.21       Passenger traffic statistics for the years 1966-70, together with
forecasts for 1971-75, are given itt Table 8. The urban traffic in the
Buenos Aires metropolitan area accounts for about 91% of the passengers
and 58% of the pass-km. The increase in highway capacity and quality and
the extended use of buses and private automobiles have, in the past, limited
the growth of railway passenger traffic. In the forecasts it is assumed that
the potential passenger traffic increase which might be expected from the
better service now being offered w:Lll be countered by fare increases (para.
3.27); total passenger traffic, therefore, is expected to remain at about the
same level through 1975. However, for Buenos Aires urban traffic there may
be economic reasons to encourage the use of rail transport and to limit fare
increases (para. 3.28).
(iii) Operations
3.22      Table 6 gives a summary of FA's operating statistics 1964-69.
Statistics for the individual railwqays for 1969 are shown in Table 9. The
operating performance of FA was poor pre-1967; under the new management
general improvement has been shown in 1967-69, although there are differences
among the individual railways. There is room for further considerable im-
provement; in particular, train loads and the utilization of freight cars
are poor. For passenger trains average occupancy is reasonable (53% urban
and 32% general) and the general timekeeping has improved, but further



- 12 -
progress is needed. Serious accidents are normally few 1/ but minor derail-
ments due to track and vehicle defects are high, and need to be reduced as
better standards of maintenance of track and equipment become effective.
3.23      FA has made a start with measures for improved operations and
intends to pursue these vigorously during 1971-75: (a) rationalizing of
train services; (b) using heavier freight trains and more "block" trains
for bulk loads (both requiring improved freight cars); (c) improving control
of locomotives and cars (requiring improved telecotimunications); and (d)
concentrating and improving marshalling yards and freight terminals (to re-
duce delays and improve utilization).
(iv) Commercial Policy
3.24      The fundamental need is for FA to improve the services offered,
but this must be accompanied by a parallel effort to sell these services
to potential customers who have been discouraged by FA's past poor perform-
ance. Efforts should also be made to improve FA's public image. The physi-
cal rehabilitation of FA will not by itself achieve improved utilization of
equipment or the freight traffic increases forecast. FA has made a start on
a vigorous commercial effort and is preparing, with the aid of SOFRERAIL and
FIEL, a time-phased commercial pricing program, based on experience obtained
in a pilot area, and on the costing system being introduced for tariff
purposes. FA is intensifying its efforts particularly to provide (a) private
sidings to large users; (b) grain silos and other track-side storage; and
(c) mechanized cargo-handling facilities; it is also making special market-
ing studies and negotiating rates for special tariffs and full car loadings.
Time-phased action programs for the next two years have been prepared by FA.
F. Tariffs and Costs
3.25      Tariff levels have been generally low, although in 1967 passenger
fares were raised by 50% and freight rates by an average of 66%; this was
followed in 1969 by two increases, the first (in May) of 25% on urban and
15% on general passenger fares and the second (in December) of 30% and 21%
respectively, together with surcharges on particular passenger services.
These increases should be viewed against the rise of 25% in the cost of
living over the two years 1968 and 1969. Parcel traffic is not remunera-
tive, and FA has directed much of it to independent forwarding companies.
Starting in 1969 the Government is (a) paying for the carriage of mail
(estimated to bring in about $a 35 million annually), and (b) reimbursing
for the free or reduced fare transportation of military personnel (about
$a 15 million in 1970).
1/   Although a very serious accident on February 1, 1970 caused the deaths
of 260 passengers.



- 13 -
3.26      FA and FIEL have made traffic cost studies but sufficient basic
data have not yet been available to establish accurate figures, particularly
for incremental costs, as required for rate fixing and tariff structuring.
FA has now established a good costing organization, working to sound tech-
niques, and in association with FIEL, is completing detailed cost analyses
of main commodities. SOFRERAIL is studying the tariff structure, using
these costs, to enable FA to (a) ensure that all commodities will at least
cover marginal costs, (b) set maximum tariffs according to the competitive
situation, and (c) give emphasis to Loadability.
3.27      In order to meet the financial targets (para 6.16) FA intends
to make (a) increases in freight rates sufficient to increase average
revenues per ton-km by about 2% each year, 1971-75; and (b) increases in
fares of 15% per year, 1971-73, on urban, and 10% per year, 1972-74, on
general, passenger traffic. These increases will be in real terms; in
accordance with the Enterprise Law, FA will propose and the Government will
decide promptly on any additional adjustments in the tariffs to offset in-
creased costs arising from general inflationary conditions. In line with
this arrangement, and with FA's proposals, the following tariff charges were
made in January 1971:
(a)  Freight traffic - increases of 10-21% to several major
commodity rates, raising average revenue per ton-km
by about 15.5% (i.e., norrnal annual rise of 2% plus
about 13.5% to offset inf:Lationary cost increases);
(b)  Urban passengers - increases to individual fares, of
10-23%, raising average revenue per pass-km by about
15.5%, to offset inflatioinary cost increases;
(c)  General passengers - increases to individual fares of
12-17%, increasing average revenue per pass-km by
about 13%, to offset inflationary cost increases.
3.28      In implementing the tariff increases, special attention will have
to be given to the appropriate pricing of urban rail services in view of the
potentially large economic losses that could occur if only financial targets
are considered. Such losses could occur if, in pricing rail services higher
than the relevant economic (incremental) costs to achieve financial targets,
traffic is diverted to the already congested highways and streets serving
Buenos Aires. In the study of the Roca railway improvement proposals,
special emphasis is to be given to this pricing problem to ascertain whether
the financial needs of FA with respect to urban services should be filled from
user charges (fares) or partially from an economically justified Government
subvention.

4. THE PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Plan
4.01      FA has prepared a five-year investment plan 1971-75.  The plan
has been appraised by the Bank and, following some revisions as a result
of this appraisal, is estimated to cost about $a 3,350 million (about US$840
million equivalent) with an estimated foreign exchange component of US$360
million (Table 10 and Annex 5); a summary is given below. Assurances have
been obtained that the Government and FA shall implement the full plan,
shall periodically review it, and shall not make major additions to or
deletions from the plan without the agreement of the Bank. If the economic
study of the Roca railway electrification scheme shows it to be justified,
then this may imply a further project for Bank participation.

4.02      The recovery of FA depends not only on the investment plan but also
on parallel inter-related actions on (a) staff reductions, (b) rationaliza-
tion of services and closure of lines, (c) rehabilitation of diesel locomo-
tives, (d) reduction of workshops, and (e) commercial plans, for which FA
has prepared time-phased action programs (Chapter 3). These programs are to
be carried out by FA in association with the investment plan.
B.   The Project
4.03      The project consists of the first two years of FA's investment plan
1971-75. The total cost is estimated at $a 1,472 million (US$368 million
equivalent) with a foreign exchange component expected to be between US$166
million and US$172 million, depending on the bids won by Argentine suppliers
in international competition; US$84 million of this would be provided by the
proposed loan.  A breakdown of the project and of the expenditure suitable
for finance under the proposed loan, with brief details, is given below
(also in Annex 5):

4.04      New locomotives and cars (the largest item) cover 120 diesel loco-
motives, 100 small rail tractors (for shunting), 175 passenger cars (locally
built) and 4,400 freight cars. The locomotives will enable the use of steam
power to be reduced and will relieve part of the pressure on the workshops
during reorganization. The rail tractors will replace large locomotives,
both steam and diesel, for light shunting operations in stations, yards and
private sidings. All will form part of the program for the elimination of
steam traction by 1975. However, agreement has been reached that locomo-
tives for the Urquiza railway are to be obtained only if the revised traf-
fic forecast, based on the transport study of the Mesopotamia region, justi-
fies the purchase (para 2.14). The passenger cars are part of a continuing
program for the replacement of over-age wooden-bodied cars, unsafe under
modern operating conditions. The freight cars will replace old, small ca-
pacity cars also not suited to present-day operations in heavy fast trains;
the majority will be specialized cars for the easy handling of bulk commo-
dities and should improve operating efficiency and the services offered to
the public.
4.05      The item for locomotive and car rehabilitation is to (a) provide
components for the rehabilitation of existing diesel locomotives, (b) im-
prove existing suitable freight cars for use in heavy fast trains and (c)
provide equipment related to the reduction and reorganization of workshops.
4.06      Track renewals cover complete replacement of rail and timber
sleepers, with the welding of rail joints and the provision of stone
ballast, on the main trunk routes. Improvements cover the partial re-
placement of rail and sleepers plus the provision of welded rail joints
and stone ballast on the more heavily utilized secondary lines. The
regular cycle of such work has fallen considerably into arrears during
past years and the annual amounts need to be increased to enable FA to
continue to carry present traffic and to provide higher speeds and better
services for future traffic; about 2,100 km of track will be dealt with
during the period. Mechanical track maintenance and workshop equipment will
improve the quality of track work in the future.
4.07      Lesser amounts are provided for improvements to (a) signalling
and telecommunications, and (b) structures, to improve the services and
utilization of equipment. Before purchases are made on item (a), decisions
are to be taken on common policies and standardization of equipment through-
out FA.
4.08      The estimates in the project are based on 1970 prices but a
contingency allowance of about 10% has been added to all costs. Local
costs are expected to rise about 5% per annum over the period 1971-73
while prices for imported material and equipment due to present increasing
labor and other costs in the industrialized countries may rise by about
the same amount.

C.   Financing of the Project and the Plan
4.09      Throughout both the projeci: and plan periods, FA will be unable
to provide from earnings any finance for investment, which will consequently
have to be financed entirely from borrowing and from Government resources.
The total financial requirements of the project, US$368 million equivalent,
will be financed as follo4s:
US$ Million
Maximum foreign exchange                       172
Bank loan                                       84
Suppliers' (Foreign) Credits                    34
Capital Grant from Government                   54
Local Currency Cost                            196
Local Bank Loans and Credits                    81
Capital Grant from Government                  115
4.10      In the full plan period l971-75, an expenditure of US$339 million
equivalent will have to be financed.  Presumably over the last three years
of the plan a similar proportion will be obtainable from foreign and inter-
national credits as tnder the first two-year project. The balance once more
will have to be provided or arranged by the Government. The detailed cash
flow is presented in paragraph 6.18 following.
D.   Execution of the Project, Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      PA is competent with the 1help of its consultants to carry out the
project. All imported goods to be Financed from the proposed loan would be
acquired through international competitive bidding except for the components
for locomotives, which will necessarily involve negotiated procurement of
about US$15 million from the nine original suppliers in seven countries.
The components are needed to restore to service valuable capital assets
"cannibalized" in the past due to shortage of spare parts.  Suppliers' cred-
its are not normally available for this type of purchase. Financing by the
Bank will facilitate this operation which is a vital aspect of the rehabil-
itation effort. Argentine firms may participate in bidding for some of the
track maintenance, signalling and telecommunications equipment and also for
the freight cars (see next paragraph). All customs duties on imported equip-
ment are higher than 15% and Argentine firms will be accorded a preference
margin of 15% in lieu of import duty in the bid evaluation of equipment and
freiqht cars. Contracts for major track renewals and improvements, amounting
to US$500,000 equivalent or more, would be let after international competitive
bidding.  Contracts for less than US$500,000 would be tendered locally as at
present and would not involve Bank financing. Disbursements on major track
renewal and improvement contracts would be to meet the estimated foreign ex-
change component which is 50% of the total cost.



- 18 -
4.12      Four thousand four hundred freight cars are required.  The bogies
for the cars are to go wholly to international bidding, there being no local
manufacture of bogies.  The freight car bodies (that is, the cars less the
bogies) are to be procured in two groups of similar car bodies of approxima-
tely equal numbers. For the first group international bids will be invited.
For the second group bids will be invited only from local bidders, there
being an established local industry which the Government wishes to continue
to support. In this group, local bids must fall, or be negotiated, within
125% of the lowest bids for similar cars in the internationally procured
first group. Should this not occur, these cars will be offered to the suc-
cessful bidder in the first group. The Bank loan woulc finance the car bogies
100%, and the car bodies in the first group 90% (on the basis that the cars
if imported will arrive as components and be erected locally) whether the
contracts are won by foreign or local firms. Tlhe Bank will not finance the
cars in the second group, except for any which may be offered to successful
bidders in the first group at a price no higher than that stipulated in his
bid. The detailed arrangements are set out in Annex 6.
4.13      Should local firms win all the freight cars in the first group,
a maximum of about US$6 million of the loan would be financing local currency
expenditure (Annex 5). It should be noted that FA's expected external bor-
rowing is only about US$118 million compared to the minimum estimated foreign
exchange content of the project of US$l66 million.
4.14      A law has been passed recently in Argentina modifying a previous law
and requiring all state enterprises to use local industry to the maximum ex-
tent available. However, the Government has agreed to approve the loan
agreement by law, which will enable FA to procure goods under the proposed
loan in compliance with the Bank's normal requirements. The enactment of
this law is to be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
4.15      Disbursement of the proposed loan is given in Table 11.  Because
of inevitable delays in the delivery of equipment and the execution of track
works, the disbursements will extend through 1974. The project forms part
of the continuing investment plan 1971-75 which has been appraised as a whole
and to which further Bank loans may be rnade. It is proposed, therefore, that
if there are any savings on Bank financed items of the project, thev be used
to finance the foreign exchange costs of continuincg items in the plan, subject
to review and agreement with the Bank.
5.  ECONOMIC EVALIJATION
A.   General
5.01      The 1971-75 Investment Plan is part of a coordinated program of
reorganization, commercial action, and physical investment designed (a) to



- 19 -
preserve and to restore the ability of the railways to carry a substantial
part of total Argentine freight and passenger traffic; and (b) to improve
economic use of resources and to eliminate fiscal pressure and inflationary
effects produced by railway and Government deficits.
5.02      If this recovery program were not carried out there would be
further deterioration in the quality of railway services, and large tonnages
of agricultural products, building materials, manufactures, and other goods,
as well as long-distance and urban passengers, would be diverted to higher
cost highway carriers. No significant diversions to air or water transport
wotuld occur.  Passenger traffic is assumed to be diverted to buses and the
higher cost of diversion to private cars is not considered.
5.03      A large part of the investment in the 1971-75 plan is to make up
past deficiencies in the orderly renewal and replacement of rolling stock,
track, and other facilities. Some further investment of this type will be
required in the 1976-80 period, after which it is assumed that a capital
renewal and replacement program adequate to maintain the railway at normal
levels of efficiency and service will be carried out. Estimates of the
investments required after 1975 have been included in the economic analysis
(Annex 7).
5.04      The investments proposed for the 1971-75 period are adequate if
efficiently utilized to allow achievement of the forecast levels of traffic.
This traffic is described in paragraphs 3.20 and 3.21 and shown in detail in
Tables 7 and 8. The program is as large as FA can efficiently handle in
the years concerned. Detailed alternative plans with smaller investments
in the 1971-75 period were not available for comparison. However, a sensi-
tivity analysis indicates that it is possible to attribute a high proportion
of total benefits to a hypothetical smaller plan and still to justify the
additional amount involved in the full plan. Therefore, it is believed that
the size of the program now proposed is justified and appropriate.
5.05      It is not possible to attribute specific portions of the traffic
to individual components of the recovery program, because all are needed;to
achieve the operating results and the traffic levels forecast. The proposed
plan does not represent a marginal increment to an efficiently functioning
system, but amounts to ensuring the continuance of a railway where it would
otherwise soon almost cease to exist as a major transport mode. Therefore,
the economic justification of the proposed investments has been analyzed in
terms of the benefits and costs of the program taken as a whole.
B.   Economic Benefits of the Five-Year Plan
5.06      The principal economic benefits of the railway program are the
avoided investment and operating costs of highway transport. Some labor
savings attributable to the program provide additional benefits, but these
are relatively small. Not included in the quantitatively estimated benefits
are savings in travel time and reduced loss and damage for freight and
passengers that would continue on the railways even in the absence of the



- 20 -
plan. There would also be benefits from reduction of accidents and from
highway congestion avoided. Some passenger traffic would probably be
diverted to private cars rather than buses, but the higher costs that would
be involved have not been estimated.
5.07      Owing to the uncertainties inherent in estimates of investment
costs, operating costs, labor savings, and traffic projections, a sensitivitv
analysis was performed to test the effects of variations from the estimates
believed to represent the most likely magnitudes. The economic rate of re-
turn for the total investment in the program was found to range from 14.5Z
with very conservative estimates of the variables (including stagnant
traffic over the investment life) to 26.5% with verv favorable assumptions.
The most probable economic return is 20.5% which confirms that the program
is economically well justified and of high economic priority. Iurther
details of the analysis are in Annex 7.
5.08       Sensitive factors for maintaining a high economic rate of return
for the plan are (a) early action to capture traffic and (b) control of
investment costs; these factors have been taken into account in determining
the timing of the plan outlavs. The investment plan should be carried out
as soon as possible; five years is the most reasonable duration that can
be expected for the physical accomplishment of the plan.
5.09      The five-year plan will have a beneficial impact on the Argentine
balance of payments. The probable amount of foreign resources in the plan
(43% of the total investment) is less than the amount of foreign exchange
that would be used in truck investment and road transport operations if the
railway plan were not carried out.
C.   The Project (1971-72)
5.10      The 1971-72 project under consideration for Bank financing covers
important investments in the first two years of the recovery plan. The
proposed timing for these investments is the most reasonable, taking into
account urgent needs for equipment and the practical ability to absorb this
new equipment and works. These investments are essential to carry the
traffic forecast by 1972; supporting operational and commercial development
activities are under way to promote earlv traffic growth. The investments
are appropriate for early procurement, and the Bank has asked FA to call as
soon as possible for competitive bids for the items in the first two years
of the recovery program.

6. EARNINGS AN) FINANCES
A.   Present Position
6.01      After nationalization in 1946 and 1947, the earning power and
financial condition of the Argentine railways steadily deteriorated, cul-
minating in a record working loss (before depreciation) of the equivalent
of US$158 million in 1966.
6.02      With declining efficiency, aggravated by political factors, loss
of workers' morale and discipline, and failure to maintain equipment to
proper standards, and confronted with rising road competition, the rail-
ways have been caught in a familiar vicious circle of expenses rising much
faster than revenues, leading to neglect of necessary investment and main-
tenance.
6.03      Under the new management, FA has made the first steps along what
is likely to be a long process of recovery; the rise in operating expendi-
ture has been virtually halted, and revenues, aided by traffic and tariff
increases, have risen substantially. The situation is illustrated by the
following summary oerating accounts for 1966- 69  (more detailed operating
accounts for 1964- 69  are given in rable 12):

Table 12: the latter are inadequate and the assessed figure for
1969 has been substituted to pive a more correct comparison of
earlier years with 1969.



- 22 -
6.04      Under the new management the working loss has been brought down
from $a 555 million in 1966 to $a 319 million in 1969; in terms of constant
1966 prices, the change has been from $a 555 million to about $a 205 mil-
lion. This is a reduction of almost two-thirds in real terms of the burden
on Government finances, which is a creditable achievement. All six railways
incurred operating losses in 1969, with operating ratios varying between
101% for the San Martin to 195% for the Belgrano. These, of course, under-
stated the position because of the very inadequate provision made for de-
preciation.
6.05      Labor cos-ts are the most important operating cost, being higher
than gross operating revenue, and 73% of total working expenditure in 1969.
National wage awards of November 1, 1969 and March 1, 1970 raised salary
levels by about 13%. Pensions and family allowances are payable by Govern-
ment, with FA contributing 10% to family allowances and 12% to the pension
fund (the staff contribute 8% to pensions). Material costs have been low,
mainly due to past lack of spares for maintenance, but are now increasing.
Fuel costs are affected adversely by the continued operation of steam
locomotives, using fuel oil, coal and wood.
6.06      FA has been revaluing its assets on a current cost basis and
the work is to be completed, and adequate provision for depreciation be
made, based on the revised values, by the end of 1972.
6.07      The balance sheets for 1964-69 are given in Table 13 and are

6.08      The value of inventories has been inc.reasing since 1966, mainly
due to the purchase of spares to improve the maintenance of locomotives
and rolling stock. In line with the reorganization of stores, FA is cur-
rently examining all stores holdings to eliminate obsolete and slow-moving
items; this review is to be completed by the end of 1972.
6.09      The debt consists of (a) loans from Eximbank and the Government
Central Bank and (b) liability for contractor financing. This latter is



_ 23 -
not entirely for debt already incurred, but is a mixture of liability for
progress payments due as work or equdipment is completed, and of debt re-
payments. Further details are given in Annex 8.
6.10      "Deferred asset:s" is also a mixture consisting of (a) commitments
for the value of work to be done or equipment to be delivered by contractors,
in general complementary to item (b) in paragraph 6.09 and (b) the value
of naterials (consumables and fixed assets) awaiting analysis and allocation
to the correct asset account. FA has agreed that this item will be substan-
tially cleared by the end of 1972.
6.11      One item of debt shown under "Government account" as of December
31, 1969, and still outstanding, relates to FA's 1967 contribution to pen-
sion funds ($a 143 million) not paid into Government funds due to shortage
of cash. This reflected FA's former lack of working capital with conse-
quent long delays in settlement of accounts, leading in turn to increased
costs. Recently working capital has been considerably improved, with $a 85
million being provided from the official savings bank (repayable over five
years), which has enabled FA to reduce considerably the delays in the settle-
ment of local accounts.
6.12      In its present form the balance sheet of FA is unsuited to an
enterprise which in the future is to operate on commercial lines. In line
with the general policy of reorganization of accounts, the balance sheet
is to be reconstructed by FA with the aid of consultants (para 6.23) by
the end of 1972.
B.   Future Prospects
6.13      FA's aim is (a) to hold oMterating expenses to about the present,
1971, level, (b) to increase revenues sufficiently to meet working expenses
by about 1975, thus eliminating the need for the large subsidy from Govern-
ment for operations, and (c) by about 1979, to cover all operating expenses,
including adequate depreciation.
6.14      In achieving (a) above, FA plans to use the savings arising from
the reduction in labor force to an average of about 120,000 in 1975, to
give selective increases to managerial, supervisory and skilled staff suffi-
cient to increase the average pay oE such staff by about 20% through 1975.
The actual amounts and timing of the selective pay rises should be regulated
so that total labor costs would vary within the limits of $a 1,100-1,120 mil-
lion each year. Any further general pay rises ordered by the Government,
such as recentlv announced (January 1971) will, of course, be in addition to
the above. The revised labor costs forecast for 1971 are about $a 1,086 mil-
lion for an average labor force of about 141,000 persons. This includes
basic salaries, allowances and provision for pensions and family allowances.
In each of the vears 1971-73, FA's contribution to the pension fund will rise
by 1%, to 1571 in 1973, with a corresponding reduction in the staff contribu-
tion. Each rise of 1% will cost FA about $a 7 million annually.



- 24 -
6.15      Revenue increases will be achieved by (a) increasing freight traf-
fic by about 3% per annum and at the same time adjusting tariffs in the light
of costing information and the competitive environment so as to raise the
average revenue per ton-km in real terms by about 2,, p.a. over the five vesrs,
and (b) raising urban and general passenger fares as explained in paragraph
3.27, while retaining passenger traffic at about the current level.
6.16      The forecast operating results over the period 1970-75 are given
in Table 14 and are summarized below.  These results, wlich indicate the
working ratio improving from 124 in 1970 to 98 in 1975, and the operating
ratio improving from 145 in 1970 to 115 in 1975, are believed to be as good
as can be achieved. Their attainment will require sustained and concerted
action by the Government and FA.

6.18      Over the project period (1971-72) FA will require $a 1,472 million
(US$368 million equivalent) for capital investment and $a 995 million
(US$249 million) for reimbursement cf debt service and net operating losses,
that is, a total of $a 2,467 million (US$617 million).  It is assumed that
for the capital investment, $a 336 million (US$84 million) will be provided
by the proposed loan, $a 136 million (US$34 million) from suppliers' credits
for locomotives and railcars on favorable terms and $a 323 million (US$81
million) in loans from local finance institutions, with the balance, plus
the amounts to meet debt service and operating losses, totalling $a 1,672
million (US$416 million), in the foim of equity from the Government.



- 26 -
6.19      In the remaining three years (1973-75) annual capital investment
needs will decrease, the total required being $a 1,884 million (US$471 mil-
lion equivalent). With improved operating revenues FA's net operating
losses will also decline but debt service will rise, the total reimburse-
ment being $a 913 million (US$228 million).  The total cash requirements
will then amount to $a 2,797 million (US$699 million) which it is assumed
may be met to the extent of about $a 1,203 million (US$301 million) by
borrowing from multilateral, bilateral and local sources and the balance,
$a 1,594 million (US$398 million), by the Government, on a declining scale,
over these three years.
6.20      In view of the unsatisfactory nature of FA's current balance
sheets and the revaluation of fixed assets presently under way, it is not
possible to project future balance sheets in the normal manner. Instead,
an attempt has been made to build up forecast statements on the basis of
(a) an estimate of the revised gross values of fixed assets, and of
accumulated depreciation, (b) the forecast operating results, (c) the
annual forecast of debt, and (d) the assumption that FA's accounts,
particularly those relating to equity and the Government accounts, will
be reorganized within the next two years. These summary tentative balance
sheets for the years 1971-75 are given in Table 16. Over the five years,
there should be a slight improvement in the current ratio, from 2.0 to 2.2;
the debt/equity ratio will range from 33/67 to 41/59 and should improve
thereafter.
6.21      Agreement has been reached that:
(i) the Government shall promptly provide all funds to cover
the annual deficits resulting from operations and debt
service and to carry out the plan;
(ii) FA shall (a) for 1971-75 take all necessary steps to
achieve the annual working and operating ratios set
out above, (b) provide annual depreciation of not less
than $A 200 million and (c) reconstruct the balance
sheet on modern commercial lines by the end of 1972; and
(iii) after 1975 FA shall aim to improve net operating revenues
so as to achieve an operating ratio of 100 by about 1979.
C.   Budgets, Accounts and Audit
6.22      FA, in the past, prepared annual operating and capital budgets
only. With the help of its consultants FA has now prepared budgets for a
five-year period 1971-1975, and will amend and extend them on an annual
basis.
6.23      The accountancy system meets governmental budget needs, but should
be converted to modern commercial practice. A start has been made, with the
installation of a large computer and with the reorganization of the system,



- 27 -
initially to facilitate the extraction of information essential for costing,
particularly in the workshops. FA has appointed an accounting and management
consulting firm to advise on statistical and management information systems
and has also appointed the same firm to advise on the reorganization of
accounting matters generally. A new centrally controlled internal check
system has been prepared by FA and will be reviewed by the accounting con-
sultants before implementation.
6.24      Under the new Enterprise Law, two Government auditors or "Sindicos"
are appointed, one responsible to the Ministry of Public Works and Services,
and the other to the Ministry of Finance. Their principal duties are to
check that FA conforms to its legal powers and to report upon FA's opera-
tional and financial performance. These arrangements are not sufficient
to ensure that FA's accounts are kepl. in accordance with generally accepted
standards and, consequently, as empowqered by the Law, FA has appointed pro-
fessional accountants to carry out commercial-style annual audits commenc-
ing with fiscal year 1969.
7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government of
the Republic of Argentina and FA on the following principal items:
(i)  FA's 1971-1975 investment plan and the limitations on
changing it (para. 4.01);
(ii)  time-phased action progranms on (a) staff reductions, (b)
rationalization of services and closure of lines, (c) re-
habilitation of diesel locomotives, (d) reduction of work-
shops and (e) commercial plans (para. 4.02);
(iii) revision of tariffs in stages including prompt adjustments
to meet such inflationary costs as general wage awards (para.
3.27);
(iv)  financial targets to reach a working ratio of 100 by 1975
and an operating ratio of 100 by about 1979 (paras. 6.16
and 6.21);
(v) provision of funds to meet operating deficits, debt service
and capital requirements (para. 6.21);
(vi)  modifications to the Enterprise Law, affecting adversely and
substantially the conduct of FA's operation and financial
condition, to be an event of default of the Loan (para. 3.03);
and
(vii)  procurement of freight cars, a portion being reserved to
local industry under suitable pricing arrangements (para.
4.12).



- 28 -
7.02      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$84
million equivalent to the Argentine Railways. A term of 25 years, includ-
ing four years of grace, is recommended for the loan.

Balance to make 60,000       -   44,000
3.4       Number of new cars planned for purchase 1971-75 at about 2,000
per year (which is the estimated rate at which new cars can be
absorbed by FA) = 10,000
3.5       Number of reasonably modern freight cars available after 1975 -
16,000 + 10,000 - 26,000
3.6       This will leave a further 34,000 new cars to be obtained in sub-
sequent years; however, the total should be reviewed periodically

in the light of traffic and operational developments because pro-
ductivity per car should improve and a total of about 50,000 cars
may prove sufficient.

ARGENTINE RAILWAYS
FA 1971-1975 Investment Plan - Main Items
Track Renewal and Improvement (25% of' total expenditure)
1.        As a result of past inadeqtuate track maintenance and material
replacement or improvement, there is a large backlog. PA has started re-
newals and improvements but the rate of work needs to be increased and
maintenance methods improved. AllowiLng for physical limitations to the
rate of increase in material supply, transportation and work execution, the
following annual lengths of complete track renewal and improvement (partial
renewal with suitable quality recovered material and making up shortages
with new) on main and secondary lineia are proposed:
1971    1972    1973    1974    1975      TOTAL
Renewal     km        450     500     600      700     800       3,050
Improvement km        500     700     800      900     900       3,800
2.        The normal standards being used are 50 kg/m rail on main lines
and 42.5 kg/m rail on secondary lines, with welded joints and carried on
local quebracho timber sleepers (life 40-60 years), supported in turn on
adequate stone ballast. Heavier rail of 60 kg/m is to be used on lines with
dense traffic, mainly in urban areas.
3.        Track maintenance standards need improvement by more systematic
methods, assisted by modern mechanical equipment, such as track defect
recording vehicles, track inspection cars, track and road vehicles for
labor and material, mobile joint and rail welding equipment, ballast
tampers, track liners, earth moving, grass cutting and weed killing units,
miscellaneous power assisted hand tools.
4.        Workshops are to be equipped for the welding of new and recovered
rail, the manufacture of switches aind crossings, the renovation and assembly
of track material and tools and the maintenance of signalling, telecommunica-
tion, and track maintenance equipment.
5.        FA has been carrying out the present limited program of track
renewals and improvement using local contractors with manual labor. To
achieve the standards of quality, speed and economy required with the
enlarged program, the most important works should be carried out by larger,
more experienced enterprises equipped with high output mechanical tools.
At present such firms are virtually non-existent in Argentina and FA pro-
poses to call upon international companies, to be associated with local
firms, to carry out projects of adequate size, FA supplying the track ma-
terial except ballast.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
6.        Much of the supply equipment and cables on the existing Buenos
Aires electrified urban services are over 40 years old and unsafe by modern
standards; a program of replacing such material is to be carried out. In
addition, remaining low level platforms on some of the services are to be
raised to improve the efficiency of passenger transfers.
Signalling and Telecommunications (3% of total expenditure)
7.        Existing signalling equipment is mostly old but adequate.  Some
improvement is needed to complete new works in progress, increase capacity
on heavily utilized sections (mainly in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area),
improve safety and reduce personnel. Common policies and standardization
of equipment on all the railways are required; FA's consultants SOFRERAIL
are making studies, and the recommendations are to be available and decisions
be reached before any items of signalling go forward.
8.        FA has been carrying out for several years a program of replacing
manned level crossing gates by automatic barriers. Both because of the
expansion of highway traffic and the reduction of personnel, this program
should be! continued systematically.
9.        Common policies and standardization are also to be adopted for
telecommunication equipment: to replace obsolescent installations, extend
the internal telephone and teleprinter services, install radio links, and
feed data to the computer. All these with, additionally, the improvement
of train, locomotive and car control, are required to achieve benefits in
improved services and better utilization of equipment.
Structures (8% of total expenditure)
10.       Many speed limits are imposed on trains because of bridges in poor
condition or of inadequate strength. A program of repair and strengthening
co-ordinated with the track renewal and improvement program is to be carried
out.
11.       To improve services, obtain personnel savings and meet traffic
increases, station yards being retained after replanning of operations must
be improved with increased handling facilities. Associated buildings
require renovation and modernization while there is a need for improved
staff premises, staff quarters, and additional vocational training centers.
12.       The Government is constructing the bridges and connecting roads
and railways, across the Parana River delta between Zarate and Brazo Largo,
to provide direct road and rail access between the Mesopotamia region and
Buenos Aires. The cost of the structures is to be met by the Government but
FA is to construct the railway approaches (on .he Urquiza railway) at its
cost.



ANNEX 5
Page,3
Locomotive and Car Maintenance (11% oE total expenditure)
13.       Spare parts and components are required urgently to rehabilitate
diesel locomotives out of service; FA started ordering in 1970, with further
spares to be obtained in 1971-72. In parallel there is an urgent need for
FA to establish central control of the workload and production of all work-
shops to ensure that the rehabilitation program can be carried out (Annex 3).
Next the workshops are to be reorganized and reduced so that production lines
are concentrated in fewer shops; the buildings, machinery and equipment
available are mostly adequate but some additional modern equipment, such as
diesel motor test benches, precision pit wheel lathes, and efficient handling
units, will be needed.
14.       Some of the more recent pas,senger and freight cars should be
modernized with improved bogies, roller bearings, center couplings, and
air brakes, to be able to operate in heavier trains at higher speeds, with
greater safety and economies in mainl:enance.
New Locomotives and Cars (41% of total expenditure)
15.       On the broad gauge the rehabilitation of diesel locomotives and
improved availability plus the provision of rail tractors (see below)
should provide enough locomotives to cover the elimination of steam
traction and carry present traffic. To accommodate the freight traffic
increase forecast, an additional 40 units will be required (Annex 4) but
FA proposes to purchase the 40 new locomotives in 1971 and so have them
available to relieve part of the pressure on the workshops and speed the
replacement of steam traction in the meantime. This is reasonable. To
complete the elimination of steam traction on the meter and standard gauges
and to deal with the traffic forecast, 150 diesel units will be needed on
the former and 40 units on the latter (Annex 4). FA proposes to spread
deliveries on the meter gauge over 1971-75 but on the standard (Urquiza)
railway the 40 are to be obtained irk 1972-74, providing the transport studies
of the Mesopotamia region (para. 2.14) confirm that the purchase is justified;
a decision should be possible in 19,'1. The new locomotives will include units
of 2500 hp as compared with the existing maximum of 1800 hp to enable heavier
trains and higher average speeds to be achieved.
16.       Diesel rail tractors, 200 over 1971-74, are to be obtained to
replace steam and heavy diesel locomotives for light shunting operations
in stations, private sidings, yards, etc. These units will be cheaper to
operate than the existing shunting Locomotives.
17.       On the standard gauge, Urquiza, urban service in Buenos Aires,
75 fifty-year old electric railcars are in use; these need replacement
for safety and to reduce operational and maintenance costs. The existing
all-motorized units can be replaced by 25 motor units and 50 trailers to
make up three car sets with satisfactory performance.
18.       FA's aim is to eliminate almost all old wooden-bodied passenger
cars by 1975 to improve safety and to reduce maintenance costs. FA placed



ANNEX 5
Page 4
a contract in December 1968 with Fiat Concord of Argentina for 661 new cars
of which 108 had been delivered by end 1970 leaving a balance of 453.
Allowance is made in the plan for continuance of deliveries from this con-
tract. This will still leave about 40 wooden bodied restaurant cars in use
and in view of the fire risk involved, an additional provision is made in
the plan to replace 20 restaurant cars.
19.       On the broad gauge Mitre and Sarmiento urban services in Buenos
Aires, the! existing fleet consists of 420 modern electric cars and 250
old cars. Improved utilization of the modern cars, together with the
provision of 50 trailer cars, will enable all the old cars to be withdrawn;
better, more comfortable service will be provided with savings in operating
and maintenance costs.
20.       About 40,000 freight cars only (out of the nominal total of 71,000)
are in reasonable condition and of these, only some 12,000 are less than 30
years old; most cars are not suited to modern operation in heavy, fast trains
or for easy handling of bulk commodities with which FA will be principally
concerned in the future. The modernization of the freight car fleet is
essential for FA to offer satisfactory service and the future number (based
on 1975 forecast traffic) should be under 60,000 (Annex 4). For the present
it is proposed that 2,000 more cars per year be obtained; these are to be
mostly hopper cars for bulk grain, convertible box and grain cars, flat cars
for containers, open high sided cars for minerals, tank cars for cement,
road vehicle carrying cars, and box cars with fully opening side doors for
fork lift operations. In addition FA needs 400 open hopper cars for the
transport of stone ballast for track works; these cars will also be usable
for public stone and mineral traffics.
Miscellaneous (1% of total expenditure)
21.       Ihe item is to cover miscellaneous office, teletype, ferry-boat and
testing equipment throughout the various services.
22.       The Project will consist of the first two years 1971-72 of the
Plan in Table 10. The items that would be suitable for financing under the
proposed loan are shown in paragraph 4.03.
23.       The track works will consist of 950 km of renewal and 1,200 km of
improvements. FA already has ordered enough rail, from the State steel
concern SOMISA and from overseas, to cover all but 12,000 tons of the total
of 92,000 tons required for 1971-72. These 12,000 tons plus rail fastenings
will be obtained on international bidding and have been included in the
proposed loan amount. Timber sleepers will be obtained, as at present, on
local contracts, while the supply of stone ballast and the execution of
works will be dealt with partly on local contracts. FA proposes to call
for international bids for major contracts (para. 5) covering about 400
km of renewal work on the Roca, San Martin and Mitre railways. The estimated
total value of this work is about $a 28 million or US$7 million equivalent;
the foreign exchange content, covering foreign expert staff, tools, stores,



ANNEX 5
Page 5
and use of imported equipment, is estimated at about 50% or US$3.5 million
and this has-been included in the t:rack item. The minimum value of any
contract for Bank participation should be US$500,000.
24.       The spares, components anid workshop equipment required for the
program of diesel locomotive and car rehabilitation have also been allowed
for.
25.       In the two years 1971-72, 4,000 general and 400 stone ballast cars,
or a total of 4,400, are to be provided.
(a) The bogies are to be obtained by international bidding.
The estimated cost is:
2x4,400 bogies + 200 as imaintenance spares, or 9,000 total,
at US$2,500 each - 22.5 million.
(b) The bodies (that is cars less bogies) are to be obtained in
two groups, the first on international bidding, the second
reserved for local bidding (Annex 6).
(c) The bodies are estimated to cost an average of US$8,000 each
if supplied by a foreign bidder. The local preference on
international bidding, with the first group of cars, is 15%,
giving an average total per car of US$9,200. On local bid-
ding for the second group of cars, the maximum price is to
be 25% above that of imported components, plus other charges
and local erection added thereafter, or a total of about
US$10,000 per car. If nLo local bidder agrees to supply
below this ceiling (Annex 6), the contract would be offered
to the successful bidder in the international bidding.
(d)  There are then the following alternatives, on the basis of
the Bank's assessment that the foreign exchange is approxi-
mately 90% of price for foreign supplied, and 60% for locally
supplied, bodies.

Freight C r Procurement
With respect to all contracts for freight car bodies to be pro-
cured under the Project, bids will be invited and opened simultaneously
for two groups of similar cars of approximately equal numbers.
(a) For the first group, bids will be invited on an international
basis. In evaluating the bids, the Borrower will compare local bids for
components plus erection with foreign bids for components plus erection,
where the cost of the components in foreign bids will be the sum of (i)
the cif Buenos Aires price for such components; (ii) the amount of any
taxes which would be payable on the importation of such components into
the territories of the Guarantor by non-exempt importers, or 15% of the
amount specified in (i) above, whichever shall be the lower; and (iii) the
costs of services such as consular fees, port fees, and statistical charges
to be incurred on such importation.
(b) For the second group, bids will be invited only from local bid-
ders. Contracts may be awarded tco the lowest qualified bidder, provided
that his bid does not exceed the following amount, hereinafter called the
"ceiling price": 125% of the ex-iactory price of components plus erection
costs of the lowest qualified biddler (qualified according to the tender
documents) in the first group if siuch bid is a local bid, or, if such bid
is a foreign bid, the sum of the iEollowing: (i) the cif Buenos Aires
price for the components; (ii) 25% of the amount specified in (i) above;
(iii) the cost of services such ai; consular fees, port fees, and statisti-
cal charges to be incurred in the importation of such components; and (iv)
the cost of erection of the freight car bodies. If no contract may be
awarded, the Borrower shall invite bidders in the second group to reduce
their price to or below the "ceiling price". Expenditures for goods pro-
cured under this paragraph shall not be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan.
(c) If no bidder for the second group agrees to reduce his price to
or below the "ceiling price", the bidder who has been awarded the contract
for the first group will be offered the contract for the second group at a
price not to exceed that stipulated in his bid for the first group. Expend-
itures for goods procured under this paragraph shall be eligible for finan-
cing out of the proceeds of the loan.
(d) Tf the contract cannot be awarded according to (c) preceding, the
Bank and the Borrower will agree on a procurement procedure and on the eli-
gibility of the goods procured tc be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan.

Economic Benefits and Methodology
Nature of the Investment
As a result of the many years of inadequate maintenance and re-
placement of rolling stock, track, amd other facilities, the physical plant
of FA has reached a serious state oF deterioration that limits the ability
of the railways to attract and carrl traffic in the coming years. Detailed
descriptions of existing conditions are in Section 3. In coordination with
improved operating and management practices, FA now proposes to undertake
a major program of renewal of physical assets which is necessary to improve
the services offered and to retain and increase the traffic carried. If
renewal of the physical assets does not take place, large decreases in
freight and passenger traffic are anticipated, as a result of declining
quality of service and diminishing capability to twve traffic offered.
The first five years of the renewal program have been planned
in detail (Annex 5). However, it is apparent that during the life of
assets acquired in the first five years additional investment will be re-
quired to continue the capability of the railways to attract and handle
the forecast traffic. Such additional investments have been estimated
and included in the analysis, which is extended to the year 2000. No
allowance has been made for salvage value of the physical assets at the
end of the period of analysis, although it would obviously be substantial.
Owing to the general and extensive deterioration of physical
plant now existing it is not possible to attribute specific portions of
the forecast traffic to individual components of the renewal program,
such as track, locomotives, and cars. The combined effects of all com-
ponents are needed to achieve the forecast results, and the program is
therefore most suitably considered as a single investment package.
The total investment proposed for the years 1971-75 is the
equivalent of $a 3,356 million (US$839 million) at 1970 prices. The
additional new investment and replacement expenditures required in the
1976-2000 period are estimated as the equivalent of $a 7,460 million
(US$1,865 million) at 1970 prices.
Alternative Programs
The investment plan for 1971-75 was designed by FA and its
technical consultants SOFRERAIL and economic consultants FIEL, and has been
reviewed by the Bank staff. The plan is considered to contain only elements
essential for the restoration and long-term viability of the railways for
the forecast traffic levels. Alternative plans with different total in-
vestments have not been developed by FA and its consultants, nor was it



ANNEX 7
Page 2
possible for the appraisal mission to develop such alternatives and to es-
timate the traffic that could reasonably be expected to be associated with
each.
It is unnecessary to consider larger programs because the one now
proposed is believed to be as large as FA can manage with reasonable effi-
ciency in the 1971-75 period. However, the logical question remains whether
the proposed program could be, fronm an economic point of view, too large.
To deal with this question in the absence of detailed alternative
smaller programs, an analysis was made to check the feasibility of an in-
vestment of one-half the amount now proposed, plus replacement expenditure.
It was found that even if this first half of the investment produced two-
thirds of the total benefits expected for the total plan, the second half
would still be justified.
Economic Benefits
The economic justification of the proposed program comes mainly
from avoiding a shift to highway carriers of the traffic that would not be
carried by the railways in the absence of the renewal program. For purposes
of this analysis, it is assumed that all such traffic would shift to highways
because competitive relations with water, air, and pipeline transport would
not be significantly affected by the program. No allowance has been made
for traffic that might cease to move if suitable rail service is not avail-
able. The costs of moving traffic diverted to highways has been estimated
in terms of annual investments and operating costs for the trucks needed
to handle the volume of freight traffic and in terms of passenger-kilometer
costs for buses. These costs include highway maintenance but no allowance
for any additional highway construction that might be occasioned by the
diverted traffic. Private passenger cars have not been considered as an al-
ternative. Some additional economic benefit is provided by labor savings
made possible by the program but is estimated to be less than 3% of total
benefits.
Internal Economic Return (IER)
Thle estimates of economic benefits and costs used in the calcula-
tion of IER are shown in detail in Tables A and B. For each variable there
is a value representing the mission's best estimate of most probable future
conditions. Owing to uncertainties inherent in some of the estimates it
was considered desirable to include also for the most critical variables
values representing conditions that would produce a lower IER ("pessimistic"
estimates) and values that would produce a higher IER ("optimistic" estimates).
Some intermediate values were also used in test computations of IER.  From
calculations of IER using different combinations of the estimates of the
variables, the values of IER were found to correspond approximately to a
normal probability distribution. It was then assumed that the distribution
is normal and that the value of IER obtained by using all pessimistic esti-
mates is three standard deviations below the mean value, while that obtained



ANNEX 7
Page 3
by using all optimistic estimates is three standard deviations above the
mean value. The mean value of IER was then calculated as follows:
IER = Pessimistic IER + optimistic IER + 4 (best estimate IER)
6
The best estimate IER was found to be slightly higher than the estimated
mean value. The best estimate was then recalculated using a six-month
slippage for the benefits to be obtained from the plan, as explained in
Table A, Note 8. In this second rin, the adjusted best estimate IER coin-
cided with the estimated mean IER at 20.5%. Allowing for variations of
+ 2 standard deviations from this value, the probability is 95% that the
actual IER lies between 14.5% and 26.5% (rounded values), which indicates
that the railway investment program is economically justified.  The lowest
value of IER, 14.5%, would be obtained even in the unlikely event of stag-
nant freight traffic for all the life of the investment (Table B, Section
2.2).
Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis was then applied to the variables in the
computation of IER. Variations of- + 10% and + 25% of the values of the
variables and subsequent IER variations were computed for the three main
sets of hypotheses. The sensitivities reflected in Table A are averaged
values of the plus or minus perceiatage variation of IER when the correspond-
ing value of the variable is changed plus or minus 1%. The best estimates
of bus operating costs increase or decrease at the same time and in iden-
tical proportions as they are shown in Table A with a joint sensitivity.
The most sensitive factors in the computation of IER are investment costs,
traffic, road transport operating costs and, to a lesser extent, railway
operating and labor costs.
First Bank Railway Project
The loan now being conE idered would finance key elements of the
first two years of the 1971-75 investment program.
It is not possible in i:his program of large-scale renewal of
physical assets to attribute spec:ific traffic results to individual pro-
gram components. Therefore, it Ls not possible to make a separate deter-
mination of the economic rate of return of the specific investments covered
by the loan. However, since the total investment program has been found
feasible as a whole and as two separate increments of cost, a separate
evaluation of the loan components is not necessary.
The time sequence of elements of the total program has been deter-
mined on the basis of engineering and operating judgments concerning the
most efficient manner of accomplishing the total program. The immediate
impact of spare parts on increasing the availability of diesel locomotives
now idle is obvious. This availability makes possible the retirement of



ANNEX 7
Page 4
obsolete steam locomotives with higher operating costs. The acquisition of
new freight cars is important in improving the ability of the railways to
hold and attract traffic and to move it efficiently; the total need for
car replacements is very large, and an immediate start at a rate geared to
the railways' ability to assimilate new cars into the fleet is warranted.
Similarly, the total backlog of track renewal and improvement is large,
and an immediate start is needed to avoid serious, traffic-impairing
deficiencies in the future.  The items being considered for the proposed
loan are, therefore, of high priority for immediate procurement.
