MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR
FOR A BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of El Salvador for US$34.0 million to help finance a Basic
Education Modernization Project. The single currency US dollar loan would be at the IBRD's
standard variable rate for single currency loans, with a maturity of 17 years, including five years of
grace. The total project cost is estimated at US$80.2 million. The project would also be assisted
by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) through parallel financing in the amount of
US$37.3 million. The Ministry of Education (MINED) of El Salvador would be the implementing
agency for the project and would receive support from the Ministry of Coordination of Economic
and Social Development (Ministerio de Coordinaci6n de Desarrollo Econ6mico y Social -
MICDES).
2.    Background.  A deterioration of public services in El Salvador, resulting from the
combination of economic crisis, a devastating earthquake, and internal warfare in the countryside,
has started to be reversed. Public spending on social programs, which fell from 44 percent to 24
percent in the 1980s, increased to 31 percent in 1992. Spending on education, which declined
about 40 percent in real terms during the 1980s, has slightly increased in the last two years.
Education spending as a fraction of executed government spending has ranged from about 11 to
14 percent between 1989 and 1993, but remains far below the corresponding figure of 24 percent
in 1980. Over 90 percent of education spending is allocated to recurrent expenditures and there
has been neither maintenance nor new investment in schools for more than a decade, except for
facilities built with outside assistance. External aid constitutes over 40 percent of the annual
national budget for the education sector.
3.    Even though education indicators did not deteriorate during the last decade -- probably
due to increased foreign assistance, and provision of services by the private sector and
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) -- they remain among the worst in Latin America. Major
additional investments will be needed to maintain and improve the indicators of sector
performance beyond current levels. Coverage of education services is inadequate, particularly in
rural areas; in remote areas services frequently do not exist. In 1993, 77 percent of urban children
between the ages of 7 and 15 were enrolled in basic education (grades 1-9). In rural areas, only
56 percent of the same age group were enrolled. Over 66 percent of the primary schools offer
less than six grades (82 percent in rural areas) and 29 percent of the schools offer less than three
grades. The quality of education is low and is reflected in high levels of repetition and dropout.
Only about 47 percent of the students who enter 1st grade ever complete the 6th grade, and, on
average, 19 years of instruction are required to produce a graduate from 9th grade. Over 50
percent of children repeat first grade. Dropout rates in 1992 were 17.3 percent for 1st grade, 8.5
percent for 2nd grade, and 8.9 percent for 3rd grade. Sixty-seven percent of rural students and 53
percent of urban students in basic education (grades 1-9) are over the age expected for the grade
in which they are enrolled. The average school attainment of those who ever attended school is
only 4.5 years (3.1 years in rural areas). Institutionally, MINfED lacks the capacity to guide basic
education effectively. Problems center on: complex financial procedures and mechanisms;



2
inadequate/insufficient planning, information, monitoring and auditing systems; lack of incentives
for providing supervision in remote areas; a fragmented structure; and overly centralized
administration.
4.    Government Strategy. The 1995-1999 Economic and Social Development Plan states
the Government commitment to create an education system that can be an effective tool for
promoting the economic and social development of the country. The Government Social Sector
Strategy is based on three findamental elements which are framed within the process of
institutional modernization and development: (a) the focusing of human, financial and material
resources on basic education; (b) the decentralization of services and the participation of the
communities; and (c) the privatization of those services which are more efficiently provided by the
private sector. Based on these principles, the Government Social Sector Strategy for education
has as its major objectives to: (a) implement compensatory programs to protect the poor and most
vulnerable groups during structural adjustment; (b) improve coverage and quality of preschool
and basic education targeted to the poorest areas of the country; (c) modernize and decentralize
administration and management of social sector ministries as part of the Government-wide Public
Sector Modernization Program, including promotion of community and private sector
participation; and (d) provide targeted nutrition assistance.
5.    The Government has implemented its strategy through a combination of short-term and
long-term programs. The short-term programs have included the Social Investment Fund (Fondo
de Inversi6n Social - FIS) which, since 1991, has financed 1,492 small scale social and
infrastructure rehabilitation projects for a total cost of about US$24.6 million, primarily with IDB
support to help alleviate social costs of macroeconomic adjustment.  The IBRD-supported
Earthquake Reconstruction Loan 2873-ES also financed the rehabilitation of 2,000 primary
schools.
6.    MINED has designed several long-term projects to improve the delivery of services and
the quality of education. With the support of USAID, the Basic Education Achievement
Strengthening Project (Solidificaci6n del Alcance de la Educaci6n Basica - SABE) was begun in
1990. Under this project, curricula in basic education up to the sixth grade was redesigned. To
support the new basic education study programs, textbooks and workbooks were prepared, and
an initial supply of 1.5 million books was distributed to students in grades 1 through 3. Training
programs for teachers, school directors, and supervisors were intensified in the areas of teaching
methods as well as in educational evaluation and administration.
7.    MINED also launched the Community-managed Schools Program  (Educaci6n con
Particzpaci6n de la Comunidad - EDUCO), an innovative program based on direct involvement
of parents and community education associations (Asociaciones Comunales para la Educaci6n -
ACEs) in defining and administering education services. Since 1991, the EDUCO program has
been supported by the Bank under the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project (SSRP, Loan 3348-
ES). EDUCO schools are operated by an ACE drawn from the parents of the children served by
the school. The ACEs hire teachers and closely monitor teacher performance, ensuring regular
attendance and direct feed-back to parents on children's progress. The ACEs have a substantial
measure of budgetary responsibility for the school through the direct transfer of MINED funds to
an ACE bank account from which teachers are paid according to a contract of employment
between the teachers and the ACE. The ACE also contributes to maintenance and equipment of



3
the schools. The ACE may raise additional financial resources to complement the Ministry's
funds and has a major role in mobilizing parents and community members to provide voluntary
service in support of the school.
8.    The Bank assessment of program implementation, as reported in the sector study 'El
Salvador Community Education Strategy: Decentralized School Management," Report No.
13502-ES, December 8, 1994, concluded that this program has proven to be effective overall. It
helped expand preschool enrollment from 2 percent of the rural preschool population to 10
percent between 1989 and 1993. The enrollment of children in the first three grades of basic
education increased by 6.4 percent between 1989 and 1993. Despite the lower average socio-
economic status of EDUCO students compared with students in traditional schools, EDUCO
students performed on a level comparable with students in traditional schools (rural and urban),
and in some cases better. While the overall cost of the EDUCO program appears to be slightly
higher than the cost of the traditional program overall, the benefits of the program seem to more
than offset the higher cost involved. These benefits include providing of basic education in areas
which did not previously receive education, community involvement in providing basic education
services, and better control over teacher attendance and performance. EDUCO has also
contributed to improved dialogue between communities and MINED, and between MINED and
the international agencies and NGOs that support program implementation.
9.   Based on the promising results of EDUCO, the Government intends to follow-up the
successful implementation of SSRP with additional IBRD/IDB support. At the request of the
Government, the planned SSRP II was divided into two separate projects, one for education and
one for health. The proposed operation responds to the request for an education project, and a
health sector reform project is under preparation.
10.   Project Objectives. The objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) improve access to,
and the quality of, the education system with emphasis on preschool and basic education; (b)
strengthen MINED's capacity to set policies and guidelines for the sector; and (c) improve the
public education system's capability to deliver education services effectively and efficiently.
11.   Project Description.  The proposed project has been organized into three major
components:
(a)   Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education (US$12.5 million
including contingencies or 16 percent of total project costs) would include measures to
improve access to preschool and basic education in 135 target municipios to
approximately 32,000 preschool children and 64,000 children in grades 1 to 6, through: (i)
supporting the expansion of EDUCO to regions which currently do not have preschool or
basic education services, including rehabilitating school infrastructure and providing
school furniture in rural schools not supported by the FIS; and (ii) technical assistance for
strengthening the EDUCO model, including training programs to approximately 13,000
ACE members and 23,000 parents.
(b)   Improvement in Education Quality (US$49.2 million including contingencies or
61 percent of total costs) would strengthen the quality of preschool and basic education in
the country as a whole and include: (i) technical assistance for supporting curriculum



4
development activities for preschool and basic education, designing a new student
promotion system, and establishing multigrade classes in schools in rural areas; (ii)
educational materials, including approximately 3,500,000 textbooks, didactic materials,
and books for approximately 3,000 classrooms and school libraries; (iii) training and
assistance to upgrade the skills of approximately 2,300 preschool teachers, approximately
24,000 basic education teachers, 6,500 principals and 250 supervisors, and preparing
studies to improve pre-service teacher training; and (iv) developing an education
assessment system. The component would also develop a school health and nutrition
program, targeted to the 135 municipios with the lowest levels of social services, which:
(i) incorporates nutrition and health education into the formal curriculum; (ii) provides
vitamin A, iodine supplements and de-worming treatments through the schools; (iii)
identifies vision and hearing impaired children; and (iv) develops alternative school feeding
program mechanisms.
(c)   Institutional Modernization and Strengthening (US$13.3 million including
contingencies or 17 percent of total costs) to provide for: (i) technical assistance for a
review of MINED's legal and organizational framework to increase system efficiency, to
increase the coverage and improve the quality of education services, to implement
institutional reforms in the areas of management of human and financial resources,
planning, information, evaluation, monitoring, supervision and communication systems,
and to establish a staff development program to improve the capacity of administrators
and technical personnel; and (ii) establishing a funding mechanism, the Pilot Basic
Education Fund Program, to test alternative methods of providing basic education through
the municipios, NGOs or other non-profit private institutions, and to experiment with
pedagogical and administrative innovations. This component will have an effect that will
extend throughout the education sector and the country.
Project administration will total approximately US$4.8 million or 6 percent of total project costs.
12.   Project Implementation. The project would be implemented over a five year period
(1996-2000). MINED will be the principal implementing agency, but FIS, the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), selected NGOs and local communities will also have major
implementation roles. FIS will carry out classroom construction and school rehabilitation under
norms provided by MINED, and UNDP will act as the procurement agent for the project. Project
implementation will be carried out within the existing organizational structure of MINED through
units whose operational and administrative responsibilities are directly linked to project
components and coordinated by a Project Manager. Overall responsibility for implementation of
the proposed project would be vested in the Minister of Education who would be supported in
general policy setting and institutional coordination by a committee composed of the Vice
Minister of Education, Project Manager, and Project Component Directors (MINED directors
involved in implementing project activities). The Project Manager would report directly to the
Vice Minister of Education on the day-to-day operations of the project. Within the Project
Management Office there would be four units to assist, coordinate, monitor, and evaluate project
activities, each under the direction of a Project Component Director: (a) the Quality Improvement
Unit which would be responsible for the implementation of the quality improvement component;
(b) the EDUCO Unit which would be responsible for the expansion of the model in rural areas,
and reorganization and strengthening of service delivery; (c) the Management Modernization Unit



5
which would be responsible for implementing the Institutional Modernization and Strengthening
Component; and (d) the Office of International Programs (OPCI) which would be responsible for
management of the procurement and financial aspects of the project. Implementation of the
institutional reforms would be phased, in order to allow for adjustments to the Ministry's
framework, preparation of operations manuals, staff training, and installation of improved
information systems. Based on its previous experience of implementing international projects,
MICDES will also assist MINED during project implementation and would guarantee the
coordination of the institutional reforms in MINED with the Government's Public Sector
Modernization Reform Program. Schedule A shows a breakdown of estimated costs and
financing. Schedule B shows the amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule.
13.   Project Sustainability. The project's focus on reforms, institutional modernization, and
strengthening of the education sector, aimed at improving the quality and efficiency in the
provision of those services, should contribute to the project's sustainability. The financial impact
of incremental recurrent project costs and of the increased number of students due to efficiency
gains and population growth, will require annual increases in the budget of between US$4 and
US$5 million. Under a very conservative assumption, repetition rates will be reduced by 25
percent (one year each for the 1st and 2nd cycles). The reduction in repetition rates can yield
savings of up to 38 percent of the education cost per graduate in grades 1 through 6, and 21
percent in grades 7 through 9, the equivalent of saving US$5 million per year. Those savings
would be an additional source of funding for the expansion of education services. In addition
administrative decentralization would sustain project benefits. Greater community involvement in
school management (EDUCO model) would increase local pressure for the allocation of adequate
resources to the education system and the efficiency of educational expenditures. Furthermore,
new resources may be opened for financing education, such as mobilization of other local
resources. Cost savings are likely to occur through efficiencies introduced by the decentralization
and rationalization of resources allocated to MINED.
14.   Lessons From Previous Bank Involvement. Implementation experience and the impact
of the education component of the SSRP were reviewed in 1994, and lessons learned from the
project have been incorporated in the sector report (see para. 8). Among other lessons, three
should be highlighted. First, the EDUCO model, with its strong community participation, offers
education services at a reasonable cost to some of the lowest income groups in rural areas, and
provides efficient management of those services (see paras. 7 and 8). Second, although the
M:ICDES Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) had an important role in implementing the SSRP
project and acquired project implementation expertise, this expertise was not fully transferred to
the executing agencies such as MINED.  To guarantee efficient project implementation,
managerial capacity must be reinforced, not only at the project management level, but also within
the executing agencies involved in the project. Thus, project management for the proposed
project has been established as an integral part of MINED, with staff drawn from the operational
units that prepared the project. In addition, a staff development program to improve the skills of
administrators and technical and pedagogical personnel as required by the institutional
development process, will be implemented. Third, the education loans in the 1970s experienced
significant implementation delays arising from shortage of counterpart funds. The SSRP took this
into account in its design. Annual implementation targets were included in the Government's
budget proposal presented to the Assembly to avoid shortages of counterpart funds, and



6
consequently funds were made available at the onset. Also, building upon lessons from the SSRP,
a Revolving Fund, operated by OPCI, would be opened.
15.   The EDUCO program has also provided valuable experience that has been incorporated
into the project including: (a) the effectiveness of incentives to improve teacher performance; (b)
the positive impact of classroom libraries in complementing teaching strategies and in stimulating
student interest and reading habits; and (c) the importance of having learning materials that
complement textbooks to stimulate more active learning in school.
16.   Feedback from other education projects in Latin America indicates that a proper policy
framework and adequate institutional capacity are major factors in determining the success of
project implementation. The proposed project focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of
basic education on the basis of: (a) a clearly stated government policy framework; and (b)
improvement of the institutional capacity of MINED at the central and departmental levels. Other
specific lessons learned from basic education projects in Latin America which have been
incorporated in the design of the proposed project include: (a) increasing education expenditures,
especially those targeted to the poorest regions; (b) promoting adequate nutrition and health
practices; (c) developing an integrated, inter-disciplinary curriculum that can be adapted to the
needs of the urban and rural sectors; and (d) the need to keep the public informed and involved in
the changes being contemplated by the Ministry.
17.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed Basic Education Modernization Project
is consistent with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Board on
September 14, 1993 with the Second Structural Adjustment Loan Project (Loan 3646-ES), which
focuses on supporting the Government in meeting its critical development challenges and
facilitating the transition from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy. The Bank Group's
strategy is to support the Government in meeting its four principal development challenges -
modernizing the public sector, enabling private sector-led growth, reducing poverty and investing
in human capital, and strengthening natural resource and environmental management - through a
blend of adjustment lending, investment lending in selected sectors, analytical work to address
sectoral issues and guide the policy dialogue, technical assistance to deepen reforms and
strengthen institutions, and donor coordination. The successful progress of the SSRP has assured
the Government's interest in the IBRD's involvement in following up with a second operation.
By supporting the proposed Basic Education Modernization Project, IBRD assistance would play
an important role in: (a) increasing investments in basic education, thus helping to accumulate
human capital, the lack of which is a serious constraint to growth; (b) addressing the needs of the
poor, and contributing to a more equitable distribution of basic social services, thereby alleviating
poverty; and (c) improving the efficiency of using the scarce public sector resources through
measures to strengthen MINED's institutional capacity. The project will provide the IBRD and
IDB joint assistance to support the Government in furthering reforms in the social sector. In
parallel with health sector reform, the EBRD's participation in this operation together with IDB
would help make the public sector reform more successful.
18.   Agreed Actions. At negotiations, agreement was reached: (a) on the schedule and terms
of reference for the modernization of MINED; (b) that the required funds for incremental teacher
salaries as established in the annual work plans review would be included in the MINED budget
for the following year; (c) on the IBRD Special Account and on retroactive financing; (d) on



7
appointment of key project technical and administrative staff and/or consultants and their terms of
reference; (e) that MINED would: (i) conduct, jointly with MICDES, IBRD and IDB, annual
project implementation reviews; and (ii) submit to the Banks annual progress reports on the
implementation of the project in accordance with targets established in previous annual work and
investment plans; (f) that: (i) the in-depth mid-term review would cover all aspects of project
implementation and be conducted jointly by MINED, MICDES and the Banks, and (ii) on the
basis of this review, action plans, satisfactory to the Banks, would be prepared and initiated by
January 1, 1999; and (g) on the Development Objectives for the project.
19.   As a dated covenant, the borrower will select a local university/research center to develop
the education assessment system no later than January 30, 1996.
20.   Conditions of Effectiveness.  As conditions for loan effectiveness: (a) the plan to
strengthen OPCI will be completed to the satisfaction of both Banks; (b) the Government will
present evidence that the Revolving Fund had been created; (c) the Operational Manual for the
project will be adopted; and (d) a signed contract with UNDP for procurement services under the
project would be presented.
21.   Conditions of Disbursement. As a condition for disbursement for the Institutional
Modernization and Strengthening component, MINED will present the work plan for the staff
development activities.
22.   Environmental Aspects.  The project would contribute to enhance environmental
conservation practices through the introduction of environmental themes in the basic education
curricula and teacher training focused on environmental issues, and would be classified as C.
23.   Program  Objective and Poverty Category.  The proposed project belongs to the
program objective of poverty reduction and is a program of targeted poverty interventions. The
project would be an integral part of El Salvador's antipoverty strategy to improve coverage and
quality of basic education services for the poorest groups in the country. It will target poor
children in rural and urban marginal areas through a ranking system based on prevalence of
malnutrition, repetition rates for first grade, net enrollment rates for first grade, and percentage of
overage students.
24.   Participatory Approach. Representatives of parents and teachers, as well as local
authorities and the teacher unions, have been actively involved in discussing the main features of
project design with MINED. A Social Assessment was performed, with assistance from the
Environment Unit of the Latin American and the Caribbean Region Technical Department, to
gather input from the stakeholders on their understanding of the process, to determine their needs,
and to develop mechanisms to continue the process of including them in the decisions made in the
sector. The National Commission for Education, Science, and Development (Comisi6n Nacional
de Educaci6n, Ciencia y Desarrollo), composed of members of NGOs and other private
organizations, universities, and teacher unions, will provide support to the Government in
reforming the education sector.  Parents, teachers, local authorities, and private sector
organizations will participate in project implementation, especially in the expansion of the
EDUCO schools.

25.   Project Benefits. The project would reinforce the efforts of the Government of El
Salvador to achieve a better quality of education and greater efficiency of the school system.
Institutional strengthening will contribute to the provision of services in a more cost-effective
manner through better allocation of resources, increased staff productivity, and enhanced
capability to carry out, evaluate and monitor education policies and programs. It would provide
improved preschool and basic education services throughout the country and expand services to
remote rural areas where services do not currently exist. The project would continue efforts to
target resources to the poor and vulnerable groups, and at the same time improve the efficiency of
resource use and the institutional capacity of MINED. It will improve the equitable and efficient
use of expenditures. The project is designed to produce significant reductions in repetition and
dropout rates through better qualified teachers, improved availability of instructional materials, an
updated curriculum, a more effective learning environment and direct involvement of parents,
teachers and the community in the management of schools. Decentralization will make teachers
and administrators more responsive to the concerns of the parents and the community since all
will be sharing administrative responsibilities. Institutional strengthening would contribute to a
better allocation and increased productivity of resources within MINED, and to an enhanced
capacity to evaluate and monitor education policies and programs. Altogether, approximately
1,200,000 basic education school children, 25,000 parents, 26,300 preschool and basic education
teachers, school directors and supervisors, and MINED managers would benefit during the
project implementation period.
26.   Financial Benefits.  The Govermment has selected a variable rate US dollar single
currency loan to improve its overall liability management and reduce its risks. It considers US
dollars to be an appropriate currency for its debt management strategy, and prefers the standard
country repayment terms for LIBOR-based single currency loans compared to the shorter final
maturity for fixed rate single currency loans.
27.   Economic Analysis.  The socio-economic viability and efficiency of the program is
supported on the basis of the high average return of basic education in El Salvador, and the solid
results obtained in an exercise to estimate the marginal retums of the program (20 percent).
These results are based on the expected private returns to students completing additional years of
education and also the fiscal savings resulting from higher intemal efficiency. The result is very
conservative because it overlooks the extemalities of the project and the positive effect of a more
efficient and responsive MINED.
28.   The most recent estimates in El Salvador place the average private rate of return to
primary education at 18.9 percent, to secondary education at 14.5 percent and to university
education at 9.5 percent. Although it cannot be assumed that these rates are the same as the
marginal rates of return from investments by project activities, high average rates of return
provide a good indicator that overall retums to investments in primary education will be high.
Under the assumption that the marginal return will be half of the average private return (9.5
percent), retums are still considerably higher than the current average lending rate (7.4 percent).
29.   The real marginal economic rate of return of the medium term plan for education has been
estimated as 19.7 percent. This underestimates the true rate because: (a) private and economic
retums for education are increasing as a consequence of an increasingly competitive economy; (b)
gaps in the rates of return between levels of education are widening as a consequence of the



9
demand for a better educated labor force by the productive sector; (c) the assumptions about
expanded years of education are very conservative; and (d) no external positive effects were
included.
30.   Reduction of repetition rates can yield savings up to 23 percent of the education costs per
graduate in grades 1 to 9. Annual expenditures per student in basic education are US$149. With
a basic enrollment of 1.06 million in 1994, the cost of repetition may be as high as US$37 million
per year. This cost will be considerably reduced by the actions to improve quality and to reduce
repetition and dropout rates proposed by the project.
31.   Project Risks. The project involves limited institutional, financial and political risks. Due
to the comprehensive scope of the operation, the main risk of the program will be the limited
capacity of MINED to implement the program. However, MINED has proven to be one of the
most dynamic ministries in El Salvador and has shown its capacity to respond to increasingly
demanding tasks under the SABE Project and the SSRP. This risk will be reduced, and the
institutional viability secured, through continuous technical assistance that will strengthen the
institutional capacity of MINED.
32.   The fiscal requirements to support the modernization of basic education will depend on
the assumptions made regarding growth of teacher salaries. Under a conservative scenario the
financial viability of the program will require that public sector spending in education be increased
by 0.6 percent of GNP to a total of 2.5 percent.' The macroeconomic and fiscal risks leading to
inadequate funding are low. The Government has provided assurances to provide adequate
funding for the project.
33.   The decentralization process bears the risks of an inadequate articulation between different
levels of operation. The process relies on the EDUCO model which has a proven record and thus
this risk is minimized.
34.   The introduction of a new teacher incentives system  and the establishment of a
performance assessment system could create political tensions between MINED and the teachers.
However, the political support for the modernization program of MINED, the support of the
National Commission for Education, Science and Development, and the introduction of an active
communication campaign will reduce the risk of an unsolvable confrontation with teachers.
35.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
