Agency
Amount:            US$37.3 million.
Terms:             Repayment in 30 years including 5¼/2 years of grace with interest at the
IDB's standard variable rate (ordinary capital).
The IDB's financing would be chargeable to the ordinary capital, under the
Intermediate Financing Facility (IFF) subsidy, in the amount of US$37.3
million, considering that: (a) El Salvador is eligible to use the IFF under the
Eighth General Increase in Resources (document AB-1683); (b) El
Salvador is conducting a peace process following a period of armed
conflict that ravaged the country for over 10 years; (c) a significant
majority of the beneficiaries of the operation, according to conditions
prevailing in the country, are poor; and (d) the program supports preschool
and basic education. It is proposed that the IFF resources be used to
defray up to five percentage points of the interest rate on the total amount
of the loan. It is also proposed that up to 90 percent of total program costs
be financed with IDB resources, since the direct beneficiaries are low-
income earners. For the same reasons, it also proposed that the OC loan
be granted for 30 years.
Disbursement
period:            5 years.
Commitment Fee
OC:                0.75 percent annually on undisbursed balances.

BACKGROUND:                Following the peace accords, signed in 1992, the Government of
El Salvador (GOES) committed itself to the reconstruction of the
country. The achievement of peace was a prerequisite for the
implementation of a series of measures in support of social and
economic development, including education.  The education
system will play a key role in the reconstruction process because
of its effects on social equity and economic growth at a time when
economic globalization imposes highly competitive standards for
progress.
Over the last five years, the political and economic policies put
into effect by GOES have put the country on a path of positive
growth of GDP (6 percent in 1994) and have laid the basis for
sustained growth. In that context, during the last administration



vi
(1989-May 1994), the Ministry of Education (MINED) began to
address the problems of the education system through a number of
sectoral policies. The current Government is continuing,
expanding and consolidating the education sector reform measures
initiated by the previous administration. Central to this strategy
are the processes of decentralization and modernization. The
overall objective of the current education policy is to create an
education system that can be an effective tool for promoting the
economic and social development of the country.
OBJECTIVES:               The proposed project will promote greater equity, quality and
efficiency in the provision of education services by: (a) improving
access to education; (b) improving education quality in both
academic achievement (output) and learning environment
(education inputs); and (c) strengthening the managerial, financial
and administrative capacity of MINED to set policies and
guidelines for the sector and deliver public education services
efficiently.
DESCRIPTION AND           The project has been organized into three major components as
COST:                     follows:
(a)  Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education
(US$12.5 million or 16 percent of total project costs) in 135
target municipios to provide for: (i) supporting the
expansion of community-managed schools (EDUCO)
including rehabilitating the school infrastructure in rural
schools; and (ii) technical assistance for strengthening the
EDUCO model.
(b) Improvement in Education Quality (US$49.2 million or
61 percent of total costs) would contain activities that
impact the quality of preschool and basic education in the
country as a whole, including: (i) technical assistance for
supporting curriculum development activities for preschool
and basic education, designing a new student promotion
system, and establishing multigrade classes in schools in
rural areas; (ii) educational materials, such as textbooks,
didactic materials, and classroom and school libraries; (iii)
training and assistance to upgrade the skills of preschool
and basic education teachers, principals and supervisors, and
preparing studies to improve pre-service teacher training;
and (vi) developing an education assessment system. The
component would also include activities to develop a school
health and nutrition program giving priority to the poorest
135 municipios in the country.
(c)   Institutional  Modernization   and   Strengthening



vii
(US$13.3 million or 17 percent of total costs) to provide
for: (i) technical assistance for a review of MINED's legal
and organizational framework to increase system
efficiency, to implement institutional reforms in the areas of
management of human and financial resources, planning,
information, evaluation, monitoring, supervision, and
communication systems and to establish a staff
development program to improve the capacity of
administrators and technical personnel; and (ii) establishing
a funding mechanism, the Pilot Basic Education Fund, to
test alternative methods of providing basic education,
through the municipios and non-profit private institutions,
and to experiment with pedagogical and administrative
innovations. This component will have an effect that will
extend throughout the education sector and the country.
ENVIRONMENTAL             The project is not expected to have direct environmental effects,
CLASSIFICATION:           and has been classified as Category C for IBRD and Category II
for IDB (December 12, 1994).
BENEFITS:                 Faced with the urgent need to improve coverage and quality of
basic education, the project would support the efforts of the
Government to undertake a balanced process of improving equity,
quality and efficiency of the school system. The project would
target some resources to poor and vulnerable groups, would
improve learning achievements, and promote the efficiency of
resource allocation. At the same time it would strengthen the
institutional capacity of MINED to provide services and to
evaluate and monitor educational policies and programs.
Decentralization and community participation will boost
responsiveness by teachers and administrators since all will be
sharing administrative responsibilities, and clarity will promote
accountability at all levels. The proposed project will support the
Public Sector Modernization by establishing the conditions for
MIED to be an active and responsive actor in the process while
being consistent with the general guidelines of the Public Sector
Reform. The program will also help to identify efficient methods
and procedures to deliver education services that will be a seed for
future improvements within the sector.
RISKS:                    The fiscal requirements to support the modernization of basic
education will depend on the assumptions made regarding growth
and real recovery of teachers salaries.  Under a conservative
scenario the financial viability of the program will require that
public sector spending in education be increased by 0.7 percent of
GNP to a total of 2.7. As noted in Annex 2 the macroeconomics
and fiscal risks leading to inadequate funding are low.  The
Government has been adamant in declaring its commitment to fund



viii
the program, even under a less favorable scenario that will require
an additional fiscal effort to the detriment of other sectors.
Due to the comprehensive scope of the operation, the success of
the program  will depend upon the capacity of MINED  to
implement the program. MINED has proven to be one of the
most dynamic ministries in El Salvador and has shown its capacity
to respond to increasingly demanding tasks under the SABE
Project (Strengthening Achievement in Basic Education) and the
SSRP (Social Sector Rehabilitation Project).
The program relies on the EDUCO model for providing services in
rural areas.  The expansion of EDUCO will introduce new
challenges to maintain its efficiency, an adequate incentives
structure, and timely responsiveness to the demands of the
community. The expansion of EDUCO will also have to be
matched with the revision of the incentive structure for all teachers
(EDUCO and traditional) to avoid the conflict that could arise
from a dual labor regime for teachers. The program addresses
both issues to minimize those risks.
The introduction of a new teacher incentives system, the
establishment of a performance assessment system  and the
rationalization of MINED's staff could create political tensions
between the GOES/MINED  and the teachers, supervisors,
principals and MINED's staff.  The political support for the
modernization program of MINED, the support of the Comisi6n
Nacional de Educaci6n, Ciencia y Desarrollo, and the
introduction of an active communication campaign will reduce the
risk of a confrontation with MINED's employees.
The decentralization process bears the risks of an inadequate
articulation between different levels of operation. The design of
pilot programs and the consideration of lessons learned in other
Latin American experiences when designing the implementation
process are the best ways to limit those risks.
THE BANKS'                The IBRD's country assistance strategy (CAS) for El Salvador,
STRATEGIES:               discussed by the Board on September 14, 1993 with the Second
Structural Adjustment Loan, focuses on supporting the
Government in meeting its critical development challenges and
facilitating the transition from a wartime economy to a peaceful,
more participatory society.  The Structural Adjustment Loans
(SAL I, Loan 3293-ES, 1991; SAL II, Loan 3646-ES, 1993), the
Technical Assistance Loan (TAL, Loan 3648-ES, 1993), and the
on-going SSRP (Loan 3348-ES, 1991) have been supporting
Government economic reforms and the social sector strategy by
emphasizing, in the long-term, the provision of targeted preschool



ix
and basic education which directly benefit the poor. The proposed
project would be a key instrument for supporting the efforts of the
Government to implement public sector reforms and to continue
the strategies developed under the SSRP by increasing community
participation in the basic education system.
The proposed project is also in line with the IDB country strategy
which was discussed during a programming mission with the
Government in August 1994. This strategy, which covers 1994-
1996, was defined in the Country Programrning Paper of March
1993. Its objectives include: (a) improving social and economic
infrastructure; (b) supporting economic reforms; (c) increasing
IDB support to the social services; (d) protecting the environment;
(e) supporting the modernization of the State; and (f)
strengthening the participation of communities and women in the
national reconstruction process.
POVERTY TARGETING: The project would be an integral part of El Salvador's antipoverty
strategy through its assistance to improve coverage and quality of
basic education services for the poorest groups in the country.
The Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education
Component and the Health and Nutrition Subcomponent, are both
targeted to poor children in rural and urban marginal areas in the
135 poorest municipios of the country.
The IDB's financing would be chargeable to the ordinary capital,
under the Intermediate Financing Facility (IFF) subsidy.  It is
proposed that the IFF resources be used to defray up to five
percentage points of the interest rate on the total amount of the
loan. It is also proposed that up to 90 percent of IDB financed
subcomponent costs be financed with IDB resources, since the
direct beneficiaries are low-income earners. For the same reason,
it also proposed that the OC loan be granted for 30 years.
RETROACTIVE               The IBRD and the IDB have agreed to finance retroactively up to
FINANCING:                US$300,000 each to help cover eligible start-up expenditures. For
the IBRD this financing will cover expenditures made on or after
March 15 1995.  For the IDB  this financing will cover
expenditures six-months prior to Board approval.
ADVANCES:                 Given the degree of preparation and the proposed implementation
plan, it is recommended that an advance equivalent to 10 percent
of the proposed IDB loan be approved to assist the Government to
implement project activities during first 120 days. The fund would
be replenished upon presentation by MINED of the required
documentation.
PROCUREMENT:              All procurement will be undertaken by a procurement agent. The
benefits of using a procurement agent are consequence of (i)
MINED's limited capacity to manage extensive procurement



x
procedures simultaneously; and (ii) the technical support provided
to the MINED on a daily basis resulting from a procurement
agent's experience in the implementation of projects financed by
international donors.
The IDB would finance all construction and rehabilitation works.
All civil works contracting would be managed by FIS which has
proven experience in this area and is also familiar with IDB
procurement norrns and procedures since it has been the recipient
of four IDB loans.
SPECIAL                   At negotiations, agreement was reached: (a) on the schedule and
CONTRACTUAL               terms of reference for the modernization of MINED; (b) that the
CONDITIONS:               required funds for incremental teacher salaries as established in the
annual work plans review would be included in the MINED
budget for the following year; (c) on the IBRD Special Account
and on retroactive financing; (d) on appointment of key project
technical and administrative staff and/or consultants and their
terms of reference; (e) that MINED would: (i) conduct, jointly
with MICDES, IBRD and IDB, annual project implementation
reviews; and (ii) submit to the Banks annual progress reports on
the implementation of the project in accordance with targets
established in previous annual work and investment plans; (f) that:
(i) the in-depth mid-term review would cover all aspects of project
implementation and be conducted jointly by MINED, MICDES

EL SALVADOR
BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
INTRODUCTION
1.    At the request of the Government of El Salvador (GOES), the World Bank (IBRD) and
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have worked together to assist GOES in designing
a project to continue their efforts in improving the quality of education and the delivery of
education services. The following document is one of the first efforts between the IBRD and the
IDB to prepare a project using a single document. This document was written by members of
both Banks and combines the elements of documents needed to comply with the requirements of
each Bank.
2.    The first chapter presents information on the economic and social context of El Salvador
and Chapter 2 provides an overview of the education sector. Chapter 3 is a detailed description
of the project components and subcomponents. Chapter 4 provides information on project costs
and the mechanisms to be used for procurement, disbursement and auditing. Chapter 5 describes
project implementation and management. The final chapters summarize information on the
beneficiaries, the risks, and the agreements needed to proceed with the project. Annexes provide
specific details on education statistics and the project components and subcomponents. An
economic analysis and social assessment were done to better assess the risks and benefits of the
project. These are presented in Annexes 2, 3 and 4.
1. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BACKGROUND
1.1   Following the peace accords, signed in 1992, GOES committed itself to the reconstruction
of the country. The achievement of peace was a prerequisite for the implementation of a series of
measures in support of social and economic development, including education. The education
system will continue to play a key role in the reconstruction process because of its effects on
social equity and economic growth at a time when economic globalization requires a highly
competitive labor force.
1.2   Afder a twelve-year war and a 50 percent reduction in social expenditures as a proportion
of GDP during the 1980s, more than two-thirds of the population was poor in 1991. Despite
substantial improvements since the end of the war, poverty and inadequate social services are still
widespread.  Raising social sector expenditures and modernizing inefficient public sector
institutions are major challenges faced by the Government as it strives to achieve better social
indicators while maintaining sound fiscal policies.
1.3   Over the last five years, the political and economic policies put into effect by GOES have
put the country on a path of positive growth of gross domestic product (GDP) (6 percent in
1994) and have laid the basis for sustained growth. Under stable economic conditions, the



2
Government's economic and social strategy sets the alleviation of poverty as the principal social
objective. The plan calls for progress toward a long-term objective of establishing a national
network of basic social services that assures access to all the population, especially to the most
vulnerable groups.  It places special attention on human capital formation (especially for
education, health and nutrition), the well-being of the poorest groups, basic infrastructure,
community development and the monitoring and evaluation of social programs. As part of this
strategy, the Government implemented an IBRD-supported US$35.6 million Social Sector
Rehabilitation Project (SSRP, Loan No. 3348-ES, 1991) which was designed to enhance the
public sector's capacity to manage and deliver health and education services efficiently by
supporting institutional reforms, increasing the flow of funds to the social sectors, and improving
basic social services for the poor.
1.4   As another key element in the social plan, the Government instituted the Social Investment
Fund (Fondo de Inversi6n Social - FIS) in 1990. This agency is responsible for approximately
5,000 small investment projects which have benefited 60 percent of the poor population in the
majority of the country's municipios. The FIS has distinguished itself as an agency capable of
rapidly, efficiently and transparently channeling resources to the needy population through small-
scale contracts, with the ample participation of community groups. By July 1994, the FIS had
built or repaired 4,000 classrooms and supplied 200,000 desks. It implemented 250 water
projects, in and near urban areas, benefiting about 160,000 persons (over 3 percent of the
country's population). In its first three and one-half years of operation, the FIS has been
supported by UNDP, UNICEF, the Government of Japan, the German Credit Institute for
Reconstruction (Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau - KfW) and the IDB. IDB's support in four
consecutive loans sums to US$153 million (Loans 861/SF-ES, 905/SF-ES, 765/OS-ES, 829/OC-
ES).
1.5   During the last administration (1989-May 1994), the Ministry of Education (MINED)
began to address the problems of the education system through a number of sectoral policies
which included: (a) re-allocating public education resources to favor preschool and basic
education for the population living in the poorest areas of the country (especially in the
countryside and in urban squatter settlements); (b) the development of non-formal education for
adults; (c) improvement in the basic education curriculum; (d) decentralization of education
services as a means to improve the efficiency in the use of resources; and (e) the participation of
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other private organizations in the execution of
cultural and educational programs and projects.
1.6   The new administration, which came to power in June 1994, will continue the reforms
initiated by the previous administration, and requested that the two Banks finance the proposed
project. The proposed project would support the reform program by: (a) expanding basic
education services through alternative delivery means targeted to the most disadvantaged
population; (b) improving the quality of basic education services; and (c) further strengthening the
institutional capabilities of MINED to plan and manage the delivery of social programs in a
decentralized manner by incorporating new areas in the reform.

2. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
A. Sectoral Overview
2.1    Since 1989, GOES has made great progress in rehabilitating the critical status of the
education system which was severely affected by the war. The education sector has been
developing a set of programs to shape the education reforms considered essential to the building
of a new society in the country. With the education strategies adopted by the 1989-1994
administration, preschool education offered by the public sector for 4 to 6 year-old children has
increased significantly from 15 percent in 1989 to 35 percent in 1993. The total enrollment rate
for grades I to 6 has increased from 76 percent in 1989 to 83 percent in 1993. The current
Government is continuing and consolidating the education sector reform measures initiated by the
previous administration (see paras. 1.5-1.6).  In addition, it is expanding reforms in new
directions, emphasizing the provision of services to the poor.
Sector Organization and Administration
2.2    Organization. The formal education system consists of one year of preschool, nine years of
basic education, three years of secondary education, and higher education with courses of two to
six years. Basic education starts at age seven and is organized in three cycles of three years each.
The first cycle contains grades 1-3, the second contains grades 4-6 and the third contains grades
7-9. Secondary education, grades 10-12, is diversified and prepares students for the Bachillerato
diploma in any of the following specialized programs: academic, business administration, home
economics, industrial, vocational arts, agriculture, hotel catering and tourism, navigation and

fishery, health, and teacher training.  Higher education is offered in two forms, technical/
vocational and academic, through 30 technical institutions, a national university, and 36 private
universities.
2.3    Administration. The main institution in the education sector is NINED  which is
responsible for administering all levels of education, except universities, and monitoring the



4
private sector provision of services (see Annex 9 for organigram). Except for the national
university, which receives resources directly from the national budget, administration is highly
centralized with programming and administrative and financial management all concentrated in the
central office. Adult education and vocational education are administered by the Directorate of
Adult Education in MINED through private institutions like the Fundaci6n Empresarial para el
Desarrollo  Educativo  (FEPADE), Instituto  Salvadoreno  de  Formacion  Profesional
(INSAFORP) and NGOs. The National Council for Culture and Art (Consejo Nacional para la
Cultura y el Arte - CONCULTURA), created in 1992 as a decentralized unit of MINED, was put
in charge of watching over the preservation, development and dissemination of the cultural
patrimony of El Salvador.'
2.4   With the support of the SSRP, MINED developed and implemented a decentralized model
of services provision in rural areas, the Community-managed Schools Program (Educaci6n con
Participaci6n de la Comunidad - EDUCO), which transferred the management of schools to
communities. This innovative program, based on the direct involvement of parents and members
of the community, and institutional strengthening activities at the central and regional levels,
promotes the participation of rural communities in defining and administering education. The
Community Education Associations (Asociaciones Comunales para la Educaci6n - ACEs) have
been instrumental in promoting community participation not only in educational matters, but also
in matters concerning the community as a whole. Under the program, ACEs are organized by
communities, and are the key management mechanism for program operation at the local level.
MINED transfers funds to the ACEs who are responsible for: (a) managing the schools; (b)
selecting (qualified) teachers, and hiring and dismissing them; (c) maintaining the infrastructure
and furnishing the schools; and (d) negotiating with the different Government agencies and/or
international agency programs to obtain funds for improving the school program. Additionally,
they interact with supervisors to maintain adequate communication with MINED.
2.5   In 1993, there were approximately 27,700 teachers for preschool, basic, and secondary
education in El Salvador (see Annex 1, Table 7). These are divided into three categories: (a)
Docente I teachers who are prepared to teach preschool and grades 1 to 6; (b) Docente II
teachers who are prepared to teach grades 7 to 9; and (c) Docente III teachers who are prepared
to teach secondary education. Although teachers are categorized by Docente level, they may not
be teaching at the level in which they are categorized (see para. 2.26). MINED employs 5,520
technical and administrative personnel, 38 percent assigned to posts outside San Salvador, to
administer traditional education services throughout the country. The existence of regional
offices does not represent effective decentralization. Local staff activities are limited to a passive
follow-up of decisions taken at the central level. The only outstanding exception to centralization
is the EDUCO program where decentralization is effective through the administrative support of
the ACEs.
2.6   The National Teacher Organization (ANDES) is strong in El Salvador.  Although
membership is not obligatory, the majority of traditional teachers, and some EDUCO teachers,
belong. ANDES has been participating with MINED in the definition of the education reform.2
MINED is also responsible for the preservation of the national patrimony, which includes parks and the zoo, and
for the so-called cultural extension executed by 100 "houses of culture" (casas culturales).
2 There is no formal trade union with legal support for collective labor negotiation, but the organization acts and
performs as a trade union.

2.7   Teacher salaries, in real terms, have steadily declined since 1980. The purchasing power
of a teacher's wage in 1992 was 32 percent of its level in 1980. Per capita income rose 5.4
percent between 1984-92, while teacher wages fell 50 percent in the same period. The apparent
benefits of the reduction of the economic burden of providing education is illusory. Quality
standards drop and absenteeism increases. By reducing the number of teaching hours, teachers
adjusted the real salary by quantity and quality to offset the drop in wages.
Gender in Education
2.8   El Salvador has advanced significantly towards gender balanced educational attainment.
At the preschool level, female enrollment is 50.2 percent (see Annex 1, Table 17). In basic
education and secondary education, female students slightly outnumber male students with 51
percent and 54 percent, respectively. Female students also outnumber their male counterparts in
post-secondary technical education where 58 percent of the enrollment is female, but in post-
secondary academic education, male students (52 percent) outnumber female students (48
percent). A recent study jointly prepared by the IBRD and IDB3, shows that place of residence
and income level are more significant determinants of literacy than gender (see Table 2). There
are, however, four women's issues in education that have not been resolved: teenage pregnancy;
women's narrow preferences for careers and fields of study; lower rates of return on education for
women; and gender stereotypes in textbooks.  Gender stereotyping is closely related with
preschool and basic education.  The Ministry has taken steps toward eliminating sex-role
modeling in the textbooks for grade 1 through 4. The proposed project will continue these efforts
by removing gender stereotyping from textbooks and other classroom materials (see also paras.
2.24 and 3.14).

B. Sectoral Issues in Education
2.9   The Salvadoran education indicators reveal an education system  with interrelated
problems causing poor system performance. The main education sector issues are: (a) low
internal efficiency; (b) insufficient access to education; (c) unsatisfactory education quality in both
academic achievement (output) and learning environment (education inputs); (d) weak managerial
and administrative capacity; and (e) inadequate financing of the sector.

IBRD and IDB.

2.10  To better understand education issues, a Social Assessment was undertaken (see Annex 4)
to consider the perceptions of the stakeholders - MINED, teachers, parents, students, etc. The
provision of well-organized information on the public perceptions of the education sector has
been an especially useful tool for MINED in the process of changing the provision of public
education services to rely more on community participation. The lack of regular communication
channels transformed the Social Assessment into an unintended communication mechanism for
education reform and helped the Banks in the fine tuning of the design of project components.
Low Internal Efficiency
2.11   Late entrance to school, the existence of a large number of 'incomplete" rural schools not
offering at least the full first two cycles of education, and high repetition and dropout rates in
basic education have the greatest impact on the education system's internal efficiency.
2.12  Late entrance to schooling. Fifty-three percent of urban students and 67 percent of rural
students enrolled in grades I to 9 are over the age expected for the grade in which they are
enrolled (Annex 1, Tables 3 and 4). In 1993, the 1 st and 2nd cycle gross enrollment rate, in urban
schools, was 113.6 percent and the net enrollment rate was 89.6 percent. A similar situation
occurred in rural schools where the gross enrollment was also significantly higher than the net
enrollment in the same grades, 101.9 percent and 77.3 percent, respectively (Annex 1, Table 2).
In El Salvador, the main reasons for late entrance to school include: (a) absence of services during
the war years; (b) ignorance on the part of parents about the benefits of schooling; and (c) low
levels of family income which: (i) prevent parents from being able to afford the costs of sending
their children to school; and (ii) require children to work in order to augment the family income.
Late entrance in school, particularly in the rural areas, has provoked the overage phenomenon and
age heterogeneity in the classroom. Age heterogeneity in the classroom without the use of
appropriate methodologies can have an unfavorable impact on overall academic achievement.
Available data show that late entrance, however small, increases repetition rates and decreases the
completion rates of basic education. The introduction of preschool education is one of the most
effective ways to promote prompt entrance of students. The proposed project will have a positive
effect in increasing internal efficiency by expanding the coverage of preschool (para. 3.6).
2.13  Incomplete basic education schools. Too frequently public schools do not offer education
services for the entire basic education cycle. According to a recent survey4, almost all schools
cover the 1st cycle, but only 80 percent cover the 2nd cycle, and 50 percent cover the 3rd cycle.
The deficiencies are more severe in rural areas. The existence of these incomplete schools keep
many student from completing their basic education. The expansion of coverage provided in the
proposed project will cover preschool through grade 6 (para. 3.7).
2.14  Repetition and dropout rates in basic education. Repetition rates for basic education
range from a high of 22 percent in 1 st grade in the Central Region to less than one percent in the
9th grade in all regions (Annex 1, Table 6). Repetition rates in grades 1 to 3 are slightly higher in
EDUCO schools where late entrance to school is a more frequent phenomenon than in traditional

Desarrollo Educativo, Universidad Centroamericana Jose Sime6n Cafias.



7
schools (17 percent and 15 percent, respectively). At the national level, many students repeat
more than once and eventually drop out of school. Preschool education has proven to be an
effective method to reduce repetition rates in higher grades. Through the expansion of preschool
coverage, the proposed project will help to reduce repetition rates (para. 3.6).
2.15  Because of repetition and dropout, completion and promotion rates are very low. The
cumulative effects of late entrance, repetition and dropout, and incomplete basic schools, mean
that only 47 percent of the initial student cohort finish the first two cycles of basic education, and
only 33 percent finish the 3rd cycle.5 On average, members of the urban population who are 15
years of age or older have completed 7 years of schooling. In rural areas, on average, only 2.8
years of school have been completed.
2.16  Repetition in grades 1 to 9 adds approximately 23 percent to the cost of producing a
graduate.6 It is estimated that repetition adds to the system some US$37 million in additional
costs each year. In addition to the financial costs, these inefficiencies are costly in terms of lost
human capital, and they compound the difficulty of addressing problems of low coverage and
quality. The proposed project will address issues of efficiency in a comprehensive way through a
series of actions to improve the quality of education services provided by MINED. It is important
to emphasize six actions that will have a direct impact on repetition rates and are considered in the
proposed project: (a) the revision of curriculum to meet the needs and interests of the rural school
population (para. 3.13); (b) the expansion of preschool coverage (para. 3.6); (c) the development
of a multigrade program in rural areas that introduces the flexibility required in rural environments
(para. 3.13); (d) the establishment of a new promotion system for students, allowing for automatic
progression within cycles (para. 3.21); (e) the development of a nutrition program targeted to the
poorest schools in rural areas (para. 3.23); and (f) the promotion of an active participation of
parents in school management (para. 3.1 1).
Insufficient Access to Education
2.17  Access to education varies depending on the part of the country in which the person lives,
and is hindered by lack of sufficient infrastructure. It is also heavily dependent on the level of
income of a student's family.  Children from  the poorest households not only have less
opportunity to enter school, but also enter at a later age, and stay less time in school, than do
children from families with more economic resources. Education figures show that by 1993, only
24 percent of children aged 4-6 attended preschool in rural areas, compared to 46 percent of
students the same age in the urban areas. At the same time, only 56 percent of children between
the ages of 7 and 15 were enrolled in basic education in rural areas, compared to 77 percent of the
same age group in urban areas (Annex 1, Table 2). Although low, the levels of rural enrollment
have increased because of the EDUCO program. Despite its success in increasing enrollment,
problems remain in regards to the ACE management capability. The proposed project will include
measures to increase ACE efficiency with the support of NGOs and other private organizations.
2.18  Regional characteristics play an important role in explaining differences in access. These
differences are a result of the priority given by the Government and other donors to regions

8
affected by the war, and to population increases caused by migration to the Central Region. The
Central Region has the highest gross and net enrollment rates for both preschool and basic
education (see Annex 1, Table 5).
2.19   Another factor affecting access to schools is inadequate infrastructure. Many existing
schools need rehabilitation, and lack equipment and furniture. Based on the results of the
microplanning/microlocation exercise7 the proposed project will include measures to promote the
construction of new sections in areas presenting infrastructure deficits and to rehabilitate rural
schools. Under the proposed project, MINED will work together with the FIS to increase and
rehabilitate infrastructure following MINED's infrastructure (see para. 3.7).
Low Quality of Education
2.20   The low quality of education in El Salvador has been caused primarily by: (a) deficiencies
in the provision and the quality of textbooks, and in the curriculum on which they are based; (b)
lack of supplementary educational materials; (c) inadequate teacher training programs; (d)
insufficient student achievement evaluation; (e) lack of systematic pedagogical supervision; and (f)
the precarious nutritional status of the preschool/basic education age population.
2.21   Textbooks and curriculum deficiencies. Studies show that there are deficiencies in basic
education textbooks and instructional materials in schools throughout the country in terms of the
number of textbooks provided, the quality of the texts, and the curriculum on which they are
based. A recent evaluation study8 shows that only 44 percent of the teachers in traditional schools
and 31 percent of the teachers in EDUCO schools surveyed indicated that each of their students
had their own textbooks. Forty-three percent of traditional school teachers and 31 percent of
EDUCO teachers indicated that their students had no textbooks.9 Since 1991, with the support of
the Strengthening Achievement in Basic Education Project (Solidificaci6n del Alcance de la
Educaci6n Bdsica - SABE) (see para. 2.52), MINED has provided textbooks to urban and rural
students (grades I to 3) to use for the school year at no charge. With MINED funds, a limited
number of textbooks produced under SABE has been printed and distributed to urban and rural
students in grades 4 to 6. However, because the SABE project is phasing out and the amount of
MINED funds for textbooks is limited, there are not enough books to cover all students in those
grades. Textbook deficiencies can be particularly significant when teachers themselves lack
mastery of the material, and when students lack supplemental learning opportunities in the home
or at the school, mainly when the environment is not conducive to formal learning as in rural
areas. Current textbooks lack complementary teaching materials relevant to the rural areas. In
this environment, an improved curriculum and textbooks may be the most cost-effective means to
improve learning. No cost-recovery policies on textbooks and/or teaching materials has so far
been implemented by the Salvadoran authorities, but the current administration has agreed to
study and consider cost-recovery schemes. The proposed project wvill include measures to
Under the SSRP, an intensive survey of the existing education infrastructure has been undertaken to determine
the costs for providing infrastructure, the amount of rehabilitation required for existing infrastructure, and the
areas where services are needed.

establish universal provision of textbooks to students in basic education, and will support the
establishment of textbooks cost recovery policies ( paras 3.15 and 3.16).
2.22  Rural student absenteeism is related to inadequacies in curriculum plans and the school
calendar, and is also connected to low internal efficiency. MINED has devoted time and effort to
rethinking the curriculum for basic education in general and for rural students in particular. In
addition, the school calendar in the rural schools needs to be organized taking into account the
demand for family labor. Such an adjustment is be expected to relieve parental pressure to pull
children, particularly boys, out of school at times when their labor is in high demand. The
proposed project will include measures to increase the provision of textbooks and to adapt the
curriculum to rural areas (paras. 3.13, 3.15).
2.23   Multigrade methods in rural areas have been considered an important pedagogical method
to improve the provision of education.'0 However, teachers must learn how to deal with this
situation on the job. Building on the strong participation of the community in the school activities
under the EDUCO program, the proposed project will support, where necessary, the adoption of
multigrade approaches in the rural schools to improve quality of learning and solve traditional
problems of rural students (para. 3.13). Instructional materials, in-service teacher training, school
administration, and community participation will be integral parts of the model to be adopted by
the rural schools, first on a pilot basis. UNICEF would support the pilot experience before
expansion to a large number of rural schools.
2.24   Textbooks and zender issues. As in many countries, textbooks used in El Salvador tend
to foster and support gender stereotypes. Women are typically depicted in jobs consistent with
traditional nurturing roles. MINED has acted to counter negative gender-based stereotyping
through efforts funded by UNICEF/UNIFEM and USAID, but results have been only partially
achieved. An IBRD/IDB study on textbooks indicates that in the revised texts for grades I to 6,
although illustrations were more gender balanced, texts continue to portray predominantly male
characters, and women continue to be depicted in a traditional context."1 The proposed project
includes measures to counteract gender stereotypes both in curriculum and textbooks (para.
3.14).
2.25   Lack of supplementary educational materials. In addition to the lack of textbooks, schools
lack supplementary educational materials such as globes, maps, charts, educational toys,
supplemental texts, and workbooks. Likewise, more costly but effective resources, such as
libraries, classroom reading resources, science kits, and computers, are rarely in evidence. The
above situation is more acute in the rural and marginal urban schools. Under the SABE project
(para. 2.52), MINED started to develop an educational package program (canasta bdsica) with
basic educational materials for grades I to 6. However, more needs to be done to make a more
extensive provision of these materials and supplementary teaching/learning materials to all basic
education schools and students. The provision of instructional materials is also considered by
teachers as a key incentive for teaching as noted in the Social Assessment (see Annex 4). The

IBRD and IDB.



10
proposed project will include measures to increase the provision of instructional materials to
preschool and basic education schools through the canasta blsica (para. 3.15).
2.26  Inadequate teacher training.  Teacher pre-service training specifically for preschool
education or the early years of basic education barely exists in El Salvador. Most Salvadoran
basic education school teachers are graduates of universities and have been prepared to teach the
upper grades of the basic education cycle. As a result, most teachers lack the pedagogical skills
needed to foster effective interaction with students in the lower grades, make the best use of the
textbooks and instructional materials, and identify and orient students with learning disabilities.
Therefore, they are most in need of training because of: (a) their lack of previous teacher training
preparation; (b) the general lack of systematic supervision; and (c) the added difficulty of handling
multigrade classes. The proposed project will include measures to establish a systematic in-
service training system for all teachers in preschool and basic education and funds for assessing
the pre-service training system, currently administered by the private sector, which will
recommend policy options to improve the basic education pre-service training programs
administered by the private sector (para. 3.16).
2.27  Insufficient student achievement evaluation. MINED has only recently started to apply
achievement tests to measure the learning status of students in the education system. Under the
SABE project, MINED began using achievement tests to assess the impact of the new core
curriculum for grades 1-6. However, the results of this exercise showed that MINED's resources
and capacity are too limited to monitor and evaluate academic achievement and standards of
teaching across the country and in the different modalities of education services provided. There
is a need to create in MINED the '"ulture" of evaluation to support education policy options
regarding teacher training, textbooks and instructional materials. The proposed project will
include measures to improve the institutional and technical capacity in El Salvador for monitoring
student achievement as a tool to increase education efficiency and accountability (para. 3.21).
2.28 Lack of systematic pedagogical supervision. The education supervision system, which had
disappeared during the armed conflict, was reorganized in 1990. Since the system was re-
established, school supervisors have played an important administrative role in the implementation
of the EDUCO program. However, they have not been able to provide pedagogical support and
guidance to teachers in either system, traditional or EDUCO.   Inadequate supervision
mechanisms, unclear assignment of activities, and low technical preparation, are factors impeding
the better performance of the supervisors and their contribution to improving school and teaching
efficiency. The proposed project would support activities to re-orient the supervision system in
the direction of providing technical support to teachers and school principals, disseminating
results of education program evaluation, and giving feedback to correct shortcomings in the
education process. To increase the professional capacity of the supervisors, the proposed project
will seek to achieve a qualitative change in the supervisors functions by increasing the time
employed in monitoring teaching activities and by reducing their strictly administrative
responsibilities (para. 3.28(d)).
2.29  Children's low nutritional status.  Hunger and malnutrition diminish the physical and
mental capacity of poor children.  Protein-energy malnutrition and the lack of certain
micronutrients, especially iodine and iron, reduce learning capacity and academic achievement.
Deficiencies of vitamin A and iron also reduce resistance to infections which can increase



11
absenteeism. In addition, research shows that children who go to school without breakfast have
difficulty in concentrating, and perform less well than children who have had breakfast. This
effect is greatest in children who are also malnourished. School nutrition and health programs to
alleviate hunger and malnutrition can complement other efforts to improve the quality of basic
education, and contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the education system.
2.30   According to the first height-for-age census of first grade school children conducted in
1988, one-third of Salvadoran children in first grade are malnourished. In the least developed
municipios 2, the prevalence of malnutrition rises to half the children. A Ministry of Health
(MOH) study conducted in 1994 corroborates the results of the census. It showed that 61
percent of preschool children in the least developed municipios are malnourished.
2.31   Goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland caused by a lack of iodine) affects 25 percent of children
between the ages of seven and 14. The problem is especially severe in the Western region where,
on average, 40 percent of the school age children are affected (Annex 8). Goiter is higher in girls
than in boys (28 percent versus 21 percent) and also higher among children aged 10 to 14 years
old. MOH has initiated a program to fortify salt with iodine, however, it will take several years,
at least, before fortification can alleviate iodine deficiency in the country. The consequences of
iodine deficiency can be most severe and irreversible when experienced in utero, causing, for
example, mental retardation and deafness. School-aged children deficient in iodine perform worse
on tests of intelligence and other tests of learning capacity compared to iodine-replete children.
Iodine deficiency is also linked to impaired hearing in school-aged children.
2.32   The lack of vitamin A is a widespread problem in El Salvador. All of the studies over the
last 40 years have shown that more than 70 percent of infants consume inadequate amounts of
vitamin A, especially in rural areas. A study conducted in 1994 showed that 99 percent had
insufficient consumption of vitamin A. Blood tests among preschool children show that 40
percent are deficient. The MOH has embarked on a program to fortify sugar with vitamin A. So
far the coverage of this program is low. It will take several more years before this program can
alleviate vitamin A deficiency.
2.33   Anemia from a lack of iron affects a large proportion of the population in all developing
countries. A sample study with teenagers done in 1988 indicated that 51 percent suffered anemia.
There is no updated and systematic information about iron deficiency, but the accepted estimate is
half of the school population. It affects physical capacity, achievement and immunity. Children
deficient in iron are less alert and attentive, less motivated, and perform less well on tests of
development and school achievement. Controlling this problem can be achieved through the
fortification of foods (flour, cookies, drinks) and provision of iron supplements.
2.34  In regions with deficient sanitary conditions, half or more of children suffer from parasitic
infections. These infections reduce appetite, increase the risk of anemia, in some cases, and cause
absenteeism because of diarrhea. They also independently contribute to poor school performance
by diminishing a child's ability to pay attention and concentrate. Broad spectrum single dose
drugs, effective against several species of worms, are now available to treat helminth infections.
12 A municipio is the second administrative level of the govermmental system. The levels, in order, are:
departamento, municipio, cant6n, caseria, comunidad.



12
The proposed project will include the provision of basic nutrition supplements and health
education measures, and targeted treatment activities as a highly cost-effective approach to
improving children's readiness to learn via better nutrition and health (para. 3.23).
Weak Managerial and Administrative Capacity
2.35  Despite the major efforts of the Government to foster an effective administration and the
existence of a highly qualified group at the managerial level in MINED that is leading the
education reforms, institutional weaknesses still remain. The education sector has insufficient
institutional capability to strengthen and consolidate ongoing education reforms to assure
efficiency, quality and equity improvements, especially among low-income areas.  Overall
institutional weaknesses and lack of adequate personnel policies in MINED underline much of the
poor performance in the sector. These weaknesses include: (a) an inappropriate institutional
organization; (b) an inadequate incentive structure for teachers and MINED technical staff, and
(c) the absence of an effective communication system (within MINED and between MINED and
the public) that weakens MINED's capacity to deliver its services timely and effectively.
Moreover, the lack of a timely, trustworthy, and relevant management information system (MIS)
has not allowed the Salvadoran education authorities to ascertain the impact of policies and
activities in the delivery of the education services.  These weaknesses impede MINED in
effectively translating education policies and strategies into concrete programmatic actions, target
resources to most needed areas, and periodically monitor achievements.
2.36  Inappropriate institutional organization. MINED's rigid and centralized organizational
structure, the wide range of responsibilities, the weakness of local institutions and the complex
administrative procedures are not conducive to the efficient management of education services.
MINED devotes its limited management resources to a wide range of activities which lessens its
efficiency and exacerbates the problem of limited management capacity. Moreover, the basic
management tools - planning, information systems, and evaluation mechanisms - are almost non-
existent. Under the shield of investment projects financed by external donors, MINED is able to
bypass some of the rigidities of the current structure to implement more efficient practices.
EDUCO is the most successful structural change in the way MINED provides education services.
Based on this experience, MINED has been gradually shifting responsibilities to the regional and
local levels. Other changes have happened in an unsystematic way, contributing to the lack of
transparency - an inadequacy of the current structure.  The problems of organization  are
worsened by severe personnel constraints.  The degree to which improvements could be
developed under the current structure are limited by the current legal framework of the education
sector and further actions need to be conceived in a consistent and systematic way.
2.37  The incentive to modernize MINED and increase its efficiency is part of a much broader
Public Sector Reform that has been underway and will be supported by the Banks under a Public
Sector Modernization Project under preparation (Annex 5). MINED was selected as the pilot
institution for reforms in the budgetary planning process that is expected to facilitate allocation
and flow of funds by level of education and to regions and departments. The proposed project
will: (a) build on the successful decentralization experience of MINED to develop pilot
modernization programs that will subsequently be implemented at the national level; (b)
strengthen the management tools available to MINED; and (c) revise the legal framework of the
education sector to make it suitable for the new organization of MINED (para. 3.27).



13
2.38  Inadequate incentive structure for teachers and MINED technical staff. Deficiencies in teacher
performance and low efficiency of technical staff are, in part, the result of an inadequate incentive
structure for both teachers and technical staff. During the last decade, performance of traditional
public school teachers decreased and absenteeism and turnover increased. This could be only partially
explained by the decline in real wages. Teachers are ruled by specific regulations (Escalaf6n
Magisterial) that guarantee job stability, and reward time in service and pre-qualification, but fail to
compensate for work environment or to promote excellence. In addition, there are no specific criteria,
based on qualifications, to select school principals. Moreover, the lack of adequate supervision
restricts effective control of teacher performance. As a consequence, teacher salaries are linked more
to the strength of the negotiating capacity of the organizations representing them. On the other hand,
teachers under the EDUCO program are not formal employees of MINED; they are selected, hired,
supervised and dismissed by the parent associations and, unlike traditional teachers, are judged by their
performance. Their salaries are higher, but they do not have the job stability of regular teachers. The
better attendance, performance and commitment of EDUCO teachers confirm the importance of
improving the incentive structure for traditional teachers based on performance evaluation.
2.39 Despite the success of the EDUCO program in improving teacher performance, it is
proving difficult in practice to hold teachers within the EDUCO system for appreciable lengths of
time because they prefer to be in the official career stream which is more stable and less
demanding.'3 In addition, the regular teacher organizations could obstruct the expansion of the
EDUCO system if it is perceived as threatening their interests. This calls for a comprehensive
revision of the incentive structure for both EDUCO and traditional teachers. A basic incentive,
such as the improvement of teacher real wages, should be combined with the revision of the
structure of incentives, including regulations, supervision, training, performance evaluation, and
better communication with MINED. The proposed project will finance a revision of the legal
framework including the Escalaf6n Docente, a strengthening of supervision, the development of a
broad in-service training program and the development of a communication strategy for MINED
(para. 3.28).
2.40   Performance of the technical staff at MINED is limited by low motivation and low
salaries, high turn over of management and technical personnel. In the absence of adequate and
defined policies for recruitment and career development, 50 percent of MINED's staff provides
only administrative support and the salary structure is very flat. Consequently, although MINED
offers very good remuneration and stable labor conditions for low administrative positions, it has
enormous difficulties in hiring or retaining competent technical and professional personnel. To
fully achieve the objectives of the education reform, a highly trained work force should be in place
to carry out the decentralized processes"and systems. The proposed project will provide for
technical assistance to MI4NED to revise the salary structure that will have to be consistent with
the revision of the Civil Service System under the Public Sector Modernization Project. The
proposed project will finance a revision of the education legal framework including the Escalaf6n
Docente, a strengthening of supervision, the development of a broad in-service training program
and the development of a communication strategy for MINED. It will also provide funds for the
definition of new job descriptions and training programs, and for the implementation of the
rationalization plan for personnel under the new structure of MINED (para. 3.28(f)).

2.41  Absence of an effective communication system.  The Social Assessment (Annex 4),
undertaken during project preparation, pointed out the severe problems resulting from MINED's
lack of an effective communication policy. Within the Ministry, the general guidelines set at the
highest levels do not always reach lower levels, and fragmented infornation undermnined the rapid
implementation of reforms. Communication with teachers, supervisors and principals is constant
but not necessarily efficient, and communication with other stakeholders has been very limited
despite its proven effectiveness in the EDUCO program. Although there is a consensus that the
education system should be changed, the lack of communication led to public misconceptions of
GOES' plans to modernize the education sector, and prevented the stakeholders from developing
a sense of ownership. The Social Assessment exercise contributed to promoting a better informed
discussion of education reform between stakeholders. Based on its results, the project includes
specific actions to develop a communication system within MINED, and between MINED and
other stakeholders (para. 3.28(e)).
2.42  To promote a national dialogue about education and to seek a national ownership for
education reform, in October 1994 the Government set up a National Commission for Education,
Science, and Development (Comisi6n Nacional de Educacz6n, Ciencia y Desarrollo). The
Commission was composed of 12 members who represent a wide range of political affiliations and
are acknowledged for their professional capacity and strong technical skills. The Commission
presented specific recommendations for the modernization of the education sector that are fully
consistent with the proposed project. The Commission will continue to support MINED in the
definition of further actions to improve education services in El Salvador.
Inadequate Financing of the Sector
2.43  Inadequate and deficient sector financing has been caused by: (a) sharp decreases in
education spending as a percentage of GDP; (b) the relative reduction of fiscal resources allocated
to education; and (c) inadequate financial/management mechanisms. Education expenditure in
relation to Central Government expenditure and to GDP has steadily decreased since 1981 and
has only slightly increased in the last two years. Its share of GDP fell from 3.6 percent in 1981 to
2.0 percent in 1994. This is partially due to the fact that total government expenditure fell from
nearly 20 percent of GDP in the early 1980s to 15 percent in 1994; however, the share of
education expenditure in the Central Government budget has also declined from nearly 28 percent
at the beginning of the 1970s to 14 percent in 1994 (Annexes 2 and 3).
2.44  Fiscal austerity has also resulted in a severe curtailment of investments in education. The
most important investments in the last four years have been financed by international donors in
projects associated with considerable technical assistance programs. Investment expenditures
have been drastically reduced, and only partially executed. Since 1990, executed spending on
education has fallen short of budgeted spending on education. In 1992 and 1993, the shortfall
was approximately 10 percent of total spending. In contrast, recurrent expenditures have been
almost fully executed as budgeted, and their share has increased to nearly 90 percent of the
budget.
2.45  Cumbersome financial mechanisms impede better management of budgetary allocations.
Apart from the ordinary budget, which finances most recurrent costs, El Salvador also has an



15
extraordinary budget, principally used to finance investment expenditures with external resources.
The extraordinary budget, however, has expanded to cover some recurrent expenditures. As part
of its macroeconomic reform program, the Government is taking measures to consolidate the two
budgets.  This effort will provide a better management of education funding to support
decentralization and local provision of education services and to make more cost-effective
decisions in the sector. Moreover, the proposed project would allow GOES to implement a vast
investment program for the expansion of education services and is part of a broader effort to
expand the fiscal support for the education section.
C. The Government's Strategy for Education
2.46  The severe economic crisis of the 1980s, followed by a drastic fall in real per capita
income and in government expenditures in education, an earthquake, and a civil war have severely
impacted the performance of the education sector in El Salvador. In 1989, only 14 percent of the
preschool age population and 65 percent of the basic education population were enrolled in the
education system. Illiteracy among those 15 years old and over was 27 percent; in Latin America
only Guatemala and Haiti had higher illiteracy rates.'4 During the war period, most education
indicators held steady because of an increase in services by the private sector and foreign aid.
Starting in 1989, GOES initiated policy reforms aimed at rehabilitating the public sector's
capacity to manage and deliver social services, including education.
2.47  The overall objective of the education policy currently being followed by GOES is to
create an education system that can be an effective tool for promoting the economic and social
development of the country. This will be done by promoting the formation of human capital
which will allow the recipients to reach higher levels of productivity and capacity. By promoting
personal development, the level of income and the quality of life of the population will be
enhanced.15
2.48  The strategy of GOES for the education sector is based on three fundamental elements:
(a) the focusing of human, financial and material resources on basic education; (b) the
decentralization of services and the participation of the communities; and (c) the provision of
services through the private sector which are more efficiently provided by that sector.'6 The first
element implies that the majority of human resources, as well as materials and financing, should be
focused towards increasing coverage and improving the quality of preschool and basic education
until the sixth grade. Specifically, large amounts of resources need to be directed towards those
rural areas in which no education services. currently exist.
2.49  The goals for basic education in 1995-1999 include: (a) increasing preschool enrollment
rates from 24.5 percent in 1993 to 40 percent in 1999 in the rural areas; (b) raising enrollment
rates in the 1st and 2nd cycles from 83 percent in 1993 to 90 percent in 1999; and (c) reducing
overage students in basic education from 29.2 percent in 1993 to 15.3 percent in 1999. MINED
would continue involving the community in the provision of basic education services,

15 Ministry of Planning, "Plan de Desarrollo Econ6mico y Social, 1994-1999."
16 Ibid.



16
strengthening and increasing the ability of communities to organize and assume a protagonist role
in the administration of basic education services.
2.50  For secondary education (grades 10-12), the emphasis will be on improving the academic
skills and capabilities of the graduates in order to respond to the dynamic changes of the labor
market. This will be accomplished, in part, by reforming the curriculum to respond to the
requirements of the labor market and the possibility that graduates may continue their studies at
higher levels. For technical education, the participation of the private sector in the administration
of technical institutes will be promoted by supporting a scholarship fund for students with limited
resources. Finally, as the result of curriculum reform and public/private interaction in the
provision of services, higher education should produce highly qualified professionals who will be
able to respond to the conditions of the modern workplace in terms of scientific and technological
investigation. 17
2.51   The strategy for education is part of a larger Public Sector Modernization Action Plan
which will be implemented with the technical and financial support of the IEBRD, IDB and other
donors through a proposed Public Sector Modernization Project (see Annex 5). Central to the
Government's strategy for education are the processes of decentralization and modernization,
which include the provision of selected education services through the private sector. To support
the education reform, both in academnic content and the provision of education services, the
Government set up the National Commission for Education, Science, and Development composed
of members of NGOs and other private organizations, universities and teacher unions (see para.
2.42).
2.52  Since 1989, priority in the education sector has been given to both preschool and basic
education with emphasis on expanding coverage to rural areas through an innovative program
based on direct involvement of parents and community groups, the Community-managed Schools
Program (Educaci6n con Participaci6n de la Comunidad - EDUCO) (see para. 2.4). In addition
to sectoral policies to address problems of access in the education system, MINED also instituted
several programs to enhance the quality of basic education. Several of these programs were
supported by the USAID-financed SABE Project. Under this project, curricula in basic education
were redesigned up to the fourth grade. New curricular contents were established based on a
diagnosis of needs, interests and problems, and were validated in more than 100 schools
throughout the country. To support the new basic education study programs, textbooks and
workbooks were prepared, and 1.5 million were distributed to students in grades I through 3.
Training programs for teachers, school directors, and supervisors were intensified in the areas of
teaching methods as well as in education evaluation and administration.
2.53  The Government's EDUCO strategy to increase education opportunities in rural areas has
proven to be a good instrument for targeting education services to the poor and increasing access
and quality to preschool and grades I to 3. It helped expand preschool enrollment from 2 percent
of the rural preschool population to 10 percent between 1989 and 1993. The enrollment of
children in the first three grades of basic education increased 6.4 percent between 1989 and 1993.
Despite the lower average socio-economic status of EDUCO students compared with students in
" Ibid.

traditional schools, EDUCO students performed on a level comparable with students in traditional
schools (rural and urban), and in some cases better.

2.54 While the overall cost of the EDUCO program appears to be slightly higher than the cost of
the traditional program overall, the benefits of the program seem to more than offset the higher
cost involved. These benefits include providing of basic education in areas which did not
previously receive education, community involvement in providing basic education services, and
better control over teacher attendance and performance. EDUCO has also contributed to
improved dialogue between communities and MINED, and between MINED and the international
agencies and NGOs that support program implementation.
2.55 Nevertheless, despite the Government's recent efforts, the education system still faces
severe problems of access in rural areas and low internal efficiency. Because of problems of
internal efficiency related to repetition, on average, 10 years of instruction are required to produce
a 6th grade graduate.18 Without considering the high incidence of dropping out between the 2nd
and 3rd cycles (on average for 5.4 years), four years of instruction are needed to complete the 3rd
cycle.
2.56  The proposed project will play an important role in supporting the Government strategy to
improve equity, quality and efficiency of the school system. It will: (a) increase investments in
basic education, thus helping to accumulate human capital, the lack of which is a serious
constraint to growth; (b) address the needs of the poor, and contribute to a more equitable
distribution of basic social services, thereby alleviating poverty; (c) improve the efficiency of using
the scarce public resources through measures to strengthen MINED's institutional capacity.
Additionally, the project will contribute to lowering the education flow wastage and repetition and
dropout rates by improving the quality of the services through better qualified teachers, improved
availability of instructional materials, -an updated curriculum, a more effective learning
environment, and direct involvement of parents, teachers and the community in the management
of the schools. Decentralization and community participation will boost responsiveness by
teachers and administrators since all will be sharing administrative responsibilities, and
transparency will promote accountability at all levels. Furthermore, the proposed project will
support the Public Sector Modernization Program by establishing the conditions for MINED to be
an active and responsive actor in the process, while being consistent with the general guidelines of
the Government's strategy for the public sector.

D. World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank Roles and Assistance Strategy
2.57  The IBRD's country assistance strategy (CAS) for El Salvador, discussed by the Board on
September 14, 1993 with the Second Structural Adjustment Loan Project, focuses on supporting
the Government in meeting its critical development challenges and facilitating the transition from
a wartime economy to a peaceful, more participatory society. The IBRD's strategy is to support
the Government in meeting its four principal development challenges - modernizing the public
sector, enabling private sector-led growth, reducing poverty and investing in human capital, and
strengthening natural resource and environmental management - through a blend of adjustment
lending, investment lending in selected sectors, analytical work to address sectoral issues and
guide the policy dialogue, technical assistance to deepen reforms and strengthen institutions, and
donor coordination.'9 The Structural Adjustment Loans (SAL I, IBRD Loan 3293-ES, 1991;
SAL II, IBRD Loan 3646-ES, 1993), the Technical Assistance Loan (TAL, IBRD Loan 3648-ES,
1993), and the on-going SSRP (IBRD Loan 3348-ES, 1991) have been supporting Government
economic reforms and the social sector strategy by emphasizing the provision of targeted
preschool and basic education which directly benefit the poor. The proposed project would be a
key instrument for supporting the efforts of the Government to implement public sector reforms
and to continue government strategies for decentralization and community participation in the
basic education system which were supported by IBRD under the SSRP.
2.58  The proposed project is also in line with the IDB country strategy which was discussed
during a programming mission with the Government in August 1994. This strategy, which covers
1994-1996, was defined in the Country Programming Paper of March 1993. Its objectives
include: (a) improving social and economic infrastructure; (b) supporting economic reforms; (c)
increasing IDB support to the social services; (d) protecting the environment; (e) supporting the
modernization of the State; and (f) strengthening the participation of communities and women in
the national reconstruction process.
E. Lessons Learned from Past Experience
2.59  The IBRD has financed four previous education projects in El Salvador. Three of these
projects (First Education Project, Loan 609-ES, 1969; Second Education Project, Loan 1007-ES,
1974; and Industrial and Agricultural Training Project, Loan 1571-ES, 1978) covered such areas
as: (a) improving the secondary school system; (b) establishing rural basic education schools; (c)
improving the teacher training college; (d) testing a national non-formal adult training program;
and (e) creating a network of non-formal training centers for agricultural and industrial workers.
The SSRP (see para. 1.3 ), funded in 1991, supported the development of EDUCO which included
improvements in the delivery and the quality of basic education services in rural areas, and tested
a decentralized education system based on community management of service delivery.
2.60 The IDB has financed nine education projects in El Salvador since 1962 (Annex 17).
These loans have covered such areas as: (a) improvement of general education and basic sciences;

Development to the Executive Directors on a Proposed Second Structural Adjustment Loan of US$50 million

19
(b) expansion and improvement of academic and physical infrastructures; (c) studies of the supply
and demand of human resources in secondary and higher education; (d) programs to combat
illiteracy and provide adult education; and (e) studies of non-university technical education. Prior
to the proposed project, IDB's involvement in the finance of basic education in El Salvador has
been minor.
2.61  Implementation experience and the impact of the education component of the SSRP was
reviewed in 1994 and lessons learned from the project have been incorporated in a sector report,
'El Salvador Community Education Strategy: Decentralized School Management" (Report No.
13502-ES, December 8, 1994). Among other lessons, three should be highlighted. First, the
EDUCO model, with its strong community participation, offers education services at a reasonable
cost to some of the lowest income groups in rural areas, and provides efficient management of
those services. Despite the lower socio-economic status of EDUCO students20, their achievement
results are comparable to students in traditional (urban and rural) schools. Although overall costs
of the EDUCO schools are similar to those of traditional schools, the benefits of the program
appear to be much higher. These benefits include bringing education to areas which did not
previously receive these services, community involvement in providing education services, and
better control over teacher attendance and performance. EDUCO also established channels for
better communication between communities and N4INED.  The proposed project continues
supporting the participation of the community by expanding the EDUCO model in rural areas
which are currently without services. Second, although the Ministry of Coordination of Economic
and Social Development2' (Ministerio de Coordinaci6n del Desarrollo Economico y Social -
MICDES) Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) had an important role in implementing the project
and acquired project implementation expertise, this expertise was not fully transferred to the
executing agencies. To guarantee a high level of project implementation, the managerial capacity
must be reinforced, not only at the PCU level, but also within the executing agencies involved in
project operation. Thus, project management for the proposed project has been established as an
integral part of the MINED, with staff drawn from the operational units that prepared the project.
In addition, a staff development program to improve, in a timely and coordinated way, the skills
of administrators, technical/administrative and pedagogical personnel required by the institutional
development process will be implemented. Third, the education loans in the 1970s experienced
significant implementation delays arising from shortage of counterpart funds. The SSRP took this
into account in its design. Annual implementation targets were included in the Government's
budget proposal presented to the Assembly to avoid shortages of counterpart funds, and
consequently funds were made available at the onset. Also building upon lessons from the SSRP,
a revolving fund (see para. 4.9), operated by MINED's Office of International Cooperation
Projects (Oficina de Proyectos de Cooperaci6n Internacional - OPCI), would be opened in the
name of the project.
2.62  The EDUCO program has also provided valuable experience that has been incorporated
into the project including: (a) the effectiveness of incentives to improve teacher performance; (b)
the positive impact of classroom libraries in complementing teacher strategies and in stimulating
20 EDUCO schools are in some of the lowest income areas of El Salvador, where factors such as health, nutrition,
and the need for child labor weigh in heavily against school performance.
21 Formerly the Ministry of Planning and Coordination of Economic and Social Development (Ministerio de
Planificacion y Coordinaci6n del Desarrollo Econ6mico y Social - MIPLAN).



20
student interests and reading habits; and (c) the importance of having learning materials that
complement textbooks to stimulate more active learning in school.
2.63  Feedback from other education projects in Latin America indicates that a proper policy
framework and adequate institutional capacity are major factors in determining the success of
project implementation. The proposed project focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of
basic education on the basis of (a) a clearly stated government policy framework; and (b)
improvement of the institutional capacity of MINED at the central and departmental levels. Other
specific lessons learned from basic education projects in Latin America which have been
incorporated in the design of the proposed project include: (a) increasing education expenditures,
especially those targeted to the poorest regions; (b) promoting adequate nutrition and health
practices; (c) developing an integrated, inter-disciplinary curriculum that can be adapted to the
needs of the urban and rural sectors; and (d) the need to keep the public informed and involved in
the changes being contemplated by the Ministry.
2.64  Decentralization experiences in Latin America have pointed out some key elements that
have to be present to ensure that decentralized units of government, are capable of absorbing new
responsibilities and implementing them effectively. "Successful decentralization requires: (i) full
political commitment from national, regional, provincial, municipal, and local leaders; (ii) a model
addressing the issue of which educational functions and responsibilities could be more efficiently
and effectively delivered at the central level, smaller decentralized government units, and/or the
private sector, and explicitly defining the degree of accountability of the different participants; (iii)
an implementation strategy and a timetable; (iv) clear operational manuals and procedures; (v)
continuous training for the skill levels to be performed at the central and decentralized units of
government; (vi) relevant performance indicators to be continuously monitored; and (vii)
adequate financial, human, and physical resources to sustain the process. 2
2.65  The decentralization process that is supported by the proposed project (para. 3.28(a)) has
been designed with the full support of the Government and through an active communication
campaign that has already created a sense of ownership within the education community. The
process will be guided by a prototype that defines functions at all levels in a systematic way and
its implementation will be sustained by the development of an MIS, and will be implemented
gradually using pilot experiences that will allow for the introduction of corrective measures in a
timely basis. The process will also be accompanied by a comprehensive training program at all
levels.
3. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Scope
3.1   The proposed project will promote greater equity, quality, and efficiency in the provision
of education services by: (a) improving access to education; (b) improving education quality in
22 Prawda, J. 1992. 'Educational Decentralization in Latin America, Lessons Learned." A View from LATHR,
No. 27, Human Resources Division, Technical Department, Latin America and the Caribbean Region, World
Bank.



21
both academic achievement (output) and learning environment (education inputs); and (c)
strengthening the managerial, financial and administrative capacity of MINED to set policies and
guidelines for the sector and deliver public education services.
3.2   Greater equity will be achieved by increasing coverage to include approximately 32,000
preschool age children and 64,000 basic education students who do not currently attend school.
Increasing the quality of education services, and thereby increasing the educational attainment for
many who do attend school (approximately 800,000 children) will be made through provision of
training and education materials. Training will be provided to approximately 26,300 teachers,
13,000 community members and 23,000 parents (see para. 3.20). Textbooks will be produced
and distributed to students in public schools to provide for a better learning environment.
Improved efficiency will be reflected in a reduction of repetition rates, an increase in the
completion rate, an improvement in the net enrollment rate and increased relevance of the
curriculum. These improvements in pupil and school performance will be achieved by improving
the quantity, quality and management of learning resources and improving the planning,
administration and management of the national education system.
B. Project Target Areas
3.3   The proposed project will continue the Government's efforts to increase education service
delivery, especially in rural areas. Several interventions will be targeted to the 135 municipios
(out of 262 total municipios) with the lowest levels of social services (see Annex 6). The targeted
activities are comprised of: (a) expansion of preschool and basic education; and (b) increasing the
learning capacity of children through improvements in health and nutrition. The remainder of the
project activities will be implemented nationwide.
C. Project Components
3.4   The project has been organized into three major components as follows:
(a)   Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education (US$12.5 million
(including contingencies) or 16 percent of total project costs) in 135 target
municipios to provide for: (i) supporting the expansion of EDUCO to regions
which currently do not have preschool or basic education services, including
rehabilitating the school infrastructure and providing school furniture in rural
schools not supported by the Social Investment Fund; and (ii) technical assistance
for strengthening the EDUCO model.
(b)   Improvement in Education Quality (US$49.2 million (including contingencies)
or 61 percent of total costs) would contain activities that impact the quality of
preschool and basic education in the country as a whole, including: (i) technical
assistance for supporting curriculum development activities for preschool and basic
education, designing a new student promotion system, and establishing multigrade
classes in schools in rural areas; (ii) educational materials, such as textbooks,
didactic materials, and classroom and school libraries; (iii) training and assistance



22
to upgrade the skills of preschool and basic education teachers, principals and
supervisors, and preparing studies to improve pre-service teacher training; and (iv)
developing an education assessment system. The component would also include
activities to develop a school health and nutrition program targeted to the 135
poorest municipios as defined by having the lowest levels of social services.
(c)   Institutional Modernization and Strengthening (US$13.3 million (including
contingencies) or 17 percent of total costs) to provide for: (i) technical assistance
for a review of MINED's legal and organizational framework to increase system
efficiency, to increase the coverage and improve the quality of education services,
to implement institutional reforms in the areas of management of human and
financial resources, planning, information, evaluation, monitoring, supervision and
communication systems, and to establish a staff development program to improve
the capacity of administrators and technical personnel; and (ii) establishing a
funding mechanism, the Pilot Basic Education Fund Program, to test alternative
methods of providing preschool and basic education through, for example, such
organizational entities as the municipios, NGOs or other non-profit private
organizations, and to experiment with pedagogical and administrative innovations.
This component will have an effect that will extend throughout the education sector
and the country.
D. Project Description
(1) Component 1 - Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education (US$12.5 million
or 16 percent of total costs).
3.5   This component will increase access to preschool and basic education in rural areas by: (a)
expanding the number of community-managed schools (Educaci6n con Participaci6n de la
Comunidad - EDUCO) in rural areas; and (b) strengthening EDUCO through the support of
NGOs or other private organizations.
3.6   Subcomponent (l.a) Expansion of preschool and basic education in the rural areas
(US$6.0 million). The EDUCO program has contributed to improving access and raising the
quality of education in rural areas.23 Based on its promising results, and following a gradual
process, MINED intends to provide education coverage in rural areas under the EDUCO model.
MINED will start the process by: (a) establishing approximately 3,000 new EDUCO sections in
the poorest municipios which currently have deficits in preschool and basic education services24;
and (b) gradually replacing approximately 3,000 traditional school sections with the EDUCO
model.
3.7   The creation of new sections, that will cover preschool through grade 625, will be financed
with funds from the ordinary budget26 of MINED and FIS funds. The teacher cost of increased

23
coverage will be fully covered by the ordinary budget of MINED. The construction of classrooms
with community participation will be undertaken as a regular operation of FIS and will be
financed by FIS. The microplanning/microlocation survey (see para. 2.19) will be used as the
basis for approving school infrastructure. The proposed project will also provide funds for the
development and promotion of the ACEs that will manage the new preschool and basic education
sections. An agreement (convenio) with FIS to guarantee the timely construction of new
classrooms was presented at the negotiations (para. 7.2(a)). The estimated timetable for creating
new sections is presented in Table 4.

Notes: There were 1,311 EDUCO sections and 14,602 traditional preschool, 1st and 2nd
cycle sections in 1993.
All EDUCO sections are managed under the EDUCO system.
3.8   The gradual transformation of rural traditional schools to the EDUCO model will not
represent additional recurrent costs because in these cases, traditional schools are already
operating. Nevertheless, finance for rehabilitation of school is required and will be financed by the
proposed project. To transform the rural school system into community-managed schools, three
methods will be used: (a) as traditional school teachers retire, transfer or resign, they will be
replaced by EDUCO teachers; (b) single-teacher schools will be transformed into EDUCO
sections; and (c) any new school and/or section in rural areas will use the EDUCO model. The
proposed project will also support the rehabilitation of the schools. MINED will hire the services
of FIS to manage the rehabilitation of infrastructure. The estimated timetable for transforming
traditional sections into EDUCO is presented in Table 5.

3.9   At the end of the project it is expected that the provision of education in rural areas will be
provided by approximately 9,400 EDUCO sections and approximately 11,500 traditional sections.
This subcomponent will provide: (a) technical assistance to complete the microplanning exercise
initiated under the SSRP undertaken in 50 percent of all schools in the country; and (b) funds to
rehabilitate schools and infrastructure, and purchase and distribute school furniture in EDUCO
schools to complement current FIS funds for infrastructure in the rural areas (see Annex 7).
Maintenance of the schools will be provided under the current MINED maintenance program
26 El Salvador's annual budget is divided into two broad categories: ordinary and extraordinary. The former
category is comprised of funds from domestic sources; the latter is comprised of funds from bilateral and
multilateral agencies and other external donors (see also para. 2.45).



24
which was developed under SSRP. The promotion of the ACEs will be financed under the
Strengthening of EDUCO Program. As a condition for IDB for the disbursement of this
subcomponent, MINED will present assurances of the continuance of the school maintenance
program for rehabilitated schools (para. 7. 7(a)).
3.10 Subcomponent (l.b) Strengthening the EDUCO program (US$6.5 million). This
component will focus on strengthening the administrative capacity of the ACEs and parent
participation in the EDUCO program with the support of NGOs or other private organizations.
Pilot experiences with the participation of NGOs have demonstrated the sound contribution that
those organizations can add to the communities, mainly in terms of improving ACE member
management skills and parent participation in the program. Based on these pilot examples, the
project will assist the Ministry in improving the participation of selected NGOs or other private
organizations operating in the sector, building on their strengths to support community
development programs, facilitate local resource mobilization, and to promote local participation in
the socioeconomic development process.
3.11  The strategy to be developed by the component includes: (a) the selection, on an
experimental basis, of ACEs to participate in administering supplementary community services
(e.g. school-based health and nutrition programs) in addition to administering education services;
and (b) strengthening of training programs for parents. The subcomponent will provide: (a)
technical assistance and consultant services to develop an inventory of NGOs or other private
organizations to be selected for supporting the ACEs, and to establish a system to monitor NGO
or private organization performance; (b) financial resources for NGOs or private organizations to
help with the organization, training, and monitoring of ACE activities (see Annex 7); (c) training
programs for teachers and supervisors in community-related matters; (d) preparation and printing
of training materials; (e) guidelines for the operation of the ACEs; and (f) resources for devising
ways of launching, supporting, documenting, and disseminating information about the experience
gained (see Annex 7).
(2) Component 2 - Improvement in Education Quality (US$49.2 million or 61 percent of
total cost)
3.12  This component would include measures to complement actions already initiated under the
SABE Project and to develop new activities for improving the quality of education services. The
component consists of the following interrelated parts: (a) curriculum design and development,
including pilot multigrade classes; (@) design, production and distribution of textbooks,
learning/teaching materials, school equipment, and school library books; (c) development of in-
service training programs for preschool and basic education teachers, principals and supervisors,
and a pre-service teacher training assessment study; (d) establishment of a permanent education
assessment system; and (e) development of a school-based health and nutrition program.
3.13 Subcomponent (2.a) Curriculum development (US$1.4 million). The curriculum
development subcomponent is aimed at providing programs of study that are more relevant and
flexible to meet the needs of the school population, especially in rural areas. The subcomponent
will complement curriculum activities initiated by the SABE Project (see Annex 8). These
activities would involve: (a) adapting learning objectives and content for core curriculum modules



25
at the preschool level in rural areas; (b) reviewing the curriculum for the 3rd cycle of basic
education (grades 7 to 9) to complement the one designed for the 1st and 2nd cycles; (c)
developing a multigrade pilot program in EDUCO schools; and (d) establishing a new student
promotion system. Over the life of the project, the subcomponent will provide: (a) technical
assistance for studies of curriculum and student promotion; (b) production and distribution of
approximately 26,000 curriculum guides for the 3rd cycle of basic education, and 31,000
curricular guides for the rural schools; and (c) production of materials for multigrade classrooms.
3.14. Subcomponent (2.b) Textbooks and instructional materials (US$32.5 million).
Recent evaluation in the country links the low level of student attainment at all levels and
modalities of education in the country to the lack of education materials.27 The proposed project
would continue to support the current Government's effort in providing textbooks. This includes
revision of gender content, adaptation to the new curriculum, and adjustment to rural student
characteristics. This subcomponent is aimed at improving the quality of learning, increasing
school attendance, reducing student dropout and repetition rates, and raising the academic
achievement level of students. This would be accomplished through the provision of: (a) technical
assistance for the development of student and teacher guides, and modular textbooks for grades 7
to 9, the selection of school and classroom library books, and the design of cost recovery studies;
(b) textbooks and instructional materials; (c) complementary classroom supplies for selected
preschool and basic schools; (d) school libraries for preschool and basic schools, and small
classroom libraries for EDUCO classes; (e) support for the development of a sustainable textbook
and education materials production and distribution system; and (f) financing for office equipment,
costs of transporting textbooks and instructional materials, and operating costs.
3.15   The MINED plan calls for the production and distribution of approximately 3,500,000
books over the next five years.28 The textbooks will be provided following the strategy used by
the SABE Project by which textbooks are prepared by national or/and international specialists,
and printed by the private sector. The project will provide: (a) two instructional booklets
designed to include multiple units for preschool students; (b) four textbooks (in the areas of
Spanish, mathematics, natural sciences and social studies) for grades 1 through 9; (c) modular
student instructional guides, to foster auto-instructional use by students in grades I to 6 in urban
areas and in the multigrade classes in rural areas; (d) books for a total of about 3,400 school
libraries to preschool and basic education schools in urban and rural areas; (e) 2,000 classroom
libraries to preschool and basic education EDUCO schools; and (f) 200 laboratory kits will be
produced for 3rd cycle schools. Each school library will have 2 copies of about 100 titles plus
reference books, and each classroom library will be made up of 2 copies of about 20 titles plus
reference books. A package of instructional materials (canasta basica) will also be distributed
annually to all preschool and basic schools in urban and rural areas.29 Two strategies will be used
for the provision of the basic instructional materials: (a) distribution of the canasta basica for
urban schools; and (b) provision of funds (district and school fund) to schools to purchase
instructional materials. The first strategy is designed to benefit from economy of scale in the
purchase of the instructional materials; the second, to test the cost-effectiveness of purchasing and
27 EDUCO Study, op. cit.
28 The provision of books will be complementary to SABE's provision of textbooks. Approximately every student
will receive, on average, one new textbook per year.
29 The canasta bMsica will include items such as pencils, non-durable materials such as exercise books, education
toys, paper, pens, markers, scissors, rulers, etc., and will also be used to distribute nutritional supplements.



26
distributing instructional materials through the ACEs for the rural schools or school committees
for selected urban schools. For the distribution of textbooks and the canasta basica to urban
schools not included in the pilot district and school fund program, MINED will use the
distribution system established under SSRP which involved the contracting of private
transportation firms to carry pre-packaged textbooks and instructional materials from the central
warehouses to the departments, and from the departments to the districts. The distribution plan
ensures that the instructional materials will arrive at schools before the beginning of each school
year and new textbooks will arrive before the usable life of existing textbooks expires.
3.16   Subcomponent (2.c) In-service teacher training system (US$10.8 million). Currently,
with the support of the SABE Project, several in-service teacher training activities have been
developed to support curriculum implementation. MINED developed 90 schools as Education
Training Centers (Centros Educativos de Capacitaci6n - CECs) to act as in-service training units
or resource centers on an experimental basis. The impact of these activities has been limited due
to the lack of pre-service training programs for basic education teachers, and a lack of a
systematic approach to improve the quality of the teacher training programs. The project will
support an integrated/decentralized training system, to consist of gradually phasing in three
Teacher Training Centers (Centros de Capacitaci6n de Maestros - CCMs) into existing
educational facilities, and transforming the CECs into Model Schools for Education Development
(Escuelas Modelos de Desarrollo Educativo - EMDEs) which will function as in-service training
and pedagogical resource centers.
3.17  In addition, MINED will conduct assessment studies of the teacher pre-service training
program developed by private/public institutions to address policy options to improve the quality
and efficiency of these programs.
3.18  The project will support technical assistance and training activities. Technical assistance
will be provided for: (a) the design of plans and programs for in-service teacher training
programs; (b) the design of a systematic assessment system to identify in-service training needs
for preschool, and basic education levels; (c) the production of training modules and evaluation of
outcomes; and (d) the development of an assessment study of the pre-service training needs for
basic education and preschool teachers. Training will be developed as: (a) seminars for teachers
working in the EMDEs (80 hours); (b) programs offering specialized courses for: (i) preschool
teachers (80 hours), (ii) basic education teachers (grades I to 9) (80 hours), (iii) EDUCO
multigrade teachers (120 hours), (iv) school principals (80 hours), and (v) supervisors (120
hours); and (c) follow-up teacher training at the EMDEs through 12 workshops per year,
supported by the district supervisors. The training of supervisors will be linked with a more
pedagogical role of supervision (see para. 3.28(d)).3° The project will also provide: (a) funds for
contracting out selected content/pedagogical training programs to universities or research centers;
(b) furniture, equipment and rehabilitation of facilities to be used as the CCMs and the EMIDEs;
and (c) specialized training libraries at the EMDEs.
3.19 The National Directorate of Education (Direcci6n Nacional de Educaci6n - DNE) will be
responsible for establishing national teacher training guidelines. Training activities will be carried
out by the CCMs which will be responsible for: (a) developing teacher training programs for
30 Hours of training are the numnber of training hours per teacher per year.



27
preschool and basic education teachers; (b) supporting the in-service teacher training programs to
be implemented by the EMDEs; (c) preparing teacher training instructional materials, and pilot
training prograns; (d) contracting out content/pedagogical training programs to universities and
other private institutions; and (e) monitoring teacher training programs.   The training
professionals, currently working at the regional departments of education (about 12 in each of
the regional training units), will form the basic staff of the CCMs. To allow full participation of
trainees and minimize travel time and costs, training will be decentralized primarily to the 238
local schools (EMDEs) selected to function as in-service teacher training and resource centers
which will be responsible for implementing the in-service training programs with the support of
teacher trainers prepared by the CCMs. Additionally, teachers trained under the USAID-
supported Basic Education Leadership Training Program (Capacitaci6n de Lideres de Educaci6n
Bdsica - Becas CAPS) will be assigned to each of the schools in the network to function as
animators of the in-service teacher training activities.
3.20  Beneficiaries of the training program will be all the public preschools (approximately
2,300 teachers), basic education schools (approximately 24,000 basic education teachers in grades
1 to 9 and approximately 2,150 teachers working in the EMIDEs), approximately 6,500 school
principals, and approximately 250 supervisors.31 Over the life of the project, each public school
teacher, including EDUCO teachers, will receive an estimated 420 hours of additional training
both at the CCMs and in the EMDEs.
3.21   Subcomponent (2.d) Education assessment system (US$3.0 million). Under the SABE
project, MINED began using achievement tests to assess the impact of the new core curriculum
for grades 1 to 6. With the assistance of a local university/research center, MINED Curriculum
Directorate staff will continue developing this system  on a nationwide basis.  The local
university/research center will be selected no later than January 30, 1996 (para. 7.3(a)). The
system of external evaluation will test, each year, a nationally representative sample of those
students finishing each cycle of the basic education system (grades 3, 6 and 9) on Spanish and
mathematics. Additionally, readiness tests will be administered at the beginning of first grade and
at the end of third grade. To cover the whole learning evaluation process, a survey on the impact
of associated factors that might impact the learning process will be applied to the sample of
schools selected. Three major criteria would be considered in the sample selection: (a) type and
size of school according to official typification; (b) source of funding (public, private and
public/private); and (c) geographic area (department, rural, urban and urban-marginal areas).
3.22  Considering the lack of experience in the country in carrying out achievement tests on a
permanent basis, this subcomponent would provide: (a) technical assistance for: (i) further
developing the existing system, including the preparation of tests, and implementing it in a sample
of schools on a nationwide level, and (ii) designing of training programs for the development of
technical skills for both the local university/research center staff and MINED staff members
responsible for the coordination of the evaluation assessment system; (b) funding for equipment,
office furniture and operating costs for an external evaluation unit (university/research center); (c)
the production and implementation of a sample of language and mathematics achievement tests,
and a survey to determine the impact of selected associated factors to the learning process for
grades not covered by the SABE Project; and (d) supplies, materials and computer services. The
31 Some teachers will receive training in more than one modality.



28
pedagogical evaluation will be complemented with management evaluation and pilot exercises
(see para. 3.28(c)).
3.23  Subcomponent (2.e) School health and nutrition program (US$1.5 million). The
objective of this sub-component is to improve the quality of education by increasing the learning
capacity of children via improvements in health and nutrition. The component will support
interventions and activities to: (a) increase knowledge and change practices related to nutrition
and health in the school community; (b) prevent and treat significant nutrition and health problems
of school-aged children; and (c) evaluate the on-going school feeding program while identifying
and testing alternative school feeding models for the municipios with the most poverty.
3.24  The school nutrition and health measures will be built on the activities developed by MOH
and MINED in the 78 targeted municipios under the SSRP. The proposed component will
continue and improve upon these activities and expand them to 135 targeted municipios (see
Annex 6). The specific measures include: (a) incorporating nutrition and health education into the
formal curriculum, as well as developing and implementing non-formal approaches to health and
nutrition education; (b) providing vitamin A and iodine supplements, and anthelminthic treatment
through the schools to 400,000 children in the first two years of the project; (c) identifying
visually and hearing impaired children and taking remedial action; (d) implementing a pilot test of
providing school-based iron supplementation; and (e) developing alternative school feeding
program mechanisms to overcome logistical and other difficulties in on-going programs.
3.25 The subcomponent will be implemented in close coordination with MOH and the National
Secretariat of the Family (Secretaria Nacional de la Familia - SNF) which is in charge of food
programs.32 A coordinating mechanism will also be established between MINED, MOH, and
NGOs or other private organizations for supporting sub-component implementation, mainly in the
rural areas through the canasta basica. Prior to the negotiations, MINED provided the draft
technical agreement model and coordinating mechanisms between MINED, SNF, and MOH to
implement this subcomponent.
(3) Component 3 - Institutional Modernization and Strengthening (US$13.3 million or 17
percent of total costs)
3.26 The main objective of the institutional modernization component is to carry out institutional
modernization and strengthening of the education sector.  The policies and activities of this
component will be consistent with the reforms in other sectors as part of the Government's Public
Sector Modernization Action Plan which will be implemented with the technical and financial
support of the IBRD, IDB and other donors through a proposed Public Sector Modernization
project (see Annex 5). As presented in the Social Assessment (Annex 4), the participation of
stakeholders will be critical to develop a sense of ownership that will be the base on which the
reform would be successfully built. Seminars with representatives of the different stakeholders
have been one of MlNED's strategies to build up consensus for the reform. Advancement of the
overall public sector reform and results of the report of the High Level Commission for
Education, Science and Development (para. 2.42) may cause changes that will have to be
incorporated during project implementation.
32 The SNF wiUl pay for the school food program.



29
3.27  Subcomponent (3.a) Modernization of MINED (US$11.4 million). This subcomponent
will address the changes needed in MINED by: (a) designing a new organizational structure for
MINED and revising the legal framework of the education sector to support education activities
at the school and community levels; (b) implementing the new MINED organization structure,
including improving MINED management mechanisms in the areas of planning, information,
communication, evaluation and monitoring systems and the introduction of a more sound
incentive system; (c) revising the performance incentive system for teachers, principals,
supervisors, and technical staff, (d) improving the supervision system; and (e) establishing a staff
development program to improve the technical capabilities of managers, technical/pedagogical,
and administrative staff to support improvements in the provision of education services. Under
this subcomponent, the project will provide: (a) technical assistance and consultant services for:
(i) reviewing MINED's legal and organization structure; and (ii) completing the design and
implementing the planning, information, communication, evaluation, and monitoring systems; (b)
funds to carry out staff development activities; (c) a review of the incentive structure for teachers
and technical staff, (d) public campaigns and communication activities, including annually updated
communication strategies and their use by the media; and (e) operating costs for developing the
decentralized activities, and equipment, materials and supplies.
3.28  The implementation of actions to foster policy development and changes on a long-term
basis will be based on the review of MINED's organizational structure and legal framework. The
institutional reforms to be carried out by a national technical group would be supported by
technical assistance and training provided under the project. The main activities planned include
(see Annex 9 for more detail):
(a)   Reorganization of MINED  structure, and decentralization of education
activities. Education services will be decentralized to the department/district and
school levels with the elimination of the current regional organization. MINED's
role under the new organization will consist of providing general direction, setting
goals and priorities, establishing quality standards and pedagogicaVadministrative
legal norms and regulations, and evaluating the public and private education
system. Its major activities will be: (i) the definition of policies, education goals
and program objectives; (ii) the definition of targets, budget and staff posts for
each department/district and school; (iii) establishing basic curriculum content, and
quality standards for teacher training programs, textbooks, instructional materials
and assessment of learning achievements; (iv) undertaking systematic evaluation of
student learning achievement and impact evaluation of education programs; (v)
determining physical investments; (vi) defining standards for recruitment of both
teachers and administrative staff, and establishing career planning services and
incentive systems for both teachers and administrative staff, (vii) the control of
cash flows, and accounting and budgeting at the national level; (viii) procurement
activities, when justified by economies of scale, distribution costs, and timeliness of
delivery; and (ix) monitoring of departmental activities.  The Departments,
organized as small and responsive offices, will be responsible for administering the
human, physical and financial resources at their level and for coordinating district
supervision activities.  The Supervision districts will be responsible for
coordinating activities and processes between the schools and the department in



30
terms of teachers, textbooks, school materials, school meal programs, collecting
information on public and private schools within their jurisdiction, and providing
technical assistance to schools and teachers for solving administrative and
pedagogical problems, the latter with the support of the EMDEs. The schools
would be able to: (i) provide quality education services; (ii) prepare their school
education plans (Plan Educativo Escolar - PEE); (iii) administer their financial and
material resources; (iv) select qualified teachers; (v) generate data and indicators
regarding the results of their operation (e.g. data on promotion, repetition,
desertion and coverage33); and (vi) administer funds for small purchases.
(b)   Teacher and technical staff performance incentive system. To increase the
effectiveness of the MINED reorganization, it is necessary to combine it with a
structure of incentives promoting excellence. In order to foster the establishment
of an adequate structure of incentives for all MINED personnel, the proposed
project will provide technical assistance and consultant services to: (a) revise the
Escalaf6n Docente for teachers in the traditional system; (b) develop an improved
employment policy for teachers in the EDUCO system; (c) revise the salary
structure for technical staff within the new organization of the Civil Service
System to be defined under the Public Sector Modernization project; and (d)
define new job descriptions. The program will also provide funds to foster the
implementation of the rationalization of personnel under the structure of MINED.
(c)    Planning, management information, and evaluation systems will be improved
through provision of technical assistance, equipment and software to: (i) expand
the education statistics database to all levels of education; (ii) support planning,
budgeting, accounting and evaluation activities; (iii) track the distribution of
educational materials through an inventory of facilities and equipment; (iv) support
human resource activities through an inventory of teachers and administrative staff
(number, professional characteristics, location, vacancies) and student enrollment
information; and (v) conduct joint evaluations with external agencies to measure
the impact of education interventions, including an assessment of secondary
education. Training activities to carry out the planning, evaluation/monitoring and
management information systems will be provided under the staff development
program (see para. 3.28(f)). To be consistent with the GOES program for Public
Sector Modernization, priority will be given to the development of the Human
Resources System (Sistema de Informaci6n de Recursos Humanos - SU"  and
Integrated Financial Management System (Sistema de Administracion Financiera
Integrada - SAFI).
(d)   Supervision.  Supervision activities will be re-oriented in the direction of: (i)
providing technical support to teachers and school principals; (ii) disseminating
results of education program evaluation; and (iii) giving feedback to correct
shortcomings in the education process. Additionally, to increase the professional
capacity of the supervisors, the program seeks to achieve a qualitative change in
their functions by increasing the time employed in monitoring teaching activities
33 For analysis and comparison at the central level.



31
and by reducing their strictly administrative responsibilities.  The supervision
system will be improved through the provision of: (i) technical assistance to review
the supervision system and the incentive system for supervisors working in remote
rural schools; (ii) training programs especially designed for the supervisors; (iii)
per-diem, vehicles, office supplies and equipment for department and district
supervisors; and (iv) assessment of the revised system.
(e)   Communication Program. International experiences with education reform
projects in developing countries show that where insufficient attention was given
to identifying real needs or to mobilizing demand for changes, innovations were
difficult to implement. Using these experiences, MINED has developed a series of
strategies to guarantee education agents' participation in the education reform
process. The social assessment (Annex 4), undertaken during project preparation
to identify major education reform benefits and risks, suggests an action plan of
activities to be developed by MINED to enhance public support for the education
reforms envisioned by the Government. The plan calls for the establishment of an
effective communication strategy as a key tool: (i) to guarantee public support for
the education innovations; and (ii) for the establishment of a communication
system to provide a permanent information channel within MINED, between
MINED and the public and to receive feedback from the sector's stakeholders.
The communication activities, which started during project preparation, will
continue through project implementation to inform and mobilize the participation
of parents, teachers, students, and other stakeholders.  The communication
program will use social research techniques, particularly the 'focus groups"
technique, and mass media publicity, in the design, execution and monitoring of the
program. MI4NED's communication structures will be strengthened to facilitate
the fulfillment of their coordinating and monitoring roles. The project will provide:
(a) technical assistance for: (i) organizing focus groups with different stakeholders;
(ii) monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) design of public campaigns; (b) equipment
and operation costs; and (c) school and public campaigns.
(f)    Staff development program. A review of the international literature shows that
successful education reforms, involving decentralization of tasks, should include
training for both central administrators and local implementors. Technical and
managerial training must be provided not only for those to whom responsibility is
being transferred, but also to central officials who will have to learn how to
support local implementors more effectively. The design and implementation of
the staff development program will follow MINED's reorganization to improve, in
a  timely  and  coordinated  way,  the  skills  of  administrators  and
technical/administrative and pedagogical personnel required by the institutional
development process. The staff development program will be provided through 15
courses, 10 seminars, and 15 scholarships for short courses specializing in
education policy analyses, information, planning, budgeting, education
methodology and human resources management. As a condition for IBRD
disbursements for the modernization component MINED will present the work
plan for the staff development activities (para 7.6(a)).

3.29 Implementation Strategy. The implementation of the new MINED organizational
structure, including new planning, information, supervision and evaluation procedures, will be
tested initially in three departments, which will serve as prototypes of the new structure. The
redistribution of functions and roles between levels, across all systems, and the strengthening of
managerial capacity at all levels, will be implemented in their entirety in the pilot departments.
Only after testing and evaluating the pilot experiences will implementation be extended to the
remaining departments. This strategy will allow for the control and simultaneous testing of
project components, particularly the new modalities of delivering education services and the new
functions envisioned by the education reform. The departments of Ahuachapan, Cabanas, and La
Uni6n were selected to participate in the pilot experiment based on the following criteria: (a) their
physical and institutional infrastructures; (b) the existence of a sub-regional structure; (c) the
department's geographical extension; (d) the existence of human resources; and (e) demand for
education services. The preparation, development and evaluation of the pilot decentralization
activities are expected to be carried out in ten months, and the expansion for the new departments
in 15 months (see Annex 9). MINED will establish, under the Modernization Manager's
supervision, a Management Modernization Unit (MMvIU), in charge of managing the
subcomponent. The MMU will be responsible for: (a) implementing the pilots in the selected
departments; (b) promoting and coordinating changes at the central level; (c) selecting staff
responsible for implementing the reform in the departments; (d) coordinating studies to support
the organizational development activities and modernization of the legal framework; and (e)
coordinating MINED's activities with the groups involved in the public sector modernization
project. During negotiations, terms of reference and a schedule for the modernization of
MINED, including key staff at the department level, were agreed (para. 7. I(a)).
3.30 Subcomponent (3.b) Pilot Basic Education Fund Program (US$1.9 million). As part
of the principles of the Education Reform, MINED needs to explore various methods of
delivering education services, in order to improve the quality and efficiency of the public and
private sectors. Innovative methods of combining the public and private sectors in the provision
of education services can eventually be adopted on a broader scale within the modernization of
the education sector but they need to be identified and tested. A pilot fund to develop education
innovations will be set up to support new initiatives in the education reform process. The main
objectives of this fund are to: (a) test alternative methods of providing basic education through
the municipios, NGOs or other non-profit private institutions; (b) establish a more substantial and
incentive-driven financing mechanism for piloting school-oriented interventions to solve particular
administrative and/or learning/teaching problems; (c) make provision for future public education
initiatives in the areas of pedagogical innovations and institutional modernization which cannot be
anticipated or launched immediately; and (d) disseminate the pilot results. Four principles
underlie the design and organization of the Pilot Basic Education Fund Program: (a) ensuring that
education innovation in pedagogical and administrative areas to provide education programs are
designed according to the priority needs of implementing the education reform; (b) ensuring that
funds to increase access and quality of education are used effectively; (c) pursuing efficiency in
the use of human/financial resources in the sector, thus avoiding duplication of effort; and (d)
providing support for the implementation of the reform program and the decentralization process.
3.31  During project implementation, the subcomponent will finance at least four innovative
subprojects that contribute to improving the quality, efficiency, and coverage of preschool and
basic education in the country. The subcomponent will provide: (a) financial resources for



33
identifying and implementing the approved subprojects; (b) support to establish a monitoring
system to follow-up the education interventions financed by the program; (c) support to fully
evaluate all subprojects funded; and (d) assistance to disseminate the results of the evaluations.
By the end of the project, MINED will have developed a funding mechanism to continue
supporting the education innovations piloted during the proposed project that have been evaluated
as being relevant and successful.
3.32  Organization and Administration. The subprojects submitted for financing would be
presented twice a year to a Review Committee which would analyze, rank and recommend
approval of the subprojects according to established criteria.
3.33  Based on the Education Reform Project principles and guidelines, the Minister and Vice
Minister of Education will supervise the Fund. They will be responsible for: (a) establishing the
goals and policies of the Fund; and (b) defining the Fund's classification system based on
considerations such as coverage, quality, efficiency, focus, and cost. The factors for consideration
will reflect the priorities of MINED policies and will be established annually during the Project
Annual Review. The Review Committee will evaluate each one of the proposed pilot subprojects.
This Committee will be formed by five voting members: the Project Coordinator, who will preside
over the Committee, the Manager of OPCI, and the three Project Component Directors. Experts
in subjects related to the specific subproject proposals could be invited when deemed necessary.
Each proposal will be classified and evaluated according to the classification system for that year,
and points will be assigned to each one of the five areas (coverage, quality, efficiency, focus of
objectives, and cost). The subproject with the largest number of total points will be selected. The
'ho objection" of the Banks is a pre-requisite for the final approval of the proposed subproject.
Once a proposal is approved, a technical agreement (convenio) between MINED and the
requestor will be signed whereby the former agrees to disburse the resources approved under the
proposal, and the latter agrees to implement the proposed project. As a disbursement condition
for IDB for this subcomponent, the Operational Manual for the Fund, including the eligibility
criteria, will be agreed with the Banks and put in place by MINED (para. 7.7(b)).
4. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENTS AND
AUDITING
A. Project Costs
4.1   The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies and taxes, is estimated at
about US$80.2 million, of which about US$37.3 million will be foreign exchange. Taxes amount
to about US$4.4 million. Investment costs amount to 91 percent of base costs and incremental
recurrent costs amount to 9 percent of base costs (Annex 11). Project costs were estimated at
July 1995 price levels and include physical contingencies of 10 percent for civil works and 5
percent for equipment, furniture, and didactic materials. Price contingencies were calculated at
1.8 percent for 1995 and 1996, 2.4 percent for 1997, and 2.5 percent annually thereafter. These
rates have been applied to local and foreign costs as well, as periodic currency rate adjustments
would compensate for the difference between projected US dollar inflation and local inflation
rates.



34
4.2     Estimated costs of equipment, furniture, textbooks and didactic materials are based on unit
prices of goods procured recently by MINED. Estimates for technical assistance and studies are
based on current rates for local and foreign experts. Cost estimates for training, salaries and
operating costs are based on current costs or costing standards used by MINED. Estimated
construction and rehabilitation costs of schools and administrative buildings throughout the
country are based on current FIS unit prices that derive from  periodic cost analyses for similar
standards of construction in corresponding facilities.

Note: Interest and financial costs will be paid directly by the El Salvadoran Government.
Incremental Recurrent Costs
4.3     During the implementation period, the project will add an average of about US$1.5 million
per year to the recurrent expenditures budget of MINED. These incremental operating costs would
be generated mainly by salaries for staff at the departmental levels, incremental personnel at the central
level, travel expenditures, and operation and maintenance of infrastructure, equipment, vehicles,
furniture, and office supplies. Over the life of the project incremental recurrent costs generated by
the project are estimated to grow from US$1.1 million in the first project year, to US$1.6 million
in the last year. The recurrent costs would be financed by GOES increasingly during the life of
the project. Recurrent costs under the project, in July 1995 US dollars, are estimated as follows:



35
US Million    1995/96    1996/97     1997/98     1998/99     1999i00
GOES        0.11        0.15        0.62        0.62       1.06
IBRD        0.85        1.07        0.84        0.82       0.45
IDB         0 18       026         0.12        0.11        0.04
TOTAL        1.14        1.48        1.58        1.55    |   1.55
The effect of the recurrent costs on MINED's budget is small and could be easily absorbed by
MINED. Based on MINED's ordinary budget for 1995 (excluding investments) of about
US$184 million, and the projected budget increments equivalent, at least, to the projected annual
growth of GNP (7 percent real for next five years), the impact of those costs on the MINED
ordinary budget would be 0.06 percent, 0.07 percent, 0.27 percent, 0.25 percent, 0.41 percent,
for the successive years of implementation of the project. Savings accruing to MINED from
increased efficiency and reduced repetition waste should amply compensate for higher incremental
recurrent costs.
4.4    The recurrent costs associated with the GOES program to introduce a better incentive
system for teachers including improvements in teacher salaries are not part of the project
recurrent costs. To accomplish the objective of the education reform, the public sector has to
generate revenues and provide them to MINED in order to: (a) cover the incremental recurrent
costs associated with the proposed project investment plans; (b) pay for the enrollment increment
program; (c) improve teacher real salaries; and (d) pay for the expected growth of actual
expenditures that would occur without additional expansion programs. In order to fulfill these
goals, it has been estimated that the education budget will need to reach 2.7 percent of GDP by
the end of the century.34 The Government expects that total revenues will reach 19 percent of
GDP in 1999. If this target is reached, it will not be necessary to raise the share of education
expenditure in the total central Government expenditure. But any figure lower than 19 percent in
total revenues would imply that the efforts on education should be pursued at the cost of other
sectors. The Government has made a clear and public commitment to devote the required funds
to develop an extensive and efficient education sector (Annex 18).
4.5   In addition, teacher salaries associated with the expansion of services to rural areas are not
included in the project costs. The Government's decision to continue to fund all new EDUCO
teachers with funds allocated to MINED reflects its commitment to increase basic education
expenditures. It is estimated that the total MINED contribution for teacher salaries during the
project period for the new EDUCO sections will amount to about US$3.7 million annually.
During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that the required funds for
incremental teacher salaries as established in the annual work plans (para. 5. 10) would be
included in the MINED budgetfor the following year (para. 7.1(b)).
34 If economnic growth is lower than expected (3 percent), increases in the education budget could be as high as 3.3
percent. Nevertheless, under these adverse circumstances it would be expected that growth in all public
expenditure and investment will also slow down.

B. Project Financing
4.6    The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of El
Salvador will finance the project. To allow flexibility and clarity in the choice of cost items to be
financed by each of the external cofinanciers, the proposed financing plan is articulated according
to the project's sub-components. Also, to allow flexibility in the percentages of financing, each
sub-component is divided in investment costs (including civil works, vehicles, equipment,
furniture, didactic materials, technical assistance and training), financed by both Banks at equal
percentages for the same items, and recurrent costs (including incremental salaries, long-term
consultants, travel allowances, operation and maintenance of infrastructure, equipment and
furniture, and operating costs), these items being financed, on a declining basis, by the external
cofinanciers. Table 7 lists the proposed financial arrangements.

a Costs include contingencies. Interest and financial costs are not included.
4.7    Given the project's major emphasis on serving the education needs of the poorest
segments of the population, the Government's contribution to the financing would be reduced to
about 11 percent of total costs, while the share of each of the external cofinanciers would be 42
percent for the IBRD and 47 percent for the IDB. Taxes and duties (approximately US$4.4
million), and a portion of the local costs of recurrent costs would be financed by the Government.
The IBRD Loan of US$34.0 million would finance 38 percent of foreign exchange expenditures,
and 51 percent of local expenditures. The IDB Loan of US$37.3 million would finance 61
percent of foreign expenditures and 37 percent of local expenditures. To ensure timely and
efficient project implementation, some start-up activities, particularly those related to contracting
of technical assistance for the institutional modernization component, are now being undertaken.



37
Retroactive financing of up to US$300,000 would be requested from each Bank to help cover
eligible start-up expenditures.35
4.8    GOES is eligible to receive single currency loans and anticipates borrowing US$115
million from IBRD on a single currency loan basis during FY96, including US$34.0 million for
this project. The loan would be a US dollar single currency loan for 17 years, including 5 years of
grace, at the IBRD's standard LIBOR-based rate for such loans.
4.9   Project Financial Monitoring. MINED's Office of International Cooperation Programs
(Oficina de Programas de Cooperaci6n Internacional - OPCI) would be responsible for
managing and monitoring the project's flow of funds. Though OPCI has had wide experience in
externally-financed projects, a recent survey identified some bottlenecks in the area of accounting,
and a still extensive flow of funds cycle. To remedy this situation, and to enable OPCI to be fully
operational at the project start, the following action plan has been adopted: (a) a joint analysis of
the flow of funds cycle with every entity intervening in this process (mainly the External Financing
Technical Secretariat (SETEFE) and the Corte de Cuentas), to identify steps to be eliminated; (b)
internal reorganization and streamlining of OPCI's present structure, eliminating inefficiencies and
reinforcing identified weak points; (c) preparation of a computerized financial data processing
system, which will allow integration with the future 14 departmental offices (who would
eventually maintain their own accounts) and with SETEFE (to accelerate the disbursement
process); and (d) adoption of cost accounting, ensuring a better monitoring of the accounts and
the flow of funds. This action plan has already been initiated, and all actions to be taken and
investments to be made would be financed through the SSRP. This action plan is expected to be
achieved by the end of December 1995, when it will be assessed by a joint IBRD-IDB mission.
The completion of the OPCI action plan satisfactory to both Banks will be a condition of
effectiveness for IBRD and a condition of disbursement for IDB (paras. 7.4(a), 7.7(c)).
4.10  Revolving Fund in Local Currency. Improvements in the procurement process should
improve the quality of the accounting procedure, but also improve the project's cash flow, by
reducing the flow of funds cycle from the present level of six to seven months to an expected
cycle of three to four months. It is thus necessary to give to the project the necessary liquidity to
operate during the four first months of project activities, before the IBRD Special Account (held
at and managed by the Central Bank) can operate (see para. 4.27). As was accepted at the start
of the SSRP, a Revolving Fund, operated by OPCI, would be opened in the name of the project,
with an initial deposit of about US$2.5 million, from the Government as its up-front participation
to the project financing. The effective creation of this Revolving Fund would be a condition of
IBRD loan effectiveness (see para. 7.4(b)).
C. Procurement36
4.11   The project would include procurement of construction and rehabilitation of school
infrastructure, textbooks and other school library and reference books, manuals and guides for
35 IBRD retroactive financing will cover expenditures made on or after March 15, 1995. IDB retroactive financing
will cover expenditures six months prior to Board Approval.
36 A detailed explanation of the ad hoc procurement procedures will be included in the Loan Agreement between the IDB
and the Government



38
teachers and students, educational materials, school furniture and other furniture, vehicles, and
consulting services for studies. Procurement of civil works, goods and services would follow the
procurement procedures agreed with each Bank. The procedures of both Banks are similar, but
not identical. An effort was made to establish similar limits to facilitate MINED's management of
procurement processes. Procurement for IBRD-financed contracts would be carried out in
accordance with guidelines for procurement of January 1995. Procurement procedures for IDB
would be carried out in accordance with guidelines for procurement of September 1994 and a
detailed explanation of ad-hoc procurement procedures will be attached to the loan agreement for
this project to be signed by GOES. MINED staff acquired substantial experience in handling
national and international shopping procedures and preparation of technical specifications during
implementation of Loan 3348-ES. MINED would continue to be supported by a procurement
agent, and by qualified staff trained under the SSRP project and experienced in IBRD's
procurement procedures. In addition, OPCI would be further strengthened to ensure acceptable
procedures under the distinct guidelines of the two Banks by contracting one specialist to handle
procurement in IBRD-financed contracts and one for IDB-financed contracts. Detailed project
procurement and disbursement procedures to manage procurement and ensure acceptable
procedures of IBRD and IDB would be included in the Operational Manual to be used by all
relevant project executing units. A draft of the Manual would be presented to the Banks for
review in December 1995, and the Manual must be put in use as a condition of IBRD loan
effectiveness (paras. 7.4(c)).
4.12  All procurement under international competitive bidding (ICB), national competitive
bidding (NCB), and contracting of international consultants and consulting firms will be initially
undertaken by a procurement agent. MINED would continue to undertake procurement done by
national and international shopping and direct contracting. A signed contract with a procurement
agent would be a condition for IBRD effectiveness (para. 7.4(d)). Fees for procurement agents'
services would be financed under the project. For ICB and NCB, the procurement agent would
use the standard bidding documents (SBDs) to be issued by the Banks, with such modifications as
agreed by the Banks to be necessary for the purpose of the project. For the purpose of comparing
foreign and national bids for goods during ICB evaluation for IBRD financed contracts, national
manufacturers would be allowed a margin of preference in accordance with IBRD guidelines. In
all procurement carried out by NCB, foreign bidders would be allowed to participate. Prior to
the negotiations, MINED prepared draft standard bidding documents, including modified ICB-2
stage documents for library books to be financed by IBRD. Final documents would be put in
force by loan effectiveness.
4.13  Procurement arrangements under both Banks are summarized in Table 8 below.
Civil Works
4.14 IDB would finance all civil works. Civil works are comprised of construction and
rehabilitation of classrooms, rehabilitation of up to three teacher training centers and of a few
small administrative buildings throughout the country, mainly in small cities, which would amount
to about US$6.6 million. All civil works would be carried out under a management agreement
with FIS following IDB standard procedures. As an executing agency for IDB's financed loans,
FIS has acquired substantial experience in the procurement of these contracts and in its
procurement norms and procedures. Packaging of works contracts would be encouraged, but is



39
not mandated to ensure competition and interest by local contractors. ICB procedures would be
used only when packages of works exceed US$1.0 million, although no contract of this size is
expected. Contracts costing US$250,000 or more would be done by NCB. Works expected to
cost less than US$250,000 would be done by private bidding procedures requiring invitations to
at least five contractors/suppliers. Direct contracting in scattered distant rural areas would be
carried out for works below US$100,000. Foreign bidders' participation is not expected due to
the small amounts and scattered locations of the construction or rehabilitation works. A signed
agreement between FIS and MINED for the management of infrastructure and rehabilitation was
presented prior to negotiations.
Textbooks, Teachers' Manuals, and School Furniture
4.15  IDB would finance procurement of textbooks for grades 1-6, teachers' manuals, school
furniture and printing of textbooks for grades 7-9, and distribution services for these materials.
Procurement of goods and services costing US$150,000 or less would be done using private
bidding procedures37, with invitations to at least five suppliers.  In the case of specialized
publications, direct purchase would be allowed. NCB procedures, acceptable to the IDB, would
be used for procurement of goods costing between US$150,000 and US$250,000.  ICB
procedures would be used for goods costing more than US$250,000. Procurement through
private tender and NCB procedures would be open to international suppliers.
Educational Materials, Library Books, Office Furniture and Office Equipment
4.16  IBRD would finance the procurement of library and reference books, laboratory kits and
education packages (canasta bdsica) for preschool and basic education students, printing services
for instructional booklets for students in preschool and multigrade classes, and distribution
services to transport these materials to the local level offices. In addition, some office equipment
and furniture would be procured. Library books would be procured following ICB-2 stage
procedures, using modified ICB standard bidding documents. NCB would be used to procure
packages of goods equal to or less than US$250,000, up to an aggregate limit of US$600,000.
National or international shopping, from at least three qualified suppliers, would be used for
purchases equal or below US$50,000, up to an aggregate of US$1.4 million.
Vehicles
4.17  The project would also finance the procurement of vehicles. IBRD procurement of
vehicles, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.2 million, would be purchased using limited
international bidding (LIB) procedures acceptable to IBRD.
4.18 For the IDB, for purchases of vehicles costing more than US$250,000, MINED would use
ICB. NCB would be used for procurement of vehicles costing between US$150,000 and
US$250,000. Private bidding procedures with invitations to at least five suppliers would be used
for vehicles costing less than US$150,000. Procurement through private bidder and NCB
procedures would be open to international suppliers.
37 One firm could not have individual contracts exceeding an aggregate amount of US$2.0 million.

Micronutrients
4.18  IBRD would finance procurement, inspection and distribution services of micronutrients
to be under the nutrition pilot program.38 Procurement of these goods would be done following
LIB procedures. Procurement agents would ensure the selection of a list of international
laboratories which meet World Health Organization (WHO) quality control requirements and
operate under ISO regulations. Micronutrients would be procured in two packages, amounting to
approximately US$1.2 million.
Technical Assistance and Studies
4.19  The project would finance technical assistance and consulting services to prepare studies,
design and provide training, design instructional materials and communication campaigns, and
other project support activities. The studies to be performed under the project include, but are
not limited to: (a) an assessment of pre-service teacher training needs; (b) an assessment of
secondary education; (c) an evaluation of curriculum development; (d) an evaluation of the
modernization/decentralization process; (e) an evaluation of the supervision system; and (f) an
evaluation of the school feeding program and an assessment of alternative school feeding model
methods. For the subcomponents financed by IBRD, individual consultants and consultant firms
carrying out technical assistance, including auditing services, would be hired following the IBRD
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as
Executing Agency (August 1981). During appraisal technical assistance required to support the
components financed by the project were reviewed and agreed with each executing agency. For
contracting studies and technical assistance services financed by the IBRD, all executing agencies
would use a standard invitation package and contracts as agreed with the IBRD, amended as
required for the purposes of the project. Drafts of a standard invitation package and contracts
were presented prior to negotiations.  Final documents woul be put in place prior to
effectiveness.  For the subcomponents financed by IDB, IDB's Standard Procedures for
Consulting Services would be followed. ICB procedures would be used for consulting services
contracts costing US$200,000 or more. NCB procedures, acceptable to the IDB, would be used
for consulting services contracts costing between US$100,000 and US$199,999. Consulting
services contracting less than US$100,000 would be done through private bidding involving
invitations to at least five contractors. Direct invitations and NCB procedures would be open to
international consultants.
Costs not Involving Procurement
4.20  Approximately 11 percent of project costs, or about US$8.1 million would not involve
procurement. These costs include the education fund and operational expenses.
Review by IBRD
4.21  Prior review by the IBRD would be required for: (a) all annual procurement plans done by
each executing agency, including procurement agents; (b) procurement procedures and
38 Micronutrients are organic compounds essential in minute amounts to the growth and welfare of people, and
include such things as vitamin A, iron, and iodine.



42
documentation for all tender packages and contracts for ICB and LIB, and tender packages for
the first contract during each year of project implementation for miscellaneous goods done under
NCB, regardless of value. It is expected that these procurement arrangements would result in
about 52 percent of IBRD-financed contracts by value. All terms of reference for technical
assistance and studies would be subject to prior review by the IBRD. Documentation for
contracts with consultant firms, valued at US$75,000 and for individual consultants, valued above
US$3 5,000, would also be subject to prior review by the IBRD. These thresholds of prior review
are justified, based on a careful review of estimated costs and nature of consultant services which
are required by the project. All other documentation would be subject to ex-post review during
auditing and by IBRD supervision missions on a random basis.
Prior Review by the IDB
4.22  The IDB's Country Office would review the first contract for civil works, regardless of
value, and all supporting documentation for civil works and goods contracts valued at
US$250,000 or more. All other contracts would be subject to ex-post review by country office
staff, on the basis of random sampling.
Procurement Agents
4.23  NIvNED would enter into a one-year agreement with a procurement agent for the
acquisition of goods and services financed by the project. The benefits of using a procurement
agent, such as UNDP were evident in the implementation of the SSRP. The reasons to use a
procurement agent to assist MINED include: (a) MINED's limited capacity to manage extensive
procurement procedures simultaneously; (b) the technical support available to MINED on a daily
basis resulting from a procurement agent chosen for its vast experience in the implementation of
projects financed by international donors; and (c) the GOES/UNDP general agreement that grants
UNDP an exemption from value added tax and exempts UNDP from the jurisdiction of the Corte
de Cuentas, allowing for an expedited procurement and contracting process. As a condition to
presentation of the program to the IDB Board, MINED will present a satisfactory draft of an
agreement between MINED and UNDP (para. 7.5(a)).
4.24 No recent Country Procurement Assessment on El Salvador is available. However, El
Salvador's procurement regulations clearly authorize, as a special provision, application of
procurement procedures of international financial institutions in the procurement of works, goods
and services, where financing of such procurement comes from an international financial
institution.
D. Disbursements
Disbursements of IBRD Funds
4.25  The proposed project will be implemented over a period of five years and is expected to
be completed by December 31, 2000 and closed by June 30, 2001. The proceeds of the IBRD
loan would be disbursed during a five and a half year period as follows: (a) equipment furniture
and vehicles, 100 percent of foreign expenditures, and 90 percent of local expenditures for other
items procured locally, excluding taxes; (b) didactic materials and library books, 100 percent of



43
foreign and 90 percent of local expenditures, excluding taxes; (c) staff training, technical
assistance, consultancy services, and studies, 100 percent of total expenditures, excluding taxes;
(d) micronutrients and food supplements, 90 percent of total expenditures, excluding taxes; and
(e) incremental salaries and local long-term consultant costs, travel and per diem costs,
maintenance costs, and office supplies costs, at a rate of 90 percent until an aggregate amount of
US$1.6 million has been reached, thereafter, disbursements for this category would be made at a
rate of 60 percent until the aggregate amount of US$2.5 million has been reached; and the
remaining funds would be disbursed at a rate of 30 percent.
4.26  Proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed according to the schedule shown in
Annex 13 against expenditures that would be submitted to the IBRD and fully documented for
contracts valued at more than: (a) US$250,000 for goods; (b) US$75,000 for consulting firms'
services; (c) US$35,000 for individual consultants' services; and (d) expenditures under category
5 of the project.  Claims for expenditures of lesser amounts would be disbursed against
presentation of statements of expenditure (SOEs), for which the supporting documentation would
be retained by the MINED for inspection by the Banks and by external auditors. The Government
would set up a special account for the IBRD loan in US dollars with an initial deposit of US$2.5
million. Withdrawals from the special account would be supported by the required documentation
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of expenditure. Separate project accounts may be
established in MINED for each project executing agency and these would be monitored by OPCI.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on the IBRD Special Account and on retroactive
financing of up to US$300,000 to cover eligible expenditures for preparation and launching of
the proposedproject incurred after March 15, 1995 (para 7.1(c)).
Disbursements of IDB Funds
4.27  The proceeds of the IDB loan would be disbursed during a five year period as follows: (a)
civil works, 90 percent of expenditures for construction of classrooms and/or rehabilitation, repair
and maintenance of existing classrooms, training centers and administrative buildings; (b)
equipment furniture and vehicles, 100 percent of foreign expenditures, and 90 percent of local
expenditures for other items procured locally, excluding taxes; (c) textbooks, and manuals, 100
percent of foreign and local expenditures, excluding taxes; (d) teacher training, technical
assistance, consultancy services, and studies, 100 percent of total expenditures, excluding taxes;
and (e) incremental salaries and local long-term consultant costs, travel and per diem costs,
maintenance costs, and office supplies costs, at a rate of 90 percent until an aggregate amount of
US$0.4 million has been reached, thereafter, disbursements for this category would be made at a
rate of 60 percent until the aggregate amount of US$0.5 million has been reached; and the
remaining funds would be disbursed at a rate of 30 percent. During negotiations, agreement was
reached on the IDB Special Account and on retroactive financing of up to US$300, 000 to cover
eligible expenditures for preparation and launching of the proposed project incurred after
March 15, 1995 (para. 7.1(d)).
4.28  Proceeds of the proposed loans would be disbursed according to the schedule shown in
Annex 13.  Given the degree of preparation and the proposed implementation plan, it is
recommended that an advance equivalent to 10 percent of the proposed loan be approved to assist
the Government to implement project activities during first 120 days. The fund would be
replenished upon presentation by MINED of the required documentation. These funds would be



44
deposited in a Special Account that will be held at the Central Bank. Retroactive financing of up
to US$300,000 to cover expenditures for the preparation and launching of the proposed project
incurred six months prior to Board Approval will be provided.
4.29 The procedures for the management of the Special Accounts and the revolving funds are
includes in a manual (Instructivo Unico) that would be reviewed and agreed among all the
Government institutions involved. The draft manual was included in MvINED's proposal (see
Annex 18).
4.30  OPCI, with the support of the relevant offices of both Banks, will prepare formats for
disbursements that will be adequate to comply with the requirements of both Banks.
E. Accounting and Auditing
4.31  MTINED would establish and maintain separate accounts and records for each loan
adequate to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources and
expenditures related to the project. OPCI, at the central level, would maintain a consolidated
account of all resources and expenditures under the project. Other sets of records, one for each
operating unit, OPCI at the regional level and parents' associations at the local level, would be
maintained by each unit, under supervision from the central level, and would reflect the resources
and expenditures related to project implementation for their respective programs. Data from the
three OPCI regional operating units would be sent to the central level for consolidation purposes.
These accounts would be audited annually by private independent auditors satisfactory to the
Banks. The audit reports, which would include a separate opinion on the adequacy of statements
of expenditures as a basis of loan disbursements, and on the special account and the revolving
funds, would be forwarded to the Banks no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.
To support the timely provision of audit reports, MINED will contract the auditing firm at the
beginning of each project year to be considered for the auditing exercise. To support the timely
provision of audit reports, the private independent auditors would be requested to present mid-
year progress reports. The annual audits would also cover a random sample of the records and
accounts maintained by parents' associations. During negotiations the Government provided
assurances that MINED would: (a) have the records and accounts for each fiscal year audited
by independent and qualified auditors, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
and procedures; (b) furnish to the Banks as soon as available, but in any case not later than six
months after the end of each year, a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and (c) furnish to
the Banks such other information concerning the records and accounts as well as the audit as the
Banks wouldfrom time to time reasonably request (para. 7. I (e)).
5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Borrower, Guarantor and Executor for the Project
5.1   The borrower and guarantor of the loan will be the Government of El Salvador. MINED
will be responsible for the execution of the project. An agreement between the borrower and the
executing agency to transfer resources from the loan will be a condition for IDB disbursement



45
(para. 7.7(d)). MINED has experience in implementing programs financed by international
donors and its institutional capacity has been evident in the implementation of the SSRP, financed
by the IBRD, and the SABE Project, financed by USAID, that are close to completion (early
1996). The size of this loan will demand expanded management capacity within MINED for its
efficient implementation. The project provides adequate financing to guarantee that MINED will
receive timely, adequate technical support for project implementation.  In addition, before
disbursements begin, OPCI will complete an action plan to strengthen its capacity to manage and
monitor the project's flow of funds (see para. 4.8).
B. Project Organization
5.2   The project organization would have two levels: the central level, which would have
overall responsibility for project coordination and implementation, and the decentralized level
which, throughout the project implementation period, would receive progressively more
responsibility for the implementation and delivery of education services.
C. Project Management
5.3   Project implementation would be carried out within the existing organizational structure of
MINED through the Project Management Office which would be drawn from existing units
whose operational and administrative responsibilities are directly linked to project components.
Overall responsibility for implementation of the proposed project would be vested in the Minister
of Education who would be supported in general policy setting and institutional coordination by a
committee composed of the Vice Minister of Education (General Project Director) and Project
Component Directors.39 To facilitate project implementation, a Project Manager would be
appointed. The Project Manager would report directly to the Vice Minister of Education on the
day to day operations of the project, and would be responsible for calling the directors to
committee meetings.
5.4   The Ministry of Education, through the Project Manager, would assist, coordinate,
monitor and evaluate the activities through the following participating units, each under the
direction of a Project Component Director:
(a)   The Quality Improvement Unit which would be responsible for the implementation of
the quality improvement comrponent through its various administrative units. The main
responsibilities of the unit would include: improvement of the basic education
cuniculum, production and provision of teaching materials and textbooks, in-service
training for teachers and supervisors, evaluation of student achievement, revision of the
supervision system and provision of nutritional and health programs through schools;
(b)   The EDUCO Unit which would be responsible for the expansion of the model in rural
areas, and reorganization and strengthening of service delivery;
39 MINED directors involved in implementing project activities.



46
(c)    A Management Modernization Unit (MM[) would be created which would be
responsible for the implementation of the Institutional Modernization Component. The
main responsibilities of the MMU would cover: changes and improvements in sector
planning, administration, decentralized provision of services, evaluation, supervision
and monitoring, a review of the organizational structure and the legal framework, the
management information system, and public awareness campaigns. The MMU would
include a small Decentralization Unit whose main functions would be to carry out the
decentralization process, to provide support to the staff working in the decentralized
units in all aspects of the operations; and
(d)   OPCI which would be responsible for management of the procurement and financial
aspects of the project.  OPCI's main responsibilities would include: contracting
procurement agents, procurement of goods and services under shopping and direct
contracting, maintaining the project's financial records and accounts, developing annual
plans to be presented to the Ministry of Finance regarding national finance of the
project, including maintenance funds and teacher salaries, making transfers to the
ACEs, and making payments for goods and services required by the project.
5.5   The Project Management Office would manage the Pilot Basic Education Fund and devise
adequate mechanisms to ensure that the Fund reaches its intended beneficiaries quickly and
efficiently.
5.6   The proposed  structure is deemed appropriate to  ensure efficiency  in project
implementation because implementation authority is retained by the respective line and staff
departments of MINED. MINED will require technical support during project implementation
and the proposed project provides sufficient funds to guarantee adequate and timely support. The
proposed project would include financing for contracting specialized staff and/or long-term
consultants, and travel and per diem costs for project monitoring and supervision. Evidence of
the establishment of the Management Modernization Unit and the Quality Improvement Unit in
the Project Management Office will be a condition for IDB disbursement (para. 7.7(e)). During
negotiations, agreement was reached on the appointment of key technical and administrative
staff and/or consultants (para. 7.1Wf)). This condition was also required for IDB board
presentation (para 7.5(b)).
Other Agencies Involved in Project Implementation
5.7   MINED will sign an agreement with the FIS to ensure timely and efficient implementation
of all civil works financed under the project. FIS has extensive experience in the construction and
rehabilitation of small education infrastructure in isolated and scattered locations. FIS has been
financed extensively by international donors (including four IDB loans) and is very familiar with
IDB's procurement norms and procedures (para. 4.13). In addition, FIS has put in place
procedures to deal with land tenure issues and for insuring technical construction specifications
are met.
5.8    MINED will contract with a procurement agent to handle the procurement of goods and
services that require ICB, NCB, ICB-2 stage, LIB, and contracting of international consultants
and consulting firms (para. 4.23).



47
D. Preparation and Review and Annual Work Programs and Budget
5.9   The project implementation units, with the Project Manager's support and with OPCI's
assistance, would prepare an annual work program for the project that would include the
proposed activities for the year, their timing, and budget. Under SSRP, MINED has acquired
considerable experience in the preparation of annual work programs that are monitored
periodically to ensure that performance targets are being met. As responsibilities are delegated to
lower levels of MINED administration, the relevant units would be required to prepare annual
work programs and budgets that would be monitored by the central level. These work programs
would cover the period January through December of each year and their preparation would take
place early enough to enable MINED to incorporate the total budgetary requirements of the
project in its budget proposal for the following year.
E. Annual and Mid-Term Reviews by the Banks
5.10  Throughout the project implementation period, annual reviews would be undertaken
jointly by MINED, MICDES, IBRD, and IDB no later than September 30 of each year to have an
opportunity to assess project impact and performance, and to reach agreement on necessary
adjustments. The cost estimates prepared for the various components (Annex 11) and the key
monitoring indicators and implementation targets (Annex 13) would serve as a basis for project
implementation planning, and would be updated annually by MINED in preparation for the annual
reviews. The annual project implementation review would: (a) analyze progress made during the
previous year in project execution and in attaining its objectives, based on the key monitoring
indicators for the project; (b) analyze and agree on the proposed annual work plans, specific
project progress reports, and budgetary requirements for the following year of project
implementation to ensure the adequacy of counterpart funding; (c) assess the effectiveness of
project management and coordination and discuss adjustments to be made in the project's
implementation schedule or targets; and (d) review progress in implementation of the ministry's
decentralization and its coordination with the Government's overall program.  During
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that MINED would. (a) conduct, jointly with
MICDES, IBRD, and IDB, annual project implementation reviews in September of each year,
beginning in 1996; and (b) by the same date each year, beginning in 1996, submit to the Banks
annual progress reports on the implementation of the project in accordance with targets
established in previous annual work and investment plans, including the proposed budgetary
requirements for project implementation during the subsequent year (para 7.1(g)).
5.11  The third annual review would be the mid-term review and would be undertaken no later
than September 30, 1998. It would assess overall project performance and initial impact in the
light of project objectives and MINED policies. The key areas to be covered, in addition to all
aspects of project implementation covered during the annual reviews include:
(a)   Expansion, reorganization and strengthening of the EDUCO model:
Number of new sections created and converted from the traditional system would be
reviewed. NGO and other private organization performance in the delivery of services
to ACEs, and results of the school maintenance program would be analyzed to



48
determine the efficacy of the programs. Careful review of the improved mechanisms to
transfer resources to the ACEs would be made, as well as of the impact of teacher
incentives included in the new teacher salary structure and a thorough assessment of
EDUCO's costs vis-a-vis the traditional system. In addition, close attention will be
given to the existing procedures that guarantee adequate financing for maintenance of
education infrastructure.
(b)    Quality improvement:
Progress in development of improved curricula for basic education, especially in the
3rd cycle as well as in the textbook development program for all grades of basic
education would be analyzed. The implementation of the pilot multigrade program
would also be evaluated. Efficiency in the acquisition and distribution of didactic
materials for teachers and students would be reviewed.  An evaluation of the
achievements and effectiveness of the training program will be undertaken. Preliminary
results of the student assessment program would be analyzed to take measures to
address any deficiencies that may be found. The pilot nutrition program would be
reviewed to ensure that coordination mechanisms between MINED and MOH are
adequate for the program.
(c)   Institutional modernization:
The functioning of the human resources, statistics, budgeting, infrastructure and
procurement subsystems at the departmental level, in the pilot departments would be
reviewed, including the actual costs associated with the decentralized provision of
education services. The reports produced by the information system for the above
subsystems would be analyzed.   The implementation of local planning and
programming in some urban and rural schools as well as in the pilot departments would
be evaluated. The operating and administrative manuals would be reviewed. In
addition, the implementation of the human resources data base would be reviewed.
The implementation of the supervisor training program, as well as the equipping of
their offices would be reviewed. Particular attention will be given to the consistency
between the modernization of MINED and the Public Sector Reform, including civil
service conditions, decentralization, and accounting procedures. The communication
strategy and its efficiency will be assessed. Finally, the procedures used to allocate
funds for projects financed by the Pilot Basic Education Fund would be evaluated with
respect to their efficiency and effectiveness.
(d)   Public education financing:
Particular attention will be given to education expenditure as a share of both GDP and
central Government expenditure. The composition of expenditures by academic level
and expenditure category would be reviewed. An analysis of the evolution of teacher
salaries and an implicit incentive structure would be undertaken. Finally, the sources of
funding of other investments would be analyzed.



49
5.12 On the basis of the above in-depth review, the MINED and the Banks would agree on
adjustments to project design and implementation, as necessary. During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that: (a) the in-depth mid-term review would cover all aspects
of project implementation; (b) it would be conducted jointly by MINED, MICDES and the
Banks, and (c) on the basis of this review, action plans, satisfactory to the Banks, would be
prepared and initiated by January 1, 1999 (para. 7. 1 (h)).
F. Loan Supervision
5.13  Project supervision will be coordinated by the IBRD task manager and the IDB team
leader and is expected to take place at least twice a year, jointly, by the two Banks.40 The main
purpose is to monitor progress of the different project components. This supervision will require
an estimated 20 staff-weeks per year. Although MINED has project implementation experience,
this project would require significant supervision because of its wide scope. The supervision
teams would be a combination of the Banks' staff4' and consultants with the required technical
expertise and experience in the operation of similar projects in Latin America and other regions.
The participation of team members of the proposed joint IBRD/IDB Public Sector Modernization
Project will be requested when necessary. It is expected that the main areas of expertise required
would be education and education planning, student achievement testing, institutional
development, management information systems and communications. Annex 15 includes a
project supervision strategy.
5.14 The IDB Country Office will perform the continuous task of monitoring and supervising
the proposed project for the IDB. The IDB Country Office will be responsible for all supervision
tasks, coordinating with the Project Team.
5.15   Since annual evaluations of the proposed project will be undertaken (including an in-depth
mnid-term review) and a loan completion report is expected, it was decided that an additional ex-
post evaluation would not be required.
6. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Project Benefits
6.1   Faced with the urgent need to improve coverage and quality of basic education in El
Salvador, the project would support the efforts of the Government to undertake a balanced
process of improving equity, quality and efficiency of the school system. The project would
target resources to poor and vulnerable groups, would improve learning achievements, and
promote the efficiency of resource allocation.  At the same time it would strengthen the
institutional capacity of N4INED to provide services and to evaluate and monitor education
policies and programs. The education flow wastage could be dramatically cut by improving the
quality of services and by the existence of minimal nutrition conditions for the students. The
40 For IDB, the annual review mission will take place in the second semester of each year. Additionally, during
execution, supervisionlmonitoring missions will take place in the first semester of each year.

project is designed to produce significant reductions in repetition and dropout rates through the
expansion of preschool education, better qualified teachers, improved availability of instructional
materials, an updated curriculum, a more effective learning environment and direct involvement of
parents, teachers and the community in the management of schools. Decentralization and
community participation will boost responsiveness by teachers and administrators since all will be
sharing administrative responsibilities and transparency will promote accountability at all levels.
The proposed project will support the Public Sector Reform by establishing the conditions for the
MINED to be an active and responsive actor in the process while being consistent with the
general guidelines of the Public Sector Reform. The program will also help to identify efficient
methods and procedures to deliver education services that will be a seed for future improvements
within the sector.
6.2   The socio-economic viability and efficiency of the project is supported on the basis of the
high average return of basic education in El Salvador, and the solid results obtained in a
preliminary exercise to estimate the marginal returns of the Government program to expand
coverage in rural preschool and basic education (20 percent, see Annex 3). These results are
based on the expected economic rate of returns of students that achieve one more year of
education and also the fiscal savings resulting from higher internal efficiency. The result is very
conservative because it overlooks the externalities of the project and the positive effect of a more
efficient and responsive Ministry of Education.
6.3    The financial benefits of the project are represented in GOES' selection of a variable rate
US dollar single currency loan from the IBRD to improve its overall liability management and
reduce its risks. The Government considers US dollars to be an appropriate currency for its debt
management strategy, and prefers the standard country repayment terms for LIBOR-based single
currency loans compared to the shorter final maturity for fixed rate single currency loans.
B. Impact on Women
6.4   Female students slightly outnumber male students at both the preschool and basic
education levels (para. 2.8). Curriculum reform under the SABE project has sharpened the focus
on the specific needs of women and the key role of educated women in reducing fertility,
promoting family values, and guiding and encouraging the education of young children. The
project will support these reform efforts by eliminating the remaining gender stereotypes in school
texts, improving teacher quality, and introducing career guidance. The EDUCO model directly
involves a significant number of mothers in school boards and decision making processes. By
expanding the EDUCO model, women will be increasingly active in community activities and will
benefit from the training programs that will improve their skills in education.
C. Environmental Impact
6.5   The project is not expected to have direct environmental effects, and has been classified as
C for IBRD and Category II for IDB.42  Civil works will be restricted to recovering existing
schools. Education materials produced by the project will include appropriate environmental
42 IDB classification was approved by CMA Short Procedure on December 12, 1994.



51
topics. Therefore, an improved basic education will contribute to make children and their parents
more aware of the environmental concerns and more receptive to public campaigns for
conservation and protection of the environment.
D. Project Risks
6.6   Although the project has been designed with a systemic and balanced approach, the
technical viability is highly contingent on the participation of qualified technical support during the
project. The end result, however, will be increased equity through improvements in quality and
the transformation of the structure of incentives leading to more efficiency.
6.7   The fiscal requirements to support the modernization of basic education will depend on
the assumptions made regarding growth and real recovery of teachers salaries (Annex 2). Under a
conservative scenario the financial viability of the program will require that public sector spending
in education be increased by 0.6 percent of GNP to a total of 2.5 percent.43 As noted in Annex 2
the macroeconomic and fiscal risks leading to inadequate funding are low. The Government has
been adamant in declaring its commitment to fund the program, even under a less favorable
scenario that will require an additional fiscal effort to the detriment of other sectors. During
negotiations, a letter signed by the Minister of Finance assuring the Borrower's commitment to
provide the requiredfunds, including an annual increase in the education ordinary budget, was
received (para. 7.2(b)). During Annual Reviews, the provisions for adequate counterpart funds
for the project and the fulfillment of agreed budgetary increase will be condition for the approval
of the Annual Work Program.
6.8   Due to the comprehensive scope of the operation, the main risk will be the limited capacity
of MINED to implement the program. However, MINED has proven to be one of the most
dynamic ministries in El Salvador and has shown its capacity to respond to increasingly
demanding tasks under the SABE Project and the SSRP. This risk will be reduced, and the
institutional viability secured, through continuous technical assistance that will strengthen the
institutional capacity of MINED.
6.9   The project relies on the EDUCO model for providing services in rural areas. The
expansion of EDUCO will introduce new challenges to maintain its efficiency, an adequate
incentives structure, and timely responsiveness to the demands of the community. The expansion
of EDUCO will also have to be matched with the revision of the incentive structure for all
teachers (EDUCO and traditional) to avoid the conflict that could arise from a dual labor regime
for teachers. The program addresses bothissues to minimize those risks.
6.10  The introduction of a new teacher incentives system, the establishment of a performance
assessment system, and the rationalization of MINED staff could create political tensions between
the GOES/MINED and the teachers, supervisors, principals and MINED staff. The political
support for the modernization program of MINED, the support of the Comisi6n Nacional de
Educacion, Cienciay Desarrollo, and the introduction of an active communication campaign will
reduce the risk of a confrontation with teachers.
4 Five percent if economic growth is half of what is predicted in MIPLAN's long term plans.



52
6.11  The decentralization process bears the risks of an inadequate articulation between different
levels of operation. The design of pilot programs and the consideration of lessons learned in other
Latin American experiences when designing the implementation process are the best ways to limit
those risks.
E. Program Objective Category
6.12  The proposed project, in the human resources development category, is a program of
national and targeted interventions. The project would be an integral part of El Salvador's
antipoverty strategy through its assistance to improve coverage and quality of basic education
services for the poorest groups in the country. It will target poor children in rural and urban
marginal areas through a ranking system based on prevalence of malnutrition, repetition rates for
first grade, net enrollment rates for first grade, and percentage of overage students. The non-
targeted actions of quality and efficiency will be circumscribed to improve the public education
services at preschool and basic education levels. Following the guidelines of the IDB's Eighth
Replenishment Poverty Targeting Mandate, this project is a poverty targeted loan.

Basic Education Public Financing and
Financial Impact of the Project
EL SALVADOR BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
BASIC EDUCATION PUBLIC FINANCING AND FINANCIAL
IMPACT OF THE PROJECT1
1.    Basic education enrollment in El Salvador increased 24 percent between 1991 and 1993,
reaching 1.19 million children at the end of this period. El Salvador's net enrollment deficit in
basic education remains high (34 percent) and disparities between rural and urban enrollment
persist. While net enrollment in preschool and the 3rd cycle have reached 46 percent and 53.4
percent, respectively, in urban areas, it is about half as much as that in rural areas - 24.5 percent
and 13.8 percent, respectively.
2.    Education expenditure as a share of both gross domestic product (GDP) and central
Government expenditure has steadily declined since 1981. Its share of GDP decreased from 3.6
percent in 1981 to 2.0 percent in 1994. This reflects the fact that total government expenditure
fell from nearly 20 percent of GDP in the early 1980s to 13 percent in 1993 while, at the same
time, the education share of the budget declined by more than half during the same time period
(see Figure 1).
3.    There are several issues of concern in El Salvador's education budget:
(a)   Investment expenditures have been drastically reduced, and only partially executed.
In contrast, recurrent expenditures have been almost fully executed as budgeted,
and their share has increased to nearly 90 percent of the budget.
(b)   In El Salvador, the percentage of the Government's education expenditure is less
than its Central American neighbors.
(c)   El Salvador allocates proportionately more resources than its neighbors to basic
education, however, its expenditure on secondary education is low compared to
other Central American nations. There is a high private sector share in secondary
education (55 percent in 1993).
(d)   There is a high private sector share in secondary education (55 percent in 1993)
and transfers to the University of El Salvador are very low for regional standards
(an average of 0.19 percent of GDP in the last five years).
(e)   Teacher salaries in real terms have steadily declined since 1980. Between 1984
and 1992 per capita income rose by 5.4 percent while teacher wages fell by 50
percent. The purchasing power of teacher wages in 1992 was 32 percent of its

level in 1980. Hence, in the last decade education became a less attractive sector
for young people in the job market.2
(f)    The key education investments in the last four years have been financed by
international donors in projects associated with considerable technical assistance
programs
4.    In summary, in El Salvador the amount of resources being allocated to education have
been reduced in the past 20 years, and concentrated in basic education. Most of those resources
are being used to cover recurrent expenditures. Additionally, there has been a sharp deterioration
in teacher remuneration, and El Salvador has shown a limited managerial capacity to undertake
investment projects.
5.    Repetition and dropouts are costly for El Salvador. In 1994, the average per student
annual cost was around US$149. However, due to repetition, a child spends an average of 5
years longer than necessary to complete the primary level costing as much as US$37 million per
year, that is, almost one-fourth of the total government expenditure in basic education. Between
repeating grades and temporarily dropping out of school, a child needs, on average, 19 years to
complete a 9 year cycle.
GOVERNMENT GOALS FOR ENROLLMENT IN BASIC EDUCATION, 1995 - 1999:
6.    El Salvador's basic education goals for 1995-1999 include: (a) increasing preschool rural
enrollment from 24.5 percent in 1993 to 40 percent in 1999; (b) raising enrollment in the 1st and
2nd cycles from 83 percent in 1993 to 90 percent in 1999; and (c) reducing overage students in
basic education from 29.2 percent in 1993 to 15.3 percent in 1999. No specific target has been
set for increasing enrollment in the 3rd cycle which is currently 32.8 percent (net enrollment).
7.    Calculations of the cost of meeting the goals are based on the following assumptions:
(a)   GOES' Economic Plan for the next five years assumes an annual economic growth
of 7 percent per year. To avoid distortions implicit in this assumption, estimations
of recurrent costs (cost per student involving all inputs) were made as a percentage
of GDP. The estimation of capital costs (investment) was made under two
scenarios, 7 percent and 3 percent GDP growth.
(b)   The school-age population is assumed to grow by 2 percent annually.  This
projected growth is larger than the Ministry of Education's (MINED's) projections
of 1.95 percent growth rate for 4-6 year olds and 1 percent for 7-12 year olds.
(c)    Sections3 are assumed to have 32 students, the average number of students in
EDUCO schools.
2 There is some evidence that suggests that teachers in the traditional system have high absenteeism. But even
adjusting teacher salaries by the net hours worked, real wages declined by about 50 percent between 1980 and
1992.
3 A section is a group of students under the charge of a teacher.

Basic Education Public Financing and
Financial Impact of the Project
(d)   Since increased coverage will focus on schools in rural areas and in small towns, it
is assumed that EDUCO will play a fundamental role. Some of the planned
expansion will be based on adding a second session to the already existing
infrastructure. Because teachers receive a premium of 43 percent of their base
salary for teaching a second session, the expansion of the EDUCO system through
adding a second session can be achieved with a 43 percent increase in base salaries,
far below from the cost of opening a new EDUCO session.4
(e)   The simulation allowed for increases in expenditures in the 3rd cycle of the basic
level and on the secondary level due to the natural increase in the population and
for the preservation in real terms of other education programs.
8.    Based on the above, the projected cost of meeting the government's medium-term goals is
projected in Table 1:

El Salvador," 1995.
9.    These public expenditures will provide for the implementation of the Government
expansion of the education system as described in paragraph 6. This includes additional actions to
those financed by this proposed IBRD/IDB project including an average of 0.15 percent of GNP
investment financed by other donors. For a specific assessment of counterpart funds for the
project see Annex 11.
EDUCATION BUDGET 1995-99:
10.   MINED's total expenditure plan aims at annual education investments of 0.5 percent of
GDP during the next 5 years. Approximately 80 percent of the investments will be used for
infrastructure, equipment and training. The remaining 20 percent will be used for recurrent
expenditures associated with the investments, in particular with didactic materials.
4 The recurrent cost of a new EDUCO section is assumed to be $32,800 colones (of 1994) per year. Teacher
salaries are, by far, the important recurrent cost of the EDUCO program.



78                                 ANNEX 2
Basic Education Public Financing and
Financial Impact of the Project
11.   It is expected that the public sector will generate revenues and assist MINED in: (a)
covering the incremental recurrent costs associated with these investment plans; (b) paying for the
enrollment increment program; (c) improving teacher salaries (real) at least in the EDUCO
program; and (d) paying for the passive growth of actual expenditures. In order to fulfill these
goals it will be necessary that the education budget reach between 2.7and 3.4 percent at the
beginning of the next century depending on the rate of GDP growth and the wage policy adopted
for teachers in the traditional system (see Table 8).
12.   The emphasis of government programs will change the composition of expenditure among
levels of education, favoring preschool and basic at the cost of secondary and higher education.
In the above scenarios, the share of education expenditures channeled to preschool and basic
education would climb from 76 percent of the total in 1992 to 79 percent in 1999. The remainder
of education expenditures goes to secondary education (9 percent), vocational training (2
percent), adult education (1 percent), and the university (9 percent). The program will reduce the
share of private education in preschool from 27 percent in 1993 to 22 percent in 1999, will
slightly reduce its share in basic education, and will increase its share in secondary school from 55
percent in 1993 to 56 percent in 1999.
13.   The ability of the Government to increase education expenditures hinges on: (a)
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies that increase tax revenues; and (b) a substantial
increase in the surplus of public enterprises. The government expects that total revenues will
reach 18 percent of GDP in 1999; if this target is reached it will not be necessary to raise the share
of education expenditure on central government expenditure. But any figure lower than 18
percent in total revenues would imply that the education goals should be pursued at the cost of
other sectors.
14.   It is important to mention that the expected reduction in repetition rates can yield savings
up to 38 percent of the education costs per graduate in grades 1 through 6 and 21 percent in
grades 7 through 9. Under a very conservative assumption, the process will reduce repetition
rates by 25 percent (one year for 1st and 2nd cycles). The reduction in repetition would be
equivalent to savings of US$5 million per year. Those savings will be an additional source for
funding the expansion of education services.

Economic Analysis
EL SALVADOR BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.    Empirical evidence suggests that the overall rate of return to primary education is high in
El Salvador. Using 1990 data, Psacharopoulos and Ng estimated the average private rate of
return for primary education at 18.9 percent.' The same study estimated the average private rates
of return for secondary education at 14.5 percent and for university education at 9.5 percent.
Social rates of return of 16.3 percent for primary school, 13.3 percent for secondary school and
8.0 percent for university education show a similar pattern of the highest rates of return for
primary education and the lowest for university education.
2.    Although one cannot assume that the above-cited average rates of return are the same as
the marginal rates of return from investments by project activities, high average rates of return
augur well for the overall returns to investments in primary education. Moreover, the available
evidence suggests a positive assessment of the project's returns when compared with alternative
investments available in the country. Under the assumption that the private marginal return will
be half of the average return (9.5 percent), returns are still considerably higher than the current
average real lending rate (7.4 percent).
3.    A brief analysis of the components of the project will give additional evidence of the
economic soundness of the proposed project.
Component 1. Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education
4.    The expansion of EDUCO schools, supported by the first component of the project, seeks
to follow cost-effectiveness criteria in offering education services at a reasonable cost to some of
the lowest income groups in rural areas, and provides efficient management of those services.
Despite the lower socio-economic status of EDUCO students2, their achievement results are
comparable to students in traditional (urban and rural) schools. Although overall costs of the
EDUCO schools are similar to those of traditional schools, the benefits of the program appear to
be much higher. These benefits include bringing education to areas which did not previously
receive these services, community involvement in providing education services, and better control
over teacher attendance and performance. EDUCO also established channels for better
communication between communities and the Ministry of Education (MINED).
5.    The EDUCO model accomplishes a balance between the benefits of an active participation
of parents in the education of their children, and the economic benefits of public sector
intervention. The proposed project will support the strengthening of the partnership between
communities and MINED.
' Psacharopoulos, G. and Y.C. Ng, "Earnings and Education in Latin America: Assessing Priorities for Social
Investments," World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, WPS 1058, December 1992. The results reported use
the full discounting method.
2 EDUCO schools are in some of the lowest income areas of El Salvador, where factors such as health, nutrition,
and the need for child labor weigh in heavily against school performance.



85                                 ANNEX 3
Economic Analysis
6.    By delegating the administrative functions to the local communities, the EDUCO model
builds in an adequate structure of incentives because the parents are empowered to make the best
out of the resources provided by the government and by themselves to educate their children.
7.    The financial support of the government circumvents two phenomena which hinder private
demand for education. Parents do not perceive the full economic return of education because
they only take into account private costs and returns, and, even when they do, they may be unable
to pay its price, or to borrow against the future returns of this investment. Facilitating the access
to education services, based on the expansion of the EDUCO model, allows the capitalization of
economic returns that could otherwise be lost in a poverty trap.
8.    Through the use of double sessions and, whenever possible, the rehabilitation of existing
schools rather than construction of new schools, the expansion of EDUCO that is supported by
the current project uses cost-efficient criteria to achieve better school coverage. Double sessions
in existing infrastructure and in new schools reduce expensive infrastructure investments.
Additionally, experience shows that teachers are willing to assume responsibility for a second
session at a premium of about 43 percent of their regular salaries, this means that the marginal
costs of adding double sessions are substantially below those of adding new sections with new
teachers. In reference to classrooms, the project calls for rehabilitating 9,152 classrooms at a cost
of approximately $2,600 each. A much smaller number of new classrooms (1,140 at a cost of
about $23,000 each) will be built where rehabilitation of existing infrastructure cannot meet the
demand for increased coverage, and will be financed by the communities and the Social
Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversi6n Social - FIS).
9.    It is important to mention that the expansion of EDUCO could face increasing marginal
costs. The program introduces a more active participation of the private sector to provide
promotion and organization services for the community which are currently provided directly by
NMINED.  The project will compare the cost effectiveness of contracting services with the
potential negative economies of scale of extensive MINED micromanagement of the project.
Component 2. Improvement in Educational Quality
10.   The education flow wastage could be dramatically cut by improving the quality of services
and by the existence of minimal nutrition conditions for the children. The five subcomponents
supporting education quality - curriculum improvements, teaching materials, teacher qualification
and training, student achievement evaluation, and health and nutrition - respond to the weakest
elements of the Salvadoran education system.
11.   There is substantial room for improvement in dropout and repetition rates. The average
period required by a student to finish 9 academic years is 19 years. The dropout rate is
particularly high between the 2nd and 3rd cycles.
12.   The transition to 3rd cycle increases by 51 percent the required surplus time needed to
complete the basic education cycle. Dropout rates within cycles are known to be considerably
less. Under the assumption that repetition explains 90 percent of education waste within cycles,
repetition is responsible for 4.5 of the extra years needed to finish basic education.

Source: Rand. 1995. "An Analysis of the Unit Costs of Preschool and Primary School in El Salvador.
13.   Reduction of repetition rates can yield savings up to 23 percent of the education costs per
graduate in grades 1-9. Annual expenditures for students in basic education are US$149 dollars. With
a basic enrollment of 1.06 million in 1994, the cost of repetition may be as high as US$37 million per
year. This cost will increase with expansion of education services if it is not combined with actions to
improve quality to reduce repetition and dropout rates.
14.   The proposed project will address issues of efficiency in a comprehensive way through a
series of actions to improve the quality of education services provided by MINED. It is important
to emphasize six actions that will have a direct impact on repetition rates and are considered in the
proposed project: (a) the revision of curriculum to meet the needs and interests of the rural school
population; (b) the expansion of preschool coverage; (c) the development of a multigrade
program in rural areas that introduces the flexibility required in rural environments; (d) the
establishment of a new promotion system for students allowing for automatic progression within
cycles; (e) the development of a nutrition program targeted to the poorest school in rural areas;
and (f) the promotion of an active participation of parents in school management. Under the
assumption that repetition is responsible for 4.5 of the years needed to finish basic education, a
reduction of repetition rates in one year will reduce the annual average repetition waste in the
amount of US$9 million. If that goal is accomplished, an amount similar to that estimated for the
quality component could be 'internally" financed by the savings.
15.   Dropout costs are difficult to measure because of the complex interconnections with labor
and production. Nevertheless, the costly pedagogical difficulties of having overage students, the
increased cost of generating human capital, and the potential loss of economic returns sustain the
importance of reducing dropout rates.
16.   The importance of the subcomponents included under the quality component have further
support in international experiences. A recent study of Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Mexico
stated that "the study flow inefficiency, specially among the urban and rural low-income students,
is primarily prompted by lack of: (a) early stimulation programs; (b) appropriate educational
inputs such a as textbooks, learning and teaching materials, in-service teacher training,



87                                  ANNEX 3
Economic Analysis
pedagogical supervision, feeding programs, health screening, and school construction and
maintenance; (c) relevant curricula; and (d) suitable learning environments."3
17.   One aspect that deserves special attention is the introduction of evaluation schemes to
monitor the effectiveness of the education policy, including this project.  The evaluation
component and the development of a MINED information system, introduce powerful tools to
value the effectiveness of the education policies. The establishment of accountability through
achievement tests has proven its capacity to improve teacher performance and student
achievement, the case of Thailand is one remarkable example.4
Component 3. Institutional Modernization and Strengthening
18.   The government has set realistic targets for improving enrollment, and the project emphasizes
quality enhancing investments. The increase in resources has to be paired with an effort to enhance
efficiency in the provision of education, and in the performance of government agencies.
19.   Moreover, the Government is developing a full Program of Modernization of the Public
Sector that aims to improve the overall efficiency of the public sector. The project will contribute
to this process from within MINED by supporting improvements in MINED's incentive structure,
strengthening the information system, improving communications, strengthening the supervision
of personnel, and developing an effective monitor system.
20.   One important underlying decision in the modernization process that the Government
wants to implement is the decentralization of services (particularly education and health). The
examples of education decentralization in Latin America indicate the paramount importance of the
coexistence of a strong management capacity that will allow policy makers and government
officials to monitor the decentralization process and the development of managerial capacity at
local levels to absorb new responsibilities. The timely provision of technical support and the
establishment of an efficient information system to implement the monitoring process are also
critical. The project will closely support the decentralization process and is expected to provide
the necessary technical assistance to empower the MINED to finish that process.
21.   The major bottleneck of the education sector is the limited managerial capacity of
MINED. In spite of the willingness of the Government and international agencies to provide
funds to expand and improve the education sector, the implementation capacity is limited. By
contributing to the development of MINED's managerial capacity, the education sector could
reap the benefits of a vast set of social investment opportunities.
22.   Finally, the availability of funds and technical support for pilot projects is a cost efficient
way to introduce efficient methods and procedures to deliver education services. The pilot
projects will encourage innovations on an experimental basis. The pilot projects will identify, test,
improve, and evaluate different pedagogical methods and administrative procedures to improve

useful inputs for policy makers to make cost effective decisions in the allocation of capital and
human resources.
Marginal rate of return of the medium term education plan of GOES for expanding coverage and
reducing repetition and dropout rates
23.   The medium term plan of the government of El Salvador aims at increasing the coverage
in rural preschool and in primary education, and to reduce the presence of overage students.
24.   Even without detailed econometric work based on the Household Surveys,5 it is
worthwhile to estimate a rudimentary internal rate of return for the project. In order to do so, the
following assumptions were made:
(a)    A higher coverage demands additional resources.  A yearly average cost per
student of US$149 (including capital costs) was multiplied by the increase in the
number of preschool and primary students in public schools.6 The yearly cost was
assumed to increase at an annual rate of 7 percent until 1999 and 5 percent
thereafter.7
(b)    A more rudimentary method was used to estimate the benefits of the plan. It was
assumed that an improvement in coverage will have the following positive effects:
(i)    Dropout decisions will be postponed by a year.  This means that the
average wage of those students who dropout from school will increase.
Using data about the relationship of wages and years of schooling from
Dewees et al.8, it was estimated that the average income of primary school
dropouts will increase by about 10 percent. This income differential was
multiplied by the projected number of dropouts from 1995 to 2024.
(ii)    A higher coverage allows new students to receive higher wages. The extra
annual income was assumed to be the same obtained by postponing
dropout decisions (i.e. about 10 percent of actual wages). It was applied
to the difference between the enrollment in the three cycles of public basic
education with and without the project. This is a very conservative
assumption.

Salvador." In Diagnostico del Sistema de Desarrollo de Recursos Humanos de El Salvador. Report for the
Harvard Institute for International Development in collaboration with Fundaci6n Empresarial para el Desarrollo
Educativo, Universidad Jose Sime6n Caffas. The differential in income was adjusted so as to allow for a 5 percent
anmual teal gmwth in salaries of the economy.

Economic Analysis
(iii)    A better coverage of preschool in rural areas will reduce the repetition rate
of 1st. grade. This reduction was estimated as 20 percent (i.e. repetition
rate in the 1st grade in rural areas declines from 20 percent to 16 percent).
This allows the saving of fiscal resources.
(iv)    Benefits accrue after 1999. This assumes that the benefits of the program
require time to mature before becoming effective.
25.   With these assumptions the annual real marginal rate of return of the medium term plan for
education was estimated as 19.7 percent. This underestimates the true rate because: (a) private
and social returns for education are increasing as a consequence of an increasingly competitive
economy; (b) returns gaps between levels of education are widening as a consequence of the
demand for a better educated labor force by the productive sector; (c) the assumptions about
expanded years of education are very conservative; and (d) no external positive effects were
included.

EL SALVADOR BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECr
SOCLL ASSESSMENT: SUMMARY OF MAIN RESULTS
Background and Objectives
1.    As part of the preparation of the project, a Social Assessment (SA) was undertaken between
November 1994 and February 1995. The SA supports the operation by identifying major benefits and
risks, and proposing an action plan on how to maximize the former and minimize the latter. Given that
background and statistical information were already available, the SA focused on both the enforcement
capability of the government and on the involvement of school communities in canying out the
education reforms. The SA had two components. The first component, institutional, analyzed the
organization and legal framework of the education system as well as its constraints. The second
component, community participation, identified the main stakeholders, their values and interests, their
evaluation of the education system, their level of information about it, and their willingness to
participate. The SA sources consisted of desk review, focus groups, in-depth interviews, and a case
study. Focus groups, rather than individual interviews, were chosen for both practical and
methodological reasons: the practical reason was the limited time frame in which the SA had to work;
the methodological reason was that the reform would rely upon the capacity of groups (school boards),
rather than individuals (principals) taking over responsibilities in school management.
Findings
* The access and quality of basic education are considered a priority by the government. The
priority placed on basic education is reflected in the 1994-99 National Plan for Development and in
the government's budget. The first draft of the Plan identifies as main objectives, for 1995-1999,
to: (a) increase the coverage of pre-primary education from 24.5 percent in 1993 to 40 percent in
1999 and increase coverage in the first six grades of basic education from 83 percent in 1993 to 90
percent by 1999; (b) expand the EDUCO program; (c) improve the quality of education in first
through sixth grades by financing curricula, training and supplies; and (d) provide parents with
incentives to discourage school drop-outs and encourage teachers to spend more time in the
classroom. MINED's 1995 National Budget reflects this priority placed on basic education.
* Education is valued and parents' attitude towards teachers is positive. Parents speak well of
the school and teachers: "Teachers do miracles" according to one mother. There are fewer
criticisms than expressions of support for teachers, and criticisms are attenuated by generalizations
such as "80 percent of the teachers are very dedicated, very responsible, but 20 percent no longer
want to teach." Because parents value education, they are critical of the government, which,
according to many, "is neglecting health and education and building more roads. "
* The new education goals are not yet known to their beneficiaries. Although there is a
consensus that the education system should be changed, there is fear that the Government intends
to privatize and "municipalize" education, thus undermining children's sole access to social
mobility: "The reform is announced as if it were a privatization. If it [school] is to privatize we
parents would have to pay more, and would not be able to support our families."
Municipalization raises the fear that personnel decisions will be politicized even firther, and that



96                                   ANNEX 4
Social Assessment: Summary
of Main Results
they will be more arbitrary. A parent stated, "the municipal mayor's office is a political post.
Mayors do not have the training or the time to take care of education issues."
* The main constraints to reforming the education system are not economic but rather
social, cultural and institutional. The SA provides evidence of satisfaction with the system
among parents whose children are enrolled in EDUCO, although they must contribute to school
building and maintenance. EDUCO's system is the best way for parents to be taken seriously. On
the other hand, parents of children enrolled in traditional schools resent being called to meetings
only to be asked for money. Another bottleneck in the system is the lack of teacher incentives.
Thus, teachers seem to be more willing to move to the private sector because they feel it offers a
better incentive system. Teacher incentives are strongly tied to self-esteem. Low self-esteem is
correlated to lost prestige, poor benefits, arbitrary promotions, poor infrastructure and lack of
access to good training. When teachers are asked what would make them feel more satisfied, they
answer that they would like to receive more support from the Ministry as well as more incentives,
more training, and more teaching material. Finally, the Government's inability to disburse all of its
available financial resources is an indicator of its weak institutional capacity.
- Self-esteem and respect in the community are linked to participation for both parents and
teachers. In general, participation is considered important because it gives a role for people to
play in society, bringing social recognition and creating a sense of self-worth. For parents, this is
achieved through helping to define the interactive system their children belong to; for teachers it is
found as they achieve the professional status they lost.
* There is frustration with authority at every level. Results from focus groups indicate that
teachers don't trust either the government, which they think is disdainful, or principals, who they
think are erratic and unaccountable. One of the interviewed teachers said, "l was in a school
where the director didn 't even have a promotion list. One day he took off his belt and hit one of
my colleagues."  Parents also distrust principals, often complaining that they only want their
money, never telling them how the money is spent. On the other hand, principals claim to that it is
difficult to reach parents because few of them attend meetings. They are also apprehensive about
parents supervising their activities claiming that parents are not prepared to be active in their
children's education.
* Gender bias: women exercise their influence through husbands or companions. Women are
not completely marginalized from making decisions, but men are the ones who vote in the ACEs.
In 1992, 60 percent of the total ACEs' membership and 78 percent of their presidents were men.
* Repetition and dropout rates are high, particularly in the fist grade. There are several
reasons for high repetition in the first grade: teachers' inexperience, higher enrollment in first grade
than in any other grade, lack of teaching materials, low family income, nutritional deficiencies, and
absenteeism because of distance from school. Similarly, explanations for the dropout rate are
rooted both within and outside the system. Common justifications for dropping- out of school
include questioning the relevance and usefulness of what the student learns, claiming that earning a
living takes precedence over education, and believing that the costs of sending children to school
seem to outweigh benefits. Parents who live in communities far from education centers often wait

Social Assessment: Summary
of Main Results
until their children are older to send them to school. Another common problem amongst poorer
families is how to afford to have more than one child in school at the same time.
* The institutional capacity of the education system is fragile. This fragility is shown in many
ways:
- Since 1989, MINED has been supported by a multiplicity of bilateral and multilateral
organizations. However, an analysis of its financial cooperation projects during 1989-1993
confirms that the Ministry was able to execute only 42.3 percent of programmed financial
resources.
- MlNED's goals and strategies have been complemented by "compensatory" strategies
promoted by the Social Investment Fund (FIS) and the Secretariat for National Reconstruction
(SRN). Nonetheless, there is no effective coordination among the three offices to complement
and maximize institutional resources.  NflNED has not kept accurate records of the
contributions that the FIS and SRN have made to education, particularly in the area of
infrastructure.
- Besides the Constitution, there are approximately 300 laws in the education system. The
excessive number of laws results in confusion and ineffective regulation of the sector
- Approximately 110 NGOs with education programs are registered in El Salvador; about half
of them with technical training programs and the other half with management training
programs. NGOs are capable of expanding coverage with subsidies from the public sector, but
the SA reveals a distrust from both NGOs regarding the government and from the government
regarding NGOs.
- Current teacher training is problematic in three aspects. First, there is a concentration on
secondary education training and in three subjects. About 81 percent of the teachers are being
trained for the secondary level, 14 percent for the pre-primary level and 5 percent are certified
as special education teachers. About 21 percent of the training is in social sciences, 18 percent
in philosophy/humanities/esthetics and 14 percent in English. Training for the elementary
education level has been suspended since 1990 and training for physical education teachers
corresponds to less than 1 percent of total enrollment. Second, the Ministry is not fulfilling its
role as quality control enforcer for training. Third, teachers are not receiving sufficient training
for the posts they are to occupy. If this trend continues, supply and demand will be completely
incongruous by the year 2000 resulting in 83 percent of teachers certified to teach secondary
education while the demand would represent only 19 percent of total student enrollment. On
the other hand, the demand for elementary education teachers would be 72 percent by the year
2000 while the current supply is zero percent. The structure of the current promotion system
sends an implicit message that secondary education is more important than elementary
education, thus steering teacher training demand towards the former.
- The supervising function, which should be pedagogical, is also administrative. This creates
double expectations and inefficiencies.

Recommendations
As a result of the SA, the following strategies are suggested:
*  Recognize that MINED's most critical problem is not the lack of resources but rather inappropriate
management. It is suggested that the project include an institutional component to: (a) improve the
information systems for monitoring, evaluating and making decisions; (b) develop mechanisms to
increase coordination between the central units and units at the regional and community/local
levels; (c) improve the quality of the supervisory system and the participation of the private sector,
NGOs and groups from communities and universities; (d) perform a follow-up assessment of the
project's impact, including promoting an evaluation system for learning performance that should be
an integral part of curricular development; (e) structure and organize teacher training to: take
place during vacation periods, be recognized academically by the University of El Salvador, begin
as early as university training, and provide health care training to children and other community
members.
*  Communicate to society that the main goal of education reform is not to privatize education, but
rather to extend coverage and improve quality.
*  Suspend traditional hiring practices for teachers in order to reorganize the current system of
teacher administration and education coverage. To take advantage of EDUCO's innovations, the
traditional system has to be dismantled. Personnel hiring and replacement should be specifically
assigned to each departmental education center and managed by community or civil institutions.
*  Simplify the legal framework which oversees the functions of MINED to serve as the basis for
administrative and financial restructuring.
k Ensure that teacher promotion is not based solely on seniority, but rather includes merit. Salaries
should also correspond to the level of academic preparation and training required for each level.
Categories should be flexible enough to recognize and to give incentives for further professional
training. The Teaching Profession Law should: (a) apply exclusively to teachers (not supervisors,
directors and technical staff); (b) abolish position assignments traditionally based on seniority; and
(c) establish that teachers will compete for assigned posts and eliminate transfers of posts.
Action Plan
*  Support MINED's Communication Unit in implementing mechanisms for consulting school
communities (teachers, parents, supervisors, administrators and principals), NGOs, unions and
other governnental institutions, in order to keep them informed about the project as well as to get
feedback and suggestions from them.
* Disseminate community and teacher innovations on administrative, financial and teaching/learning
procedures through radio, videos and community meetings to help communities learn from each
other.



99                                  ANNEX 4
Social Assessment: Summary
of Main Results
* Support MINED's initiative of following-up the project's implementation with focus groups of
parents and teachers, adding new groups with different stakeholders, including school boards,
school administrators, and administrative personnel from MIN4ED.
* Promote public discussion of the goals and achievements of the new policy through workshops
with conmmunity representatives and NGOs. Listen to suggestions on adaptations and changes
needed.
*  Create mechanisms to inform MINED's employees of their new role and of the role expected
from communities.
*  Study and compare the Salvadoran reform and the experience of community participation with
other efforts carried out in Latin America to upgrade their experience in this material.
*  Create mechanisms to enlighten commnunities about the importance of having women participate in
school boards and in decision making processes.

Proposals for the modernization of the Education
Sector within the Modermization of the Public Sector
EL SALVADOR BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
PROPOSALS FOR THE MODERNIZATION
OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR
WITHIN THE MODERNIZATION OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
1.    This Annex summarizes the main aspects of three recent proposals for the modernization
of the public sector in El Salvador.  The first Public Sector Modernization Program was
developed by the previous administration which was in power between 1989 and 1994. The other
two have been developed by the current administration which took power in June 1994. The
common theme that runs through each proposal is the decentralization of the delivery of services
as a means of achieving increased coverage and improved quality in performance.
Background
2.    During the previous administration (1989-1994), the process of modernizing the
Salvadoran public sector was launched with the support of the World Bank (IBRD) (Structural
Adjustment Loans Ln. 3293-ES, 1991, Ln. 3646-ES, 1993, and Technical Assistance Loan, Ln.
3648-ES, 1993) and other external donors. Reform proposals were directed towards economic
and social policies, and the promotion of a strong market economy. The strategy focused on six
areas: institutional reorganization; administrative simplification; decentralization; privatization;
strengthening of human resources; and fiscal and financial management.
3.    The following three proposals are reviewed: (a) the IBRD supported Public Sector
Modernization Program; (b) the 1994-1999 Plan de Desarrollo Econ6mico y Social; and (c) the
Ministry of Education's (MINED's) general proposals for the modernization of the education
sector.
Public Sector Modernization Program (Programa de Modernizaci6n del Sector Pfiblico,
PMSP)
4.    Decentralization is one of the most important mechanisms developed in this strategy. The
commission for Decentralization and Municipal Development was created in 1992 and developed
concrete proposals within the scope of the general strategy. The document, "Socio-Economic
Development Policy and Operational Strategy" (Sept 1994), explains the main guidelines. The
model proposed for the strategy defines three areas to be tackled: local socio-economic
development; municipal strengthening; and decentralization.
Modernization of the Education Sector - Plan de Desarrollo Economicoy Social 1994-1999
5.    In the education sector, the main guidelines mirror the overall social sector strategy. The
main elements of the education strategy, according to the Plan, for the next five years will be:
stronger focus on human, financial and material resources; decentralization and community
participation; and privatization of some MINED actions, especially those related to technical
education.

Sector within the Modernization of the Public Sector
6.    Policies designed to meet basic needs pursued objectives consistent with the priorities
represented in the strategy, such as: to focus on poorer groups and areas; decentralization of
services; and the reduced role of the state, with stronger roles assigned to the private sector and
to the organized community. Emphasis was given to activities that could be completed in the
short- and medium-term. Medium-term activities included the modernization of those entities
responsible for planning and executing priority policies and services - the Ministries of Finance,
Planning, Health, Education, Agriculture, Civil Works, Economy and the administrative entities
working at the local level.
MINED's Proposal for Education Reform
7.    MINED's proposal for education reform intends to achieve two basic objectives: (a)
increased coverage of the system; and (b) improved quality of the delivery of education services.
While acknowledging the important advances that have been made since 1990, the proposal
emphasizes the need for institutional modernization of the education sector, focusing on the
administrative and planning systems.
8.    The proposal considers two innovations as the axes of the reform: (a) schools and
communities will jointly manage transferred resources for the operation and maintenance of the
system; and (b) the central office (MINNED's central units) will be limited to the financing and
regulation of activities, to technically support the system, and to evaluate its outcome. In other
words, the decentralization process is the chosen way to achieve the main objectives of the
reform, including a more effective relationship with the society, especially beneficiaries of the
education sector.
9.    The current institutional arrangements are plagued with inefficiencies due to MINED's
highly centralized structure. To remedy these problems, the proposal has developed the following
guidelines: (a) at the preschool and basic levels the management of services would be turned over:
(i) to the community in rural areas by expanding the EDUCO model to the whole system; and (ii)
in urban areas, management of resources would be the responsibility of schools with a gradual
process of transfer of funds and responsibilities to intermediary bodies (department, district); (b)
at the secondary level, resources would be directly transferred to schools; (c) for technical
education, management would be transferred to other entities of the private sector (NGOs or
profit oriented); and (c) at the university level, mechanisms of control of the provision and the
quality of services would be created.
10.   To guarantee that these changes are made, actions directed towards the improvement of
the administrative and planning systems are required. Many of them are detailed in the proposal.
Some of these include: an adjustment plan for technical and administrative personnel; creation of a
permanent system of technical assistance for administrative matters; revision of MINED's
organizational structure; implementation of technical and administrative career plans; reform of
the legal framework of the education sector; and improvements in the budget planning system.

Prioritization of Municipios
EL SALVADOR BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
PRIORITIZATION OF MUNICIPIOS
1.    The Ministries of Education (MINED) and Health (MOH), working together, have
developed a system to classify the rural areas of the municipios' in order to target social services
to those areas which are most in need. A ranking system for the rural areas in all 262 municipios
in the country was developed based on the following indicators: (a) 1st grade repetition rate; (b)
percentage of overage students in grades 1-9; (c) net enrollment rate for grades 1-9; and (d)
percent of undersize children. The first three indicators are based on data collected in 1993, and
the last on the 1988 census of size.
2.    Each indicator was classified into four categories and was assigned points according to the
category.
REPETITION RATE                    PERCENTAGE OF OVERAGE STUDENTS
Range                Points                 Range              Points
0-10                   1                    0-18                 1
10.1-20                 2                   18.1-36               2
20.1 - 30               3                   36.1 - 54             3
30.1+                  4                    54.1+                4
NET ENROLLMENT RATE                  PERCENTAGE OF UNDERSIZE CHILDREN
Range                Points                 Range              Points
0-40                   4                    0-15                 1
40.1 - 50               3                   15.1- 30              2
50.1 - 60               2                   30.1 - 40             3
60.1+                   1                   40.1+                4
These points were then summed for a total point score. Priority was assigned to the following
ranges of point scores:
Range                 Priority
13 -15                   1
11-12                    2
8 -10                    3
1-7                     4
Priority 1 represents those areas most in need of services.
3.    The following table presents the 135 municipios selected by MINED to receive services.
Activities in two parts of the project will be targetted to these municipios: the Expansion of
Access to Preschool and Basic Education Component, and the School Health and Nutrition
Subcomponent.
A municipio is the second administrative level of the governmental system. The levels, in order, are:
departamento, municipio, cant6n, caseria, comunidad.

Expansion of Access to Preschool and
Basic Education Component
EL SALVADOR BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
EXPANSION OF ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL AND BASIC EDUCATION COMPONENT
Background
1.    Despite the efforts of MINED in the last years, serious problems of coverage remain, especially
in rural low-income areas. This results in a lack of equity in the offering of education services. As the
data demonstrate, despite the fact that basic education is guaranteed by the Constitution, the reality is
that the coverage is less than universal. One of the best ways to increase coverage is to improve the
administration of education services, and one of the most effective ways to improve the administration
is to increase the involvement of the community. Thus, since 1991, MINED has established the
increase in coverage as an objective in its education policy, emphasizing preschool and basic education
services for the rural sectors through the EDUCO model.
2.    A fundamental element for the achievement of a quality school is the availability of adequate
physical infrastructure. The prime priority for the Government for improving school infrastructure is
the rural sector, especially in those schools administered under the EDUCO system. Rural schools are
clearly deficient in space provided by the community and much of the space is in a precarious state.
According to Social Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversi6n Social - FIS) projections, the Government
estimates that the financing of EDUCO schools would require approximately US$26 million. Emphasis
will be given to the geographically unattended areas insuring a norm of a maximum distance of 2.5 km
for children to travel to school. Infrastructure for new schools will be provided by FIS under an
agreement with MINED.
Objectives
3.    The objectives of this component are to support the increase of rural coverage in preschool and
basic education, and to strengthen the administrative mechanism through community participation as
developed under EDUCO.
Subcomponent la. Expansion of Access to Preschool and Basic Education
Description
4.    This subcomponent will support the expansion of the EDUCO program by: (a) increasing the
coverage of preschool education services in rural areas from 26 percent to 40 percent which will
increase coverage to 32,000 children in 1,000 new sections; (b) expanding the basic education
coverage in rural schools in 1st to 6th grades, from 77 percent to 90 percent by the end of 1999. This
will include the natural growth of the population covered in existing EDUCO sections and the
expansion to other communities in which there are currently no services (64,000 children attending
2,000 new sections); (c) changing the administration of education services in rural areas by gradually
transforming 3,070 traditional sections into EDUCO sections; (d) completing the second phase of the

microlocation study' for those schools not surveyed in the first phase to support policies options
regarding the infrastructure program; and (e) rehabilitate infrastructure to foster the transformation of
rural traditional schools to EDUCO schools, providing adequate infrastructure that will be
administered by the ACEs. The program will have the support of FIS to provide new schools when
they do not exist, including some substitution of current infrastructure that is inadequate.2
Implementation Strategies
5.    For the creation of new sections, the strategy includes the following criteria: (a) the existence
of a minimum school-age population (25 students per section) available to attend in both preschool and
basic education (1st & 2nd cycles); (b) a community that demands education services and demonstrates
a minimum level of organization; (c) the existence of physical space with at least minimum conditions;
(d) the existence of qualified teachers in the community; and (e) municipios defined as priorities (see
Annex 6).
Mechanisms for Execution
6.     The program for the creation of new sections has been adjusted to the capacity of MINED.
The results of a pilot program that will be executed by MINED in the current year to determine the
capacity of private institutions to accomplish the tasks of organization and promotion of the
community will be evaluated.
7.     The preliminary experiences and some studies seem to demonstrate that there exist in the
country a considerable number of institutions that could offer services. This is of great importance
because the planned increase of coverage already requires support for MINED.
Rehabilitation of Education Centers
8.     The project will finance the rehabilitation of the schools that are transformed to the EDUCO
model. The deterioration of these 3,070 schools is estimated as 17 percent of the cost of building new
schools. The rehabilitation of 1,535 classrooms will be required for the 3,070 sections that are
estimated for transformation. This will require a cost estimated at US$2,600 per classroom, or
financing of US$4 million that would be administered within the framework of this project. This will
be critical to foster the process of administration/maintenance under the full responsibility of the ACEs.
Under the SSRP, MINED started a program for maintenance of schools with the support of the ACEs
that will guarantee the maintenance of infrastructure.
' Under the SSRP, an intensive survey of the existing education infrastructure has been undertaken to determine
the costs for providing infrastructure, the amount of rehabilitation required for existing infrastructure, and the
areas where services are needed.
2 The infrastructure needs will not be financed using project funds.

Expansion of Access to Preschool and
Basic Education Component
Subcomponent lb. Strengthening the EDUCO Program
Description
9.    The first phase of EDUCO has given birth to a radical departure in the way basic
education is administered and operated in El Salvador. This rests on the principle of local
responsibility through elected Community Education Associations (Asociaciones Comunalespara
la Educaci6n - ACEs) for the provision of basic education services for the children of a given
community. ACEs have emerged with little planned effort to develop the specific skills which are
essential if they are to support the physical extension of schools, hire and monitor the performance
of teachers, develop supplementary education programs for adults through associated Parents
Schools.
10.   Given the close linkage between ACEs/Parents Schools and the wider process of
community organization and development, MINED decided to explore and test ways of
strengthening community-based strategies by working through NGOs or private organizations
which already have the track record and specific skills needed to work at this level. The pilot will
be developed in three departments (Cabanas, La Union and Ahuachapan) and an evaluation of the
strategy will be made at the end of the year. Based on the success of the pilot, the schedule will be
expanded according to the following table.
-Schedulfor Ex p   dithe Pilot Epenence
Year  I   Year 2      Year 3     Year 4     Year 5
ACEs                              300        500       1,000      1,800      2,500

11.   The involvement of the private and nongovernmental sector as working partners is
regarded as fundamental to the EDUCO approach as a whole, and especially to the community
component, as the programn enters its second phase.
Objectives                   4
12.   The broad goal of the community participation component is to strengthen the
community's engagement with the basic education sector, whether in the delivery of services or as
learners. There are four basic objectives in the attainment of this: (a) to build skills and capacity
in parents to operate ACEs effectively; (b) to improve the organization and learning environment
of Parents Schools as an essential component of the ACE strategy; (c) to further develop and
refine mechanisms which will ensure that the local community participates permanently and
effectively in the management of the basic education services serving its children; and (d) to
execute further in-depth studies of the operation of the current ACE model, drawing out the
lessons which can enhance community participation both in service delivery and in their own
education.



110                                ANNEX 7
Expansion of Access to Preschool and
Basic Education Component
Implementation
13.  In the first phase of EDUCO, the ACE concept, and even the structure, was present in
many instances but was largely unsupported by an institution-building effort on the part of
MINED. The second phase of EDUCO must therefore address the institution-building and human
resource development needs of the ACEs and of MINED itself. This implies necessarily drawing
on experience outside government as in the case of the current (1995) pilot project.
14.  It is envisaged that, within the framework of the proposed project, a national pilot
program should be set up, subject to competitive bidding, limited to NGOs or private
organizations, which over the full five years of project implementation would develop, implement
and document a support mechanism  for ACEs and Parents Schools.  The specific field
components of such a program would be: (a) the expansion of access to preschool and basic
education employing the ACE mechanism; (b) the development and implementation of training
programs for ACE, their members, their teachers and their supervisors; (c) the development and
implementation of training and staff development programs for MINED personnel so as to ensure
effective monitoring and support for the program; (d) the development and application of
curriculum, materials and training methodologies to address the range of problems faced by ACEs
and their clientele.
15.   The system of competitive bidding for social sector projects is already well established in
El Salvador. The disadvantages are that the procedure can be administratively demanding and
that the awarding agency, in this case MINED, must have a very clear perception of the purposes
of the exercise and the qualities sought in the ultimate winner. This relates again to the need for
enhanced understanding of the program on the part of MINED. The advantages of the system are
that it ensures the donor a measure of neutrality in the allocation of funds; that unless one agency
is dominant in a particular field, there can be a beneficial coalition building effect among the
bidders and, of course, it can have a restraining effect on costs.
16.   It is recommended that the funding banks and the national authorities proceed as follows:
(a) agree in principle to proceed with a competitive bidding process for the NGO-private
organization/community participation component of the proposed project; (b) reach mutual
consensus, drawing on external consultancy if necessary, on the criteria and content of a public
Request for Proposals; and (c) establish procedures for public announcement, submission of
proposals, refereeing and contracting.

Improvement in Education
Quality Component
EL SALVADOR BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATION QUALITY COMPONENT
SUBCOMPONENT 2A: CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT
Background
1.    Curriculum is a fundamental component of the education process. It determines the socio-
cultural contents that will ultimately shape the education of students. The main problems affecting
curriculum in El Salvador are lack of connection with the cultural environment, and the poor teaching
methodologies adopted by schools. These methodologies reinforce conservative teaching practices,
which emerge from obsolete pedagogic methods that disregard education as a dynamic social process.
This phenomenon is especially severe in El Salvador, a country which recently finished a violent
conflict, and is currently struggling to consolidate its peace process.
2.    Another important problem of the curriculum is its lack of continuity. The curriculum for the
first two cycles of basic education (1st to 6th grades) has been developed, by the Education
Improvement Program (Programa de Mejoramiento Cualitativo de la E4*caci6n),which was initiated
by MINED at the beginning of the 1990s within the USAID-financed SABE Project (Proyecto de
SolidfJicaci6n de la Educaci6n ). No curriculum for the 3rd cycle (7th to 9th grades) has been
adopted. This fact hinders a consistent development of students. In addition, no curriculum has been
designed especially for rural areas.
Objectives
3.    The main subcomponent objectives are to: (a) improve the quality of education for rural
preschool and the 3rd cycle of basic education (7 to 9 grades) through a curriculum improvement
program; (b) enhance the quality, and facilitate the use, of curricular instruments, planning programs,
and supporting materials at the preschool and basic education levels; (c) promote participation of the
community, teachers and school children, and the use of local resources in the process of quality
improvements at the preschool and,basic education levels; and (d) design and implement multigrade
programs for basic education students in rural areas.
Description
4.    The subcomponent will complement curriculum activities initiated by the SABE Project
These activities would involve: (a) defining learning objectives and content for core curriculum
modules at the preschool level in rural areas; (b) creating a curriculum for the 3rd cycle of basic
education (grades 7 to 9) that complements the one designed for the 1st and 2nd cycles; (c)
developing a multigrade pilot program in EDUCO schools; and (d) establishing a new student
promotion system.

Improvement in Education
Quality Component
Implementation Strategies
5.    The subcomponent will use the following strategies: (a) participation of all individuals involved
in the education process for the diagnosis of education, cultural and social needs; (b) decentralization of
the curricular process to the teachers. Based on the general curriculum guidelines established by the
National Directorate of Education and the local conditions, teachers should adapt their teaching
practices to better fit student needs; (c) development of a multigrade methodology for education in
rural areas, including specific instructional materials and community involvement in school activities;
and (d) use of appropriate technologies and innovative methodologies for adopting curriculum
requirements to children and community's characteristics.  These strategies would increase and
facilitate active participation of children, parents, teachers and other community members. Finally, the
subcomponent would also use: (e) implementation of systematic mechanisms for monitoring
curriculum instruments and curriculum improvements..
6.    The subcomponent will provide: (a) technical assistance for studies of curriculum and
student promotion; (b) production and distribution of approximately 26,000 curriculum guides for
the 3rd cycle of basic education, and 31,000 curricular guides for rural schools; and (c)
production of materials for multigrade classrooms.
SUBCOMPONENT 2B: TEXTBOOKS AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS
Background
7.    MINED had three institutions specializing in designing and providing printed materials: (a)
Centro de Producci6n de Materiales Educativos (CENPROME); (b) Servicios Tecnicos Pedag6gicos,
whose main project was the Plan Nacional de Libro Escolar (PLANALIBRE); and (c) Education
Technology. All of them received aid fromAlianzapara elProgreso, USAID and IBRD.
8.    In 1990, the National Directorate of Education (Direcci6n Nacional de Educaci6n - DNE),
which includes the Directorate of Education Materials (Direcci6n de Materiales Educativos - DME),
was created. Since 1991, DME has developed a program of providing conventional and non-
conventional materials for basic education with resources from the SABE Project. This program led to
the gradual inclusion of recurrent expenditures on instructional materials into the ordinary budget of
MINED.
9.    Currently, school textbooks are produced by education specialists, supervised by MINED
curriculum staff. Textbook printing is done by the private sector under the coordination of the DME.
The supervisors are in charge of following up the distribution of textbooks and instructional materials
to guarantee that all schools receive the mnaterials as planned.
10.    Deficiencies in the number of textbooks provided to students and schools was clear in a recent

Improvement in Education
Quality Component
Objectives
11.   The main objectives of the subcomponent are to: (a) provide to preschools, basic education
centers and Model Schools for Education Development (Escuelas Modelos de Desarrollo Educafivo -
EMDEs) the materials needed for the development of the national curriculum to support improvements
in education, and enhance teacher and student performance; (b) achieve long term sustainability in the
provision of instructional materials which support the development of the curriculum and the quality of
the education provided; (c) design and implement a Basic Package of Instructional Materials System
for preschool and basic education students in rural and urban areas; (d) promote the development of a
pernanent system for the production and distribution of textbooks and instructional materials, to
preschool and basic education students; and (e) provide equipment, furniture and instructional
resources to the district pedagogic centers.
Descniption
12.   The subcomponent will support: (a) the production and distribution of approximately
3,500,000 books, including two instructional booklets for preschool students, and four textbooks
(Spanish, mathematics, natural sciences and social studies) for grades I through 9; (b) modular
student instructional guides, to foster auto-instructional use by students, will be provided to
students in grades 1 through 6, both in urban areas and in the multigrade classes in rural areas;
and (c) books for about 3,400 school libraries will be provided to preschool and primary schools
in urban and rural areas; 2,000 classroom libraries will be provided to preschool and basic
education EDUCO schools; and 200 laboratory kits will be produced for 3rd cycle schools. Each
school library will have 2 copies of about 100 titles plus reference books, and each classroom
library will be made up of 2 copies of about 20 titles plus reference books; (d) a package of
instructional materials (canasta bdsica) to be distributed annually to all preschool and primary
schools in urban and rural areas; (e) equipment and laboratory kits to 3rd cycle basic education
schools.
Implementation Strategies
13.   Basic school package (canasta bszca). MINED will continue the policy of distributing
instructional material packages to schools at all levels. Through this strategy MINED will guarantee
that the schools/sections have all necessary materials for curricular activities. Two strategies will be
used for the provision of the basic instructional materials: (a) distribution of the canasta basica to
urban schools; and (b) provision of funds (local level and school funds) to schools to purchase
instructional materials.
14.   Textbooks, and curriculum guides and study programs. MINED will provide textbooks for the
1st and 2nd cycles of basic education; notebooks for first grade; and the booklets for preschool
education. Under this project, textbooks and curriculum guides and study programs for the 3rd cycle
of basic education will be prepared and distributed.
15.   School and classroom librarv books. Through this program, library books will be provided for
preschool and basic education schools. In addition, specialized libraries will be created in the Teacher
Training Centers (Centros de Capacitaci6n de Maestros - CCMs), and in the EMDEs.

Quality Component
16.   For the distribution of textbooks and the canasta basica, MINED will use the distribution
system established under SSRP which involved the contracting of private transportation firms to
carry pre-packaged textbooks and instructional materials from the central warehouses to the
departments, and from the departments to the districts. The distribution plan ensures that the
instructional materials will arrive at schools before the beginning of each school year, and new
textbooks will arrive before the usable life of existing textbooks expires.
SUBCOMPONENT 2C: IN-SERVICE TEACHER TRAINING SYSTEM
Background
17.   One critical input for improving quality in El Salvador is teacher training, pre-service and
in-service. Teacher training specifically designed for preschool education or the early years of
basic education barely exists. Currently, with the support of the SABE Project, several in-service
teacher training activities have been developed to support curriculum implementation.
Approximately 90 schools have been used either as in-service teacher training units or resource
centers. The impact of these activities has been limited due to the lack of pre-service training
programs for basic education teachers, and the lack of a systematic approach to improve the
quality of the teacher training programs.
Objectives
18.   The major objectives of the component are: (a) develop a decentralized in-service training
program through the EMDEs; (b) diagnose the in-service training needs at the local level (the
schools) for teachers, directors, and supervisors; (c) provide technical assistance to the curriculum
staff groups, at the national, regional and local levels (EMDEs); (d) design a follow-up model to
create feedback from the central to the regional level; from the regions to the EMDE; and from
the EMDEs to their associated schools; (e) establish a system to disseminate training results and
teaching experiences among teachers in the same education levels; (f) identify the pre-service
training needs for preschool and basic education and prepare an action plan for implementation;
and (g) prepare a study on human capital available for secondary education and an action plan to
identify further investments needed at the secondary level.
Description
19.   The proposed project will support the establishment of an integrated/decentralized training
system. This system will gradually phase three CCMs into existing education facilities, and
establish a network of EMDEs which will function as in-service training and pedagogical resource
centers. The EMDE concept has been built upon the existing experience of the Education
Training Centers (Centros Educativos de Capacitaci6n - CECs) which were developed under the
SABE project on a experimental basis.
20.   The proposed project will provided technical assistance for the: (a) design of plans and
programs for in-service teacher training programs; (b) design of a systematic assessment system to
identify in-service training needs for preschool and basic education levels; (c) production of
training modules and evaluation of outcomes; (d) development of an assessment study of the pre-

Quality Component
service training needs for basic education and preschool teachers, and (e) establishment of an
accreditation system for teachers.
21.   Training will be developed as: (a) seminars for teachers working in the EMDEs (80
hours); (b) programs offering specialized courses for: (i) preschool teachers (80 hours); (ii) basic
education teachers in grades 1 to 6 (80 hours), basic education teachers in grades 7 to 9 (80 hours
year 3, 40 hours years 4 and 5); (iii) EDUCO multigrade teachers (120 hours); (iv) school
principals (80 hours); and (v) supervisors (120 hours); and (c) follow-up teacher training at the
EMDEs through 12 workshops per year, supported by the district supervisors.
22.   The project will also provide: (a) funds for contracting out selected content/pedagogical
training programs to universities or research centers; (b) funds for contracting a study on
secondary education development; (c) furniture, equipment and rehabilitation of facilities to be
used as the CCMs and the EM4DEs; and (d) specialized training libraries at the EMDEs.
Implementation Strategies
23.   The strategy will be based on the establishment of a training system designed to be
implemented through: (a) the DNE at the central level which will be responsible for establishing
national teacher guidelines; (b) the CCMs at the regional level; and (c) the EMDEs at the local
level.
24.   The CCMs will be responsible for: (a) developing teacher training programs for preschool
and basic education teachers; (b) supporting the in-service teacher training programs to be
implemented by the EMDEs; (c) preparing teacher training instructional materials, and pilot
training programs; (d) contracting out content training programs to universities; and (e)
monitoring teacher training programs.
25.   Training personnel at the CCMs. The training professionals, currently working at the
Regional Departments of Education (about 12 in each of the regional training units), will form the
basic staff of the CCMs.
26.   EMDE training activities. The EMDEs will be responsible for: (a) in-service training
activities with the support of the CCMs; (b) functioning as resource centers for associated
schools; and (c) providing opportunities for exchange of pedagogical experience among teachers
of the associated schools.
27.   Teachers trained under the Basic Education Leadership Training Program (Capacitaci6n
de Lideres de Educaci6n Basica - Becas CAPS) will be assigned to each of the schools in the
network to function as animators of the in-service teacher training activities. An incentive will be
established to those schools and teachers that take part as trainers or monitors of associated
schools.
28.   Criteria for selecting the Model School. The following are the criteria to establish an
EMDE: (a) the existence of school principal and teachers trained by the Becas CAPs program;
and (b) infrastructure to accommodate the equipment and library to support the in-service training

activities. EMDEs will be gradually organized and equipped following the implementation
schedule for decentralization of activities to departments and districts ( see Annex 9).
29.   The implementation of the in-service training system will parallel the development of the
prototypes in the three selected departments (see Annex 9). During the pilot implementation of
the prototypes, the CCMs and existing CECs will continuing developing the training programs
following the guidelines and plans of the DGE. Special training programs for the trainers will be
provided by the staff development program.
SUBCOMPONENT 2D: EDUCATION ASSESSMENT SYSTEM
Background
30.   Under the SABE project, MINED began using achievement tests to assess the impact of
the new core curriculum for grades 1-6. However, the results of this exercise showed that
MINED's resources and capacity are too limited to monitor and evaluate academic achievement
and standards of teaching across the country, and in the different modalities of education services
provided. There is a need to create in the Ministry of Education an evaluation system to support
education policy options regarding teacher training, textbooks and instructional materials.
Objectives
31.   The objective of this subcomponent is to: (a) provide national, uniform criteria to
determine the basic academic objectives sought at the end of each of the three basic education
cycles (grades 3, 6, and 9) based on the development of learning capabilities and cognitive
development; (b) improve classroom pedagogical methodologies, reinforcing the responsibility of
schools and teachers for the learning achievement of their students; (c) mobilize public opinion to
support education reform; (d) provide a basis to target education investments to those schools
with the highest risk of student failure; (e) help define the priority needs for pre-service and in-
service training programs; and (f) strengthen the country's technical capacity for monitoring
student achievement as a tool to increase the education system's efficiency and accountability.
Description
32.   Considering the lack of experience in the country in carrying out achievement tests on a
permanent basis, this subcomponent would provide: (a) technical assistance for: (i) further
developing the existing system, including the preparation of tests, and implementing it on a
nationwide level; and (ii) designing training programs for the development of technical skills for
both local university/research center staff and MINED Curriculum Directorate staff members
responsible for the coordination of the evaluation assessment system; (b) funding for equipment,
office furniture and operating costs for an external evaluation unit (university/research center); (c)
the production and implementation of a sample of language and mathematics achievement tests,
and a survey to determine the impact of selected associated factors to the learning process for
grades not covered by the SABE Project; and (d) supplies, materials and computer services.
33.   The system of external evaluation will test, each year, a nationally representative sample of
those students finishing each cycle of the basic education system (grades 3, 6 and 9) on Spanish



117                                  ANNEX 8
Improvement in Education
Quality Component
and mathematics. Additionally, readiness tests will be administered at the beginning of first grade
and at the end of third grade. To cover the whole learning evaluation process a survey on the
impact of associated factors that might impact the learning process, will be applied to the sample
of schools selected. Three major criteria would be considered in the sample selection: (a) type
and size of school according to official categories; (b) source of funding (public, private and
public/private); and (c) geographic area (department, rural, urban and urban-marginal areas).
Implementation Strategies
34.   MINED will be responsible for: (a) coordinating  the student achievement evaluation; (b)
selecting the external agency to implement the evaluation under terms of reference approved by the
Banks; and (c) disseminating the results of the evaluation.
35.   The external agency (university or research center) will be responsible for: (a) selecting the
contents to be measured based on the study programs; (b) developing the pilot test; (c) producing the
tests; and (d) testing the school and student samples selected.
36.   Test samples. The tests will be administered every year to samples of 10 percent of those
children finishing each cycle of basic education. The only exception will be the readiness tests which
will be administered to all students at the beginning of first grade and at the end of third grade. The
samples from preschool and basic education schools should be determined according to the distribution
of the countrys population and sorted by: type of school (size according official categories); funding
sources (public or private); and geographic area (departments, rural, urban and marginal-urban areas).
37.   Pilot test. A pilot test will be developed consisting of two parts: (a) a survey of students and
teachers to gather information on teacher and student reactions to the test; and (b) the test itself. The
information obtained in the pilot will help to classify the items in three categories: usable items; items to
be improved; and items to be discarded. The items which can be improved will be revised and re-
elaborated for further development. The usable items will be included in the definitive version of the
tests, and will be part of an item bank.
38.   Final tests. The final tests will be designed to measure 14, 18 and 20 goals of the 1st, 2nd and
3rd cycles, respectively. Each goal will be measured with three items, rendering 42, 54 and 60 items
per test respectively. For each course and cycle there will be as many parallel forms as possible, taking
into consideration the number of items contained in the item bank for each goal. A survey will be used
to collect information on associated factors.
39.   Technical aspects. For interpreting the test results (related to criteria), it is necessary to
determine passing grades (number of points) or domain, per goal, in each cycle.
40.   Dissemination of test results. The dissemination of the results of the tests will be done as part
of the overall evaluation system coordinated by MINED's Evaluation Unit (Unidad de Analisis de la
Calidad de Educaci6n - UACE) in the Planning and Organization Department (Oficima de
Planificaci6ny Organizaci6n - ODEPOR)
41.   In close coordination with DNE, UACE will be responsible for: (a) defining the information
related to student achievements to be disseminated; (b) canrying on additional evaluation studies with

the same sample of schools, if needed; and (c) producing reports and supporting materials to deliver
the achievernent test results to different target population (parents, teachers, and community).
SUBCOMPONENT 2E: SCHOOL HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAM
Background
42.   Hunger and malnutrition diminish the physical and mental capacity of poor children.
Protein-energy malnutrition and the lack of certain micronutrients, especially iodine and iron,
reduce learning capacity and academic achievement. Deficiencies of vitamin A and iron also
reduce resistance to infections which can increase absenteeism associated with poorer school
achievement. In addition, research shows that children who go to school without breakfast have
difficulty concentrating, and perform less well than children who have had breakfast. This effect
is greatest in children who are also malnourished. School nutrition and health programs to
alleviate hunger and malnutrition can complement other effort to improve the quality of primary
education and contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the education system.
43.   Hunger and protein-energy malnutrition. According to the first height-for-age census of
1st grade school children conducted in 1988, one-third of Salvadoran children are malnourished.
In the least developed municipiosY, the prevalence rises to more than half. A Ministry of Health
(MOH) study conducted in 1994 corroborates the results of the census. It showed that 61
percent of preschool children in the least developed municipios are malnourished.
Objectives
44.   The overall objective of the component is to improve the nutrition and health of school-
aged children in the 135 target municipios (see Annex 6). Improvements in children's nutrition
status are intended to contribute to increased learning capacity which will improve education
effectiveness and efficiency. The specific objectives are: (a) increase knowledge of nutrition and
health among school children; (b) change certain health and nutrition practices among school
children; (c) decrease overall prevalence of parasitic infection in school children, and in the entire
community, served by the school-based anthelminthic program; (d) improve the micronutritient
status (vitamin A, iron and iodine) of school children receiving treatment through schools, and (e)
identify alternative mechanisms to facilitate the implementation of the school feeding program.
Description
45.   To begin to address some of the nutrition and health needs of school-aged children, the
project will include a component which will support interventions and activities to: (a) increase
knowledge and change practices related to nutrition and health in the school community; (b)
prevent and treat significant nutrition and health problems of school-aged children; and (c)
evaluate the on-going school feeding program while identifying and testing alternative school
feeding models for the municipios with the most poverty.
2  A municipio is the second administrative level of the governmental system. The levels, in order, are:
departamento, municipio, cant6n, caseria, comunidad.



119                                 ANNEX 8
Improvement in Education
Quality Component
46.   To improve knowledge and change practices related to school health and nutrition, the
program of Science, Health and Environment includes objectives related to nutrition and health.
The subcomponent will ensure that these objectives are incorporated into the curriculum of basic
education, as well as into the pre-service and in-service teacher training programs. Instructional
materials to support the curriculum will be developed under the Improvement in Education
Quality Component.
47.   To prevent and treat significant nutrition and health problems of school-aged children, the
subcomponent will support the following interventions:
(a)   Vitamin A. iron, iodine and anthelminthics. A total of 238,000 primary school
children in the poorest municipios in the country will receive iodized oil capsules,
vitamin A supplements, and anthelminthic treatment once a year, and iron
supplements every week, through the schools.  The teacher will have the
responsibility for distributing the medicines in cooperation with the community and
the representatives who are in charge of the school feeding program.  The
rnicronutrition supplementation will be coordinated with the fortification efforts
underway in the country.  Where possible anthelminthic treatment will be
combined with efforts to improve the school sanitary environment.
(b)   Vision and hearing. Vision and hearing problems will be identified in the group
receiving treatment as described in (a), and remedial actions taken for impaired
children. One teacher in each school will be trained to apply simple vision and
hearing tests. According to norms established with MOH, or with NGOs, children
will be referred to a second level for diagnosis and eventual treatment.
Agreements will be established with NGOs to treat certain cases. The teacher will
also institute measures to facilitate teaching children who have sensory problems,
such as moving the child to the front of the room. The pilot project will determine
the effectiveness of these additional treatments and their operational feasibility.
(c)   Evaluation. The component will also support a case/control evaluation of these
nutrition and health interventions. The impact on school (attendance, dropout,
repetition) as well as on health and nutrition (iodine, iron and vitamin A status,
parasitic infection, weight height) will be assessed. Issues related to costs and
delivery will also be evaluated.
48.   School meal program. MINED distributes lunch or an afternoon snack to almost all
school children through donations by international organizations, primarily the World Food
Program (Programa Mundial de Alimentacion - PMA). The ration of rice, oil, canned meat, and
nutritive drink provides approximately 400 calories and 11 grams of protein, and costs
approximately 1 colon (US$0. 11) per child per day. The subcomponent will support an
evaluation of the school feeding program focusing on: distribution, storage, preparation of the
food, number of rations, actual nutritional content of rations, consumption, participation of the
community, and other operational issues. Based in part on the problems and issues identified
through the evaluation, two pilot studies will be supported to test alternative school feeding
models to eliminate logistical or other problems.  One study will evaluate a system  of
decentralized food purchases, providing money directly to the community with which to purchase



120                                 ANNEX8
Improvement in Education
Quality Component
food locally. Another pilot will study an alternative program which delivers ready-to-eat snacks
(cookies and a nutritive drink) in those areas where infrastructure is inadequate for preparing food
at school. The proposed project will contribute only with the evaluation of programns actually
undertaken by other GOES agencies.
Implementation Strategies
49.   To assure close coordination of the three agencies involved in the implementation of this
subcomponent, technical agreements between MINED and MOH, and MIINED and the National
Secretariat of the Family (Direcci6n de Logistica Alimentaria de la Secretaria Nacional de la
Familia) will be signed. MOH will be responsible for: (a) revising the technical content of the
training programs; (b) identifying the areas of highest risk of deficit of micronutrients; (c)
approving the proposed therapeutic norms; (d) treating sensorial problems detected; and (e)
participating in the evaluation of the impact of the nutrition intervention. The reactivation or
creation of mixed commnissions of education and health at the central, regional and local levels is
proposed to assist in the coordination of both the education and health sectors. The National
Secretariat of the Family will be responsible for administering the school feeding program.
50.   Among the low cost interventions of known efficacy and easy implementation, the
decision has been made to apply programs of extended coverage (iodine, vitamin A, anti-parasitic
agents). For those activities that require a major effort from the education sector, pilot studies
will be performed to evaluate their feasibility before implementing programs of major coverage
(iron, detection of vision and auditory problems).
51.   Technical assistance will be offered to the Nutrition Unit (Unidad de Alimentaci6n) of
MINED to strengthen its capacity to manage.

Institutional Modernization Component
EL SALVADOR BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
INSTITUTIONAL MODERNIZATION COMPONENT
Subcomponent 3a.: Modernization of MINED.
Objectives
1.    The main objective of this component is to carry out institutional modernization and
strengthening of the education sector, a necessary condition to achieve the Basic Education
Modernization Project's objectives in terms of: (a) expanding access to, and improving the quality
of, preschool and basic education; (b) reinforcing the Ministry of Education's (MINED's)
capacity to set policies and guidelines for the sector; and (c) improving the public system's
capacity for delivering education services effectively and efficiently.
Description
2.    The modernization component includes: (a) design and implementation of a new
organizational structure for MINED, including central, departmental, district, and community
levels to reinforce education activities at the school center; (b) revision of the legal framework to
support the new organization; (c) design and implementation of the systems to support education
operations: resources management, information, planning, evaluation and monitoring,
communication and supervision; (d) establishment of a staff development program to improve the
technical capabilities of managers, technical/pedagogical, and administrative staff to support
improvements in the provision of education services; (e) introducing an adequate structure of
salaries and incentives to the teachers and administrative staff; and (f) development of a Pilot
Basic Education Fund to support pedagogical and methodological innovations.
3.    To achieve the goals of the education reform and to establish new ways to deliver
services, new processes, procedures and systems will be developed. These new processes and
systems will also be tested during the implementation of the pilot program (see para. 6). The
implementation of the actions to foster policy development and changes on a long-term basis will
be based on the review of MINED's organizational structure and legal framework.
4.    The changes to be made aim at establishing:
(a)   a Decentralized System of selecting, preparing and providing fiscal resources,
human and financial, that give automatic increases to the education centers and
improve the efficacy and efficiency of the system.
(b)   Planning, Management Information and Evaluation Systems of resources
allocation (human, physical and financial) based on the needs and priorities
identified at the local level, and linked to the planning systems at the departmental
and central levels. Management evaluation measures the opportunity, adequacy
and cost of the contribution of education services in improving the activities of
assigning resources. Evaluations will also look at the impact of services in terms



122                                 ANNEX 9
Institutional Modemization Component
of effects on production, social equity and in the achievement of society's
aspirations, measuring the relationship between benefits and costs.
(c)   Monitoring Systems able to influence policy formulation and analysis, to improve
resource allocation and the budget process, and to conduct joint evaluations with
external agencies to measure the impact of education interventions.  The
consolidation of the evaluation system within the education sector is one of the
priorities for the education reform. The evaluation activities are essential to foster
the technical-pedagogical system with dependable information necessary for the
development of strategies, technology and material to support quality
improvements. These activities will also support the planning activities which must
be based on reliable, and updated information.
(d)   a Management Information System (MIS) capable of supporting the decision-
making process in the areas of planning, budgeting, and evaluation of education
activities. Project activities in the MIS will strengthen the current MINED
Computer Center in terms of personnel and equipment.
(e)   Education Supervision. Although restructured in 1991, the supervision system
has not been able to provide sound technical support and guidance to teachers in
traditional or EDUCO schools. Several assessment studies done by MINED show
that supervisors undertake a variety of activities without a regular pattern for
supporting teachers in making learning more effective. To solve this problem, this
subcomponent would support activities to: (i) reorient the supervision system in
the direction of providing technical support to teachers and school principals; (ii)
disseminate results of education program evaluation; and (iii) give feedback to
correct shortcomings in the education process.  To increase the professional
capacity of the supervisors, the program seeks to achieve a qualitative change in
their functions by increasing the time employed in monitoring teaching activities
and by reducing their strictly administrative responsibilities. The major issues to be
addressed by the subcomponent regarding the supervision system are: (i)
establishing adequate supervision mechanisms; (ii) defining a clear assignment of
activities; (iii) enhancing supervisor technical skills and basic equipment; and (iv)
establishing incentives for the supervision system to visit schools in remote rural
areas. The new organizational structure for the supervision system will be based
on studies and processes to be tested in the pilot phase of this component (see
para. 6).
(f)    a Communication Program to provide a permanent information channel within
MINED, between MINED and the public, and to receive feedback from the
sector's stakeholders. The reform of the education sector has to be built on an
effective communication strategy, both to ensure citizen participation in the
education endeavor and to facilitate participation, commitment and the sharing of
common goals by the main actors in the education sector. A communication
strategy will include: (i) a social communication program to support community
participation and provide education planners with feedback; and (ii) institutional
communication activities to generate a flow of information within and among the



123                                 ANNEX9
Institutional Modernization Component
different agencies involved in planning, financing, administration, evaluating and
executing education services. The communication strategy will use social research
techniques, particularly the 'focus groups" technique, in the design execution and
monitoring of these programs. MINED's communication structures will be
strengthened in order to facilitate the coordinating and monitoring roles of the
Ministry. A long term communication plan for MINED will be developed as part
of the project. In addition, there will be a training program for the staff of the
Communications Unit.
(g)   Staff Development Program. The staff training program is an integral part of the
process of introducing new instruments and work methods into the education
sector.  The administrative staff must be regularly brought up to date on
innovations and administrative technologies developed in the sector. Technical
and managerial training must be provided not only for those to whom
responsibility is being transferred, but also to central officials who will have to
learn how to support local implementors more effectively. The design and
implementation of the staff development program will follow MINED's
reorganization to improve, in a timely and coordinated way, the skills of
administrators and technical/administrative and pedagogical personnel required by
the institutional development process. The staff development program will be
provided through 15 courses, 10 seminars, and 15 scholarships for short courses
specializing in education policy analyses, information, planning, budgeting,
education methodology and human resources management.
5.    Modernization Implementation. With project implementation it is expected that the
education units will have different functions and responsibilities as follows:
(a)    School level. The schools (education centers) will be responsible for: (i) operating
the education activities; (ii) preparing their school education plans; (iii)
administering their financial/material resources; (iv) selecting their teachers; (v)
generating data and indicators regarding the results of their operation (e.g. data on
promotion, repetition, desertion and coverage); and (vi) administering funds for
small purchases.
(b)   District level. The basic function of the district is to coordinate between the
department and the schools. The districts do not make autonomous administrative
decisions.  The supervision districts will be responsible for: (i) coordinating
activities and processes between the schools and the department; (ii) consolidating
and providing school needs in terms of teachers, textbooks, school material, school
meal program, and technical assistance for supporting teachers solve
teaching/learning problems; (iii) collecting information on public and private
schools within their jurisdiction; and (iv) supporting teacher training activities in
the Model Schools for Education Development (Escuelas Modelos de Desarrollo
Educativo - EMDEs).
(c)   Departmental level. The departments, organized as small and responsive offices,
will be responsible for: (i) preparing departmental plans by specifying education



124                      1          ANNEX9
Institutional Modemnization Component
program objectives and goals, budgetary allocations by school, and modalities of
service delivery (public, EDUCO, private subsidized); (ii) coordinating the
administration of the human, physical, and financial resources at that level; (iii)
monitoring the quality of school facilities and equipment; (iv) managing
department budgetary allocations and accounting; (v) consolidating and analyzing
public and private school data; (vi) monitoring district supervision activities; and
(vii) promoting community participation.
(d)   MINED, at the central level will be responsible for setting goals and general
guidelines, establishing priorities and quality standards, and providing systematic
evaluation of the public and private education systems. Its major activities will be:
(i) defining policies, education goals and program objectives; (ii) defining targets,
budgets and personnel posts for each department/district and school; (iii)
establishing basic curriculum contents and quality standards for teacher training
programs, textbooks, instructional materials and learning achievement; (iv)
evaluating student learning achievement, departmental evaluation of management
process, and outcomes, and impact evaluation of education programs; (v) defining
physical investments; (vi) establishing recruitment standards for both teachers and
administrative staff, and establishing career planning services and personnel
incentive systems; (vii) controlling cash flows, accounting and budgeting at the
national level; (viii) procurement activities when justified by economy of scale,
distribution cost and timeliness of delivery; and (ix) monitoring departmental
activities.
6.    Implementation Strategy.  The implementation of the new structure will be tested
initially in a limited number of departments which will serve as prototypes of the new structure.
The reorganization of functions and roles between levels, across all systems, and the strengthening
of managerial capacity at all levels, will be implemented in their entirety in the prototype
departments. Only after evaluating and standardizing the experiment will the new processes and
procedures be extended to the remaining departments. This strategy will allow for the control and
simultaneous testing of project components, particularly the modalities of delivery of the
education services envisioned by the education reform.
Subcomponent 3b: Pilot Basic Education Fund Program
Background
7.    As a consequence of the peace agreements and the economic opening of the country,
economic, political, and social changes occurring in El Salvador open new possibilities for
cooperation between the public and private sectors. As part of the principles of education reform,
MINED needs to explore various methods of delivering education services, in order to improve
the quality and efficiency of the public and private sectors. Innovative methods of combining the
public and private sectors in the provision of education services can eventually be adopted on a
broader scale within the modernization of the education sector.



125                       ,        ANNEX 9
Institutional Modernization Component
Objectives
8.    The main objectives of this program are to: (a) test alternative methods of providing basic
education through the municipios, NGOs or other non-profit private institutions; (b) establish a
more substantial and incentive-driven financing mechanism for piloting school-oriented
interventions to solve particular administrative and/or learning/teaching problems; (c) make
provision for future public education initiatives in the areas of pedagogical innovations and
institutional modernization which cannot be anticipated or launched immediately; and (d)
disseminate the pilot results.
Description
9.    During project implementation, the subcomponent will finance at least four innovative
subprojects that contribute to improving the quality, efficiency, and coverage of preschool and
basic education in the country. The funds allocated to this subcomponent would be set aside to
finance subprojects under the procedures, principles, and criteria of selection described in para 19.
The subcomponent will provide: (a) financial resources for implementing and identifying the
approved subprojects; (b) support to establish a monitoring system to follow-up the education
interventions financed by the program; (c) support to fully evaluate all subprojects funded; (d)
technical assistance for selecting the proposals; and (e) support for disseminating the results.
10.   The Fund's resources (US$1,916,000) will be divided as follows:  US$31,000 for
assessment and US$1,885,000 to finance pilot subprojects. It is expected that the Fund will not
be depleted before its third year. Therefore, approximately US$628,000 will be used annually:
US$571,000 to operate the pilot subprojects and US$57,000 to evaluate the implementation and
impact of the pilot subprojects.
Implementation Strategies
11.   Organization and Administration. The subprojects submitted for financing would be
presented twice a year to a Review Committee which would analyze, rank and recommend
approval of the subprojects according to established criteria (see para. 19).  The Review
Committee would be composed of the Minister, Vice Minister of Education, the Project Manager,
directors of MINED, and, as required, experts in subjects related to the types of subproject
proposals.
12.   The Minister and Vice Minister of Education will supervise the Fund. They will be
responsible for: (a) establishing the goals and policies of the Fund based on the Basic Education
Modernization Project's principles and guidelines; and (b) defining the Fund's goals.
13.   A Review Committee will be formed, which will evaluate each one of the proposed pilot
subprojects. This Committee will be formed by five voting members: the Project Manager, who
will preside over Committee, the Manager of OPCI, and the three Project Component Directors.
The Committee will be in charge of receiving the proposals.
14.   The Project Manager will be responsible for: (a) managing the Pilot Basic Education
Fund; (b) implementing the policies defined by the MINED, including the allocation and



126                                  ANNEX9
Institutional Modernization Component
disbursement of resources; and (c) preparing the procedures that will be forwarded to the
presentation and evaluation of the proposals.
15.   The Review Committee will nominate a Technical Group to rank the proposals applying
the established criteria (see Table 1). The Committee is responsible for: (a) receiving the
proposals; (b) selecting a technical group to rank the proposals; (c) reviewing proposal
classifications; (d) approving proposal classifications; (e) preparing the list of recommended
proposals to be approved by the Minister and Vice Minister; (f) establishing subproject
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; and (g) disseminating results generated by the
subprojects. The 'ho objection" of the Banks is a pre-requisite for the final approval of the
proposed subproject. Every time a proposal is rejected, the Review Committee must send a
formal reply to the requester explaining the reasons for the proposal's rejection.
16.   Once a proposal is approved, a technical agreement (convenio) between MINED and the
requester will be signed whereby the former agrees to disburse the resources approved under the
proposal, and the latter agrees to implement the proposed subproject.
17.   Eligible Subprojects. Every year, the Review Committee will choose the subprojects
that will receive financing, selecting the subprojects with the most merit according to the criteria
set in the annual priority plan established by the National Council of Education Innovations.
Potential replicability is a general criteria for subproject eligibility.
18.   For subproject expansion, the proposal plan should include: (a) coverage (timetable,
number of units to be established in each region, number of children that will benefit from
subproject, and cost); (b) organization of the management control; (c) organization of the quality
control; (d) financial plan and disbursement mechanisms; and (e) cost estimate of the expansion
subproject.
Evaluation of Proposals
19.   Each proposal will be classified and evaluated according to how it fits into the annual
priority plan of MINED. The classification system will be based on considerations such as
coverage, quality, efficiency, focus, and cost. The factors for consideration will reflect the
priorities of MINED policies and will be established annually. Points will be assigned to each one
of the five areas (coverage, quality, efficiency, focus of objectives, and cost). The subproject with
the largest number of total points will be selected. As a disbursement condition, the forms used to
apply for the Fund, which will include a clear list of its conditions and pre-requisites, will be
agreed with the Banks.                                                           _mod.doc

PROJECT ADMINISTRATION
1.    Project implementation would be carried out within the existing organizational structure of
MINED through the Project Management Office which would be drawn from existing units
whose operational and administrative responsibilities are directly linked to project components.
Overall responsibility for implementation of the proposed project would be vested in the Minister
of Education who would be supported in general policy setting and institutional coordination by a
committee composed of the Vice Minister of Education and Project Component Directors.' To
facilitate project implementation, a Project Manager would be appointed. The Project Manager
would report directly to the Vice Minister of Education on the day to day operations of the
project, and would be responsible for calling the directors to committee meetings.

Tenns of Reference for Project
Review and Supervision Schedule
EL SALVADOR BASIC EDUCATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROJECT REVIEW AND
SUPERVISION SCHEDULE
1.    Given that the project is cofinanced by the IBRD and IDB, and the comprehensive scope
of the actions that MINED has to perform to carry out education reform, the proposed project
will require close supervision, especially in the early years. An average of 20 staff weeks (SW)
per Bank of supervision are consequently budgeted for the first two years and an average of 19
SWs a year subsequently. The first year figures includes 10 SW per Bank for the project launch
mission. Fourteen staff weeks per Bank will be budgeted in 1998 to support the Mid-term
Review.
2.    The composition and staffing level of the supervision program for each year of project are
presented in Table 1. The supervision teams will be carefully planned, and will consist of the Task
Managers, IBRD and IDB staff, and consultants with expertise in the areas of education
(evaluation, teacher training, textbooks and curriculum), community organization, informnation,
communication, management and institutional development, procurement and project
implementation. Supervision missions will normally be conducted twice a year, in March and
September of each year, beginning in September of 1996. All missions will involve discussions
with project officials in MINED headquarters, as well as field visits, on the basis of which the
m-nission will evaluate the project.
3.    Project Launch Seminar. A Project Launch Seminar will be conduct around January 1996,
to: (a) review and approve the Annual Work Program for 1996, and to review counterpart
funding provision included in MINED's 1996 budget; (b) review implementation of the project's
rules and procedures manual, and familiarize MIPLAN, and MINED central and departmental
offices with the project's planning and performance monitoring procedures and the Banks
guidelines and procedures on procurement, disbursement and auditing requirements; (c) review
the project's requirement for progress reports on the implementation of the Annual Work
Programs; and (d) the logical framework of the project. The seminar will be followed up by a
series of departmental seminars organized by MINED to provide relevant information and discuss
project implementation procedures with the other international and national agencies involved in
implementing education projects and with the department and local officials of MINED.
4.    Annual Review. The purpose of the annual review is to assess project performance against
specific objectives and targets, primarily through the analysis of two documents: (a) the Project
Implementation Report for the year under review; and (b) the Project Action Plan for the next
calendar year. Annual Reviews will take place in September of each year.
5.    In preparation for the Annual Project Review, the Project Manager, in coordination with
responsible units, will prepare and present to the Banks, no later than August 31st of each year,
the following documents:
(a)   Project Implementation Report for the year under review, covering:
(i)   compliance with the Project Operations Manual;
(ii)   compliance with the covenants of the Banks Loan Agreements;

Terms of Reference for Project
Review and Supervision Schedule
(iii)   information pertaining to all Project Monitoring and Impact Evaluation
Indicators;
(iv)    status of procurement of goods and services;
(v)    progress report of Basic Education Fund subprojects approved; and
(vi)    highlights of findings, lessons learned and problems pertaining to the
technical, institutional, administrative or financial implementation of the
project;
(b)   Project Action Plan for the next calendar year, covering:
(i)    program of activities for each subcomponent of the Project;
(ii)   schedule of activities for each subcomponent of the Project;
(iii)    detailed teacher training plan;
(iv)    detailed plan for increasing/expanding EDUCO classes and assignment of
teachers to expand the preschool and basic education in the rural areas;
(v)    detailed multigrade plan;
(vi)    detailed institutional modernization activities, including plan for
decentralization of activities to schools and departments, staff development
activities;
(vii)    detailed procurement plan;
(viii)    detailed budget by source of funds and uses, for each quarter, specifying
counterpart funds requirements;
(ix)    detailed communication plan;
(x)    relative weights that define eligibility of Basic Education Fund subprojects;
and
(xi)   specific reports when needed.
6.    Project Mid-term Review. This review will be carried out no later than two and a half
years after the initiation of project implementation (September 1998) and will take the place of the
Annual Review in that year. It will have the participation of both IBRD and IDB. The focus of
the review is to ascertain to what extent the project has achieved its development objectives.
During such review, special attention will be paid to the education sector policies related to the
project, the effectiveness of the institutional modernization measures taken, the Basic Education
Fund, the evaluation of the nutrition and health subcomponent, and the allocation of fiscal funds
to the education sector. The Project Manager will prepare the same reports for the Project Mid-
term Review as for the Annual Project Reviews. However, if special issues warrant more detailed
analysis, additional studies will be carried out under the coordination of the Project Manager.
7.    Modifications to Project Design and Implementation Plans.  During Annual Project
Reviews and the Project Mid-term Review, there is the opportunity to update project targets and
discuss changes needed in project design or implementation plans. In this context, IBRD and IDB
may require that MINED prepare an action plan for the Banks review and approval within two
months following the completion of the Project Review. MINED will incorporate the changes
agreed upon in the Project documents, including, the Project Operations Manual if warranted.
The Project Manager will be responsible for organizing the Mid-term Project Review and
ensuring that agreed follow-up actions, satisfactory to the Banks, are taken in a timely manner.
