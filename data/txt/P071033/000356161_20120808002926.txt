1.        Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal

         The project was designed strongly in line with the World Bank’s poverty reduction
strategies at the time of appraisal, as outlined in the Country Strategy, and for India in the Ninth
Five Year Plan, for sustainable growth and specific support to the poor and disadvantaged. At the
time of design the Government of Karnataka (GoK) was also an important partner for the Bank in
terms of fiscal and state level institutional reforms.

         The State of Karnataka had a 37% poverty rate before the project started, most heavily
concentrated in rural areas, and where 70% of the State’s population was dependent on
agriculture. Karnataka has the second largest arid zone in India after Rajasthan, and relatively
small proportion of irrigated areas compared to other Indian States (26% of gross cropped area).
Thus a large proportion of the population is dependent on highly variable rainfalls and arid zone
water harvesting systems. At the time of design the GoK thus made specific requests for support
to rural development, linked to improved water management and supply. The Karnataka
Community Based Tank Management Project (KCBTMP) was thus established in parallel with
the Karnataka Watershed Development Project (Credit 3528-IN, 2001) and Second Karnataka
Rural Water Supply project (Credit 3590-IN, 2001).

         There are over 20,000 small tanks1 with areas between a few to several hundred hectares,
mainly established over the last couple of centuries, with a history of traditional management.
These are small reservoirs mainly to provide irrigation to command areas, but also multiple uses
for livestock, water recharge, for livestock and household uses. Historically such rain water
harvesting structures were constructed, operated and maintained by villagers using local skills
and craftsman and also managed with the help of traditional water managers (Neeruganthi). After
independence, the management of these tanks was formally taken over by the State. While
Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs, local governments) had been allocated responsibility of tanks
below 40 ha, those above 40 ha remained with the Minor Irrigation Department (MID). None of
the institutions had sufficient resources and systems to support tank rehabilitation, operation and
maintenance. Thus they have suffered from sporadic civil works activities and little maintenance,
aside from whatever ad-hoc efforts the farmers could do with the traditional (but largely
disempowered) water managers.

         The project was thus conceived, and approved in 2002, to build on policy changes
formulated by the State around 2000, such as recognition of water user groups, including multi-
stakeholder tank user groups (TUGs), and greater decentralization of resource management. The
State also established in 2000 a flexible and semi-autonomous support institution, the Jala
Samvardhana Yojana Sangha (JSYS, literal translation ‘water management improvements
society’), and also moved toward the gradual devolution of rights of user groups to collect water
charges for maintenance.

1.2     Original PDOs and Key Indicators
        The original PDO was to improve the rural livelihoods and reduce poverty through
community based approaches for improving and managing selected tank systems, with an end of
project date of January 2009. It had the following indicators:

1
    In the PAD a figure of 37,000 tanks is used. The figure of over 20,000 refers to findings from a more
      recent, yet unpublished survey.

          community-based, self-supporting, and sustainable tank development institutions in place
           and functioning
          meaningful participation of traditionally marginalized tank users
          agriculture production (productivity and area) covered by the tank system increased
          household incomes of direct stakeholders increased
          amount of funds generated and retained by user groups/local governments for operations
           and maintenance
          percent of local governments (i.e. PRI) involved in planning and coordinating technical
           support for improving tank systems.

1.3        Revised PDO and Key Indicators

         The PDO was not changed during the project. However there was a refinement of the
indicators for the PDO and intermediate outcome of the project during the Additional Financing
(AF Project Paper 2007, Annex 3), with an end of project date extension to January 2012. These
were to make targets more precise and consolidate a large number of additional indicators in the
original logframe. The main new PDO indicators2 were as follows:

              Self-managed and sustainable TUGs established,
              …[TUGs] covering at least 85% of the traditionally marginalized tank users
               organized under the Tank Management Institutes (TMI);
              At least 50% of farmers in the upgraded Tank Command Area increased
               (incremental) production of major crops by 35% …. and income by at least 25% of
               the baseline;
              At least 75% of landless tank users increased their income by 50% of the baseline
               value via the Income Generation Activities

           The AF also laid out Intermediate outcome indicators in the framework:

              Supportive legal and institutional framework established
              Formalized Integrated Tank Development Plans and O&M strategies in place
              JSYS Project management functioning effectively
              TUG establishment with poor women in management position
              Inclusion of landless users in Self Help Groups (SHGs) and benefiting,
              Completion of good quality civil works and improved water delivery
              Irrigated area increased
              Farmers practicing double cropping and improved farming practices, and tanks are
               used for fishery activities

1.4        Main Beneficiaries (original and revised)

        The PAD estimated the number of command area farmers (in 2,000 tank systems) to be
around 266,000 households, in nine dry area Districts and the estimated number of households
served by the project tank systems was 1.5 million households. The project was focused on
improving tank systems to help increase water storage, water use efficiency, and agricultural

     they consist of two separate measures.



                                                     15
productivity in areas where there is a large percentage of rural poverty in the state. The major
economic benefits of the project expected were in improved agriculture and horticulture
production, with respective net income increases, fisheries, forestry, time savings in fetching
water, and livestock. Employment opportunities, especially for marginal farmers and landless,
were expected to be significant, both in terms of labor for civil works, and from agriculture labor
requirements to deal with increased productivity. In addition to these 'economic' benefits, there
could be important (less quantifiable) benefits including increased social capital and
empowerment through the formation and strengthening of village-level institutions, more
equitable share of benefits by providing vulnerable groups, and broad capacity building for user
groups, PRIs, and state officials.

         With the additional financing, the nature of the beneficiary groups remained the same,
although the expanded target of beneficiaries would be those served by about 3,925 tanks (see
below 1.7), including the new talukas (sub-districts) of the Phase I ‘ongoing’ districts, and 8 new
Districts under the Additional Financing. The full target population was not specified in formal
documents.

1.5     Original Components

1.5.1 The project adopted a programmatic approach to integrated community-based tank
management, to be implemented under the supervision of JSYS. The project results were to be
achieved through the following three components:

        Component 1: Establishing Enabling Environment for Tank System Development. (USD
14.22 million). This would (i) help establishing a conducive environment and institutional basis
for community-based tank management; and (ii) develop a decision support system for planning,
operation & management; and strengthen project coordination and management at all levels.

         Component 2: Strengthening Community Development. (USD 19.56 million) This
included (i) human and institutional resource development and strengthening of local institutions;
(ii) preparation and implementation of safeguard action plans and gender action plans; (iii)
assistance for each tank system developed under the project; and (iv) communications.
Essentially, the project cycle at tank level was for around 4 years, with 1.5 years for establishing
implementation support and 2.5 years for community mobilization, training, and implementation
of civil works. Communities (TUG) were to participate in preparation of ITDPs through Public
Rural Appraisals (PRAs), with planning and implementation guided by local Non Government
Organizations (NGOs).

         Component 3: Undertaking Tank System Improvements. (USD 82.15 million) This
would provide for (i) the improvement of the physical and operational performance through civil
works of about 2,000 tank systems within the project area; providing the TUGs with appropriate
administrative and management support for implementing and managing the subprojects; (ii)
supporting on-farm demonstration and training with regards to agriculture and horticulture by the
Karnataka State Universities for Agricultural Sciences (UAS); (iii) promoting other income
generation activities for members of local tank user communities who have little or no access to
land resources, and (iv) developing appropriate technologies especially for reducing water use,
suitable to the general conditions found in tank systems.

1.6     Revised Components

        There were no major changes to components through the project period.


                                                16
      1.7      Other Significant Changes

              After the Indian Ocean tsunami, project funds of SDR 16.58 million (USD 25 million,
      about 21% of Bank contribution) were transferred to the post-tsunami rehabilitation in April
      2005, but without a change in scale or targets. There were already signs then that unit costs were
      lower than in design and could thus allow for this, and disbursement was relatively slow till then.

              In addition to the original project targeted 2,000 tanks, a further 1,225 were added under
      the additional financing (AF USD 64 million IBRD and IDA, project P102328) in 2007, at the
      request of GoK, as the project implementation was accelerating, and initial results were
      encouraging. The project was given an additional financing as this was considered a simpler
      option than developing a new phase project, while still allowing for a 4 year implementation
      period. At the time of AF approval, the original closing date was extended by three years to
      January 31, 2012.

               Further, in 2010, the original project was restructured to include 700 more tanks that were
      possible to include from savings that came from implementing the low-cost, community based
      approach and improved rate of INR to dollar/SDR exchange. Also, the original project considered
      very high contingency in the range of 28% of total cost of the project. This meant that the final
      target for the project became more ambitious with 3,925 tanks. During the preparation of AF, the
      exchange rate of SDR/dollar to INR was 25% less than during 2011-12 when the majority of
      implementation took place. It means the unit cost estimates during AF also resulted in significant
      savings.

              The World Bank contribution to the project finished as planned in January 2012, although
      there were some remaining works to be done in about 1,761 tanks. An extension that was
      requested by the government was not granted, and 25 million SDR of IDA credit (USD 35
      million) was cancelled prior to closure of project, and returned to the India portfolio. A total of
      US$9.71 million of IBRD has been left undisbursed. A large portion of the cancelled and
      undisbursed amount can be attributed to high contingency, exchange rate, and incomplete civil
      works that are now being funded by GoK.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Comprehensive and pioneering design. This was the first project in the country to take
up tank rehabilitation on a large scale and to test the devolution of powers to TUGs, with full user
participation during project preparation and implementation and during the operational phase of a
tank for irrigation. This was appropriate in relation to the prevailing resource management and
policies, and with regards to Bank involvement in the State, and interests in participatory natural
resources management at the time. GoI and GoK were committed to decentralization and
participation of water users in management, operation and maintenance (MOM) as per the
National Water Policy of 2002. It also built on an increasing number of Bank community-driven
development experiences in India and elsewhere.

         The project was designed with a vision for sustainable O&M of tanks through the active
participation of users during the planning stage, empowerment during the implementation stage
and thereafter handing the tanks over to the TUGs to own and carry out O &M. Since the tanks
serve multiple users, the design was comprehensive instead of focusing on only specific aspects,
such as large scale desiltation. The integrated approach could place greater emphasis on
managing both water supply and multiple uses of water demands (on farm water use and
agricultural management), and their importance in arid areas and for marginal groups. This
emphasis on an integrated and more inclusive approach provided a greater opportunity for more
sustainable development. The project was designed to address important areas of concern in the
use of water, especially sustainability in management, which requires community involvement.
Past irrigation projects had suffered with lack of participation, and often resulting in skewed
benefits to better off farmers, or lack of progress.

         2.1.2 High commitment for preparation. The borrower provided high commitment at
the start of project, spearheading the design and development of the project, and providing a
vision for the mainstreaming of the approach more widely. This was done with considerable
dialogue with experienced NGOs. The GoK set up a special society (JSYS) to implement the
project, supported by a highly visionary management team. JSYS was also to serve as an
institutional model for scaling-up. During the preparation stage, the state introduced reforms in
the Irrigation Act and operation and maintenance policy in order to empower communities and
ensure their participation in operation and maintenance. Initially, the project commenced with a
very small number of tanks (30) that were used to develop detailed guidelines and procedures for
scaling up the community based approach. Since not many NGOs were experienced in this
particular task, three highly experienced Anchor NGOs (ANGOs) were engaged to prepare the
guidelines and train other NGOs. Similarly the technical manuals for design and quality control
were prepared for tank improvement related civil works. The training material for induction of
new staff/NGOs, execution of works and quality assurance was prepared in a professional manner
which is now being utilized as a guideline by other projects. Although preparation took
considerable time, it ensured strengthening the capability of the implementation team including
NGOs and engineering team. The project preparation was done in such a way that documented
procedures and guidelines that the JSYS team was able to maintain continuity in during
implementation despite a large turnover of staff and NGOs. The project design and documents
now serve as examples for other tanks projects in the state and central schemes.




                                                18
2.1.3 Risks well considered, although increased with complexity. The risks identified in
design on the whole were well considered and the mitigation measures were largely sound and
integrated into the basic model. The substantial risks were: the exclusion of less powerful
stakeholders, lack of sustained commitment to JSYS, pressures to implement rapidly and focus on
works, and weak accountability in the use of funds at community level. There was also
considered to be a risk of weak post-project sustainability of benefits, but this was to be addressed
through strong capitalization of TUG funds, to support O&M and village development activities.
In addition, the project design mitigated for this by allocating a four-month period of training of
TUGs for supporting O&M activities at community level.

         Although, the project ensured to mitigate the risk of exclusion of less powerful
stakeholders through its design and selection criteria, it made the project design more complex
and challenging to implement from hydrological and socio-economic point of view. Particularly
in the original project, talukas were selected with low rainfall, high percentage of marginal and
small farmers, poor education and health indicators, to address the Bank and Government’s
objectives of helping the poorest of the poor. At the same time the project was setting out to test
difficult and complex concepts - participatory methods and self-sustaining institutions - on a
considerable scale, in areas where the risk of failure was potentially quite high, which would pose
challenges in getting early successes. All of this, combined with limited implementation capacity
led the newly created JSYS to focus on capacity building of implementation team, including
NGOs and engineers in a robust and regular manner.

2.2        Implementation

2.2.1 Summary of results. Despite the complex design of project and ten years taken to
complete the project, the project had satisfactory achievements in terms of outputs (Annex 2a)
and outcomes (Annex 2b), albeit with some areas of moderate achievement. The project has
successfully demonstrated the community based approach for improving and managing selected
tanks and has improved the rural livelihoods and income of rural communities. Central sponsored
schemes and several state projects have adopted a similar approach and to date this is the only
project which empowered the communities to implement, operate and maintain the tanks where
civil works were executed only after the formation of the community organizations.

         In terms of tank improvement works, the project was implemented in two phases, almost
like implementing two independent projects in two different sets of districts. Out of 3,925 tanks
considered, 3,710 tanks have been taken up for implementation, which account for 17% of the
tanks in the State. In order to rehabilitate, modernize and manage these 3,710 tanks, the project
formed 3,126 TUGs. Through NGO mobilization, inclusive Tank User Committees (TUC) and
Gram Panchayath Sub-Committees (GPSC) were established, with members covering the
multiple uses of tanks. The JSYS and TUGs oversaw the preparation of ITDP and the
implementation of the physical works; trained TUC members and ordinary members; established
TUG processes and procedures and generated community contributions. Since the project put
more emphasis on preparation, it resulted in slower implementation during start up years (with a
time lag of about 2 years) which also affected the additional financing phase. At the end of the
project, out of 3,710 tanks selected for implementation, 1,7423 had been or were about to be
completed with handing over to TUGs. The remaining 1,761 tanks were under implementation
with overall progress of around 50% (ranging from 10-90%) to be completed through GoK funds
by early 2013. In 207 tanks, there were some TUG activities, but civil works progress was

    1,640 formally handed over by January 2012.



                                                  19
negligible, they therefore were to be dropped, although the non-civil works such as agricultural
practices, fisheries, income generation activities, and training for operation and maintenance were
completed. The civil works and agriculture technology extension were generally of good quality,
with good support from JSYS and UAS.

         The resulting outcomes were generally good (discussed in more detail in section 3.2 and
Annex 2b): in terms of TUG inclusion and functioning, implementation of works, agriculture
support activities, and the resulting water capture and agriculture production benefits. The
agricultural support activities were designed in such a way that almost all the farmers belonging
to the tank system were served, which is unusual practice in irrigation projects. The project also
achieved benefits in terms of fisheries and IGAs. At project closure, there were some concerns on
sustainability, although developments in the period after closure of Bank financing indicated
nevertheless a strengthened impetus for support to TUGs and sustainability. The factors
contributing to these results are outlined below.

2.2.2. Mostly considerable institutional commitment and adaptation. Commitment and
leadership played a considerable part in the project’s successes. The project started off with
considerably high profile support and enthusiasm and continued under excellent leadership for
most of the time. Initially this was achieved with the support of local experienced ANGOs who
were mainly used for capacity building purposes4. The project developed excellent guidelines and
manuals for both physical activities as well as community mobilization. Throughout the project
phases there has been considerable evidence of strong commitment by some key JSYS Executive
Directors and staff to the process. The project had some disturbance during the transition period
of the AF. After some start up issues during AF phase, with Government and Bank efforts to
maintain continuity in project leadership, again there was stability and considerable commitment
to complete the project to a high quality. The Government has also ensured strong JSYS
leadership after the closure of Bank funding. Despite high staff turnover (more below) the basic
tank rehabilitation process has continued – rather robustly over the project years. Thirteen
training modules have been developed for community mobilization, which are used at various
stages starting from PRA to post implementation phase. The project team has also designed
various training programs to induct new implementation teams.

         The Project team at various times responded to issues and adapted processes, with use of
various studies. This showed a considerable commitment to learning processes, as are further
noted in section 2.3 on Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). For example quality of works was a
concern in the first part of the project, where Cluster Facilitation Team (CFT) NGOs were
responsible for engineering. This resulted in considerable delays to fix the issues, and to some
extent disappointment by communities. Nevertheless, this was addressed in the second part of the
project, where JSYS responded by bringing engineering support and supervision more in-house,
leaving NGOs to focus on social mobilization.

2.2.3 Insufficient human resources, especially at critical times of original project. A concern
affecting project progress was the high turnover of staffing at times at the different levels
including JSYS, District Project Unit (DPU) and NGO levels. Key technical positions which
through large parts of the project were poorly staffed included: (i) engineers working for the
NGOs; (ii) engineers in the JSYS; (iii) monitoring and learning specialists; and (iv) training and

    After about 2004 the four ANGOs were not involved as core capacity building functions and training
     modules had been transferred to the project staff. Also several of the mobilizing NGOs had considerable
     training capacities.



                                                     20
social specialists. The shortage of engineers was partly due to boom in infrastructure development
around the same time and the low salary structure of JSYS. Later in the project, it was corrected
by raising salaries and also by hiring retired and young engineers who were strengthened through
training. Since these were small works, the fresh graduates with adequate training were able to do
the quality control and supervision. At the state level, a lack of key staff for longer periods
contributed to a fragmented management information system (MIS, more below) and impaired
training program. The lack of a State Project Unit (SPU) Training Specialist meant the full in-
depth training needs and programs could not be looked at further.

          Some of these issues of turnover and lack of supervision staff particularly affected the
critical transition period between the original project and the additional financing. During this
period the project experienced many changes in leadership in JSYS and lack of supervision at
DPU. In the critical period of 2007-08, there were a total of seven executive directors and the
project was understaffed for district project coordinators, M&E and training positions. Due to
lack of supervision, the quality of works, services of NGOs and involvement of TUGs lagged at
this time. In order to fix these irregularities, NGOs were replaced with district facilitation teams
(DFT) for original project tanks and several revisions were introduced in design and procurement
procedures during the implementation of new tanks.

         In assessment of supervision of the project, Quality Assurance Group (QAG) expressed
concerns with regards to approving the additional financing despite the lack of completion and
sufficient confidence in outcomes of the first phase of the project in the period 2006-2007. Soon
after approval of the AF, the project experienced a turnover of Bank team leaders as well. The
new team leaders on both project and Bank side, had a considerable task to catch up with physical
implementation targets and ensure a good quality process. Perhaps due to this, during this period
and from that time onwards there seemed to be a few activities by the GoK to look at institutional
and O&M issues in detail, which are important for consolidating long-term sustainability.
Although the Bank team reminded the senior management team to look at institutional and O&M
issues during each mission, it was only prior to the closure of the project that GoK initiated the
discussion on mainstreaming and the role of JSYS for implementation of other tanks in the state.

2.2.4. Challenges to Start up and scale up of implementation. The challenges to starting up both
in the first phase and in the second phase seemed to have been considerably underestimated.
However, these challenges were overcome by stable and dynamic leaders. The challenges became
further worse when the project was scaling up and turnover in leadership increased. The
inadequate staffing, especially of engineers, as discussed above, was a major bottleneck in the
project performance and the single most important factor for slow implementation of key project
activities particularly during 2006-08 when the original project implementation was scaling up
with more than 1,000 tanks. Due to unstable leadership and shortage of supervision team, the
implementation was affected adversely and was of poor quality. The tanks were handed over
prematurely in order to show the progress for AF. After AF in 2008, the project was left with very
ambitious targets to implement, with almost 1,800 new tanks in 8 original project districts and 8
new districts, and complete 1,000 ongoing tanks under the original credit in the next 3.5 years.
The project had to also set up new DPU’s in 8 new districts and also conduct technical, social and
financial audits for the ongoing tanks that were handed over prematurely. Starting August 2008,
the project had a stable leadership as it started up the second phase of the project, but with some
of the same start-up challenges that came with delivering in the first phase. Although the project
team started working effectively, it was very time consuming job in the absence of an organized
information system, with the time required to complete the work that were abandoned in the
middle, and with limited staff who were already overloaded with the ambitious target for
implementation. The project was expecting to have two working seasons for civil works, but


                                                21
preparation took longer than expected. Major delays were experienced with the procurement of
the supporting key consultancies, including almost 60 NGOs and topographical survey
consultancies. Scaling-up faced challenges, including when the targets increased by the 700
additional tanks in 2010. Due to time taken in preparation for implementation and procurement of
contracts, the project was left with one working season during 2011 only, for most tanks.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E design: As with other World Bank projects established at this time, the KCBTMP
was designed to have a strong monitoring and learning (M&L) element. The M&L system was
intended to have four components: (i) performance tracking – to measure inputs, outputs and
outcomes; (ii) institutional tracking – for organizational learning and performance enhancement
(for JSYS units and TUGs); (iii) Internal learning – developing project processes; and (iv)
evaluation – to evaluate project impacts and outcomes.

2.3.2 M&E implementation: Initially an external organization was engaged to support the
JSYS with the development of the M&L system. Nevertheless World Bank missions in
May/June 2007 and May 2008 still found significant problems with the M&L program. These
included: (i) poor and disorganized collection, processing and reporting of project data; (ii) lack
of procedures for monitoring the performance of CFTs; (iii) failure to report and present data in a
format useful for JSYS management and staff; (iv) lack of understanding in the JSYS M&L Unit
of World Bank requirements and procedures for results monitoring.

         Though M&E and MIS have been attempted under the project, it could have been done
more efficiently if the large amount of data and information gathered was systematically managed
and used in an integrated manner. Only recently have there been efforts to integrate the data silos
within JSYS. A central difficulty with the M&L implementation has been the inability of JSYS to
appoint and retain a sufficiently experienced M&L Specialist. This has meant that suitable
systems have not been established at the outset in JSYS for data collection, processing and
consistent annual or quarterly reporting. Nevertheless the project did prepare quite detailed
Status reports for Bank missions as well as detailed agenda notes for Executive Committee (EC)
meetings, which to some degree filled the gap.

2.3.3 M&E utilization: There was a tendency to collect data on everything, rather than
focusing on the key data and the purpose of the data. JSYS developed and collected a wealth of
information including topo-surveys, revenue maps, tank information, and socio-economic
information and agricultural data for the tanks. The JSYS MIS systems for the ongoing project
and the tanks taken up under additional financing, were set up with two different work streams
making the compilation and utilization of this data challenging, especially in terms of evaluating
the project in its entirety. An online MIS was developed for the procurement and civil works of
the second phase of the project but the challenge remained to get the DPUs to utilize the system
and create uniformity in their data entry. Such an online MIS, if fully utilizable by the DPUs,
would facilitate the TUG handover process and manage the mainstreaming of the project systems
and management.

        Nevertheless the project did show utilization of M&E information to adapt processes.
Independent M&E studies have been conducted in 2006-07 and another in 2011 to understand the
impact of tanks implemented under original credit and management of JSYS. With these and
based on ongoing M&E, particularly during the second phase of implementation, the following
major changes were introduced in the project:



                                                22
      1. In the first phase, the tanks sizes were initially quite small. It meant high amount of
         efforts per unit of agricultural area supported, and less chances of benefitting irrigated
         area because such tanks were primarily for non-irrigation uses. During Phase II tanks
         above 20 ha were selected.
      2. The changes in NGO team structures and their outcome indicators were introduced. The
         engineering team was shifted from NGO to DPUs. The engineering supervision was
         strengthened with more accountable engineers.
      3. The role of third party QA/QC consultancy was revised to cover more tanks on random
         basis and soil and material testing facilities were explored through local institutes instead
         of mobile labs.
      4. All TUGs are expected to contribute 6 percent of the ITDP cost estimate in cash. This
         condition was relaxed to 3% to commence the implementation.
      5. Several changes were introduced in the specifications of civil construction works.
      6. During phase 1, the TUGs were allowed to implement the works directly, while during
         phase 2, the major works were implemented through contractors.
      7. In order to encourage more contractors, the procurement was facilitated through DPUs
         and the bidding process was simplified by allowing the quotations in percentages.

2.3.4 Methodological “soundness?, data quality, and M&E sustainability: As noted above,
the MIS was maintained by individual unit and in some cases web-based applications were
utilized. Despite a good collection of information, MIS systems were generally not well
integrated, resulting in some inconsistencies noted in Implementation Completion Result Report
(ICRR) process. Similarly there had been a number of studies, including those of the agricultural
universities, some of relatively good quality, however there was relatively little integration and
overall quality control and information management, perhaps due to the gaps in staffing. While
the earlier impact assessments had difficulties in comparisons with control years, due to
differences in rainfall variability, the impact assessment study of 2012 corrected for some of this,
and generally presented relatively robust and comprehensive results and analysis (see executive
summary in Annex). The analysis followed where possible the results framework indicators
(although as is mostly the case that no significance tests were done), as well as more qualitative
analysis of intervention processes, which provide an important basis for the reporting in the
ICRR.

2.4       Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Environmental Safeguards. From Bank supervision documents, it is clear that
environmental safeguards and management aspects were significantly mainstreamed from tank
identification, preparation and until implementation stage in the project. In the extended project,
environmental management measures as envisaged in the Social and Environment Assessment
(SEA) were being planned and implemented effectively in the field. The environmental
management aspects included foreshore plantation, appropriative tank silt removal and utilization,
and introduction of Integrated pest management (IPM) and Integrated nutrient Management INM
(discussed further in Annex 2b), and were largely successful. To further strengthen these
elements post-project, adequate funding/budget for plantation and related works, awareness and
monitoring are required. Such efforts would be useful to increase the sustainability of the project
but would also add value in creating environmental awareness within the community.

2.4.2 Social Safeguards. The final evaluation of the social aspects of the project found that the
participatory process has worked well from the planning to the implementation stage. The
participatory approach helped considerably to navigate the politically delicate situation of
encroachers in tank bed areas, and resulted in the voluntary relocation of 7,803 encroachers.


                                                  23
Economic rehabilitation for all vulnerable encroachers included a productive asset grant,
additional ration and food supply, and institutional credit for crop production and allied activities
in many cases. The participatory process also empowered and motivated the society as a whole
and women in particular, and ensured inclusion of lower castes and scheduled tribes. Linking
IGA to tank rehabilitation helped to involve marginal farmers and the landless in the entire
process. The gender strategy worked very well resulting in high representation of women not only
in TUG but also in TUC and other sub committees. The hired safeguard professionals from the
market facilitated the smooth implementation through building capacity within the JSYS and in
the community. The social safeguards are discussed further in Annex 2b.

2.4.3. Financial management (FM). The performance of JSYS in terms of financial management
was mixed over the years. GOK provided the required budget on time every year and there was
no shortage of budget in any financial year. In the first few years till 2007, the rating was
moderately satisfactory (MS), while in the year 2008 and 2009 the rating moved to moderately
unsatisfactory and finally unsatisfactory due to non appointment of internal auditors and delay in
implementation of Tally accounting and reconciliation of accounts. From 2010, the performance
improved and the rating improved to MS. In 2011 the performance further improved and the FM
rating was considered satisfactory, as reconciliation was carried out by the project. In the last 18
months, the project worked well in the FM area and consistently achieved the agreed actions. In
view of the large numbers of advances and the number of entities involved in this operation, the
FM risk was maintained as 'Substantial' throughout the project life, despite all mitigating
measures put in place.

2.4.4. Procurement. Overall procurement under the project was generally satisfactory. A key
feature of procurement under the project was that most of it was carried out at the community
level. The project started off with a well-established design and concept including the most
important aspect of procurement that is the procurement through communities. Procurement
capacity building, improving accountability and governance at community level has always been
a challenge, and also in this project it was time consuming and required sustained efforts by
JSYS. The procurement performance was moderately satisfactory until 2007 and it turned
moderately unsatisfactory during the transition of phase 1 and phase 2 when the project as a
whole was affected due to turnover in leadership and supervision staff. The situation improved in
the last few years of the project.

        The key procurements under the project included hiring of NGOs, survey and topography
consultancies and hiring of civil works contractors (more than 3000 shopping and 14 National
competitive bidding) for tank rehabilitation works. The civil works contractors were hired by
communities, which was a major challenge and evolved during the project phases.

         Some challenges experienced during phase 1 were addressed during the phase 1 itself
while some major revisions were introduced during phase II. For instance, the contract for
desilting was changed from hourly basis to output basis. The selection of well performing NGOs
was essential to the success of project who were required to mobilize the communities (TUGs)
and guide them during the implementation and also train them for operation and maintenance of
tanks. During phase 1, the NGOs were engaged based on time basis. Although overall the phase 1
implementation was quite successful and effective, the performance of NGOs was mixed. Their
performance was adversely affected particularly during transition of project from phase 1 to
phase II when the supervision mechanism at JSYS was not adequate. The major issues were lack
of social accountability mechanism at community level and taking advantage of illiteracy in some
communities. Based on the lessons learnt, the contract of NGOs was changed from time based to
output based. Because the physical progress of tanks can be affected some unforeseen factors


                                                 24
such as poor performance of contractor or climate which are beyond the control of NGOs, future
revisions on deliverables could also take into consideration individual TUGs capacities not only
tank physical progress.

         For the procurement of contractors through communities (TUGs), the majority of
procurements were shopping. During Phase 1, the communities were allowed to divide the works
and hire small contractors or implement them on their own. In the absence of proper monitoring
and execution, it was found difficult to measure the progress of actual works. In order to
implement civil works in a more organized and professional manner, it was agreed to implement
using certified contractors. Since the communities were not experienced in processing
procurement documents, and works were small, scattered and seasonal specific with very small
window for execution of works, challenges were overcome with changes introduced during phase
II. These were essentially about setting up contracts in manageable packets with adequate project
supervision (see Box 1 below). This strategy contributed to build a model where at the end of the
project the capacity at the community level was built up and social accountability and governance
was strengthened.

                    Box 1. Procurement methods supporting smaller contracts

       The letter of invitation was simplified in local language which required contractors to
        quote in percentage above/below estimated cost of the bid.
       The DPU Engineer was made responsible to conduct training at the community level and
        ensure the procurement process was followed.
       This strategy was improved by advertizing and opening the bids in the DPU office.
       In case of large works (from community point of view around $150,000), slice and
        packaging was followed. This procedure included dividing large works into several
        packages of small works which facilitated small contractors to participate and hence
        increased the competition while at the same time attracted large contractors. Desilting,
        bund strengthening and farm canals were thus packaged separately.

2.5       Post-completion Operation and Next Phase

2.5.1. Continuing support and expansion of the community tank management model: The
World Bank closed its support to the project on the 31st of January 2012, as planned in the
Additional Financing, covering also its support to the original project tanks. The ongoing project
has disbursement of 100% of the first project. In the additional financing, the disbursement was
81%, and SDR 23.34 million (USD 36.11 million) of World Bank funds was cancelled just before
the closure of project and USD 10.15 million was undisbursed at the time. The GoK, nevertheless
was committed with own resources to completing and handing over the civil works during the dry
season in the first half of 2012, through the implementation and guidance of the JSYS through
2012.

        The overall quality of implementation by JSYS and TUGs suggest that the process is a
good model with its low cost, community-based approach and with better potential for sustainable
maintenance of tanks. After start up, similar projects were set up in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and
Tamil Nadu and elements were also taken up under the National Project for Repair, Renovation &
Restoration (RRR5) of Water Bodies, which has been implemented nationwide. The RRR

                                                 25
program was to mainstream this community based approach all over India, and KCBTMP served
as model to prepare the program. The project team guided the central and state teams and they
followed the KCBTMP community mobilization model, except that the RRR schemes kept the
implementation of civil works with the department while in KCBTMP, the communities were
empowered to implement them. Given that JSYS has appropriately trained staff, and a project
design that ensures empowerment of communities, the ownership has been noted to be more
effective under KCBTMP than the RRR schemes. The communities themselves acknowledged
the difference between the two programs, with JSYS emerging in many ways as a strong
institution to continue to develop and support TUG formation and tank rehabilitation.

        While JSYS has been instrumental in the achievements of the project, in terms of
undertaking a comprehensive and holistic tank rehabilitation program, its long term position as a
support institution is only slowly developing. Commitments were made by the GoK during the
ICRR mission maintaining the role of JSYS to complete the works of the present project, with
government support of Rs. 1200 million (about USD 20 million). After the closure of the Bank
support and supervision, JSYS was able to continue with no major disruption. Now JSYS has
prepared a proposal to continue support to existing TUGs for the consideration by the Executive
Committee, including proposals to strengthen policy through an amendment or addition of rules
to the Panchayath Raj Act instead of issuing new tank irrigation act. While a formal program for
continued support from JSYS to existing TUGs is still under consideration, the development since
the closure of bank support seem quite promising. Further, post-project JSYS was approached by
Rural Development Department to rehabilitate new tanks with the project approach, and other
external agencies have shown willingness to support the funding.

         Post-project JSYS continued to support the TUG and Federations in developing the
linkages with several line agencies. In some cases NGOs have generated funds from other sources
to provide support to TUG and federations. More importantly, it has been noted that the District
local government officers are prioritizing TUGs during the introduction of various rural
development schemes. As there is no shortage of schemes with further planning and coordination,
it is expected that this will considerably help TUGs in sustaining the tank system and also in
generating resources for maintenance of the tanks.

2.5.2 Institutionalization: Based on various studies conducted by the project, a report on
Institutional Reforms for Mainstreaming Community Based Tank Management was prepared in
2005 and was discussed during 2006 (See Annex 2).Based on the findings of the impact
assessment studies, it was clear that the TMIs need hand holding support for a minimum period of
2 years, to ensure the core long term tank management functions are embedded (see section 4 on
sustainability and risks to outcomes). This is to ensure (a) O&M activities are carried out by
TMIs in an organized way, (b) TUCs and its sub-committees continue to function efficiently even
in dry years, (c) developing organic linkages with federations, and (d) establishing active linkages
between TMIs and other line departments (agriculture, forestry, fisheries etc.). Post-project some
of these actions were being taken up (see above), but at the time of the ICRR, the exact
mechanisms for this had not been spelled out. TUG federations have spontaneously formed, and
show great initiative and potential to support TUGs in the long term, but are only in their initial
stages of development. A number of more detailed policy and operational issues with regards to
tank management by communities should also be addressed, especially with regards to water
charges and coordination – which would help the sustainability of O&M. These are listed in the
Box 2 below.

2.5.4. Future Supervision and Evaluation: At the time of the ICRR officials in the State
government requested some further supervision support from the World Bank to provide some


                                                26
oversight and continuity into the final stages of the project completion in 2012. It was suggested
that this could be done through the ongoing supervision missions in the State for the Hydrology II
project (ongoing), and the proposed Karnataka Watershed Development II project. This would be
a valuable opportunity also for convergence on the wider water and catchment aspects in the
project areas and could help with follow-up aspects of M&E. This would be particularly helpful
with regards to monitoring impacts of tank rehabilitation and management on water availability,
distribution, groundwater and usage. A case in point for the Bank to follow up on is the the
project’s hydrology study expected in the end of 2012. There could also useful follow-up analysis
on the sustainability of community tank management capacity, and measuring environmental
management features. In particular, an analysis could take place of the entire tank project cycle to
determine what steps are essential and should be incorporated in future rehabilitation of tanks. As
it may be challenging for the MID to take up a 3-4 year cycle, but as a minimum there should be
some focus on TUG/TUC development and their participation in determining the tank needs. An
evaluation of the impacts of the implementation of tanks activities under AF due to end in 2012
would also be informative for future mainstreaming of tank activities.

          Box 2. Some policy and operational issues regarding ongoing tank management
Developing O&M institutional systems:
        Handholding is required for 2-3 years after TUG formation and completion of the rehab works if the
         TUG is to be sustainable. There is a need to create a unit in JSYS to deal with all matters of tank
         management, operation and maintenance (MOM) – setting service fees, carrying out maintenance,
         preparation of MOM manuals, fee recovery, keeping meetings, etc. JSYS also needs to provide more
         support to getting Federations set up to provide additional support and guidance to TUGs.
        Having meaningful activities to perform are the lifeblood of any organization. The TUGs have been
         successful in tank rehabilitation but now there is a hiatus as the TUGs have to redefine their activities
         and structure (no need for Sub-Committees as constituted for the ITDP). When there is water in the
         tank, there are activities for TUGs but when there is no water, the TUGs lose purpose to organize.
         Many Sub-Committees were useful and needed for the rehab works, but they need to be restructured for
         post-handover and in the end may need only a Finance SC, O&M SC and possibly also Conflict
         Resolution SC.
Water charges:
        At present water charges are fixed by the State, although TMIs can peg it higher than the minimum
         rate. This is good and bad, good in that there is a figure, bad in that it is not related to the needs of
         each individual tank. There is a need somehow to combine the two, and do community wide agreements
         on reasonable but effective rates.
        Operation phase – there is a question regarding what to do about borehole users who benefit from
         recharge by the tank. They should pay, and are the ones most able to pay. How to organize them as
         they are not traditional part of the command area (although some are)?
        Water charge recovery for villagers is difficult; they are not accustomed to collecting money from one
         another, especially for a tax. The tax should be renamed as a service fee and develop procedures to
         enable the TUC to establish what the fee should be for each tank and then propose this to the General
         Body. Problems also arise from governments pouring money into village communities through various
         initiatives (RRR, MNREGA) which undermines the self-sustainability concept and practice.
Other institutional options:
        Develop linkages with the watershed projects to coordinate the water resources management within
         catchments; otherwise there is considerable risk that upstream watershed users will increase their
         extracts and decrease water availability for downstream communities. This is a major issue which
         needs to be addressed by the GoK (and elsewhere in India).




                                                     27
         Explore the possibility of JSYS taking up the RRR work on behalf of GoK at the local level and all RRR
          work goes through JSYS.
         Facilitate cross learning across tanks projects in other states taking up formal programs. For instance
          in Andhra Pradesh, the tank water management has been integrated with community based
          groundwater management..


3.        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

         The project in broad terms still remains highly relevant in terms of its objectives and
design in the context of the Bank and Government of India policies and strategies at the end of
project (ICRR). The India 12th Five Year Plan still has objectives of inclusive growth through
increasing agricultural production and food security, where for rainfed agriculture convergence is
stressed between livelihoods, availability and access to food, ecosystem and human health, and
where water management plays a key role. The integrated tank management approach, and the
way it has been implemented under KCBTMP, still exemplifies this strategy. Similarly, the
design addresses the core pillars of the World Bank Country Assistance Strategy, of rapid
inclusive growth in poor rural rainfed areas, sustained natural resources management, especially
relating to water, and increasing the effectiveness of watershed management related services.

        In terms of national and state level strategies, implementation placed strong emphasis on
convergence between communities and PRIs, as difficult as this may be in practice. The challenge
in bringing together the PRIs, which have broad administrative boundaries, and the TUGs, which
have a narrow focus around tanks, was the lack of political interest from local governments in
small scale projects with the poor. Implementation may have seen more progress if greater effort
was placed on management of this convergence, rather than implementing works. There have
been recent discussions on integrating tank O&M works with funds from the Mahatma Gandhi
National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme (MNREGA) but this has yet to materialize.

At the time of design the project was to examine further institutional options and develop JSYS as
a long-term support institution. In implementation however there was less emphasis on examining
the higher institutional aspects and maintaining a dialogue on them – for example with regards to
the relationship between JSYS and the Ministry of Minor Irrigation. The project would have also
benefitted from a greater emphasis on the long-term O&M of tanks after the project close. The
O&M mechanisms, and TMI, local and State institutional support will be critical in addressing
some of the deeper causes of tank degradation historically, as well as in sustaining benefits.

3.2       Achievement of PDO

         The project objectives and indicators emphasized community involvement in both
implementation and management of tanks. These would result in improved rural livelihoods and
thus poverty reduction of an inclusive group of tanks users, mainly from increased agricultural
production and income generating activities. The achievement of project development objective
and its associated indicators, and also supporting intermediate outcome indicators from AF are
treated in Table F and examined in more detail in supplementary Annex 2b. Below follows a
summary of PDO indicators, largely based on the Impact Assessment Study 2012 (IAS 2012) and
project information, and UAS studies.




                                                     28
1) Self managed and sustainable tank users groups (TUGs) established. By 2012, the project
helped establish 3,126 TUGs covering 3,710 tanks (out of formal target of 3,925 tanks, a target
set with expected savings at a later stage of the project). Out of 3,710 tanks, only 207 tanks have
been dropped from direct project support, which had partial activities done by TUGs. Most TUGs
have managed funds, satisfactorily implemented tank rehabilitation and other activities – and
most importantly were responsive to their members. The TUGs have gone some way in
generating their own resources and with operation and maintenance activities by the TUGs just
starting up, there are encouraging signs of follow-up activities by federations and support from
other schemes. Several policies and legal measures were put in place to support the system, and
JSYS is continuing support activities, as are TUG federations. The PDO indicator 1 is achieved
to a large extent.

2) Inclusion of marginalized groups. The first PDO indicator included a separate element of
inclusion: ‘…Tank User Groups established… covering at least 85% of the traditionally
marginalized tank users organized under the Tank Management Institutes’. While difficult to
qualify, the project MIS showed 1.16 million TUG members (on average around 300 per tank)
covering a wide range of farmers and other users, such as livestock keepers, often traditionally
marginalized who were part of the project, confirmed by mission observations. This inclusion can
be considered a major achievement of the project and the second part of PDO Indicator 1 is
considered achieved. Almost half of the members are women, 30% are from Scheduled Caste or
Tribe, which is generally greater than in population. In addition a majority of members are
marginal and small farmers, and around 15% are landless, reflected in TUG management ratios.
Communities also picked the most marginalized to benefit from IGAs, fisheries and resettlement
support.

3) Tank Rehabilitation and resulting agricultural Improvement. Tank rehabilitation led to
improved water capture and use, achieved through the implementation of physical works that
were identified with community participation. Together with exposure to improved water
management and agricultural practices, this provided a range of agricultural benefits, leading to
improved livelihoods in a command area under the 3,710 project tanks for over 150,000 ha. A
detailed project study showed 20% increased irrigated area, 44% increased water volume, raised
groundwater levels, 42% increased groundwater extraction, and 23% improved water use
efficiency. Farmers clearly benefited from the tank rehabilitation works, with total production
increased by 47% on average compared to controls, which had increased to 12% (a 35%
incremental difference). As target 35% is for only lower half of the command area, the PDO
indicator target has been achieved considerably. This was also distributed well in that there was
20% incremental cropped area for tail end farmers, who usually are the last to benefit. Not only
this but in project tank command areas net income for farmers increased by 76%, compared to a
42% for non-project tank farmers (IAS 2012). Nevertheless the incremental 33% on average is
considerably better than for the target 25% for half of the farmers, thus this PDO indicator has
been exceeded. In addition, a number of improved agricultural practices were demonstrated by
the regional Universities of Agriculture Sciences (UAS), such as for improved seeds and water
management methods. This resulted in widespread adoption of basic agriculture techniques
appropriate to tank farmers for water scarce situations and for lower inputs of costly chemical
fertilizers and pesticides, directly covering 26,767 beneficiaries, with further exposure for over
200,000 farmers.

4) Income increases from fisheries and other income generating activities. The project
directly supported income generating activities, particularly for the landless and agriculture
laborers. A large proportion of the allocated IGA support funds were channeled through women’s
self-help groups, and a large portion who were lower caste or tribal, with 99,453 beneficiaries.


                                                29
The IAS 2012 indicated that incomes of members have improved by 56% comparing them to
non-beneficiaries (41%), with an incremental increase of 15%. Formally this achievement,
although considerable, is less than the target PDO indicator. This in part attributable to the small
loans available. In addition, TUGs supported resettlement of 7,803 poor encroachers from
farming tank bed areas and helped them in new livelihoods, often doubling their incomes (not
seen under other government programmes). In 1,403 tanks about 7,800 landless (75%) and
marginal farmers (25%) were provided incremental income opportunities from the fisheries
activities generating additional income averaging Rs. 5,179 per fisher household.

3.3     Efficiency

         The overall economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated to be 17%, lower than the
combined (PAD and AF) estimate of 19%. The estimated net present value (NPV) is Rs. 1.1
billion (USD 23 M) at a discount rate of 12% (the same rate as in PAD/AF), which is about 3/4th
less than the PAD/AF estimate of Rs. 4.6 billion (adjusted to 2012 constant prices using Indian
Consumer Price Index).

         The project has over achieved the targets in terms of (i) more area irrigated by the tanks
by 6%, and (ii) higher crop yields by 14 to 62% in non-paddy cereal crops, pulses and
horticulture crops. At the same time, the project has also under achieved the targets in terms of (i)
lower crop yields in paddy by 49% and oilseeds by 11%, (ii) reduced Water Surface Area (WSA)
covered under fisheries by 81%, (iii) reduced sustainability of demonstrated fisheries
management practices by 39%, and (iv) lower fish yield by 21%.

          The impact of over and under achievements of the targets were assessed. A net
incremental income impact is marginally higher by 2% at farm level for agriculture but lower by
22% for fisheries. However, agriculture accounted for 70% of the incremental annual economic
benefits at full project development as against only 13% for fisheries as projected in the PAD/AF
combined estimate. But this has not helped in achieving the targeted ERR mainly due to cost and
time over runs in the implementation project activities. In a 25-year project life, implementation
itself prolonged for 11 years, in which, only 46% of the project costs were thinly spread during
the first nine years and the remaining 54% are spent in the last two years, consequently delaying
the start of project benefits by four years and pushing the realization of phased project benefits by
five years. This has substantially reduced the size of NPV by 76% while pulling down the
realized ERR to 17%, despite reasonable performance in rehabilitating the number tanks as
targeted (94%) and better achievement in realizing irrigated area, more than planned by 6%.

3.4     Justification of the Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 The project development objective has been achieved satisfactorily by demonstrating the
viability of a community-based approach to tank improvement and management by returning the
main responsibility of tank rehabilitation and modernization and the subsequent operation and
maintenance (O&M) to village-level tank user groups (TUG). This approach has contributed to
improving the rural livelihoods and income of rural communities. The associated indicators, and
also supporting intermediate outcome indicators from AF are measured in Table F and Annex 2b.
The project met several of its important targets. There were generally minor shortcomings in the
project achievement of project objectives, relevance and efficiency. The following justifies the
rating:



                                                 30
         TUGs managed the tank rehabilitation process in an inclusive manner, involving a large
          portion of traditionally disadvantaged users, including women, lower castes and the
          landless.
         The project performed well in terms of productivity based on incomes arising from the
          agricultural outcomes, in turn as a result of good rehabilitation of a considerable number
          of tanks and the resulting increases in water availability and distribution. More
          importantly the project was able to cover the majority of stakeholders in demonstrating
          agricultural practices which is not very common in irrigation projects
         Efficiency is reasonable, partly due to the lower than planned unit costs and complex
          nature of the project, that were offset due to lengthy implementation period.
         Ensuring sustainability of TUGs is a challenging process that requires ongoing support
          for some years after handover to TUGs to manage the O&M of tanks. This as a major
          challenge and the project after Bank closure has stepped up efforts to strengthen this
          aspect. The detailed design and mechanisms for tank management and scaling up of the
          project model could have been articulated further, leaving this aspect slightly below
          expectations.

3.5       Over-arching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty impacts. The project was generally well targeted and inclusive, as noted in the
analysis of the PDO. It also had considerable benefits to a large number of small and marginal
farmers and landless. The IAS 2012 analysis (section 3.19) notes a doubling of average mean net
income per farmer from Rs. 7,547 from cropping in Kharif season to Rs. 15,573 compared to only
50% increase for control farmers (from Rs. 8,779 to 13,432 per season). The project benefited
213,900 tank command area farmers, 10% more than the target. 90% of them are small and
marginal farmers. Average farm financial income, at constant 2012 prices, increased by Rs.
8,015 per year for an average holding size of 0.75 ha, which is sufficient to lift at least one
member of the farm household above the poverty line based on the Indian Planning Commission
estimates for rural Karnataka for 2004/05, updated for constant 2012 prices using inflation index.
About 70% of the project beneficiary farmers are resource poor marginal farm holders. In terms
of directly benefited population in the project farm families, about 14% of them, namely 149,730
rural poor are potentially benefited by the poverty alleviation impact due to increased farm
income.

         Increased and improved irrigation coverage in the rehabilitated tanks, resulted in
intensified and diversified irrigated agriculture, generating additional farm employment for 8,050
persons per year. This will help the landless and resource poor households by providing jobs for
about 270 days in a year. This has the potential of alleviating poverty additionally for about
40,250 rural poor in the project area.

         Farm based income and employment generation activities generated by the project
through improved agriculture in the 3,710 rehabilitated tanks will have sustained poverty
alleviation impacts for about 190,000 rural poor in the project villages. This accounts for 17% of
the population in the project villages.

       The project has further generated employment and income through rehabilitation
investments in 3,710 project tanks during the project implementation period as follows: (i) wage
employment, estimated as 3.2 million person days, equivalent to 11,830 person-years in total and



                                                  31
(ii) wage income of Rs. 16,200 per year per job. About 62% of the beneficiaries under this
category belong to socially disadvantaged SC and ST groups.

        The project has also helped 51,715 resource poor families in setting up and sustaining
livestock dominated income generating activities which has the potential of generating average
annual income of Rs. 3,900 per beneficiary. About 48% of these beneficiaries are from SC and
ST groups and 21% of the beneficiaries are landless labor households.

3.5.2. Gender benefits. As noted in achievement of the PDO section, women formed a
significant part of the TUG membership and management. They were often given the
responsibility as TUG treasurers, recognized for their thoroughness and accountability. An
important strategy was the close relationship between the TUG and SHGs in the village,
importantly for the management and ensuring benefits of the IGA support to vulnerable groups
(often widows or women headed households). SHGs also mobilized diverse groups in the
community towards the tank related activities, and in a number of cases took the lead in tank
rehabilitation and significantly, sustained O&M. The comprehensive and participatory approach
to tank planning and rehabilitation was also important in identifying and implementing
appropriate structures, such as steps on the bund for access to clothes washing areas mostly used
by women, and highlighting drinking water needs (which form a considerable daily burden in
terms of carrying water by women). No detailed analysis was done of the timesaving aspects of
the project.

3.5.3. Distribution of benefits. Comprehensive analysis was not available as to the finer details of
distribution of benefits from increased water availability, although the majority of beneficiaries
were clearly the command area farmers – mainly marginal and small farmers. It is not clear how
larger farmers with groundwater irrigation outside the command areas may have benefited from
increases in groundwater levels as they would have larger areas of land for production (often
farmers had land in command areas and outside as well). The potential negative effects of the
increased number of borewells on groundwater availability as a response to increased recharge
was not assessed, although ICRR mission discussions noted that increases in borewells was also
heavily driven by market forces and subsidized electricity. A positive benefit not thoroughly
quantified, but of potential significance to livestock keepers, many of whom are poor and often
marginalized tank users, was the increased availability of water in the dry season for animals for
2-3 months, reducing traveling time, and improving animal health.

(b) Institutional Change and Strengthening

         The project has had a marked impact on the manner in which tanks are managed, at least
rehabilitated, and the level of engagement by the local communities. A sense of ownership has
been created and local leaders have emerged from the village communities. TUGs have become
established as the management entity for the tank, and have been found by the impact assessment
and the ICRR team field visits to be functioning entities (TUC members are knowledgeable about
their role and functions, meetings are held, members attend, accounts are kept, water allocation
plans are made, water management staff employed, charges are made and recorded, etc.). The
processes followed by the project, the preparation of the ITDP, the transfer of funds to the TUG
to carry out the physical works and other activities and the capacity building of the tank users and
TUC members have enabled and supported this change.

         A key indicator of this new found local capability is the “organic? growth of TUG
Federations: typically once user groups have formed and are functioning effectively they tend to
start looking outwards. Since 2005, this process has been happening in Karnataka with the


                                                32
formation of TUG Federations which have been formed by TUGs grouping and working together.
The Federations were established for the purposes of providing assistance and guidance to
individual TUGs, protecting tanks from encroachment, mobilizing resources for tank
development, representing TUGs to block and district administrations, assisting in times of flood
or drought and, in some cases, organizing provision of crop inputs and marketing of outputs. The
project has assisted the process by organizing workshops, initially in November 2009 for some
500 participants including TUG representatives and JSYS DPU staff from 18 Districts, and later
in individual Districts where TUGs expressed an interest in the process. An important feature of
these workshops and the subsequent support given by JSYS to forming and supporting these
Federations has been the realization that Federations represent an important mechanism for
supporting and sustaining TUGs in the future. To date, some 18 District Federations and 14
Taluka level Federations have been established in all project Districts and very recently these
groups have led to formation of State Federation.

         A Taluka Committee of Taluka level government agencies has been fostered in several
areas, with a view to supporting federations and TUGs to identify other sources of support. Given
the time required to develop and operate a Taluka Committee, this is clearly an important
initiative. However, the continued operation of this mechanism has not yet been formalized.

         As an institution, JSYS developed valuable expertise in the formation and support of
community-based, self-supporting and empowered tank user groups. This experience was
particularly consolidated during the last four years. In contrast to the changes that have taken
place in the approach to tank development and management adopted by JSYS, the approach
adopted by the State MID does not appear to have changed significantly over the project period.
From reports from TUGs of work carried out by the MID on tanks under the GoI funded RRR
program, tank rehabilitation and repair lessons from the JSYS approach have not been adopted,
with the MID focusing on physical works only, with little, if any engagement with TUGs or tanks
users. In MID’s defense, they are not staffed properly and are without resources to be able to do
more than focus on construction. This points to deeper institutional issues with regards to
irrigation and tank management.

         This was among the first major projects dealing with the water bodies through
communities. Prior to this project, NGOs did not have capacity to work on such water
management issues. The project provided a good platform for NGOs to build their capacity in
restoring water bodies and the water management particularly in agriculture. Based on the success
of this project, some well performing NGOs have been able to generate funding from other
sources and are helping the communities/federations to further strengthen.

(c) Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.3 A number of unplanned outcomes happened during the project period, largely mentioned in
previous sections: TUG federations emerged, and other projects and programs have adopted the
basic community tank management model. It was noted in some Districts that the District
Collector had requested the TUGs to handle other rural development schemes or RRR program, a
highly significant institutional achievement if replicated. Moreover the linkages with other
ongoing schemes will further strengthen the changes of their sustainability and provide funds for
O&M. ICRR field visits heard that the TUG capacity to write formal documents, management of
records and prepare and advocate resolutions helped in wider community activities. In addition,
the project also undertook specific rehabilitation works which took into account restoration of
ancient historical or religious related tank structures, and also repaired bunds in such a way as to



                                                33
provide road access for otherwise isolated communities (sometimes reducing traveling by over
half a day).

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 Important findings from the Impact Assessment Study 2012 which surveyed 13,000
farmers and IGA beneficiaries in 200 tanks, has been dealt with extensively in Section 3.2 on
analysis of PDO – and summary of the IAS is in Annex 5.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

4.1.1. Overall rating. At the time of the ICR many of the risks to development outcomes were
moderate, as much had been achieved in terms of generating returns at the community level, and
TUGs had been actively supporting the users in generating those benefits. In the long run, the
risks to maintaining the outcomes is considered Moderate, especially if strong post-project
measures are taken to further develop the sustainability of MOM functions of the project tanks.
Further it will be important that the State confirms the concomitant institutional support (from
JSYS and/or MID) to monitoring and further handholding the communities, so that there is not a
recurrence of costly rehabilitation works.

4.1.2 Agriculture and water management outcomes: The project has features that will contribute
to sustainability of the outcomes, but there are also some concerns about the continuity of support
and the availability of material that was introduced by the universities. Clearly with the direct
agriculture benefits, backed up by farmers’ views, the expanded and new individual farm
activities are likely to be sustained, which will be reinforced with better rains (in dry areas) with
likely further adoption of more successful technologies.

4.1.3. Continuing functions of TUGs: The ICRR mission met several TUGs from the early phase
which were sustaining activities in support of their members. At the support level, an unexpected
positive outcome of the project, largely driven by the TUGs themselves, has been the emergence
of TUG federations, who have helped member farmers in terms of marketing, addressing internal
TUG disputes, and also taking the cause of their groups to higher level politicians.

          The continuation of the TUGs and their ability to sustain the tank system will depend on
a number of issues. Key amongst these are considered to be the frequency with which the tank
fills, the value/benefit of the tank to the users, the quality of local leadership and the awareness of
the work required and costs to manage, operate and maintain the system. Strong leadership is
perhaps the central factor. The project has built considerable capacity in this regard. These
elements of TUG functioning: to raise funds and resources (both internally and externally from
MNREGA for example) help ensure that essential maintenance works are carried out such that
the benefits of the tank system are sustained.

         In case of the sustainability of the O&M of tanks structures, awareness is considerable
and all communities have developed some mechanisms to generate resources, for what they
strongly consider their own tank systems. The amount of funds generated and retained by user
groups for operations and maintenance is around Rs. 530 million for all phases of the project.

        However, though the TUGs have been formed and the tank systems rehabilitated there
remain some questions over the sustainability of the TUGs and their ability to sustain the tank
systems over time. Following the handing over of the tanks, the impact study shows that the
number of meetings of the General Body has declined (only a minor percentage TUGs reported


                                                  34
holding these meetings post-handover) and many of the Sub-Committees are not active6. In
addition, the payment of the annual membership fee has declined, with only 23 percent of TUG
members having paid the fee since handover. The decline in the number of General Body
meetings and Sub-Committee meetings, however, is a perfectly logical consequence of the
reduced activity following completion of the physical works and is perhaps a reflection of
changes in the nature of core functions of TUGs as they mature (noted in section 2.5). While
JSYS has appointed social specialist at district level to support TUGs to ensure regular meetings,
guide O&M and comply with statutory requirements, this was done at a relatively late stage of the
project, but may pick up with increasing efforts by JSYS post-project.

         The ICRR team noted that actual application of O&M activities were especially mixed in
drier regions and the degree to which plans match available resources for O&M was not clear.
Income to the TUG was limited, with the main source of finances being the initial cash
contribution and income from fisheries. There is little income from collection of the water
charges, with the TUC finding it difficult to make this charge. This is notoriously difficult in the
India context where charges are seen historically as revenue taxes. Collecting charges becomes
especially difficult in the case for tanks in the more arid zones where there has not been water in
the tank for 2-3 years. Clearly, mechanisms for O&M in dry years needs further support, both in
terms of funding and technical support. This suggests that after the four months of O&M training,
a mechanism is needed for further ‘handholding’ of the TUGs. Much of the resources required for
this can be generated through labor arrangements, either voluntary or through schemes such as
MNREGA.

4.1.4. Risk to longer term institutional support and mainstreaming: The difficulty is that a
handholding phase moves from the realm of a time-bounded project into the realm of regular
extension and support, which by design should have been managed by JSYS in the longer term.
There is currently no other government agency qualified to take on this support role. If JSYS is
seen only as a project implementation organization then its role ends with the completion of its
post-implementation activities. However, if JSYS is seen as a line agency organization, such as
the MID, then it could take on the role of providing longer term support to TUGs following
handover (at present confined to 2012 support to project completion).

(a) Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory:

5.1.1 Generally, the project was considered to have a comprehensive design, be technically
sound, and based on an innovative approach. The design covered important policy and
participation issues, targeted the traditionally marginalized populations and was backed up by a
range of studies to be responsive and address key issues in the State.

         The project design adopted an innovative approach to address some of the key water
sector issues in Karnataka particularly building local level ownership and responsibility for the
development and management of tank systems. The project design accordingly factored an

integrated approach to tank management through community based approaches suggesting
various models planned to be piloted for community management of tanks. The project
commenced with the implementing agency (JSYS) and dedicated team in place, and required
legal reforms to ensure proper implementation of project. The commitment exhibited by the GoK
and JSYS leadership through the efforts made by the Bank clearly indicates the excellent
preparation done by the Bank team in designing such a complex project which has since become
a model for other states of India to emulate. Clearly the Bank needs to be congratulated on this
design. However, the QALP-27 in 2010 rated the quality of design as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
The reasoning for this rating included (i) optimistic in requirements for start up and targets, for
such a new type of project; (ii) the capacity requirements for implementation in terms of available
expertise (such as field engineers), was underestimated, and policy and institutional change issues
(for example in the MID) were not fully examined or appreciated. The QAG considered the
project was not ready for implementation following credit effectiveness, however, the assessment
was conducted when the project was recovering from its challenging transition and had an
ambitious number of tanks to implement. The ICR mission is of the opinion that the QAG views
did not factor the following:

         (i) The project readiness analysis clearly indicated that the project had a robust start with
         the introduction of important policies on O&M, amendment to irrigation act and design
         guidelines and manuals for streamlining the new approach prepared with the help of
         highly experienced ANGOs;
         (ii) The capacity requirements were not underestimated given that the civil works were
         small and fresh engineers equipped with training could have easily fulfilled the staff
         requirement to a large extent. This was made possible during second phase of project
         through revision in salaries and allowing fresh engineers under the guidance of
         senior/retired engineers;
          (iii) Initially, the project target was for merely 9% of total tanks (22,000 tanks) spread
         over seven different agro-climatic zones in the state. There was a balance to be struck in
         deciding the target number of tanks given that if a small number of tanks, say 500, were
         taken up under the project, the project would have not been able to demonstrate the
         feasibility of approach for various zones and institutional setup in the state in economical
         manner. Hence there was a need to critically balance the numbers to ensure relevance of
         the project as more than simply a pilot. The project had phased approach by investing
         relatively more time in testing the approach in first 30 tanks.

         Despite the preparation time invested at start that were brought on by piloting new
approaches, setting up new systems, and gradually learning how to scale up the approach to the
large number of tanks under the project, the project was able to deliver positive outcomes. In light
of overall outcome of the project, the ICRR considers that the design as conceptualized was
largely sound.

(b) Quality of Supervision

    World Bank internal INDIA: KARNATAKA Tank Management (P071033) Quality Assessment of
     Lending Portfolio (QALP-2) 2010.

construction quality, and NGO team design. The multi-disciplinary bank team ensured that
appropriate guidance was provided to the borrower and its implementing agencies in all the
dimensions of the project. It is because of Bank’s efforts that the quality of civil works have
largely been found to be sound. The institutional support enabled piloting a number of
community engagement models from which two models appears to have been largely successful.
The monitoring of environmental and social framework implementation coupled with
inclusiveness of marginalized groups enabled a holistic development. Bank’s contribution was
appreciated by the client so much so that a request was made to ICR team to continue Bank’s
support in the post project period- a rarity in the projects in India’s Bank financed water portfolio.

         Although, the QAG notes that supervision was at time a concern prior to 2008, overall
the support especially in the first and last third of the project, was satisfactory, with stable
supervision team. Although some rehabilitation works are remaining in several tanks, the
supervision team provided support to the JSYS to remain focused to the fundamental concept of
the project that is mobilizing the communities to own the system. With this approach, the team
ensured the tank rehabilitation, to generally satisfactory quality and fiduciary and safeguard
standards during the entire project duration (except in 2007 when there was turnover in the Task
Team Leaders, TTLs and in JSYS leadership). The core elements of community participation and
inclusion of the marginalized users was consistently examined. Concerns arose during
implementation related to the complex requirements for procurement with the local NGOs. The
third party quality control engineers were brought on board to improve the quality of supervision
over the many tanks located in disparate and difficult to reach areas. This third party consultant
was necessary for successful implementation but contributed to slowing down that start-up of the
additional financing. As noted above the project had several Task Team Leaders through the
project period, though for relatively long periods, with the exception of right after the AF launch.
The new team leaders on both the project and Bank sides after AF, had a considerable task to
catch up with physical implementation targets and ensure a good quality process.

        On regular basis, the task team pursued with GoK the mainstreaming of this approach to
define the role of JSYS in longer term. In addition, more could have been done to identify
opportunities to link with the Watershed Development Project, which had joint TTLs in the
beginning of the two projects. Later in the project, this became more of a challenge as different
ministries were involved and were difficult to coordinate. However, given the complexity of the
design and the challenges in scaling up, the project was still able to adapt to changes and
implement the project with satisfactory outcomes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.

5.1.3 Given the analysis above the overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. While the
timing of additional financing could have been better assessed, and follow through on
sustainability aspects, the supervision team, by the end of the project, put in considerable efforts
to largely complete a challenging and innovative project with integrated and participatory tank
rehabilitation process.

5.2     Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                                 37
5.2.1 The borrower (GoK) provided high commitment at the start of project, spearheading the
design and development of the project, and providing a vision for the mainstreaming of the
approach more widely. The State has also provided funding support to the project implementation
throughout, as well as commitment (RS. 1200 million) to finish off works in 2012, after closure
of Bank project. During the preparation of project, the government demonstrated its commitment
by providing a working platform with the approval of operation and maintenance policies and
also orders to facilitate the financial sustainability of TUGs. The society with multi-disciplinary
unit was setup which had highly trained professional to implement this innovative approach.

         The project has served as guideline for national program RRR and other state project.
While the concept has been welcomed even at national level, GOK position on the
institutionalization and scaling-up of the community based tank management model, and of JSYS
and its respective roles with MID, have been left hanging for large part of the project, from 2006
up to early 2012.

         Although the government orders facilitated the functioning of TUG during the project,
the Tank irrigation act which has been drafted is yet to be approved which will broadly address
rights of TUGs, as well as on water charges. There were also some missed opportunities in terms
of systematic convergences with line departments and PRIs, and their related programs, such as
RRR. It must be recognized however, such convergence are challenging and not just in
Karnataka.

         During first four and last four years of the project, there was stability in the executive
directors. The JSYS team was highly committed to first prepare it well and scale up the approach
on larger scale. The project performance was seriously and adversely affected during 2006-08
when there was a very high turnover of project executive directors for the critical middle period
of the project. The continual changes (7 new Executive Directors between 8th May 2006 and 20th
August 2008, 11 Executive Directors overall during the 10 years of the project) meant a loss of
focus and continuity on key activities, as well as being disruptive for project staff and real
progress was only made when the current ED was appointed in August 2008 and remained in post
till mid of May 2012. This continuity in leadership was important to implement the AF phase of
the project. The Government has taken due diligence to provide competent executive director as
his replacement during the project close.

(b) Implementing Agency (or Agencies) Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2 The JSYS has overseen the implementation of a complex and largely groundbreaking
process, and taken it to significant scale. The project implementing agency (JSYS) has had a
number of highly dedicated staff and executive directors, particularly in the beginning and in the
last few years. The project had prepared excellent guidelines, manual and had setup induction
trainings with the help of leading ANGOs and other agencies (as also briefed in Section 5.1). The
turnover in engineers and other support staff was overcome through induction and on the job
trainings. Despite the changes in leadership, some key staff at SPU were able to maintain the
standard procedures and ensure smooth implementation.

         Nevertheless, the several project systems due to their complexity and challenging areas
took a very long period to set up. There was high turnover in the M&E specialist and training
specialist at SPU and in the district level supervision staff particularly district coordinators and


                                                  38
engineers. which meant critical strategies and systems were not tackled comprehensively or with
continuity. The project was able to collect a wealth of data through their M&L consultancy and
while this data was not managed in an integrated way, it allowed for the number of studies and
quantitative analyses to be carried out under the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.

5.2.3 The Borrower has shown a generally good commitment to the basic implementation of
the project and JSYS, with several committed staff overseeing important stages of the project, and
playing a key role in its considerable achievements. Post project, there have been some positive
development towards the sustainability in TUGs and also mainstreaming the approach in Zila
Panchayath tanks.

6.       Lessons Learned

6.1.1 The mission has identified an initial set of lessons learned which may have wider
applicability for scaling-up and adaptation:

        Community based tank engagement in rehabilitation and management can work.
         JSYS has developed well-documented and robust processes and procedures for the TUG
         formation and tank rehabilitation phases. The participatory process (with TUG ownership
         and stability) works very well and delivers results on the ground – and fosters further
         innovation. The project demonstrated the simplified procurement process through
         communities for civil works that may be useful in other tanks and other programs. The
         training material for TUG mobilization is quite robust and is already being utilized by
         other projects.
        Leadership is required at all levels and produces dividends when in place. It is evident
         that there was strong leadership and commitment to the community-based development
         philosophy and approach at the start and end of the project. In addition there were some
         committed professionals within JSYS who maintained the approach throughout the
         project. This was particularly important during the middle period when there were many
         changes at the ED level.
        Well performing NGOs are the key to success of the approach. The NGOs play a key
         role in success of community based approach. The selection criteria should set smart
         indicators to evaluate their performance. The NGO’s with demonstrated performance in
         the area may be prioritized so that it ensures that they can sustain it beyond the project.
         For instance, some well performing NGO’s have managed to continue even after the
         project due to their commitment and long term presence in the area.

        New models and institutional mechanisms need considerable attention to start up and
         scaling up issues and related capacity development – with commitment to a longer
         development process, and not rapid scaling up. It requires greater realism and analysis
         of institutional issues and the gradual build up of capacities based on experience. Legal
         and institutional transformations need concerted assistance on change management,
         which is too seldom given sufficient support or time. Significant institutional change
         including of departments and federation type structures (not just a community level) often
         requires timescales of 8-10 years.




                                                 39
   A commitment to a longer process should also limit the pressures for scaling-up too
    rapidly until models are well tested. Additional financing should perhaps be triggered
    after key sustainability outcomes in existing project areas have been achieved. Further
    expansion into new Districts with required new management units, done only after
    readiness measures have been assessed.
   Managing common property resources is highly challenging. In order to manage a
    group, first start with relatively homogeneous and small groups and identify
    reasons/benefits for them to be together. Nevertheless the well managed development of
    a multi-sector user group, with strong links to (but not control by) local government is
    critical to solving conflicts and addressing multiple needs.
   Also with climatic variability affecting such common resources such as water it is
    important to allow for the project to cover several seasons to allow for the occurrence of
    dry periods in order to understand how management can cover multi-year variability.
   Start simple and with tanks systems which are likely to be successful. The project had
    two underlying aims, to test a new approach to tank development and to provide support
    to disadvantaged areas, or communities. It may have been better to focus on developing
    and testing the community-based approaches in locations where the environment
    (climate, local leadership, local commitment) was likely to lead to more successful
    outcomes. Having developed and tested the model, it could then have been expanded to
    more challenging localities and communities.
   There needs to be an institutional support system to continue testing and refinements
    in the model. While the process is well tested and refined, there is some room for
    delegating further flexibility and fostering further innovation within the approach, for
    example for managing contract rates, member contributions, water charges, allocating of
    funds to different works, federation development, etc. These elements are ideally done by
    a flexible institution like JSYS, working closely with main line departments.
   Monitoring, learning and evaluation systems need to be integrated and evolve in a
    concerted manner. MIS systems need to modular by component needs, but develop
    under a common framework. Further any information systems should be strictly
    functional to stakeholder needs, from communities to managers. This in turn requires
    strong management to develop this as the project grows so as not to result in fragmented
    and duplicated work.
   Management, operation and maintenance – the managing of the tanks - needs to take
    a much more central stage, with more thought out systems, detailed planning, capacity
    building and basic institutional support, and policy such as for water charges, and
    associated resource mobilization – from a much earlier stage in the process.
   Agriculture extension needs farmer to farmer interactions. Farmers’ field schools have
    been shown to be an important complementary mechanisms to impact large numbers of
    farmers, where farmers are empowered to learn from each other and access resources –
    helping to strengthen sustainability post project.
   Integrating tank management with agriculture is critical. This requires practical and
    sustained linking and coordination mechanisms between TUG farmers, participatory
    farmer groups, with support agencies, be they State departments, universities or other
    agencies. Commitment of staff that are managing such linking and coordination must be
    complemented by stability in their positions. Further the roles and convergence activities
    with Department of Agriculture need to be developed and formalized.
   Greater focus on water management. Though the project was essentially about the
    management and use of water there were no water management specialists on the project,
    at any level. Water management at the tank level is relatively poorly understood, and
    little practical guidance was given to TUG management and water users on alternative


                                           40
                  approaches to water management. Good water management – linked to crop planning - is
                  central to service delivery and thus in turn to fee collection. If the TUG is not providing
                  a decent level of (water management) service it is unlikely that water users will
                  contribute to the costs of maintaining the service.

         6.1.2 With increasing pressures for water and the changing nature of the rural economy, it will
         be important to provide conceptual and institutional support to:

                 Foster further convergence between water management and agriculture extension
                  systems. The project demonstrated the benefits from grassroots involvement in water
                  management on agriculture, and demonstration effects in related new technologies.
                  Further strengthen the linkages between agriculture interventions with water
                  management, especially to optimize the use and sharing of saved water (e.g. SRI).
                 Further develop planning and management and measurement systems which
                  incorporate the tank in the wider hydrological perspective, and user demands on it -
                  encompassing groundwater and watershed dynamics and monitoring, combined with
                  addressing changing agricultural trends and demands as whole. Box 3 below provides
                  some detailed examples of improving the management and measurement aspects.
                  Associated newer technology such as CAD and hydraulic simulation models can be also
                  incorporated in to tank rehabilitation planning.

Box 3. Specific lessons learned from the tank civil works improvement subcomponent include the following:

 Since majority of tanks do not fill up, it may be worthwhile to redesign the tank spread area with an aim to reduce
  evaporation. Accordingly, the tank operation policy for using it as groundwater recharge or source of surface irrigation
  needs to be supported by appropriate studies.

 For the future tank rehabilitation works, more attention should be given to command areas from the water management
  improvement point of view, rather than massive lining of existing command area canal network. It is advisable to pay
  more attention to requirements of regulatory structures such as intakes, division boxes, culverts, outlets, cross regulators,
  energy dissipaters, flow meters etc. which will allow TUGs to distribute water among member farmers in more reliable
  and timely manner. Command area canal lining should be used only for limited sections of the system which are
  technically required to reduce enormous seepage losses.

 A more comprehensive indicator needed to measure a reduction in the quantity of water abstracted given the
  improvements in distribution efficiency, scheduling, level of control over water, on-farm application, and water
  management. In water scarce environments, this is an important factor when more water is made available by head end
  water users to users in the tail end. Further work is required to measure water abstraction against water demand based
  on crop type, area and irrigation requirements. For the flow measurement structures, it is advisable to select one or two
  varieties of structures (simple and the most acceptable for farmers) and include them as standard structures in the
  designs and provide the required training for their operation.

 TUGs' O&M plans need to be developed in sufficient details including TUGs O&M expense estimation and full required
  costs for the systems’ adequate maintenance, irrigation scheduling and related subjects. Continuous monitoring and
  technical assistance in TUGs operations is essential for at least two irrigation seasons after the handing over of the
  systems.

                                                               41
7.1.1 At the outset we thank you for sharing the draft ICRR at various stages for feedback from
JSYS and having incorporated the suggestions made by us. Now we have gone through final
version of ICRR sent by you, which is well drafted and quite succinct about the project processes
and outputs. However, we have feedback regarding the project ratings for your consideration.

Regarding 5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory

Feedback: The borrower, GoK has accorded all the necessary policy support and commitment to
the project. The separate tank act which was envisaged in the beginning of the project was felt at
later stages as not expedient since appropriate amendments existing Irrigation Act and Rules,
Panchayat Raj Act and Rules and necessary Government Orders are adequate to empower the
TUGs and support the process of community based tank management in the State.
Though the project World Bank funding came to an end on 31st January 2012, the GoK has
provided Rs.120 Crore to complete the KCBTMP in all aspects in the same project mode and
spirit. In this background, we are of the opinion that the rating of the Government performance
needs to be revised to “Satisfactory? from the proposed “Moderately Satisfactory?.

Annex 2a        Component Outputs

COMPONENT 1. Establishing an Enabling Environment for Tank System Development

       The intention of the KCBTMP was to demonstrate the viability of a community-based
approach to tank improvement and management by returning the main responsibility of tank
development to village-level user groups, and provide a model for wider application.

Subcomponent 1.1. Policy, Planning and Legal Environment

a) Establishment of Jala Samvardhane Yojana Sangha ( JSYS)

         To address the limitations with the public sector agencies the GoK established the Jala
Samvardhane Yojana Sangha (JSYS, Water Management and Improvement Society) as an
autonomous and independent society as the implementing (‘nodal’) agency for the KCBTMP.
The JSYS was registered on 23rd October 2000 under the Societies Act 1960. The JSYS has a
Governing Council chaired by the Chief Minister with an Executive Committee. The JSYS has
the State Project Unit, (SPU) and District Project Units (DPUs) with multi-disciplinary teams
drawn from both the public and the private sector in both the SPU and DPUs. A State Vision
Statement provided authority to JSYS over tanks in the project area.

b) Preparation of proposed legislation (i.e. Community-Based Integrated Tank Management
   Act).

         To provide a legal basis for the formation and registration of Tank User Groups (TUGs)
the Government of Karnataka (GoK) issued the Karnataka Irrigation and Certain Other Law
(Amendment) Ordinance (2002) allowing formation and registration of TUGs under the Societies
Act (1860). A proposed Community-Based Integrated Tank Management Act was to build on the
above ordinance to build community-level ownership of tank development across the state.
While not pursued, a Tank Maintenance Policy (TMP) was instituted in 2002 to define the rights
and responsibilities for the maintenance of tanks systems. The Policy established the right of the
TUG to collect water charges, to determine how water charges would be allocated, and to have
responsibility for tank system maintenance. Amendments were made in 2002 to the Karnataka
Irrigation Act (1956) and the Karnataka Irrigation (Levy of betterment contribution and water
rates) Act (1957) to include the expression “Tank User Association? in addition to the existing
expression of “Water User Association?. Two separate Government Orders (one for Minor
Irrigation tanks in 2006 and one for Zilla Panchayat tanks in 2010) were passed in order to confer
fishing rights on TUGS.

c) Preparation of a long-term institutional strategy and development plan for the
   implementation of community-based and demand-driven tank management.

          In 2006 the project prepared a report on “Institutional Reforms for Mainstreaming
Community-Based Tank Management Approaches: Long-term Institutional Strategy and
Development Plan? (JSYS, 2006). This report was prepared by an 11-person Inter-Departmental
Study Committee convened by JSYS consisting of members from the MID, Rural Development
and Panchayat Raj Department, Panchayat Raj institutions, JSYS and two experts. The
Committee carried out field studies, in-depth analysis of policies, organizational structures and
legislation. The Committee’s report (JSYS, 2006) covers the background and issues to
development of tanks in the state. The Report made a number of recommendations. However,
despite analysis of successful experience from the project and by JSYS, it recommended a new
unit within MID and the GPSC model of tank management institutions over TUGs, even though


                                               44
the communities largely favored the TUG model. The report was submitted to the government
and discussed on 3rd April 2006. However a Cabinet note detailing the actual requirements in
respect of the MID and PR Department to be placed before Cabinet was not acted on.

d) Development of a decision support system for planning, operation and management of water
   resources on a sub basin/watershed basis that can be applied in the context of tanks.

        Various information systems were put in place, as well as more recently GIS system.
However these were never integrated in a manner as to provide watershed/catchment based
planning.

e) Preparation of a possible follow-on project.

        The focus of this was in the preparation of the Additional Finance part of the project.  

Subcomponent 1.2. Project Management:

        This was to strengthen project coordination and management through provision of
technical assistance including studies, workshops and training. Activities include:

 Develop a GIS-based information system for the project and the state.
A web-accessible GIS system was established for the project. However, per the understanding of
the ICRR team, this was only operational in the later stages of the project.

   Develop a monitoring and learning system.

         As with other World Bank projects established at this time the KCBTMP was designed to
have a strong monitoring and learning (M&L) element. The M&L system was intended to have
four components: (i) performance tracking – to measure inputs, outputs and outcomes; (ii)
institutional tracking – for organizational learning and performance enhancement (for JYSYS
units and TUGs); (iii) Internal learning – developing project processes; and (iv) evaluation – to
measure project impacts and outcomes.

        In the initial stages of the project an external organization was engaged to support the
JSYS with the development of the M&L system. World Bank missions in May/June 2007 and
May 2008 found significant problems with the M&L program. These included: (i) poor and
disorganized collection, processing and reporting of project data; (ii) lack of procedures for
monitoring the performance of CFTs; (iii) failure to report and present data in a format useful for
JSYS management and staff; and (iv) lack of understanding in the JSYS M&L Unit of World
Bank requirements and procedures for results monitoring.

         A central problem with the M&L program has been the inability of JSYS to appoint and
retain a sufficiently experienced M&L Specialist. This has meant that suitable systems have not
been established in JSYS for data collection, processing and reporting. A particular feature of this
has been the failure to produce quarterly and annual reports which report on progress of each of
the project components.

   Carry out two mid-term reviews (MTRs) in PY02 and PY04




                                                45
         A first Mid Term Review was conducted in 2004 and a second MTR in 2006. The first
MTR took place when there was still relatively little progress (99 tanks covered), and with
relatively little information coming out of the M&L system.
 
   Carry out technical support services and studies.

          The project carried out a range of studies, for example in support of legal changes, and
agriculture but most of these were undertaken in the context of other specific components
(institutional, under UAS, etc.)

   Establish fully functional state and district offices, and establish incremental staff at the state
    and district levels.

         Finding and keeping staff was a major problem experienced for the duration of the
project, though the situation was more stable once a long-term Executive Director was appointed
in August 2008. The staffing problem is exemplified by the position of the Executive Director
(ED) - during the 12 years since JSYS was formed in 2000 there have been 11 Executive
Directors, with three EDs being in post for less than 3 months. The project experienced serious
difficulties in retaining an ED between May 2006 and August 2008, with different management
approaches and uncertain direction.

         JSYS established nine DPUs in the original project Districts and nine in the AF project
(one in each District and one additional DPU in Shimoga District). The DPUs had
multidisciplinary teams to support and monitor project implementation, with different levels of
staffing depending on the number of tanks and CFTs that they were working with. Turnover of
staff was an issue and some of the staff employed were relatively inexperienced and under
qualified. This problem was particularly applicable to the NGOs/CFTs but also applied to DPUs
specialist posts such as fisheries, agriculture, water resources, social and M&L specialist.
Problems experienced as a consequence of the frequent turnover of staff and empty posts
included a heavier workload on the in-place staff, inexperienced staff, work not carried out on
time (or not at all), and the continual need to train up new staff. In addition some of the
contracted staff found it difficult to get assistance from line agencies, as they were not considered
as government staff.

COMPONENT 2. Strengthening Community Development

Subcomponent 2.1. Human and institutional resource development.

(a) Provision of support services by Anchor NGOs and CFTs

         The institutional arrangements for the project endeavored to take into account the
dynamic nature of the village environment and institutional structures and the constraints evident
in earlier public sector interventions in tank system development and management. The key
elements of the proposed approach comprised of: (i) giving full responsibility for tank
development and management to village-based communities; (ii) engaging NGOs experienced in
building capacity of rural communities; (iii) providing oversight and support to these NGOs
through Anchor NGOs (ANGOs); and (iv) providing guidance, support and project management
through JSYS at the state and district level.

        Anchor NGOs (ANGOs) were engaged by the project to assist JSYS in the initial stages
with the formulation and implementation of the project, to help build common vision among


                                                  46
stakeholders, designing and conducting training programs and supporting implementation of field
NGOs.

         CFTs with local NGOs were anticipated to total some 55 in number, to be contracted by
JSYS for a period of 4-5 years to form and build the capacity of TUGs. In addition they were to
work with the TUGs on the supervision and quality control of the physical works. Each CFT was
to consist of five/six staff: (i) a social scientist; (ii) an engineer; (iii) an agricultural/watershed
specialist; (iv) a gender and HRD specialist; and (v) an R&R/tribal development specialist. In
addition, one of the above team members or an additional member would be engaged in financial
management and capacity building of the TUGs. The initial program for each tank was 20
months. This was later increased to 30 months as it was found that additional time was required
for the implementation phase to cover more than one season. JSYS contracted 57 CFTs in two
phases: (i) 25 CFTs in 2002 with each CFT eventually covering some 40 tanks and (ii) 32 CFTs
in 2004 eventually covering some 30 tanks, about 15 of which were terminated due to poor
performance. An assessment of the first batch of CFTs found that whilst the community
mobilization was generally adequate, the construction of the physical works was inadequate as
they had little experience in monitoring engineers. To resolve this issue the CFT model was
changed in Phase II such that the CFT was composed of a mix of DPU and NGO personnel to
form District Facilitation Teams (DFTs), including engineers under the responsibility of the DPU,
which the project was able to adequately manage the engineering aspects.

        A further issue which occurred in the middle phase of the project (2006-8) was that any
money remaining in the TUG account for implementation of the physical works was reclaimed by
the SPU at the end of the 6 month implementation stage, irrespective of whether the works had
been completed or not. This left the TUGs in a very difficult position, with claims for payment
outstanding against them and no money to pay them. The matter was resolved, but only after
some time and considerable disruption to these TUGs. All these factors contributed to an
implementation lag of about two years (see Figure 1 below).

        In keeping with the multi-disciplinary nature of the project, training and capacity building
was carried out across a range of disciplines, including institutional development, financial
management, agriculture, horticulture, livestock, fisheries, etc. The training and capacity
building in the agriculture and horticultural sectors was carried out by the Universities of
Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore and Dharwad. Training and capacity building related to
formation and management of the TUG was carried out by the CFTs and DPU personnel. For this
purpose 14 modules (list below) were prepared and training given to TUG members as they
passed through into each development phase. The trainings were provided consistently, with over
100 participants per tank on average, for core training courses according to the impact
assessment. A large number of TUG members thus gained exposure to the whole set of modules.
Further analysis of the data of those trained show that for all 9 Districts the average percentage of
women in the training groups is 42 percent. The core training modules were:

    1.    Introduction to the project
    2.    Formation of TUG or TMI
    3.    Institutional models
    4.    Resettlement and rehabilitation policy
    5.    Gender Action Plan systems and implementation
    6.    Planning Civil Works
    7.    Participatory rural appraisal
    8.    Procurement (civil works and technical aspects)
    9.    Accounts and book keeping
    10.   TUG management (internal)
    11.   Post implementation (Operation and maintenance)

         As well as the institutional capacity building a parallel training program was organized
by the Universities of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore and Dharwad. This training was divided
into three parts: (i) Farmer Field Schools; (ii) On-Farm Demonstrations; and (iii) workshops,
study tours and exposure visits. The JSYS has produced some 51 training manuals on facilitation
and technical aspects during the course of the project. While there was a relatively high turnover
of staff within the project nevertheless the comprehensive documentation of the JSYS processes
and procedures and the associated training carried out for new staff has been a major contributory
factor to the continued successful implementation of the project. In addition to training manuals a
significant amount of communication material was produced to reach a broad range of
stakeholders, including tank users, local government officials, government officials and
politicians. This information has been communicated by radio and television programs, leaflets
and brochures, video documentaries and wall paintings.

        Although the training program was complex and the presence of a Training Specialist
was lacking at the SPU level for much of the project, the impact assessment study found that the
capacity building program had generated a wide awareness of the project and its activities. This
was especially the case among TUG members, as confirmed by the impact assessment survey,
where a large majority was aware of the project purpose and the TUG constitution and byelaws
and functions. This was also reflected in performance of the TUG functions where the majority
of Committee members are appointed by consensus and high attendance at the General Body
meetings, there is reasonable management of records, and a large percent were involved in the
ITP preparation. The majority (73 percent) felt that 75 percent of the ITDP targets had been met.
Most respondents expressed satisfaction with the functioning of the TUG. A majority felt the
TUG had sufficient powers over the tank for decision making. When asked if the TUG should
work more closely with the Panchayati Raj Institutions at village, taluk and district level, almost

independent from the Panchayats.

Results for Component 2: TUG performance, Sustainability and O&M

        Formation of tank user groups. The TUG is the general body of the tank users which is
represented by the Tank User Committee (TUC). In the PAD four options were outlined for the
how the TUG/TUC might be formed, either: (i) as an independent village association registered
under the Societies Act; (ii) as a sub-committee of the Grama Panchayat (GPSC); (iii) through the
Grama Sabha; and (iv) through the Gram Panchayat. Of these four options the Grama Sabha and
Grama Panchayat were discontinued during the project due to lack of any uptake by the tank
users. Of the remaining two options the majority of tanks preferred the independent village
association option. For a total of 3,710 tanks, there are 3007 TUGs registered as societies and
119 registered as sub-committees of the Grama Panchayat (GPSC). In total the TUGs have a
membership of over 1,162,000 members, of whom 49% are women8. The process appears to have
engaged effectively with SC, ST, women and landless people, with the involvement of these
sections of society encouraged and monitored throughout the process. This inclusiveness has been
secured through the TUG bye-laws and guidelines issued by the project. According to the impact
study SCs and STs together constitute about 39 percent of TUG membership, and 34 percent of
TUCs. Around 34 percent of TUG Presidents and 40 percent are from the SC/ST group. For
Treasurers the proportion is higher, at 49 percent. In some cases there are all-women TUCs.

        Sustainability Operation and maintenance. The issue of whether self-supporting and
sustainable tank development and management institutions have been established is less clear cut.
Due to the delay in the completion of the physical works and the handing over of the tanks the
post-implementation period under the project has been limited. A significant concern is that the
income to the TUGs is, on average, very poor and not sufficient to cover the cost of regular
maintenance and repair to the tank system. It is apparent that further support is required for
TUGs if income generation is to be enhanced and the necessary maintenance work carried out.

         Data on average income per TUG from different sources following handover was not
complete. Apart from fisheries income there is not much other income to the TUG each year. The
cost of maintenance for the tanks is difficult to estimate due to the number of variables involved
(catchment area, tank embankment dimensions, size of command area, etc.), with considerable
variation across districts. In general there seemed that balancing needs and required resources for
O&M had only been done quickly with little long term agreements by TUG members whether in
labor or cash. Nevertheless TUGs showed also considerable innovation as to generating resources
in some specific cases (see box below). This demonstrated the potential of the TUGs as self-
sustaining institutions, especially when supported by federations, and where there was capacity
building of TUGs in different approaches to resource mobilization. In all cases an O&M plan had
been prepared as part of the ITDP, but this broadly identified the maintenance needs and costs
rather than the actual needs (as the ITDP is prepared before the physical works commence). Also
included in the ITDP was a budget (income and expenditure) and a Tank System O&M Policy
and Norms Statement listing the main areas of O&M required in the catchment, tank, and
command area (including boreholes). As observed, the Completion Reports mostly detailed the
progress with the work carried out during the implementation phase.

Examples of resource mobilization activities by TUGs:

   12 TUGs of Bijapur have availed Rs. 10,000/- from NABARD towards administrative expenditure. This would be
    given to the TUGs continuously for three years. This would help the TUGs for continuing the TUG activities
    during the initial years.
   NABARD has also extended this facility to three Federations of TUGs in Dharwad.
   Bharat Petroleum Corporation has extended financial assistance to the tune of Rs. 2, 57,583/- for sinking farm
    pond, desiltation in tank bed, etc. to seven TUGs in Pavagada taluk of Tumkur district.
   One of the TUG in Uttara Kannada district has approached the Agriculture Department and the TUG is promised
    with a bio-fuel extraction machines etc.
   Karnataka State Bio Fuel Development Board (KSBFDB) has established an office in Tumkur district to collect
    bio-fuel seeds through TUG. The Bio Fuel Company has also distributed sapling to around 30 TUGs. This will
    ensure continued support to the TUGs by bio-fuel.
   The agriculture department is in the process of sanctioning a flour mill to Gopalanahalli TUG in Tumkur district
    which would help the TUG in earning regular income.
   The TUG in Bevinahalli has constructed a permanent building for the TUG office utilizing a part of income from
    fisheries.
   The TUG in Hassan district has liked with ATMA project for agriculture intervention.
   The chitradurga federation has initiated Rashtriya Mahila Kosh activities and done a turnover of Ten lakhs and
    earned a profit of Rs.25000/-
   Chintamani federation has taken initiative and requested deputy commissioner to conduct a meeting with line
    departments and JSYS staff. a proceeding was drawn by deputy commissioner to take linkages with line
    department

                                                                                           Source: JSYS, June 2012

         Ratings of TUGs. The project did assess the performance of each TUG during the
preparation of the Completion Report, using a rating system. The assessment rating is
comprehensive and suited to the assessment required at the handover stage for inclusion in the
Completion Report. The data were not analyzed extensively as they were only measured at late
stage of the project.

         Tank Federations. An unexpected result of the project was the emergence of TUG
federations. The biggest challenge that project face today is sustainability of the tanks
rehabilitated more so because of erratic rainfall. In order to sustain the TUGs, the project has
facilitated the formation of 14 taluka level and 17 district level federations (except for Kolar).
The federations run by the community will assist the TUGs in income generation activities and
marketing their produce. One federation, with the help of a NGO (Dhan Foundation), has roped
in private sector to help market their produce. The company will buy the produce at a pre fixed
rate. The taluka level federations have been formed in five districts namely Kolar, Shikaripura
and Tumkur (3 each); Chintamani (4); Haveri (1). The district level federations have been formed
in Hassan; Chikkamagalur; Dharwad; Belgaum; Bijapur; Davangere; Chitradurga; Shimoga;
Shikaripura; Uttar Kannada; Raichur; Kolar; Chickbalapur; Tumkur; Haveri; Dharwad; Bagalkot
and Bidar. All 17 district federations have received Rs. 50,000 from State Project Unit as
administrative cost. The project also conducted interactive workshop for TMI members towards
formation of federations which was attended by 4619 TUG members from 18 DPUs. JSYS also
arranged for an exposure visit to Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala for over 280 farmers.
JSYS also hosted 14 District Project Coordinators and 11 SPU members from Orissa apart from a
team of 160 farmers (in four batches) from Orissa Tanks project. The Orissa team visited tanks in
4 districts namely Kolar, Hasan, Hospet and Chitradurga and also visited KRES in Mysore.

Subcomponent 2.2. Safeguard and Gender Action Plans

        Preparation and implementation of Safeguard and Gender Action Plans (including tribal
development plans, resettlement action plans, environmental management plans which include
tank safety plans and cultural property action plans, pest management plans, all as necessary) and
Gender Action Plans by TUGs was done thoroughly with the assistance of CFTs and JSYS, for
each Tank System developed under the Project.

        Typically, tank rehabilitation works does not entail acquisition of private land, except
reclaiming some parcels of land either in tank bed, foreshore or catchment area which might have
been encroached for agricultural purposes and in the process may impact some people adversely
by way of losing productive assets and livelihood. To mitigate such impacts, an R&R policy was
developed and appropriate Resettlement Action Plans were prepared as part of ITDPs. Out of
3710 tanks taken up under the project, revenue survey has been completed for 3551 tanks and
encroachment was found in 1414 tanks. A total of 2288.77 ha of tank area was found to be
encroached by 7803 households. The project relocated 500 families (1073 projected affected
persons) across 143 tanks and over 2038.01 ha of encroached land is now free of all
encroachment and other encumbrances. JSYS has disbursed about Rs. 26.80 million towards
R&R assistance through 500 Resettlement Action Plan instrument.

          The objective of Gender Action Plan (GAP) was to ensure that women are adequately
represented in all committees for their effective participation. The mission was pleased to note
substantial increase in number of women participants in the project. The JSYS revised the
Gender Strategy and Guidelines for preparation and implementation of GAP in 2009 and
circulated to all the DPUs, CFTs, TMIs and State Level Advisory Committee. As per the
guideline, gender concern has been mainstreamed in every aspect of the project. The discussions
with SHG/TUG members during the field visits revealed that the project has helped in
empowering women members and making them equal partners in both the community and
household levels in the decision making processes. The Functional Literacy Program (FLP)
started in the preplanning phase for the sixth batch tanks, to help women members participate in
planning activities, but for the third and fifth batches FLP was implemented in the
implementation phase. FLP was not implemented in the second batch, as only 2927 became
literate after 10,000 were trained in 2004.

Subcomponent 2.3. Planning and Management Support to TUGs.

         This subcomponent included financing of activities carried out by tank users as part of
their social and environmental management plans, such as workshops training, study tours and
exposure visits.

Subcomponent 2.4. Communication

        These activities were in support to the Strategic Communications Strategy comprising (i)
communications and information infrastructure, (ii) capacity building and training and (iii)
strategy development and implementation.

COMPONENT 3 Undertaking Tank System Improvements

Subcomponent 3.1 Tank Civil Works Improvement

         Design. The Tank Civil Works Improvement Sub-Component has the main objectives to
stop the rapid deterioration of existing physical structures and infrastructure, to improve tank
storage capacity, to reduce siltation by stabilizing drainage lines to the tanks, and to improve
water distribution and irrigation systems in the tank command areas. To ensure sufficient
commitment and ownership of farmers/TUGs they were expected to be responsible for
contribution of 12% of the investment costs, including 6% in cash and 6% in kind.

         The design and approach appeared to adequately address the following needs: (i)
motivate farmers in developing and strengthening of operational effectiveness of TUGs; (ii)
repair the most critical parts of tank infrastructure to improve storage capacity and water
management efficiency, and (iii) take into account lack of tank/TUG level project implementation
experience. It was intended that design (ITDPs) and supervision would be carried out by DPU
and CFT in close cooperation with TUGs. In view of geographic breadth of the works, to further
enhance the quality management system, a third-party quality monitoring/inspection of works
was suggested that was utilized in the second phase of the project activities. Implementation of
civil works under the original credit was intended to be carried out by TUGs (for desilting and
bunds repair works contracted to the Empaneled Agencies identified by the JSYS), while under
the additional credit civil works implementation was intended to be contracted to private
contractors through the community based bidding procedure managed by the TUGs. The
activities also included training TUGs in for long-term financial stability, with contributions from
water users to eventually match the sustainable management, operation and maintenance costs.
The selection process required also feasibility and environmental impact assessments. No risk
related to system rehabilitation was identified in the PAD. The actual implementation however,
revealed a number of risks related to lack of experience of TUGs in works implementation and
TUGs and DPU/CFT in works contract management, inadequate quality of engineering estimates
of quantities in the ITDPs at the initial stage of the project implementation, lack of capacities of
local contractors and their unwillingness to work after unit rates increased, as well as lack of
experience of TUGs/DPU/CFT in works supervision. These resulted in significant delay in
overall works implementation and a large number of uncompleted (still on-going) works contracts
by the project completion date.

General Implementation

        The basic concept of the project was to rehabilitate tank infrastructure for only those
TUGs which would have met a set of predefined selection criteria, including sufficient frequency
of surplus water years, and community commitment. In general the construction works were
undertaken under difficult conditions because of the obligation to ensure continuous water supply
during the irrigation season, which left only a short period available for construction. Besides
this, most of the TUGs/DPUs/CFTs and contractors lacked experience with work planning and
implementation of this type of extensive rehabilitation. Nevertheless considerable efforts have
been made by both JSYS and World Bank supervision teams during project implementation to
ensure acceptable quality of both design and civil works. Particularly, a comprehensive Technical
Manual (including standard drawings for different facilities) and acceptable works supervision
procedures were developed and applied in the course of project implementation. Training on
technical aspects for relevant staff from DPU and CFT, as well as for benefitting TUGs has been
conducted. Furthermore, detailed topographic survey for tanks to accurately estimate the
quantities of desiltation and earth works has been undertaken. A random review of the sub-


                                                52
projects’ files in TUGs visited including original technical documents and estimations, ‘OK
cards’, measurement books of DPU engineers/supervisors, bills of completed quantities,
certificates of used soil quality, certificates of soil compaction works, and hand over certificates
showed that the overall supervision procedures had been organized and carried out in an
acceptable manner.

Assessment of Performance and Results

         The works under the original credit were executed by TUGs (for desilting and bunds
repair works contracted to the Empaneled Agencies identified by the JSYS). The works under the
additional credit were contracted to private contractors through one single civil works contract for
each TUG. Local Shopping (excluding 14 contracts procured under the NCB procedure as
required by the project procurement threshold) through community based procurement procedure
has also been applied. The table below provides information on the status of contracts at a DPU
level as of 31 January 2012.

         Out of total selected 3,923 tanks with total command area of about 146,647 ha, 3,710
with command area of about 160,423 ha have passed the implementation stage. Works under
1,829 contracts funded by the original credit have been mostly completed but only works under
1,620 contracts with the total command area of about 53,542 ha have been handed over to TUGs
at close of Bank project. The rest are being completed with government budget. In 207 tanks
however, the progress has been very limited or nil. It was reported that 87 tanks have already
been dropped because of low or no interest of farmers to continue, while attempts are still on-
going to complete the works under the remaining contracts. Estimated time required for final
completion and hand over was about 6 months. Average per hectare investment cost is 34,530
Rs/ha (approximate to about USD 690 per ha9), varying from the lowest 26,790 Rs/ha under the
original credit to 41,100 Rs/ha under the additional funding. Average per tank investment cost is
about Rs 1.49 million (approximate to about USD 30,000). Performance of contractors evaluated
by TUGs visited and DPU Engineers varying from Moderately Satisfactory to Highly
Satisfactory.

         Tank rehabilitation and improvement is the biggest component under the project and aims
to achieve more efficient tank storage capacity for the benefit of a range of users, as well as
improved water distribution in irrigation systems with tanks as water sources. This has been
achieved through the implementation of physical works that are identified with the participation
of the benefiting communities and that are described in ITDPs, as well as through training and
support of the tank communities. Typical physical works include strengthening of tank bunds,
outlet sluices, and waste weirs (spillways), limited de-silting of reservoir areas, cleaning of feeder
channels, construction of erosion-control structures in streams, and tree planting in tank foreshore
areas. The clearance of feeder channel, bund strengthening and repair of damaged weirs may be
categorized into critical works that will ensure the water storage capacity of the tanks while other
structures would attribute to improved water use efficiency.

        The detailed assessment of impact of works and their effectiveness in improving water
availability and efficiency and other related benefits is examined further below. Noteworthy
physical achievements are:
    a) About 58 million cum of silt has been removed. The silt served dual role by retaining the
        storage capacity of tank and also as source of fertile soil for farms. Majority of silt has
        been placed on farm lands that resulted in crop yield increase by about 18% while saving
        the input cost for fertilizers and reducing soil salinity.

                                                            54
    b) Over 7.5 million cum of bund strengthening has been done and several sluices have been
       fixed which were the major cause of water loss. Further the field channels have been
       cleared which ensured the water supply into the tanks. These structures were not attended
       to for many years which resulted in waterlogging and salinity around the tanks. The
       improved water storage capacity of tanks ensured the water availability for a longer
       duration (more than 1-2 months) that was useful not only for irrigation but also for
       recharging groundwater levels and drinking water for humans and livestock. The impact
       study reported an increase in cropping intensity by 14% more than control tanks and 37%
       increase over base year in Kharif season. The water levels increased in surrounding wells
       by 5-6 feet despite the fact there was increase of 2 hours of pumping per day during
       Kharif season when compared with base year.
    c) Over 2000 km kilometer of lining of channel was done which ensured the more water
       availability to tail enders. A further 2,000 km was cleaned and reshaped. The impact
       study reported an increase in tail end cropping intensity by 10% when compared with
       control tanks.
    d) There have also been unexpected benefits where bund repair and crossways over feeder
       canals have considerably improved local access for remote hamlets, and repair of sluices
       and steps have restored important local heritage and cultural features.

        Additionally there has been about 0.6 mln. cum of cut off trench; repair or rehabilitation
of over 3,500 sluice and gate structures; repair of some 3,100 spillway structures; cleaning and
reshaping of over 750 km of spillway channels; and rehabilitation of over 5,300 cross drainage
structures such as check dams, culverts, aqueducts, outlets and bridges (source JSYS database).

         Engineering design. Despite the rehabilitative and relatively simple nature of the works,
desk review of some of the ITDPs from the initial stage of project implementation revealed an
overall lack of accuracy and quality with respect to the engineering aspects. World Bank
supervision reports indicated that JSYS faced serious difficulties in finding suitable engineers at
field level in the beginning of works. With the technical assistance provided by the International
Engineers regularly involved in World Bank supervision missions, an obvious positive
improvement has been achieved, as the latest engineering documents cover more detailed
information and are presented with improved quality of drawings, surveys, calculations, table of
quantities and technical specifications. Review of engineering sections of the latest ITDPs has
shown that they are adequate for the type of works under consideration. However, there has been
no utilization of engineering software like CAD or hydraulic simulation tools.

         Only the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure in command area has been considered,
instead of review and improvement of existing water management practices. A large amount of
lining of existing on-farm canal network in all the TUGs has been completed. As the field
observation and discussions held with farmers show, more attention need to be paid in the future
to the requirements of regulatory structures such as intakes, division boxes, culverts, outlets, cross
regulators, energy dissipaters, flow meters etc. which will allow TUGs to distribute water among
member farmers in more reliable and timely manner. On-farm canal lining should be used only
for limited sections of the system which are technically required to reduce or combat enormous
seepage losses.

         Quality of works implemented. In general the construction works were undertaken
under difficult conditions because of the obligation to ensure continuous water supply during the
irrigation season, which left only a short period available for construction. Besides this, most of
the TUGs/DPUs/CFTs and contractors lacked of experience with work planning and
implementation of this type of extensive rehabilitation. Considerable efforts have been made by


                                                 55
both JSYS and World Bank supervision teams during project implementation to ensure
acceptable quality of civil works. The overall quality of works in the sites visited is satisfactory.
No major defects are apparent in the works completed. Reasonable quality of repairs and
strengthening to tank bunds, feeder channel improvement, spillway repair, command area canal
lining, construction of division boxes, repair of sluices/gates, construction and repair of culverts
and aqueducts, and tank bed desiltation was observed by the mission. Overall acceptable
construction practices and reasonable standards of rehabilitation have been used (with some
minor exceptions in few cases, mainly related to the access to sluices). All the required tests such
as mechanical characteristics of soil and compaction quality have been undertaken regularly and
relevant certificates are available in the contract files and measurement books. However, there
have been significant delays in majority of construction works that required terms extensions for
contracts, which have not been duly documented. No detailed schedule for works implementation
has been included in the contract documents that would allow the TUGs for adequate contract
management. No negative environmental impact from the project activities has been reported or
observed by the mission.

        Supervision of Works. Daily supervision of civil works has been carried out by a DPU
field engineer in collaboration with the CFT and TUG under the overall guidance from the JSYS
(State Project Unit). The responsibility of DPU field engineer included registration of quantities
of works implemented in the measurement book, ensuring the quality of works and in cooperation
with the CFT engineer to obtain soil quality test from the licenced laboratories (nearby
Engineering Collages) and carry out required testing of compaction works for each layer (with the
kits provided by the JSYS) and registration of tests data. The measurement data in the book have
been signed by the DPU and CFT engineers, TUG and the contractor. Payment certificates with
relevant supporting documents have been issued by the DPU engineer based on the approved
quantities of works in the measurement book. After the approval of payment certificates by
relevant institutions as per the legislation of India, the TUG has been instructed to pay the
contractor. In addition to this ‘OK cards’ have been introduced by the recommendation of the
World Bank mission to certify the completion of individual items from the bill of quantities.
When adequately maintained, they seem to add value to other formal paperwork.

         To ensure further improvement in quality of works the so called ‘third party supervision’
(‘Egis’ India Consulting Engineers Private Ltd.) was contracted by JSYS for inspection of
contracts implemented under the additional funding and savings from the original credit, starting
from March 2009. According to the contract conditions the ‘third party supervision’ had to
conduct full inspection of works undertaken under 500 contracts identified by JSYS and 10% of
works under the remaining contracts. The main responsibility of the ‘third party supervision’ has
been to inspect the quality of works implemented, to review and verify the correctness of the
calculations in the measurement books, without any responsibility to certify measurement books
or payment certificates; and to report to JSYS for identified discrepancies. Given the quality of
works observed by the mission in the site visited, the supervision system appeared to be adequate.
However, it is the opinion of the mission that introduction of ‘OK cards’ (as they are now, just to
verify the completion of items of works) proved to have no influence on overall improvement of
supervision process.

Sub-component 3.2 Agriculture and Horticulture Development

         The original project was designed based on the decline in productivity, a shift in cropping
pattern, and a decrease in value of production in the tank-based agricultural system in Karnataka.
At design the main reasons for these changes were siltation and reduction of tank storage
capacity, weakening and deterioration of tank bunds, outlets and waterways, encroachment of


                                                 56
impounding areas, improper management of the catchment area, lack of knowledge of
communities of more suitable cropping patterns and crop technologies, and weaknesses in
extension systems. Over the project period the majority of these limitations did not change
significantly, however significant external factors occurred in the latter part of the project,
notably large increases in investments in rural areas from the public sector and increases in food
prices and the minimum price support10 for various crops. The project took the approach of
increasing agriculture productivity by “(i) increasing farmer knowledge, based on location-
specific, on-farm demonstrations of improved on-farm water management practices and improved
cropping systems and crop practices and (ii) a range of technical training for farmers and tank
water users?11. The agriculture activities attempted to cover all tanks with either a demonstration
or a farmer field school.

        Approach. The approach adopted was typical of the current generation of irrigation
projects, where a multidisciplinary team is complimented by a range of extension activities. The
extension activities included a mix of the main extension tools commonly used in India, namely
demonstrations, field days, exposure visits, and trainings. Farmer Field Schools were also
included in the original design for farm level trainings, this ended up being the major activity
under component 2.2. A large focus was placed on soil testing, and the project adopted the use of
mobile soil testing facilities. Marketing was also included in the Additional Finance extension.
Research was deliberately not included as a main component, however a small number of pilot
studies were conducted.

         Results framework. The anticipated results of this component would contribute to the
PDO through improvements in agriculture production, linked to increased productivity and area
(PAD) and double cropping and adoption of improved farming practices (Additional Financing).
The design of the results framework in the PAD in relation to this component are vague, and
without a baseline nor concrete targets the output indicators are somewhat ambiguous. The
refinement of the indicators at the time of Additional Financing certainly was an improvement,
however the results indicator appears to have been ambitious, particularly given the relatively dry
nature of the state, for example in 2009/09 the ratio of net irrigated area to cross irrigated area in
Karnataka was approximately 1:1.2212, this would indicate that approximately 22% of farmers are
able to double crop, and the rationale behind the selection of this target is not spelled out in the
Additional Financing document.

         Implementation agencies. The project engaged the services of the University of
Agriculture Science Bangalore and the University of Agriculture Science Dharwad on a turnkey
basis through a sole source selection procedure13. New contracts were issued for the Additional
Finance (included additional tanks added using project savings). There was some delay in
awarding these contracts (signed 2009) that affected the continuity and limited the time available
for implementation, and perhaps to some degree the synchronization of investments in the
irrigation systems. The universities established project management and coordination units at
their headquarters and in each of the districts. These were manned by both university staff and
consultants. Field technicians and field assistants were employed at the cluster level for day to
day implementation of the project activities.

         Line Agencies such as Horticulture and Agriculture were not involved for the direct
implementation of this component, however linkages were designed through existing institutional
arrangements, i.e. Zilla Parishad Joint Committee and Taluka Production Committee. The PAD
also envisaged that the Line Departments would provide resource persons to deliver trainings and,
along with the SAUs, would collectively decide on the appropriate demonstrations and related
technical training to be conducted at each cluster of tanks. Specifically the PAD mentioned “The
design and implementation of the demonstrations will be the responsibility of the universities and
Krishi Vigyan Kendras (Agricultural Science Center) in collaboration with the line agencies at
the taluk level and the TUGs?. Regardless discussion with farmers and TUGs during ICR
revealed that there is little or no connection remaining with the line agencies.

Implementation

         The interventions, field days and exposure visits were designed to maximize exposure to
demonstrations, trainings and the farmer field schools were all interlinked to leverage the impacts
of each. A large number of farmers were reached by these interventions and considerable
attention was given to determining the spread effect, i.e. the adoption of technologies within a
command area.

         The key elements of the demonstrated technologies were use of improved seeds of high
yielding varieties/hybrids of field and vegetable crops, line sowing (to ensure proper plant
population and mechanical weed control), transplanting of younger seedlings (of rice and Ragi)
and soil test based application of fertilizers and micronutrients (zinc). The efficient water
management practices demonstrated bed and furrow planting, alternate furrow irrigation, drip and
sprinkler irrigation in high value crops, and SRI method of rice cultivation. The project has also
promoted the use of vermi-compost, bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides for increasing crop
productivity and promoting ecologically sustainable agricultural practices in the command area of
the tanks.

         On Farm Demonstrations. On farm demonstrations covered a range of topics outlined
in Error! Reference source not found.. The ratios between the number of demonstrations and
the area covered varied depending on the perception of a viable size required for both adoption by
the demonstrating farmers and spread effect. For example water management demonstration were
conducted on a 20 ha plot, while arable crop demonstrations were on a 10 ha plot. Interestingly
the reports on yields from demonstrations were exclusively higher than that of the check plots.
Ordinarily it might be expected that a small number of demonstrations may fail: one conclusion is
that the demonstrated technologies may be very robust, however this reported success should be
cross referenced against adoption rates, before being used for scaling up or expansion of the
program.

         Water Management Demonstrations were conducted on over 30 different crops, for
about half of these14, measurements were collected to determine the amount of water delivered to
the field and yields were also recorded and water use efficiencies were calculated. The range of
interventions and some average water use efficiency (WUE) figures are outlined in Error!
Reference source not found.. Given the large number of water related demonstrations conducted
some further analysis could have been (and still could be done) to look more closely at the
relationships between water productivity and management and distribution of benefits. The water
management demonstrations conducted by UAS Dharwad on paddy (where measurements were
taken) show that between districts (and probably within districts) there is a large variation
between the water use between the control and the demonstrations. Given that water management
is a core function of the TUG, the promotion of these technologies could have been better
integrated into crop planning water budgeting exercises to leverage any improvements in water
productivity.

        Arable Crop Demonstrations (ACD) covered approximately 15 field crops and
concentrated on the promotion of integrated crop management. Primarily this consisted of
improving crop nutrition (i.e. soil tests) and pest management but also included best practices
regarding crop spacing, planting techniques and irrigation management. A summary of the main
ACDs is given below in Error! Reference source not found..

         Similarly the Horticulture Crop Demonstrations covered a large range of fruits and
vegetables appropriate for the agriculture zones, and concentrated on promotion of best practices.
Yields were around 20% more in demonstrations than check areas. The promotion of horticulture
is usually associated with targets relating to diversification into high value crops, which was not
included in the Results Framework of this project. While horticulture interventions tend to target
farmers with better capacity and who are less adverse to risk, in the project the beneficiary profile
for the horticulture demonstrations is similar to other ‘demonstrations’ with inclusion rates of
scheduled class (11%) and scheduled tribes (7%) classes and women (10%).

        The Integrated Farming Systems Demonstrations (IFSD) were designed to provide
full support to the whole range of activities that farmers would undertake, and maximize the
productivity of each component. These were only done on a very limited scale (see below under
livestock).

         Farmers Field Schools. The Farmers Field Schools covered by far the largest number of
project farmers, close to 88,000, and appears to be a more cost effective extension tool than the
on-farm demonstrations (the per beneficiary costs for the Farmers’ field school (FFS) were
approximately 50%, 30% and 6% of ACD, AWM and HCD interventions respectively).
Participants for the Farmers Field Schools were selected by the village Panchyats/gram sabah. An
analysis of the 8570 participants in the FFS conducted by UASD from the project start up to 2009
showed that the about 30% were female, 30% were from the scheduled and tribal classes and
70% were small and marginal farmers. In terms of the inclusion of the scheduled tribes, the PAD
found that up to 14% of the population of certain districts were Scheduled Tribes, the sample
above reports inclusion of 15% of tribal, indicating that social inclusion was satisfactory.

         The FFS covered over 20 crops, including but not limited to, cereals (jawar [sorghum],
maize, paddy, ragi [finger millet] and wheat), pulses (bengal gram [chickpea] and tur [pigeon
pea]), oilseeds (groundnut and sunflower), cash crops (cotton, soybean and sugarcane) and
horticulture (bhendi [okra], bittergourd, cauliflower, cucumber, onion, pachouli, and tomato). A
summary of the main FFS conducted under the project is presented in Error! Reference source
not found.. It must be noted that the yields presented in Error! Reference source not found. are
only for the demonstration, and would not necessarily reflect the performance of all members of
the FFS.

        A number of research assistants and field technicians were engaged to implement the
FFS, the process was started with training for these staff followed by preparation sessions where
needs were assessed and participants were identified. It is reported that weekly meetings were
held over a period of 10 to 16 weeks depending on the crop. While FFS were clearly successful
and appreciated by farmers, the FFS probably covered too many crops, could have had more
experienced and better trained facilitators. In regards to the sustainability, other FFS platforms
seek to provide a longer term linkage to the extension service providers either through training of
lead farmers or specialists, or look toward the evolution of the group into commodity or
producers groups. There doesn’t appear to have been any formal attempt in this project to look at
the longer term extensions needs of the project farmers, nor linkages with federations.

         Soil Testing. Indian farmers application of fertilizer tends to be unbalanced, (due to
many reasons) which generally have led to application of a single nutrient, primarily nitrogen. As
soils have become depleted in other nutrients, farmers have tended to compensate by over
application of nitrogen. One solution is to promote the use of soil test based nutrient application,
in the PAD soil testing was identified under the Tribal Development Plan as an action to increase
returns from agriculture. Approximately 147,000 soil samples were collected and analyzed under
the project. About 30 soil samples were collected from different farmers in each tank command
and were mostly tested in mobile laboratories for organic carbon content, pH, electrical
conductivity (an indicator of soil salinity levels), available phosphorus and available potash.
Interestingly no measure was made of soil nitrogen levels, due to the more complex requirements
for testing. A selection of samples (approximately 5 per tank) were also tested for Iron, Zinc,
Copper and Boron. Some water samples and soil samples for engineering properties were also
tested. Test results were translated into quality and fertility classifications and presented to
farmers with recommendations regarding amelioration and nutrient requirements in the form of a
soil health card. Organic carbon levels were used as a proxy for soil nitrogen. It was reported that
many farmers changed their nutritional management as a direct result. Soil fertility maps were
also produced and reportedly disseminated to the Tank User Groups. However there was not
much evidence to ICRR that the farmers took up soil testing on ongoing basis.

         Trainings. Typically the Universities undertook a large program of training and capacity
building of line department staff, their own staff and farmers. Interestingly a specific training was
developed for the Neerguntis (the person in charge of the day to day water delivery with the
TUGs). Over 20,000 people were trained; to improve their technical capacity, as trainers of
trainers, in farm level training, in environmental issues, and as neergantis. 30% of trainees were
women, and most were marginla farmers, followed by small farmers. Over 45% were SC/ST.

         Workshops: UASB claims to have included 15749 people in workshops, of which 14%
were female. The workshops of one day duration were generally cluster level interactive sessions
while District level and Joint level workshops were organized for TMI members. Annual
Workshops for two days duration at state level were also organized involving TMI Members,
Staff of the project , line departments and the Scientists of Universities and used as a mechanism
for exchange of ideas and shaping the projects future.

        Study tours: UASB19 conducted 194 study tours with approximately 9700 participants
(21% female) who were taken on 2 or 3 day trips to agricultural research stations, progressive
farmers’ fields, UAS Krishi melas at Bangalore to expose farmers to the latest agricultural
technologies and to share experiences with their peers. Similarly UAS Dharwad conducted 19
study tours with 950 farmers 20. The outcomes and impacts of these must be taken into account
when considering the overall adoption of new technologies.

Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

         The extended project environmental management measures as envisaged in the Social
and Environment Assessment (SEA) of the project were planned and implemented effectively in
the field. As envisaged in the project and implemented at field level, the ITDP is based on a four-
day Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) program. Approximately 75 % of the village population
participates in this program. In this exercise community is introduced to concept of foreshore
plantation, silt removal and its reutilization and reduction in use of chemical pesticides through
awareness on Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Through the PRA exercise the community not
only identifies the need for these activities but also plans various related activities during the
course of construction and for tank sustainability. Thus, it is clear that environmental safeguards
and management aspects have been mainstreamed from tank identification, preparation and until
implementation stage in the project.

          Plantation Activities and Status in First Phase: This activity is planned and
implemented in three broader sections of the tank i.e. (i) catchment/ Tank foreshore (TFS), (ii)
tank bed and bund, and (iii) command area. In the first phase of the project plantation
development was implemented in tank foreshores only. It supported around 2.5 ha covering
around 1000 plants in category A tanks (tanks having command area 20-40 ha) , and for an area
5.0 ha covering 2000 plants in category B tanks ( tanks with command area of 40-100 ha.).
Project provided support of Rs.30.0/plant which included cost of plant, raising and maintenance.
The achievement in first phase is about 3500 ha with a total plantation of 14.0 lakh in 1214 tank
foreshores. The average survival percentage observed by project is 22.16% as per the 2009
statistics. The reasons for low survival rate of plants was attributed to several factors: (i) NGOs
were used for implementation of this activity with no staff / experience in forestry activities: (ii)
non availability of plant seedlings on time; (iii) drought in the state continuously for 3 years

during implementation of 1st phase project i.e. 2006 to 2009 in the project districts; (iv) non
availability of environment./ forestry specialists in project; and (v) inadequate awareness to
community on adoption of plantation and its financial benefits.

         Plantation Activities in Second Phase and Additional Financing Stage: However, in the
second phase the project made effective changes to work on this activity. This activity (both for
original ongoing extended project and additional financing project) was changed to three
components; (a) tank foreshore (TFS) plantation, (b) distribution of seedling to TUG farmers to
encourage agro forestry and (c) awareness to community on value and financial benefits of
plantation. Because of distribution of seedling to TUG area farmers, the community got
encouraged to plant trees and get benefits. TUGs showed keen interest and became actively
involved in implementing this activity in various tanks. Thus, the target was re -worked to
develop TFS in 1476 tanks over 3690 ha area with 14.76 lakhs plants. And to supply 19.18 lakhs
seedlings free of cost to TUG farmers to encourage Agro Forestry in their farm land. This
improvement in activity planning resulted in to achievement of about 15.89 lakh plants are
planted in TFS covering 3950 ha area. For agro forestry 26.13 lakh seedlings are supplied to TUG
farmers, covering 1789 tanks, about 10437.0 ha area. In addition 4500 kgs seeds are sown on
681 tanks boundary trench mound. In-spite of unexpected heavy rains in 2010 in the districts of
Shimoga, Shikaripura, Dharwad, Sirsi, Davanagere and Belagaum which in turn damaged the
plantation, the average survival percentage of plants in second phase is around 60%. The total
expenditure incurred on this activity in second phase up to Jan 13, 2012 is Rs. 533.80 lakhs.

         The reasons for high survival percentage are (i) the choice of species for TFS, (ii) main
thrust given to Pongamia species, which is widely accepted by the community. This species of
plant is Bio-fuel species, economically viable, not browsed by livestock and eco-friendly. In the
sense, the leaves used as green manure, oil is used as Bio-pesticide, and cake is used as organic
manure which enriches soil and increase soil productivity.

         Estimated Financial benefits from Plantation: Project has estimated projections for major
species of plants distributed to farmers for creating awareness, these include; Pongamia, teak ,
silver oak and grafted mango. However, it is important to add here that these are estimated
projections and success depends more on the adoption and maintenance of plants by community
as gestation period of plants is long. Provided, the TUGs maintain these plantations with
sustained interest, after 7 to 8 years time, these plantations would definitely yield substantial
income to TUGs and TUG farmers. This would be a major source of income for their future
sustenance. This requires adequate focus on awareness and training of TUGs on plantation and its
maintenance during operation and maintenance period of tank. Estimated income from above
mentioned species are yearly on average 2000 Rs, and one-off Rs 50,700 at maturity.

        Silt application and benefits – see below under agriculture results.

        IPM and INM practices and Community Benefits and adoption in Project: IPM and
INM practices envisaged under EMP activities of the project got mainstreamed through, (a)
environmental awareness programs to JSYS staff and TUG members, (b) exposure visits and
study tours of farmers, (c) on farm demonstrations on IPM, (d) education campaign for use of
environment friendly fertilizers and pesticides. like: 1) vermi-compost 2) Rhizobium 3)
Azatobactor 4) Azo-spirillum       5) Vam      6) Trichoderma 7) Pseudomonas 8) PSB etc.
The two Agricultural Universities of the state; namely UAS-Bangalore and UAS- Dharwad
worked on these and related environmental management activities. These activities are
substantiating the environmental management measures that the project have envisaged. The




                                                63
activities like IPM demonstration, training and other capacity building are being undertaken by
the Universities.

        The adoption of environmental friendly techniques due to IPM/INM practices are:

    a) Vermicomposting: Vermicomposting is being implemented to promote production of
       organic manure and support vulnerable families to generate additional income. About
       1631 beneficiaries have been covered through promotion of 1385 units in 195 tanks since
       inception of the project till date. The linkage with progressive farmers has been
       established for purchase of vermicompost through which the use of chemical fertilizers is
       reduced.
    b) Water Management and Conservation: weed management in Jalasri method of paddy
       cultivation is pursued through non-chemical measures such as stale seed bed technique,
       mechanical method and by growing smothering crops like coriander and palak etc were
       introduced.
    c) Reduction in chemical pesticides and use of Bio –fertilizer: To reduce dependency on
       chemical fertilizers, pesticides, various eco - friendly agriculture input production has
       been demonstrated through conducting on farm demonstration at tank level. Interaction
       with farmers indicate that use of pesticides have reduced.
    d) Field visit interaction with farmers indicates; (a) there is encouragement in community to
       use organic manure, (ii) Chemical fertilizer use has decreased , (iii) there is increase in
       yield but all factors attributed to this is not clear, (iv) farmers have greater awareness on
       appropriate use of water for irrigation and its conservation.

Agriculture marketing

         Agriculture marketing was included as an activity and activities such as training on
marketing aspects, training on certification of organic products, preparation of marketing
directories, organizing buyers and sellers meets, development of exhibition kiosks, setting up
exhibitions and conducting Agro climatic zone-wise market research on crops. While the
universities claim to have implemented most of the trainings, targets for buyer seller meetings
were not met, and only about half of the market research studies were completed (at the time of
writing, UASB Status report, Jan 12). No results were presented in terms of outcomes for these
activities. While this was only treated as a relatively minor activity, the impact of which may
have been much greater if these activities were farmed out to the private sector, particularly for
buyer seller meets, and creating the associated improvements to the marketing chain.

Livestock

         Promotion of livestock related activities were not directly included in the project, with the
exception of fodder production and inclusion in a small number of integrated farming systems
demonstrations. The IFSD consisted of crop and livestock activities, i.e. in Maraluru village
(Chintamani DPU) crop production was supported for three seasons along with maintenance of a
dairy unit (one crossbred cow), sheep unit (5 female + 1 male) and poultry unit (20 birds).
Reports from this farmer indicate that income was significantly increased, however the report
lacks a thorough analysis into the economics of the projects investments against the farmers
returns which would be necessary to support wider scaling up.




                                                 64
Special studies

     Three pilot studies were conducted by each of the UASs. These were as follows:
      On-Demand Water Delivery Technology and Efficient Irrigation Methods
      Effect of Tank Rehabilitation on Ground Water Recharge and Conjunctive use of Water
      Reservoir Siltation and Desiltation Techniques

Outcomes on agriculture

         Subcomponent. 3.2 was originally to be assessed based on the increase in productivity
and production of both agriculture and horticulture in and near the tank command areas (PAD).
During the refinancing these indicators were superseded by only one direct indicator ‘at least 60%
of farmers practiced double cropping and improved farming practices’. Unfortunately, even with
the benefit of five years of project implementation, no baseline was given. The PAD text of
economic analysis did not include mention of diversification nor intensification, usually two key
drivers for the analysis, however increases in irrigation intensity are mentioned in the results
framework.

         Productivity: Productivity levels are reported to have improved as a result of the project
interventions, and the gains over the project period appear to be reasonable (Table 9). However
the lack of a consistent baseline and counterfactuals make it difficult to get a view of the bigger
picture impact of the project, and increases would therefore only reflect modest annual
productivity gains. For example the yield increase in Paddy of 18.5 percent represents an annual
increase of about 3.7 percent, below the GOI target of 4% in the Eleventh Five Year Plan.
According to the Impact Assessment productivity levels of other commodities was much less,
however the PCR for JSYS was far more optimistic reporting increases in paddy production of
18-47%.

control tanks. While the area total area planted to these crops increased more in the project tanks
(21%) than control tanks (8%) the general mix of crops while variable on a commodity basis
didn’t follow a trend toward diversification. While there were modest decreases in the overall
area planted to the major cereals, there was no difference between the project and control tanks,
and it would appear that in general with the extra water availability, farmers just planted more
area of the crops they were familiar with growing.

        Spread effects. This was particularly good for water management technologies, and
those of high impact and low cost. See Annex 2b.

          Results of studies on Silt benefits. With the removal of silt being one of the most
common interventions for increasing tank water volume, as well as percolation, but also popular
among for the possibility of silt application on farms as fertilizer, is worth examining the latter
benefits. An estimated 17.6 million cubic meters of silt was excavated from tank beds over the
project period (up to Dec 2011), of which approximately 80% has been spread by farmers on their
fields. Field trials and anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been significant yield benefits,
largely attributed the impact of the silt on the soil structure (i.e. reduction in soil capping25) and to
its nutritional value. A study conducted by UASD26 found that farmers were applying an average
of 147 tonnes/ha and that the percentage increase in yields (over seven crops) was in range of 20
to 45% (over check yields). The Impact Assessment report found that farmers were applying an
average of 63 tractor loads on an average area of 1.6 ha and reported increases in yields of
between 5 and 27% in the first year after application, and similar results in the second year. This
was assessed to be largely due improved physical properties of soil rather than major increase in
nutrients.

Component 3.3. Fisheries and IGAs

3.3.a. Tank Fisheries Development

         From the total project physical target of 1180 tanks envisaged (600 tanks original credit
project, 210 extended taluks, 370 additional financing), 1403 tanks were achieved. The project
provided training on improved fish farming to TUGs beneficiaries besides supporting
advanced/stunted fish fingerlings, lime, feed, and lease money for first year and fishing
equipment such as fishing nets, coracle (type of boat) in bigger tanks which resulted in enhancing
average fish productivity from 160 kg per hectare before intervention of project to 535 after
interventions. The project adopted two fish farming models - aquaculture with stunted growth
fingerlings and the other with advanced growth fingerlings. The productivity of stunted growth
observed about 1200 kg per hectare. In order to enhance culture period of seasonal tanks dead
storage was increased by desilting 1-1.25 meter depth trench below silt level with surface area of
0.5-1 hectare for tanks below 40 hectare command area and 1-2 hectare for tanks above 40
hectare commend area.

         Fish Seed Procurement and Supply. The project procured about 228.86 lakh fingerlings
in the form of advanced and stunted growth with 2-3 inches size. The fish farmers were stocking
fry (small size fish seed) before project interventions; therefore project introduced stocking of
bigger fish seed, a major input of the project. This enhanced survival resulted into improvement

in productivity. In order to ensure supply of fish seed project supported renovation of two fish
rearing hatcheries of Fisheries Department i.e. one in Shimoga (1.14 hectare) and other in Kolar
district (0.56hectare).The effort also made to encourage TUGs to rear fish seed which had
encouraging response in Raichur district .

         Training for TUG Members. About 7400 members identified under project was
imparted training in improved fish farming since they lack skill of fish farming. The good
numbers of beneficiaries were introduced to fish farming activity first time. About 2200 women
also trained for fish farming .The training was conducted by Fish Farmers Development Agencies
in Fisheries Department Karnataka.

        Pilot Project on Fresh Water Prawn Farming: In order to assess feasibility for fresh
water prawn farming and to recommend best practice for culture, the study was conducted by
Karnataka University for Animal Sciences and Fisheries, Bidar. The study concluded that prawn
farming is feasible in seasonal tanks with appropriate tank management and market linkages. The
study has provided information of best technological package and recommended suitable districts
for undertaking prawn farming.

         Fish Marketing Linkages. The fish harvested by TUGs marketed in village and surplus
is either auctioned to fish traders or supplied to members for selling at other places. However, the
project made efforts to provide market linkages through women SHGs and selling through
Karnataka State Fishermen Cooperative Federation.

Extension Support:

       Participation in Mathsaya Mela (Fish Festival). Project participated in Mathsaya Mela
        at Bangalore by setting JSYS Stall for disseminating information of project for benefit of
        others. About 100,000 people visited JSYS stall. Project also organized exposure visits of
        TUGs to best managed tanks to learn best practices of fish farming.
       Extension Effort of Fisheries Coordinator: The Fisheries Specialist at SPU prepared
        comprehensive extension material in local language, such as, interactive CD on fish
        farming practices, three fisheries development program for E-TV, introduction of cost
        effective indigenous trap fishing method for harvesting fish, and disseminating monthly
        information.

         Results of fisheries activities. These are discussed further in Annex 2b. In summary
following outcomes were achieved in tanks with fishery activities: increased fish productivity,
livelihoods for 7400 mainly poor tank users and fishers, fish for food, household incomes from
sales of fish and a major contribution to the O&M funds of TUGs.

3.3.b. Income generating Activities (IGAs)

         Social activities included in the ITDP were IGA and kitchen gardens. Villagers in the
tank areas were encouraged to start other income-generating activities. The income generation
activities aimed to assist poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable groups who are not likely to benefit
from the tank restoration activities. In the first and second batch tanks, the project had two
components namely (i) Tribal Development Plan; and (ii) Gender Action Plan. From the third
batch onward both the components were integrated into the Income Generation Activity. The
objective of incorporating IGA component is to rope in landless and weaker section of the project
village into tank management.



                                                67
         In each tank beneficiaries are selected during the PRA Grama Sabha. For tanks with less
than 40 ha of command area, 30 to 50 beneficiaries were selected and for tanks of more than 40
ha of command area, 60 to 100 beneficiaries were selected. Preference was given to families
living below poverty line, landless people, female landowners, and widowed or divorced people.
All beneficiaries received a loan of Rs. 2,000 from JSYS to start IGA and this loan has to be
repaid (with no interest) to the TMIs within a year. The SHGs are responsible for the repayment
of the loans of their members. When the loans are repaid the TMIs select new beneficiaries who
can start IGA. Most beneficiaries start tank-related activities, like livestock rearing, growing
vegetables or flower marketing. When beneficiaries do not have the skills to develop tank-related
activities, they can get involved in other activities like tailoring. The IGA are designed around
skill enhancement trainings and provision of revolving funds and many of these activities are
focused towards women members of these communities. The IGA undertaken in 18 Districts are
based on agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, artisan and allied activities.

        For the implementation of IGA, it was agreed that (i) If more than one village comes
under TMI, main village will be considered for implementation of the program; (ii) primary data
through wealth ranking should be collected for the selection of beneficiaries; (iii) maximum
beneficiaries should not exceed 20 for ZP tanks and 30 for MI tanks; (iv) if landless people in the
village are less than 20 in case of GP Tank, then poor and small farmers can be selected; (v) if
landless people in the village are less than 30 in case of MI Tank, till 30 poor small farmers may
be considered; (vi) Rs 2,000 was fixed per beneficiary as matching grant or seed money; (vii) the
Matching Grant or Seed Money was to be linked with Bank/Co-operative Bank, the SHG should
avail this and run a viable activity; (viii) in absence of existing SHG, the amount should be
released to start an IGA and SHG should be developed and if Group formation is not possible,
individual activity can be considered; and (ix) the list of beneficiaries selected in PRA should be
approved by Gram Sabha and incorporated in ITDP. The amount was increased to Rs. 100,000
for ZP tanks for Rs. 200,000 for MI tanks. In phase II, the amount for ZP was further increased
to Rs. 50,000. In order to assist beneficiaries, JSYS has developed and distributed district wise
handbook for IG schemes to all TUGs. The handbook is written in Kannada.

        Progress: The IGAs have been implemented in 3,710 tanks (3059 TMIs) covering 99,453
beneficiaries. A total of Rs. 608 million has been disbursed for IGA under original credit of
which Rs. 333.46 million has been disbursed by JSYS; Rs. 148.03 million has been supplemented
by commercial banks under bank linkages and Rs. 102. 75 million has been invested by SHG
members as their contribution. Less than 2% of the total amount received by beneficiaries comes
from various line departments. To sustain the IGA, it is important for the project to focus on skill
development of the beneficiaries. Since majority of the beneficiaries opted for sheep/goat rearing
and dairy, project should bear the cost of insurance of animals at least for the first round.

        Kitchen Gardens: In each tank an amount of Rs. 2,000 was planned for kitchen gardens.
Poor families with some land next to their houses had started kitchen garden to supplement their
daily needs. Ten families are selected in each tank through the Gram Sabha and for each family
an amount of Rs. 200 is made available. The selected families were distributed with vegetable
seeds (8 species), coconut saplings or lemon saplings. So far project has disbursed Rs. 6.47
million to 34840 beneficiaries across 3484 tanks.

Annex 2b        Detailed Description of Achievement of PDO

         The achievement of project development objective and its associated indicators, and also
supporting intermediate outcome indicators from AF are treated in Table F and summarized in
section 3.2. The objectives and indicators are clear in the expectations of community involvement
in both implementation and management of tanks. These should result in improved rural
livelihoods and thus poverty reduction of an inclusive group of tanks users, mainly from
increased agricultural production and income generating activities, as measurable indicators.

         As clearly stated in the PAD, the benefits will derive from improved water storage and
distribution capacity of the tanks. There were weaknesses in the AF indicator targets which did
not fully articulate the total tanks, beneficiaries and extent of command areas. Where possible, the
analysis thus draws on evidence which compares similar users in similar tanks with and without
the project – to account for changes taking place in the rural areas and agriculture in the State
over the project period. The independent Impact Assessment Study 2012 (IAS 2012, executive
summary in Annex 5) limited to Phase I areas, provides reasonable comparison between such
groups, and also between comparable rainfall years (Baseline Years 2005/6, impact years
2010/11), as rainfall variability could otherwise make before and after comparisons very difficult.
This analysis is complemented by data from the various project MIS systems and studies on the
agricultural technology results done by the UAS themselves, including some forward looking but
relatively unstructured analysis by the project, for example on hydrological aspects.

1) Self managed and sustainable tank users groups (TUGs) established

        The first indicator for the project is a complex one, covering a wide range of areas. These
include: i) number of TUGs and the number of tanks; ii) the coverage of membership and
especially marginalized tanks users (for clarity presented as a separate indicator in table F and
below); iii) the implied effectiveness of the functioning of the groups and how self-sustaining
they are; and iv) their implied continuing operation (their tank management function).

         By 2012, the project helped establish 3,126 TUGs covering 3,710 tanks (out of formal
target of 3,925 tanks, where some TUGs cover more than one small tank), covering over 1.1
million members users. As a number of the tanks (700) were added to the formal targets towards
the very end of the project, due to savings, these can be to some degree be considered an added
benefit. Given that the final target for the project became more ambitious due to these additional
700 tanks from savings, the achievement of the development objectives should be seen in light of
this challenge. Out of 3710 tanks, 207 tanks have been dropped from direct project support, but
have had partial activities done by TUGs. To date full handover has been done on about half of
tanks, with the rest expected to be handed over in 2012. Most TUGs have managed funds,
satisfactorily implemented tank rehabilitation and other activities – and most importantly were
responsive to their members. The TUGs have gone some way in generating their own resources,
however operation and maintenance activities by the TUGs are mixed and although there are
encouraging signs of follow-up activities by federations and support from other schemes (see
intermediate indicators Table F(b), and below). With such a complex PDO indicator 1 it is
estimated to have been achieved to a large extent with a few shortcomings on sustainability. A
more detailed discussion follows.

        The project had two models for community-based tank management, namely (1)
association of tank users as an independent society (TUG) and (2) subcommittee of Gram
Panchayat (GPSC) under the Panchayati Raj Act. Under the project, the village communities and
tank users were given a choice for the institutional option most suitable for their tank. Out of
3,126 TUGs, 3,007 TUGs chose to register as societies and 119 as GPSCs27. The options for the
Grama Sabha and Grama Panchayat were discontinued during the project due to a lack of any
uptake by the tank users. The reasons given by members (IAS 2012) for this preference were that
the TUG format was more open and accountable and there was less political interference and a
greater sense of ownership. In several cases, it was noted that TUG leaders had to confront
powerful interests to stop illegal tank related activities (such as sand extraction).

        TUGs appear to have been well formed with the committee members knowledgeable
about their roles. TUGs that were in implementation stage were maintaining records and holding
meetings (including several Gram Sabhas) for major decisions. According to the IAS 2012, 86
percent of members reported that they felt that the ITDP reflected the needs of the tank and the
local community. The majority (73 percent) felt that 75 percent of the ITDP targets had been met,
15 percent felt 50 percent of the ITDP targets had been met. Most respondents (representing a
large cross section of users –see next indicator) expressed satisfaction with the functioning of the
TUG – 23 percent to a great extent, 67 percent to some extent. This is very notable achievement
compared to the minimal engagement prior to the project.

         The TUGs have been considerably involved in the identification of tank issues, planning,
contracting, implementation and labor, supervision and quality control, and planning of the future
of their tanks. Above all, the IAS 2012 impact assessment study and ICRR team field visits
consistently showed the tank users valued the community based approach to tank management
and have a sense of ownership over the tank system. The tank improvement activities were
identified, implemented and supervised by the TUGs and resulted in outcomes that were
consistently recognized by the communities as important to their needs. During the ICRR mission
and from case studies, there were several examples of strong leadership noted (often by women),
greater unity in the community, and local innovations.

2) Inclusion of marginalized groups

         The first PDO indicator also included a separate element of inclusion: ‘…Tank User
Groups established… covering at least 85% of the traditionally marginalized tank users organized
under the Tank Management Institutes’ (PAD has separate indicator: Meaningful participation of
traditionally marginalized tank users). It is somewhat difficult to qualify exactly what ‘85% of the
traditionally marginalized tank users’ would be, and the project did not attempt to quantify what
the total potential user group might be, although there were village PRAs and identification of
users from multiple use perspectives in forming TUG membership. There was also considerable
work done in each tank to include marginal users, such as farmers in the tail end of command
areas, the landless, women (often depending on water for clothes washing and other household
uses), livestock users and farmers in tank catchment areas.

         While the benefits section of the PAD indicates 2 million users for 2,000 tanks, an
increased number would be expected with the 700 tanks added on from the savings accrued. A
precise target was never set, nor assumptions clarified for a clear number of beneficiaries. There
is also a question of sensitivity to the size of tanks selected, which was not tracked closely during
implementation and would most likely increase the number of users given the increase in tank
size selected during implementation.


27
     The total number of TUGs is less than that of the tanks as some TUGs manage more than one tank.



                                                     70
         The project MIS identified 1.16 million TUG members (on average around 300 per tank)
covering a wide range of farmers and other users, often traditionally marginalized. From ICRR
mission field discussions and individual village records provided, the TUGs covered a large
majority of direct users. The economic and financial analysis notes close to 200,000 of direct
beneficiaries are command area farmers, thus almost a million additional TUG members
participated in the implementation and decision making process. This inclusion can be considered
a major achievement of the project and the second part of PDO Indicator 1 is considered
achieved. The inclusion was manifested in that almost half of the members are women (as
generally one man and one woman from each household were represented in the TUG28), 30% are
from Scheduled Caste or Tribe (SC/ST, also reflected in impact assessments study) which is
generally greater than in population. In addition a majority of members are marginal and small
farmers, and around 15% are landless. The marginal users were also part of TUG management:
SC/ST members were 34%, and female members also represented 40% in tank committees with
80% of treasurers were women, though a lower percent of women were presidents or secretaries
(see intermediate outcomes).

         In addition to the more direct beneficiaries, discussions during the ICR mission indicated
that other villagers and even nearby villages benefited from improved tank conditions, especially
where livestock could get water in the dry season, or groundwater levels increased for borewell
users in nearby communities. With an average of five household members, and additional indirect
users from surrounding communities the project, a likely number of users can conservatively be
estimated up to 3 million people.

         For the income generation activities, communities identified the poorest of the poor in a
participatory manner, and cumulatively SHGs provided small loans to around 100,000
beneficiaries. Further, under the fisheries component, the Fisheries Department trained 7,800
landless people in about 1,403 tanks. The project also had several benefits such as the increased
employment that resulted from both additional agriculture activities created by improved water
availability and from the implementation of civil works under the project. These types of
activities often assist the poorer landless laborers in the community.

3a) Tank Rehabilitation and resulting agricultural Improvement

         Tank rehabilitation and improvement was the biggest component under the project and
aimed at improving water use efficiency through strengthened water storage capacity of tanks,
management of agricultural water demand, as well as improved water distribution in irrigation
systems from tanks. This was achieved through the implementation of physical works that were
identified with community participation. Together with exposure to improved water management
and agricultural practices, this provided a range of agricultural benefits, leading to improved
livelihoods.

        Typical physical rehabilitation works included strengthening of tank bunds, outlet sluices,
and waste weirs (spillways), limited de-silting of reservoir areas, cleaning of feeder channels,
construction of erosion-control structures in streams, and tree planting in tank foreshore areas.
The clearance of feeder channel, bund strengthening and repair of damaged weirs ensured the
water storage capacity of the tanks while other structures helped to improved water use
efficiency. The detailed outputs achieved for these were extensive, generally of good quality and
detailed in Annex 2. Although a core premise for tank rehabilitation, there were no specific PDO

28
     This would imply that household coverage of the project is conservatively around 500,000.



                                                      71
or intermediate indicators on change in water availability, or use efficiency (although indirectly
measured in terms of IO for expanded cropped area). Nevertheless, to understand the impacts an
overview is provided below for these water related outcomes, based on available information.

         Most of the benefits were measured in relation to command areas, although other areas
would benefit to some degree (catchment, groundwater irrigated areas and drinking water source
to other villages etc). The command area under the 3,710 project tanks was around 160,000 ha
(closer to 150,000 if dropped tanks are excluded, see Annex 2a for tables).

         Detailed analysis of Water related outcomes. A comprehensive study29 of completed
and handed over 115 tanks (covering different agro-climatic zones under the original credit
funding) has been conducted by JSYS to assess the impact of tank improvement. The study
period for the field survey has been selected based on the implementation completion dates and
rainfall pattern. The Rabi (October-February) cropping season for 2010-2011 was fixed for post-
project/impact period. Taking into account the comparability of rainfall pattern, the Rabi cropping
season 2005-2006 was selected and analyzed as a pre-project/base period. Besides the water used
from the tank, groundwater used for irrigation in the command area was also taken into account.
Given the methodology and technique applied for the study and data collection it could be stated
that the accuracy of the estimations and conclusions is highly reliable. The main conclusions from
the study were:

 An overall increase of 19.79% with regard to actually irrigated area. GPS tracking has been
  used for measuring the post-rehabilitation irrigated area; and LISS IV satellite images (April
  2006) and Focus-group discussion with the command area farmers have been used to estimate
  the pre-rehabilitation irrigated area. This was also largely confirmed by IAS 2012, which
  showed that this was 15% more than controls (intermediate outcome indicator almost
  achieved).
 Some 44.83% increase in available water volume. Estimation is made based on comparison of
  volume of water stored after the rehabilitation with the volume of water stored for the same
  period in 2005. Post-rehabilitation volume of water has been estimated as a difference from
  “area-volume? relations obtained from the topographic survey data for the end of 2010
  monsoon season and empty tanks at the end of cropping season. Volume of available water in
  2005 has been estimated through the focus group survey of farmers and estimated height of
  water in tanks.
 About 20.88% increase in per hectare water availability. Estimated based on the available
  water and actually irrigated area for pre- and post-project periods.
 Estimated 41.22% increase in ground water extraction. A detailed inventory of the irrigation
  open/bore wells in the tank command area was carried out during June 2010. Total number of
  wells in use during pre- and post-project periods was recorded. Groundwater extraction in the
  command area was worked out considering the average yield of groundwater extracted during
  the crop season.
 An average increase of 23.01% in the Water Use Efficiency defined as the value realized on
  the produce grown in the command area in Indian Rupees per cubic meter of water.

        The benefits achieved are reinforced by the better than expected and positive farm returns
in several crops noted in the economic and financial analysis (Section 3.3. and Annex 3).

         Another hydrological study30 by JSYS is currently on-going to assess the Groundwater
recharge in the vicinity of project tanks. 175 tanks have been selected out of all the tanks which
are under implementation during Phase II from which in 134 desiltation has been completed.
Three to five bore wells/open wells are identified in each tank command/catchment area for
monitoring groundwater level to assess recharge/discharge. Groundwater level is recorded on a
monthly basis using digital water level indicators. Unfortunately, the pace of study is very much
depends on the completion of civil works and availability of water in the tanks. However, based
on the preliminary analysis of 35 tanks with water available revealed an average raise of
groundwater level of about 0.29 m31. Analysis of hydrographs of 2010 and 2011 from several
tanks has shown that even with the much lesser rainfall the groundwater level is remarkably
higher after the desiltation. It is anticipated that the study with recommendations on groundwater
exploitation would be completed by the end of 2012. The IAS 2012 looked at farmers’
perceptions in the open well and borehole levels who considered water levels had increased 1.5
meters in open wells and 10 m in borewells, compared to controls (achieving intermediate
indicator target). However, given that the project closing date is mid-2012, it is essential for the
World Bank and the Government of Karnataka to make provisions for this important study to be
finalized as indicated.

        As evidenced by the farmers and TUGs leadership from the tanks visited, the reliability
and timeliness of water delivery has greatly improved, leading to more efficient water use by
crops and eventually yield increases, though these are not yet measurable at project completion.
This has also led to a better organization in water distribution.

3b) Agriculture production changes

         The project intervention ensured good integration of water and agriculture activities and
covered the tank users in all the project tanks. Farmers clearly benefited from the tank
rehabilitation works, with improved water availability and distribution. Based on the IAS 2012
for a large sample of command area in 200 tanks, total production has increased by 47% on
average compared to controls which had increased to 12% (a 35% incremental difference – which
was not specified). As target 35% is for only lower half of the command area, the PDO indicator
target has been achieved considerably – even taking into account that the final number of tanks
have not been covered. This was also distributed well in that there was 20% incremental cropped
area for tail end farmers, who often are the last to benefit.

         The AF PDO indicator also includes another dimension: on income benefits generated -
here treated separately for clarity: that ‘at least 50% of farmers in the upgraded Tank Command
Area [would have] increased… income by at least 25% of the baseline’. As there are considerable
changes taking place in the agriculture context in Karnataka (changing consumptions patterns,
private sector market diversification and upgrading of infrastructure) it is important to look at the
changes in project tank compared to controls. Thus in project tank command areas net income for
farmers increased by 76%, compared to a considerable 42% for non-project tank farmers (IAS
2012). Nevertheless the incremental 33% on average is considerably better than for the target
25% for half of the farmers, thus this PDO indicator has been exceeded. Such benefit would

31
     The mechanics of this may be interesting to look at. It is well-known that canals in alluvial soils tend to seal over
      time, as the natural soil pores are closed by fine silt and sediment. The same could have happened in the tanks. If
      farmers wanted to increase infiltration they could probably do it by running a ripper over the bed of the tank each
      year, to break up the deposited material.




                                                                73
probably then make up for any slightly lower benefit that might arise from a reduced number of
tanks covered under the project, compared to the overall target.

         In addition, even though the civil works are in progress in several tanks, a number of
improved agricultural practices have also been demonstrated to the users. This would also
contribute to the benefits in terms of production and incomes noted above. The technology
dissemination in agriculture was achieved through the regional Universities of Agriculture
Sciences (UAS) in Bangalore and Dharwad. The key elements of the demonstrated technologies
were (for more details see Annex 2) the use of improved seeds, line sowing, transplanting of
younger seedlings (of rice and Ragi) and soil test based application of fertilizers and
micronutrients (zinc). More efficient water management practices were demonstrated such as bed
and furrow planting, drip and sprinkler irrigation in high value crops, and SRI method of rice
cultivation. The project has also promoted the use of ecologically sustainable agricultural
practices in the command area of the tanks.

         The technology support from universities has resulted in widespread adoption of basic
agriculture techniques appropriate to tank farmers for water scarce situations and for lower inputs
of costly chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This happened through 1,237 on-farm
demonstrations in 12,494 ha covering 26,767 beneficiaries, and exposure trainings for
approximately 200,431 farmers - including 3,187 farmers’ field schools with 86,973
beneficiaries, and soils samples analyses for 139,539 farmers.

        The UAS impact studies showed that the productivity increased by 56% over the base
year and 35% over the control in tank commands in Kharif and by almost 69% in horticulture in
and near tanks command. Initial examination of the draft impact assessment report, which
compares similar before and after water years and comparisons to controls, seems to show
considerable agriculture productivity and livelihoods benefits between 20-40% incremental
increases Kharif (monsoon season) surface irrigated area, groundwater irrigated area, productivity
and large increases in net incomes. Cropping intensity and diversification have increased as well
as improvements in water use efficiency.

         The 2012 Impact Assessment study reported on adoption of various technologies, both
for the base and impact years and against control tanks. This is a particularly difficult output to
measure, as there are many external influences, particularly in India, where there are now
numerous government subsidy schemes promoting similar technologies. The results show that
while some technologies were well received by the project (i.e. seed treatment), others were
already widespread (i.e. farm yard manure) and a lack of a suitable indicator specifically for
chemical fertilizers shows no impact of the project. Overall the adoption rates nevertheless are
very positive, particularly those related to water management, where at least 37% of farmers had
adopted improved water saving techniques (alternate furrow, border check, broad beds and
alternative wetting and drying) all of which provide significant water productivity increases over
the traditional field to field irrigation.

4) Income increases Fisheries and other income generating activities

         Marginal users also benefitted from the improved water storage, such as landless families
in the community, including farm laborers, and those who own livestock or use tanks for
washing, or drinking water through nearby wells. They were also benefited from IGAs.

        The project directly supported income generating activities, particularly for the landless
and agriculture laborers. A large proportion of the allocated IGA support funds were channeled


                                                74
through women’s self-help groups, and a large portion of lower caste or tribal. Field visits
confirmed that communities identified the poorest of the poor in a participatory manner, and that
cumulatively the SHGs had provided small loans to around 99,453 beneficiaries. Though this was
not defined precisely in proportion to all ‘landless tank users’ in relation to the overall number
beneficiaries (over 1 million, see above), it appears quite comprehensive. Due to the small size of
these loans, most were used for purchasing sheep, and a considerable portion of the loans have
been repaid, and recycled to other members. Many SHGs have paid some interest back to the
TUG. The IAS 2012, which surveyed all IGA beneficiaries in sample tanks, indicated that
incomes of members have improved by 56% comparing them to non-beneficiaries32 (41%), with
an incremental increase of 15%. Formally this achievement, although considerable, is less than
the target PDO indicator. This in part attributable to the small loans available, which are also
small compared to the increasing possibilities of larger loans through SHGs which are now taking
place through external bank linkages.

         Under the Resettlement strategy, TUGs had been active in the sensitive task of getting
over 7,803 encroachers – all below the poverty line - removed from farming tank bed areas (2,288
ha), but also assisted them in setting up new livelihoods. The IAS 2012 noted that the incomes for
the resettled had largely doubled as a result of the change in occupations and an increase in assets.

        As discussed in section 3.5a there was also a considerable amount of employment
generated from civil works activities as well as from additional agricultural activities, largely
benefiting agriculture laborers who are often poor and landless.

        In addition, though not in the direct form of IGA support, there were increased fisheries
opportunities and income impacts arising from the project’s efforts to increase suitable water
bodies from desilting and tank water availability, and technology support in the form of training
and equipment. Also important was the project support to the adjustment of policy so that TUGs
could allocate priority fishing to local tank users who have little or no access to land in tank
command areas (as opposed to the traditional rather un-transparent fish lease auctioning system –
see Annex 2, Component 3.3).

         Fisheries. The cumulative progress was fisheries development in 1,403 tanks against the
total project target of 1,180 tanks33. The Impact Assessment of Ongoing Project (Phase-I) for
KCBTMP was conducted by Centre for Management and Social Research (CMSR). The WB
supervision and project team observed that study had some limitations: The sample size was very
small, tanks sampled which were not selected for fisheries activities, production aspect not
studied, and O&M and sustainability contributions of fisheries not considered. In view of above
shortcoming in study conducted by CMSR, the impact data is taken from studies conducted by
the project which covers information of all 1400 tanks developed for fisheries, was used by the
project team to summarize findings. The fisheries development had significant impact as follows:

        Played a strategic role in providing additional livelihood to 7400 rural folk, about 75%
         landless and 25% marginal farmers



32
   Non-beneficiary control may not be fully comparable as they were poorer, even than the relatively poor
    beneficiaries. But the general trend of the results should hold.
33
   While the formal target was 60% of tanks, the project used the original 30% target (PAD p42) which is
    more realistic considering the number of suitable tanks.

          Produced protein rich food about 1092 tons , contributing to reduce malnutrition by
           providing fish in less than market price to village populations sometimes free etc. This
           has improved food security of village community.
          Enhanced productivity of tanks from 160 kg/ha /annum of pre-project to average fish
           production level of 535 kg during project intervention. Few tanks stocked with stunted
           growth fish seed achieved fish production to a level of 1200 kg/ha/annum.
          Contributed in reducing poverty of 7400 TUG members by enhancing their income
           around Rs.4500 per beneficiary/annum.
          The fisheries component has significant contribution for providing O and M funds to
           TUGs around Rs.139 lakh from project tanks, which is around 30 % income received
           from sale of fish, whereas TUGs are struggling to collect irrigation charges from the
           farmers. Fisheries are major contributor for O and M to TUGs34.
          Gender participation was lacking in fisheries sector in pre-project scenario for
           undertaking production activity which has been enhanced significantly through social
           mobilization and capacity building for about 2200 women. Women SHGs involved in
           fish marketing produced by TUGs.
          Project policy initiatives provided access to community by granting lease of tank for
           fisheries activity to TUGs on priority basis for five years by changing Fisheries
           Department policy of tender –cum -auction which was restricting access of community.
           Lease period also extended to five years from one year by project initiatives.
          The feasibility study conducted for Fresh Water Prawn farming by Karnataka Animal
           Sciences and Fisheries University, Bidar provided best technological practice for
           undertaking prawn farming in Karnataka State. This will also enhance income of TUGs.

         Sustainability. The project study on sustainably conducted for 500 tanks of phase –I
revealed that fisheries activity was continued for subsequent years in around 52% tanks (260
tanks) subject to availability of water. This means that adoption of technology was around 52%.
About 43% tanks did not continue fisheries activity due to lack of sufficient water required for
fish farming, social conflicts between agriculture and fisheries activities, problem of renewal of
fishing lease in time and lack of interest of TUGs due to poaching from community of villages.




34
     The Economic and Financial Analysis (Annex 3) notes however that overall achievements were slightly
      less than expected as the water surface area covered was small than foreseen, likely due to smaller than
      projected tanks were favoured for fisheries interventions. Large tanks have strongly contested auctions.

Annex 3         Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Project Benefits and Expected Returns in the PAD and AF

         The PAD/Additional Financing (AF) economic and financial analysis (EFA) quantified
benefits from different project activities included in the treatment of irrigation tanks and then
aggregated different streams of benefits and costs to estimate an overall ERR for the project.
Major sources of project benefits for EFA are; agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, livestock,
forestry, time savings in access to domestic water, silt removed from the tank bed and income
generating activities. For economic analysis, parity prices were calculated based on World Bank
forecasts for the main traded commodities and non-tradables were adjusted by a standard
conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9. Farm labor was valued at market wage rate and adjusted by SCF
to obtain the economic wage rate. Financial project costs are adjusted to economic project costs
by netting out taxes/duties and price contingencies (local and foreign inflation plus devaluation),
which accounted for 15% and 17% of total financial costs respectively for PAD and AF analyses.

        For PAD EFA, main economic benefits from the project were expected from agriculture
(63%), followed by fisheries (18%), forestry (11%), time savings in fetching domestic water
(6%), livestock and forage (1%) and nutrient value of silt (<1%). In agriculture, six agro-climatic
zones (ACZ) were considered with two tank models for medium and large tanks for each ACZ.
For AF EFA, main economic benefits were expected from agriculture (78%), income generating
(IGA) activities (11%), fisheries (7%), livestock (3%), and nutrient value of silt (1%). In
agriculture, five ACZs were merged into two categories as follows: (i) dry and northern transition
zones and (ii) hilly and southern transition zones. Two command area categories for Zila
Panchayath (ZP) and MID tanks for each zone were considered. Crop models were formulated by
season and zone.

         Agriculture and horticulture benefits were expected from the command area treated by
the project, projected at 72,649 ha covering 2000 tanks for PAD EFA and 52,420 ha covering
1225 tanks for AF EFA. In PAD EFA, it was also projected that improved ground water recharge
in the project tanks’ command area will additionally irrigate 2916 ha in the peripheral area
surrounding tanks outside the command area. The expected benefits in the EFA of PAD and AF
would result from two main assumptions: (i) 11% to 45% increase in paddy yield, 9% to 35%
increase in the yield of other cereal/pulse/oilseed crops, and 22% increase in the yield of
horticulture crops and (ii) 11% to 43% increase in area under irrigation in the project areas. (see
T-1 for the summary of assumptions in the PAD and AF).

         The EFA also incorporated benefits from livestock, in about 10% of the project tanks,
based on the assumption that the net income from 5 and 10 cross-bred cows in medium and large
tanks respectively will improve by 25% due to improved feeding management demonstrated
through the project. It is assumed that 0.5 ha and 1.0 ha of irrigated paddy lands will be
substituted with forage crops in the command areas of the selected medium and large tanks
respectively. The net benefit of forage cropping is also captured in the EFA.

         PAD projected forestry activities by planting 2.5 ha in the medium-sized tanks and 5 ha
in the large tanks on tank foreshore areas and/or other common and private lands, which are to be
demonstrated in about 20% of the project tanks. EFA quantified forestry benefits based on the
net benefit streams for a representative mixed forest foreshore model.

         PAD EFA assumed that half of the families in the communities associated with the
project tanks would spend 2 person-hours per day for 60 days in a year when the tanks go dry for
fetching the water for domestic use. TUG led management of project tank systems would help in
sustaining the tank water due to which about 120 person-hours will be saved per family in the
project area. Value of time savings is quantified using the wage rate and included in the project
benefits.

        PAD estimated removal of silt from the project tanks is 37 million M3. The nutritive
value of the silt is valued based on UASB study35 and added to the project benefits. It is also
assumed that (i) the additional water available after tank improvements will be 1.5 times the
quantity of silt assumed to be removed and (ii) on an average, estimated quantity of additional
water will be available in at least 80% of years.

B. ICRR Estimation Methodology

         PAD/AF methodology was applied to the extent feasible in order to estimate the project
costs and returns. The analysis was done at 2012 prices. Weaknesses and gaps in systematic
collection of outcome/impact and output data, as part of project M&E, hindered somewhat the
estimation of project benefits. Major constraints encountered at ICRR estimation are; (i) non-
availability of complete set of EFA files and raw data used for deriving the results presented in
PAD, (ii) non-availability of tank specific irrigated agriculture data, and (iii) lack of
disaggregated agriculture data from project M&E and Impact Assessment (IA) study
differentiated between seasons and rainfed/irrigated cropping. The ICRR estimates relied to a
great extent on updating the ex-ante analysis carried out during PAD and AF. To overcome the
M&E and IA data limitations, information derived from other sources such as published statistics
and triangulation from discussions with project stakeholders and field visits during the ICR
mission were used while re-estimating the returns to project investments for the ICR EFA.

         Project Costs: Total actual project cost is Rs 6907 M as against PAD/AF projected cost
of Rs 8156 M at current prices. All costs are adjusted to 2012 constant prices using the Indian
annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) to inflate historical prices. Total actual project cost is
estimated at Rs 8275 M at constant prices. Project economic costs at ICRR have used a SCF of
0.9 and parity prices for relevant tradable goods. Historical and future economic prices (based on
Bank commodity price projections) for the main commodities and inputs were derived from
international prices and analysis was conducted in constant 2009 prices using the Manufacturing
Unit Value (MUV) index as deflator for future prices. For comparability, cost and benefit flows
have been calculated with 12% opportunity cost of capital over a period of 25 years. The ICRR
estimates include IGA costs and benefits, which are not included in PAD analysis but considered
in AF EFA. Finally, ICRR project recurrent costs are estimated as 3% of investment costs.

         Agriculture: Crop budgets for major crops (paddy, maize, ragi, red gram, bengal gram,
groundnut, sunflower, tomato and onion) differentiated by seasons and ACZs are formulated
based on the data available from multiple sources like IA study, JSYS database, UAS project
documents, supplemented with region wise cost of cultivation of crop reports for various years
(2005 to 2010) covering a sample of 2000 farmers every year drawn from five farm holding sizes
representing all ACZs under the project. For agriculture benefit quantification, project ACZs are
broadly grouped into two major zones namely; (i) central, north and north east dry zones (non-
paddy cereals dominated agriculture) (ii) hill, north and north east transition and south east dry
zones (paddy dominated agriculture). Dry zone agriculture in the tank command is dominated by
non-paddy cereals. Transition zone agriculture in the tank command is dominated by paddy
cultivation. Irrigated area, cropping pattern and crop productivity impacts are quantified
separately for dry and transition ACZ groups and aggregated for overall project area.

was covered under advanced
fingerling models. Benefits from fisheries are quantified from only 2243 ha of WSA covered by
the 1403 project tanks. WSA coverage is substantially lower than the target-only 19% of the


                                                       81
targeted WSA. Available WSA per tank (1.6 ha) demonstrated for fisheries is much lower than
what was projected in both PAD (5 ha) and AF (10 ha). See T-5 for summary of project targets
and realized values in fisheries.

         On sustainability also, JSYS database recorded that only 52% of the demonstrated tanks
are continuing the improved fish production management as against 85% projected by PAD/AF.
Finally, realized fish productivity is only 79% of the targeted yield levels. Consequently, realized
fish production with the project that will be sustained is only 9% of the targeted production.
Incremental income from fish tanks is estimated at Rs 8530 per ha of WSA, which is 22% less
than the targeted income levels. Incremental income from fisheries is sufficient to lift at least one
member of the benefited families above poverty line based on the poverty line cut-off income
levels at constant 2012 prices. In terms of the directly benefited population by the fisheries
development, about 10% of them, namely 4060 rural poor are potentially benefited by the poverty
alleviation impact.

         IGA Benefits: Income generation activities were introduced in the project to improve
livelihood prospects of landless and resource poor households. The project facilitated setting up
of income generating activities for 99,453 families. At current prices, about Rs 609 M has been
used to support these IGA activities, supported by project funds (55%), bank linkages (24%),
SHGs (17%) and department (4%). Livestock based activities (sheep, cow and goat) were opted
by 93% of the beneficiaries. Based on the JSYS database, annual financial net benefits ranged
from Rs 2200 to 10,100 per beneficiary. Weighted average net benefits across major IGA
activities, accounting for 93% of the beneficiaries is Rs 3900 per year. Following fisheries
experience, 52% sustainability is assumed for the continuation of IGA activities by the
beneficiaries for quantifying the benefits.

C. Economic Returns

         PAD and AF estimated project economic rate of return (ERR), respectively are 18% and
22% (T-6). When both PAD and AF are combined in the analysis, ERR came to 19% for the
project. The overall ERR on the base case assumption is estimated at 17%, lower than PAD and
AF estimates. In calculating the project’s ERR, all project costs were included, and set against the
incremental benefits arising from agriculture          T-6 PAD/AF/ICR Estimates of Project

are accounted through improved crop yields within the command area, benefits from livestock
and forestry are ignored for want of data (forestry) and lack of activities (livestock).




                                                 82
D. Main Reasons for lower Economic Returns

         The divergence between ICR and PAD/AF estimates can be traced mainly to differences
between assumed and realized values of production benefits from agriculture and fisheries.
Tables T-4, T-5 and T-7 shows over- and under-achievement with respect to PAD/AF targets in
specific areas contributing to the divergence in ERR.

         First the positive impacts in case of production benefits following the implementation of
the project (T-4); (i) area irrigated area by the tanks is 141312 ha, 6% more than the targeted area,
(ii) ICR estimated crop yields are 14% to 62% higher in case of non-paddy cereal crops, pulses
and horticulture crops than the PAD/AF projected yield levels, (iii) production of all crops at full
development is 7% more than the targeted levels. Despite all these positive impacts, the gains are
almost nullified by; (i) lower crop yields by 49% and 11% respectively for paddy and oilseeds as
compared to the projected yield levels. Paddy is the dominating crop in the tank command areas,
occupying 47% of the crop area. Consequently, ICR estimated incremental farm income at Rs
8050 per year is only marginally better than the PAD/AF projected income levels by about 2%.

         In case of fisheries, the project substantially under achieved with respect to the targets as
follows (T-5). (i) WSA covered is less by 81% as compared to the combined target of PAD and
AF. This mainly due to- 6% less coverage in terms of tanks demonstrated for fisheries and
significantly low WSA per tank by about 80% in case of tanks used covered under demonstration,
(ii) Only 52% of the tanks could sustain the improved fish production activities demonstrated by
the project as against 85% projected by PAD and AF, (iii) Only 79% of the targeted fish yield
levels is realized at full development. Consequently, incremental net income per ha of WSA from
fisheries is less by 22% and incremental annual fish production achieved by the project at full
development is only 9% of the targeted fish production levels. Hence, contribution of fisheries in
the annual incremental economic benefits at full development came down to just 1% as against
the projected share of 18% and 7% respectively in PAD and AF.

         Finally, prolonged                   T-7 Implementation delays: PAD/AF/ICR compared
implementation of project activities           Realization of full potential

project costs spent during the first nine
years and the remaining 54% spent
during the last two years; consequently delaying the start of project benefits as well as the
realization of full project benefits as follows:

         While PAD and AF projected that benefit stream will start from first and second year
after the start of implementation, ICR estimated that actual benefits started to flow only from fifth
year due to the delayed start of the project activities. PAD and AF projected that 50% of the full
potential benefits will be realized in year-3 and year-6 respectively. But actually, 50% of the full
benefits is estimated to be realized only in year-11. PAD and AF estimated that 100% realization
of full project benefits will happen by year- 11 and 10 respectively, ICR projected that full project
benefits will be realized only in year-15.

         The cumulative impact of (i) over and under achievements in terms of agriculture and
fisheries production benefits and (ii) delayed start and realization of full project benefits due to
delayed implementation of project activities as compared to what is planned in PAD and AF, is


                                                  83
reflected in the lower ERR for the project investments. Time and cost over runs pulled down the
rate of return. Both in PAD and AF EFA, Project's ERR is shown to be sensitive to delayed
implementation- Base ERR came down by 3 to 4 %.

E. Financial Returns

        PAD did not estimate the financial rate of return (FRR) for the project as a whole, but
mentioned that FRR is generally less by 4% as compared to ERR for different ACZs. Based on
this, PAD estimated FRR is likely to be around 14% as against AF estimated FRR of 20%, with a
NPV of Rs 2.2 billion (USD 47 M). FRR for the combined investments (PAD and AF) is likely to
be around 17%. In the absence of detailed data used for PAD EFA estimation, actual FRR could
not be estimated. ICR estimated FRR is 15.6%, with a NPV of Rs 0.8 billion (USD 17 M).
ICR estimated that annual net farm financial income increased by Rs 8015 per year for an average
holding size of 0.75 ha.

F. Poverty alleviation and farm employment impacts

          The project benefited 213,900 tank command area farmers, 10% more than the target.
90% of them are small and marginal farmers. Average farm financial income, at constant 2012
prices, increased by Rs 8015 per year for an average holding size of 0.75 ha, which is sufficient to
lift at least one member of the farm household above poverty line based on the Indian Planning
Commission estimates for rural Karnataka for 2004/05, updated for constant 2012 prices using
inflation index. About 70% of the project beneficiary farmers are resource poor marginal farm
holders. In terms of directly benefited population in the project farm families, about 14% of them,
namely 149,730 rural poor are potentially benefited by the poverty alleviation impact due to
increased farm income.

         Increased and improved irrigation coverage in the rehabilitated tanks, resulted in
intensified and diversified irrigated agriculture, generating additional farm employment for 8050
persons per year. This will help the landless and resource poor households by providing jobs for
about 270 days in a year. This has the potential of alleviating poverty additionally for about
40250 rural poor in the project area.

         Farm based income and employment generation activities generated by the project
through improved agriculture in the 3710 rehabilitated tanks will have sustained poverty
alleviation impacts for about 190,000 rural poor in the project villages. This accounts for 17% of
the population in the project villages.

         The project has further generated employment and income through rehabilitation
investments in 3710 project tanks during the project implementation period as follows: (i) wage
employment, estimated as 3.2 million person days, equivalent to 11830 person-years in total and
(ii) wage income of Rs 16200 per year per job. About 62% of the beneficiaries under this
category belong to socially disadvantaged SC and ST groups. The project has also helped 51,715
resource poor families in setting up and sustaining livestock dominated income generating
activities which has the potential of generating average annual income of Rs 3900 per
beneficiary. About 48% of these beneficiaries are from SC and ST groups and 21% of the
beneficiaries are landless labor households.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY OF ONGOING PROJECT – EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
(Phase I Project) of Karnataka Community-Based Tank Management Project
Revised Draft Report (January, 2012)
Centre for Management and Social Research, Hyderabad

I.      INTRODUCTION

         Cognizant of the complex set of factors contributing to the degradation of tank systems in
the State, the GoK has initiated a range of measures, to enhance the access, of farmers and other
users, to tank systems, that includes promoting community based tank management through
project Karnataka Community Based Tank Management Project (JSYS). The KCBTMP with
the support from the World Bank aimed to improve rural livelihoods and reduce poverty by
developing and strengthening community-based approaches to improving and managing
selected tank systems in the State. The tank rehabilitation and improvement component is the
major activity under the project through the implementation of physical works that are identified
with the participation of the beneficiary communities. In addition, the project also supports a
range of livelihood interventions in agriculture and other sectors such as fisheries and other
income generating activities. The project has two phases. Phase-I works of KCBTMP is at an
advanced stage for completion and has made reasonable impact on tank rehabilitation and their
management. In Phase 1, the project has taken up works in 1829 tanks. Until September 2011, a
total of 1583 tanks (86.5%) have been handed over to the Tank User Groups for operation and
maintenance. The works for remaining tanks are at different stages of completion. For assessing
the various impacts relating to Phase-I tanks of the Project, JSYS has commissioned a study by
studying sample of 200 tanks and 30 control tanks. This study looked at pre-project and post-
project situations and (ii) with-project and without-project situations.

II. PROFILE OF SAMPLE TANKS

        This assessment contextualized its findings through a prolife of the sample tanks. The
sample tanks fall under seven ACZs). Based on the designed command area the sample tanks
have been classified into two groups. ZP tanks (40 hectares and below) make up 79% of the
sample tanks the remaining (21%) are MI tanks (41 hectares and above). The South- Eastern Dry
Zone (SEDZ) – combination of Southern Dry Zone and Eastern Dry Zone – accounts for 46% of
the sample tanks comprising the present districts of Chikkaballapur, Kolar and part of Tumkur.
The Central Dry Zone is represented by 53 sample tanks making up slightly more than a fourth of
the sample tanks. The distribution of the command area farmers across the ACZs also varies
broadly in proportion to the sample tanks’ distribution. The sample ACZs are as
follows:

        1.   North-Eastern Transition Zone (NETZ: Bidar)
        2.   North-Eastern Dry Zone (NEDZ: Raichur)
        3.   Northern Dry Zone (NDZ: Bagalkote, Bellary, Koppal, Raichur)
        4.   Northern Transition Zone (NTZ: Haveri)
        5.   South-Eastern Dry Zone (SEDZ: : Kolar, Chintamani, Tumkur)
        6.   Central Dry Zone (CDZ: Bellary, Chitradurga, and Tumkur)
        7.   Hilly Zone (HZ: Haveri)




                                                87
         The average landholding of farmers in the tank command varies from a minimum of 1
acre in the
SEDZ to a maximum of 3.17 acres in the NETZ, the overall mean being 1.4 acres. SEDZ and
the CDZ account for almost three-fourths of the sample tanks. These two zones represent a
large number of typical tanks and on the basis of rainfall and water availability as well these two
zones broadly occupy the intermediate position.

        Rainfall data show that in terms of the mean rainfall in the base year it ranges from 550
mm in NEDZ to 984 in HZ; and the corresponding figures for the impact year are 692 mm in
NEDZ and 1102 mm in NETZ. The mean precipitation across the zones in the base year and in
the impact assessment year are 819 mm and 892 mm respectively. Distribution of rainfall among
ACZs in the base year and impact assessment year shows a broadly consistent pattern.

          A ranking of ACZs on the basis of rainfall in both base year and impact assessment year
broadly indicates that HZ and NETZ receive highest rainfall, followed by NTZ and SEDZ. CDZ,
NDZ and NEDZ occupy bottom three places in that order with NEDZ receiving the lowest
precipitation in base year as well as in impact assessment year. The mean rainfall levels in the
impact year are marginally higher across the zones. Information on the approximate water levels
and rainfall levels in the sample tanks was also collected. There are minor variations in the tank
filling status between the base year and impact assessment year. But the variation between the
ACZs is in general consistent with the rainfall distribution. But across the ACZs there is a
marginal improvement in the water levels of sample tanks in the impact year.

         The total command area reported by farmers of 200 sample tanks is 9,149 acres; it ranges
from 185 acres in NETZ to 2,844 acres in SEDZ. The cultivated area is lower than the total own
land across the ACZs indicating that some farmers in all zones had left a part or whole of their
land fallow. The cropped area covered by this assessment ranges from 150 acres to 2299 acres.
Overall this assessment covered 80% of the command area reported by famers of the sample
200 tanks.

III. IMPACTS ON AGRICULTURE

         This impact assessment covered 6,479 command area famers spread across the 200
project sample tanks; and 576 command area famers representing 30 sample control tanks. Close
to 70% of the command area farmers also own land in the non-command. Command area farmers
derive almost two-thirds of their income from cropping. Dairying is the second most important
activity in the agriculture sector, which contributes a tenth to the household incomes. Almost
11% of the command area farmers’ income comes from wage labour (farm and non-farm).

        Participation of farmers and performance of tank system: Perceptions of command area
farmers on the quality of civil works were elicited. The vast majority of farmers are happy with
the quality of works as only a small section of them – ranging from 5% to 15% across the civil
works – find the quality poor. Almost a tenth of the respondent farmers reported that the quality
of rehabilitation works was “very good?; around a quarter of them rated the quality as “good?;
and the quality of works was viewed “average? by around a half of the farmers.

         Participation of farmers in tank restoration activities was also high. Their participation
covered broad categories of: (1) Coordinated or supervised civil works (2) Worked as wage
laborer (3) Contributed free labor (shramdan) (4) Did not participate in any capacity.




                                                 88
        The findings with regard to the impacts of civil works demonstrate that command area
farmers vouch for the positive impacts resulting from the project interventions. They find visible
improvements in terms of reduced siltation and soil erosion, better inflows into the tank,
increased water level in nearby bore wells and open wells, increased availability of water in the
tank and tank water reaching a higher number of tail-end farmers. Application of silt had positive
impacts in terms of increased output and savings on input costs.

         Impacts on production, productivity and incomes: Comparisons between base year and
impact assessment year show that the project interventions have had a positive impact on the
cultivated area, production and productivity levels – translating into increased incomes to
farmers. The positive impacts were found in both kharif and rabi/summer seasons.

         Impact in kharif: Results for kharif show that across the sample tanks, the total cropped
area under the tank commands has increased from 6,064 acres to 7,326 acres from the base year
representing an increase of 20%. Results regarding crop-wise production levels show that output
levels of all crops have increased in all zones on account of improvements in cropped area as
well as in productivity levels. Production of paddy – most widespread crop in the sample tanks -
has shown an upward trend across the ACZs with the crop registering an overall increase of 44%
in output over the base year.

         In the project tanks the total crop output in kharif rose to 1,26,926 quintals in the impact
assessment year from 86,453 quintals in the base year representing an increase of 46%. In
terms of productivity, the overall productivity of crops has increased by 21% since the base year
across the zones. Compared with the base year incomes from cultivation, the current income
levels are much higher for all crops in all zones. Across the zones, income from paddy - most
widespread crop in the project tank commands - has doubled since the base year.

        Similarly overall (across the zones) net incomes from other crops have also risen since
the base year by following percentages: other cereals and millets (29%); pulses (158%);
commercial crops (262%); oil seeds (56%); and horticultural crops (20%). With regard to net
income from all crops put together, it has increased from Rs 42722314 in the base year to Rs
75000423 in the assessment year, which amounts to an increase of 75% over the base.

         Findings for Rabi and Summer: Findings in this respect reflect the project impact in rabi
and summer seasons with respect to the indicators of cultivated area, output and productivity
levels in project tanks and control tanks. Rabi season in project tanks witnessed improvements
along all three variables since the base year with cultivated acreage, output and productivity
rising by 5.41%, 12.77% and 6.98% respectively. Summer also saw comparable increases in the
project tanks with regard to the above stated indicators but the levels of improvements are lower
than those of control tanks. The levels of improvements accruing from the project with respect to
the area, production and productivity are 3.44%, 7.34% and 3.42% respectively.

         Comparison with control tanks: The total cropped area in the project tanks increased by
almost 21% while that of the control tanks rose 6% from the base year. This shows that the
increase in the area cultivated in the commands of project tanks was 14% higher. As for the total
output from the tank commands, it rose by 46% in the project tanks since the base whereas it rose
by 12% in the control tanks, thus the higher level of increase of 34% can be attributed to the
project interventions.

        With regard to productivity, in control tanks it has increased by 1.06 quintals whereas in
the project tanks it has risen by 3.07 quintals – representing percentage increases of 7.24% and


                                                  89
21.52% respectively. In terms of productivity growth, this represents a net project impact of 14%.
In the impact assessment year the total net income from cropping has increased by Rs 32278109
and Rs 1697479 in the project tanks and in the control tanks respectively. In terms of growth
rates the figures show increments of 75.55% and 42.34% respectively over the base. The net
project impact therefore is 33%.

         Net returns from cropping: per acre, per tank and per farmer: Per acre net incomes in
kharif have increased in all the zones since the base year. The overall increment of 45% across
the zones reflects the levels of increases among zones. Across the zones the per acre net income
in the project tanks has increased from Rs 7,046 in the base year to Rs 10,238 in the impact
assessment year – indicating an increase of Rs 3,192. The per acre incomes have also gone up
in the control tanks. But the level of increase in the control tanks is lower, as a result the
differential of 11.22% indicates project impact.

         Results for zone-wise per tank mean net incomes from cropping in kharif show that
across the zones it has risen from Rs 2,13,612 to Rs 3,75,002 from the base year in the project
tanks. By contrast the growth rate of average incomes in the control tanks is lower than that of the
project tanks. In terms of growth rates, per tank net income from cropping in kharif has grown at
75% in the project tanks while the growth rate in the control tanks was 42%. The differential is
attributable to the project interventions.

         This assessment also computed per command area farmer net income from cultivation. In
the project tanks the net income has doubled - from Rs 7,547 in the base year to Rs 15,573 in the
impact year. The farmer level net income has also increased in the control tanks; but at 53% the
level of improvement is much lower than that reported in the project tanks. The net percentage
increase of 53% can be attributed to the project impact.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

         The overall institutional design was aimed to empower the communities to own and
maintain the tanks under the overall facilitation of the Government. Tank User Groups, Tank
User Committees, Panchayaths, NGOs/CFTs, SPU and DPUs are the key actors in the
institutional
structure.

Legal and Institutional basis for Community-based Tank Management

        The following measures completed to create an enabling legal and institutional
environment: (a) Formulation policy of Tank Maintenance Policy, 2002; (b) Amendments to
Karnataka Irrigation Act, 1965 and Karnataka Irrigation (levy of betterment contribution & water
rates) Act 1957 (amended in 2002) for insertion of expression ‘Tank User Association’ in
addition to the already existing definition “Water User Association.?; (c) Issuance of several GOs
(GO NoMID/29/JSY/2002 to empower Tank Management Institutions for Operation and
Maintenance of Tank systems; GO to empower the TUGs to collect water tax; promulgation of
GOs to confer fishing rights on TUGs); (c) Creation of JSYS as Nodal Agency to provide
technical support to the PRIs and communities on Tank System Management.

       Legal Reform Measures at different Stages and awaiting Government Approval: (a)
Panchayath Raj (Tank Management) Rules for Tank User’s involvement in tanks managed by GP
Sub Committee (GPSC); (b) Amendment to Irrigation Act for empowerment of TUGs and GPSC
to manage tanks; (c) Cabinet approval on draft note to enable the


                                                90
TUGs collection of water charges from tank command area farmers; (d) promulgation of
umbrella Tank Management Act.

         Critical Observations and Areas for Improvement: Several of these initiatives though
have created overall positive atmosphere for legal and institutional promotion, the promulgation
of the proposed umbrella legislation- Tank Management Act - and other measures which have
been pending for quite some time would provide the necessary legal anchoring and would go a
long way in achieving the sustainability for the community based tank management.

Convergence between Tank and Watershed Development Projects

        Though JSYS proposed for institutionalizing convergence between watershed and tank
development projects, it has not been grounded. Suggestions elicited during the FGDs include:
(a) need for better convergence and for a common institutional structure for managing tanks and
watersheds including MNREGA (b) develop Sub-basin Master Plans and all related departments
such as MI, Watershed, Fishery, etc should develop their plans, programs and activities in
consistence with the Sub Basin Master Plans.

Multidisciplinary Expertise in Tank Management at State and District levels

         During Phase I, the DPUs have faced huge difficulties in the availability of adequate staff
those were experienced and qualified. Continuous turnover in the staff availability was another
problem. In Phase II, this problem was addressed to certain extent. The overall shortage in recent
past at SPU is 29% (Aug 2011) and 22% at DPUs (Aug 2011). Shortage in specialists availability
is 19% across all DPUs.

         Critical Observations and Areas to Improve: (a) Some DPCs felt that they found it
difficult to implement the programme with temporary inexperienced staff; (b) the contractual staff
often find it difficult to get the works done relating to other departments as they are temporary in
nature; (c) need for continuation of Social Specialists services for all the handed over tanks for
guidance and monitoring for at least two years after the tank handover; (c) periodic assessment of
human resources.

M&L System in Place and Functional

        JSYS created an M&L organization consisting: (a) the Research, Monitoring and
Evaluation cell at the SPU, (b) and similar Monitoring cells at each of the DPUs. In addition to
the project units, the JSYS appointed an M&L facilitation agency to assist the project in
discharging M&L objectives. M&L produced monthly, quarterly and annual reports besides
undertaking process documentation research, special studies, impact evaluation, exchange visits,
etc. The M&L system found to be vibrant and active all through the Project period.

        Critical observations and areas to improve: (a) M&L output however was constrained
because of staff issues. Most of the DPUs have only one person at the M&L Cell on an average to
cover 300-400 tanks. (b) Most of the TUGs and the CFTs lack capacities to collect, maintain and
furnish data. (c) Frequent changes in formats (d) Most of the M&L specialists at DPUs lack
relevant qualifications, expertise and experience.




                                                91
CFTs/NGOs Functioning

         In Phase I, the CFTs were entirely used to be staffed by NGOs and all most all the
activities and facilitation to TMIs were carried out by NGOs. It was largely opined there was
good success in community mobilization and participation in Phase I largely due to NGOs and on
flip side there were huge delays in completing civil works due to staff turnover and capacity
problems of NGOs.

        Because of these reasons, 15 NGOs were terminated out of 57 NGOs during Phase I. This
issue was addressed to certain extent in Phase II when the CFT model was changed from out and
out NGO model to mix of DPU and NGO staff. In the present model there is flexibility in the
following aspects while finalizing the CFT contract (a) CFT physical target; (b) CFT staff
deployment; (c) Scope for establishing sub offices.

         Critical Observations and Areas for Improvement: (a) In all the staff FGDs, all most all
opined the present model CFT is better than the Phase I model. There is substantial improvement
in work completion compared to Phase I largely due to change in CFT model; (b) local NGOs
should be given preference as they better aware of local issues, conditions; (c) low salaries and
irregular payments is the one of the main problem with present NGOs; (d) NGOs are bidding at
uncompetitive prices suggesting for lump-sum costing to avoid unhealthy competition.
Different models for community based tank management developed by TUGs and PRIs
Of the two options (TUG and GPSC), 95% opted for TUG model over GPSC model. The
dominant perception that the study recorded during all FGDs was, TUG is better option over
the model GPSC. The following are the reasons: (a) GPSC is generally beset with intensive
electoral politics; (f) general community ownership, accountability and openness levels are high
with TUGs due to less politics (b) audit of GP accounts is very irregular; (c) corruption issues are
relative higher in GPs. However, the TUGs are relatively very young institutions and needs to be
supported for some more time. They are not in position to work on their own without support
from JSYS due to resource and capacity shortages.

Capacity Building

         JSYS developed 14 modules on various themes to build capacities across various
stakeholders through SPU, DPU, CFT and Resource Groups and Agricultural Universities. The
capacity building on the whole has generated lots of awareness on the program and provided
knowledge. Average number of participants per module in surveyed TMIs is 7469 and per district
it is 5502. Female trained is little less than the men trained, it is 42%. Survey reveals that about
50% of the respondents have made use of the various training program conducted on
agriculture and irrigation. Adoption of alternate cropping system is 87%, short duration varieties
is 91%, where as adoption of SRI is little above 40%.

         Critical Observations and areas to improve: (a) Multiple activities and targets often
limited the staff to conduct program systematically according to the guidelines; (b) The
community also is not able to distinguish clearly the training modules conducted at different time
periods and places; (c) for overseeing this important component, the project should have had
Training Specialist.

Institutional Functioning: Perceptions




                                                 92
         Most TUG members expressed their satisfaction with the general performance of the
institution – to some extent (67%) and to a great extent (23%). An overwhelming 72% of them
reported financial constraints; 53% reported deficiencies in capacities and technical knowledge
constraints; and 42% reported lack of willingness of members to make financial contributions and
paying water charges.

Post-Handover Management and the Question of Sustainability

        Post handover institutional performance of the TUG indicates in general a downward
trend. The absence of common activities during the post-project period was pointed out by many
TUG members. The committees were not active since there were no activities under their
respective domains. None of the sample tanks has reconstituted its TUCs (Tank User Committee).
With respect to the conduct of the General Body meetings post-handover, only 5% reported for
holding such meetings.

         77% of the respondents stated that the current level of TUG income was insufficient to
manage the tank and related activities. There are no regular schedules for holding meetings and
they will be held only when some activity start taking up. 85% of respondents feel that the TUGs
would not be in a position to raise adequate resources on its own sufficient to the needs of the
works. Suggestions for promoting Sustainability: (a) TUGs just started gaining control and they
need technical and financial support for some more time to firm it up. All the efforts and
institutions would go waste if the current support, may be in different form, is not extended; (b)
TUG needs annual funding to carry out tank management and related activities; (c) collect fees
from borewell farmers for operation and maintenance funds; (d) If additional funds are provided,
the TUG can purchase farm machinery and hire them out to local farmers at reasonable rates to
achieve some degree of financial sustainability; (e) Best practices or success stories of federations
which are in the process of formation need to be studied in-depth to learn lessons and scale up the
interventions; (f) Awareness needs to be built or improved among TUGs regarding the functions
and powers that have been devolved to them, such as fishing rights and collection of water tax;
(g) convergence with watershed activities is urgently needed to minimize the adverse impacts on
tank improvements caused by cross purposes of two program; (h) regular monitoring of
handed-over tanks, at least on a sample basis.

V. INCOME GENERATION ACTIVITY (IGA)

         Income-generating activity (IGA) component is another complementary intervention to
benefit the poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups. Largest category of beneficiaries
belong to Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribes (47.38%), followed by Other Backward
Communities (31.5%). Little less than half, 45% are literates and cultivation (72%) is the most
important source of livelihood followed by labor (21%).

        Coverage under IGA component: 98% of the beneficiaries received only one round of
assistance as it was the practiced norm for the first phase beneficiaries. Majority (81%) received
assistance through SHGs. Most beneficiaries (90%) were not able to get a bank loan as a
matching assistance to the JSYS assistance.

         Selected Income Generation Activity: 90% have chosen ‘Livestock’ based IG activity,
only 10% opted ‘non livestock’ based IG activity. 77% of the beneficiaries have selected sheep
and goat rearing followed by dairying 22%. 91% said they have not insured the livestock largely
due to lack of information and awareness (89%).



                                                 93
        Disbursement process: One third of respondents interviewed reported constrains in
receiving the IGA assistance such as lack of information about IGA provisions; delays in the
disbursement of IGA assistance.

         Demand for produce and services and sustainability of the activity: Most of the
beneficiaries (94%) have been able to sell their product or service easily. The results with respect
the sustainability also indicate a similar trend with most of them reporting that their activity can
be sustained.

         Repayment pattern: About 51% of the beneficiaries have paid the financial assistance
either partially (11%) or fully (40%). One interesting finding for the reasons for nonpayment is
majority (63%) of non payers thought that the assistance is ‘free money’.

        Returns from IGA activities: Between base and impact years the increase in average
income among beneficiaries is 56% and the same in case of non beneficiaries is 41%. When
analyzed average annual income specific from IG activities, it was largely Rs 5000 for majority
of the beneficiaries.

        Changes in Quality of Life: There is an overall improvement in the quality of life
compared to the base year when analyzed for critical variables such as household incomes and
asset ownership. Though no improvement in permanent assets such as owning houses, etc, other
assets have shown an increase in quantity from base year: pucca/semi pucca house to 89% from
79%; electricity connections to 95% from 87%; cooking gas to 5% from 1%; TV sets to 53%
from 21%; mobile phones to 56% from 13%; motor cycle to 14% from 6%.

        Perceptions on the Overall Impact and Delivery of the IG Program and suggested
Changes: The overall perception of the project found to be positive and good. Interestingly,
majority of the beneficiaries stated that their overall economic and social status has improved.
About 74% reported economic improvements and 75% reported social improvements on account
of IG program. Similarly when asked on usefulness, 90.5% opined the project is useful; 75%
opined implementation is good; the services of CFTs are stated to be good by 93%. About 81%
suggested for increase in assistance amount.

         Critical Observations and Areas for Improvement: The IG program during phase I was
evolving and indeed underwent lot of changes during the study period. There were guidance
issues to TUGs until 2005 that this money to be recycled and therefore the money largely not
recovered and recycled. This also contributed for low recovery. Given the intensive local political
dynamics, the TUC members did not enforce strict recovery measures and mostly they were
indifferent. Majority conceiving the assistance as a grant has also affected the recovery. As
animal husbandry is the most preferred IGA, there is a need for motivating the beneficiaries for
livestock insurance. Involvement of SHGs may yield better results in this regard. There is also
need to diversify the IG activities based on the information and expertise available with local
banks, financial institutions and line departments such as rural development department.

VI. FISHERIES INTERVENTIONS

         Tank fishery development plays a strategic role in providing employment to the rural
folk, providing livelihoods or additional income. Fisheries intervention was introduced in only 36
tanks (18%) in the sample tanks in different years based on possible sustainability. Under the
project a five year fisheries development program was undertaken providing technical training in



                                                 94
fish breeding, harvesting and marketing, inputs supply for production like fingerlings, lease rents
and equipments.

         Critical legal reform relating to leasing rights was also undertaken to promote tank
fishing. In order to strengthen JSYS and to provide them assured income from fisheries activities,
an amendment was brought through a GO No. pasumve/167/MEE/2005 dated 28-01-2006 that
placed the JSYS TUC first in the order of priority when it comes to leasing out of tanks for
fisheries activities.

         Results of Fishery Intervention: Analysis of income from sample tanks with fishery
intervention brings out the following: (a) In about 64% of the tanks (out of 36) fishery activities
were carried out only for one year; (b) and in 14% of the tanks it was carried out for 4 years. (c)
In only one tank the activity was carried out continuously for six years. (d) Since the intervention
was introduced at different periods, the activities were started in different years. So, the number
of tanks receiving the income also varied according to the year of fishery intervention. The
average income for 36 tanks for the study period is Rs 34928. (e) When analyzed for
discontinuity, about 25% of total tanks have discontinued for last one year followed by 19% tanks
for four years, 17% tanks for five years and another 17% for two years.

         Critical Observations and Areas for Improvement: Although fisheries intervention was
done after in-depth study on the availability of water in the tank, due to various reasons, the
fishing component has given mixed results. It has to be noted that the most important factor
necessary for carrying out fishing activities is the availability of water in the tank, which in turn
depends on the rains in the region. Second important factor is the interest of the TUC in taking up
fishing activities. Thirdly it is the leadership of the TUC which can positively or negatively
impact fishing intervention. The study has come across cases where TUC sub let the lease rights
to the traders. Although such practices are not permitted as per JSYS guidelines, the TUCs
continue this practice for multiple reasons, ranging from lack of sources for investment to lack of
interest among the TUG members and factors of poaching.

VII. INCLUSIVENESS AND EMPOWERMENT

         JSYS has provided for bringing all the community members in the village, irrespective of
caste, religion and land ownership, into the tank management group. All are given equal
opportunities to become members and participate. Inclusiveness ensured through bye laws and
guidelines to the gender and social groups (SCs, STs, and women) by enrolling them as members
in TUG and other management committees and partners in tank management. SCs and STs
together constitute about 39% in Tank Groups and it is 34% in Tank Committees. On
empowerment, about 34% of TUC Presidents belong to SCs and STs followed by 40% of
Secretaries belonging to these Groups. The representation is much higher when verified for the
position of Treasurer, it is about 49%. The most significant learning is that the community in
general has accepted/recognized such vulnerable sections as stakeholders in the tank system.
Gender representation is also encouraging. Female members constitute little above 40% in
institutions TUGs and TUCs. There are some instances where the community has opted for all
women management committees.

VIII. SOCIAL SAFEGUARD PLANS TO ADDRESS ADVERSE PROJECT IMPACTS

        Typically, tank rehabilitation works does not entail acquisition of private land, except
reclaiming some parcels of land either in tank bed, in the process may impact some people



                                                 95
adversely by way of losing productive assets and livelihood. To mitigate such impacts, an R&R
policy was developed and appropriate Resettlement Action Plans were prepared as part of ITDPs.
Organization has specialists (Social Safeguard Specialist, Social Specialists) at all levels – SPU,
DPU, CFT - to oversee and implement the social safeguard policies and systems.

         Implementation of Resettlement Action Plans: Out of 200 sample tanks, the
encroachment problems have been reported only in 30 tanks (15% of sample tanks) located in 6
DPUs. A total of 135 families were affected and all were entitled for R&R assistance. All the
affected families were given Productive Asset Grant besides providing skill development training.
In all Rs 33,58,000 was disbursed averaging to Rs 25,022 for each affected family. Most of them
invested in income generating assets like milch animals, sheep rearing, agriculture land, business.
The RAPs were implemented in all the sample tank villages.

        Post Resettlement Status: During the pre project period, primary occupational source for
majority of the affected used to be agricultural labor. Majority moved from a labor vocation to
self employed vocation after RAP implementation. The average family income was doubled
during the post resettlement from about Rs 6855 to an amount of Rs 13670. This is obvious with
changes in occupational pursuits. Since considerable number of affected families has opted for
purchase of the cows, buffaloes, sheep, goats with the grant amount, the percentage owned these
assets has increased almost by 60% during post resettlement period.

KCBTMP – Project Completion Report, Prepared by JSYS, July 20, 2012

INTRODUCTION

         Karnataka is one of the South Indian States, covering an area of 191,769 sq km. The
irrigation tanks (earthen bounded reservoirs constructed across slopes by taking advantage of
local depressions and mounds) of South India are symbols of an ancient and rich tradition of
harnessing rainwater. These water bodies are life support system to the communities as they
provide water for agriculture, recharging ground water, which in turn sustain irrigation wells.

        Karnataka has around 36,000 irrigation tanks having command area of about 6,84,500
Ha. However, due siltation, poor maintenance, changes in land use and land cover in the
catchment, reduction in inflow of water, lack of participation by the community and gradual
erosion of traditional community institutions the tanks are degraded and the actual irrigated area
got reduced to about 2,40,000 Ha - less than 35% of designed command.

       As an evolving strategy of initiating a process of reforms in the tank management,
Government of Karnataka has taken a policy decision to transfer management of all tanks to
communities in a phased manner. To facilitate this process GoK created Jala Samvardhane
Yojana Sangha (JSYS) as an autonomous and independent society.

Project Rationale

      The State has the lowest proportion of irrigated agriculture area at 26% compared to the
national average of 39%. The efforts of the State to promote sustainable management of natural
resources, more importantly, the scarce water resources through participatory irrigation
management have led to the launch of KCBTMP, which envisaged gradual transfer of Operation
and Management of the tanks to the community for sustainable management of tanks.

Project Objective

        The objective of Karnataka Community Based Tank Management Project is to improve
the rural livelihoods and reduce poverty by developing and strengthening community based
approaches for managing selected tank systems.

Project Design

        The aim of the project was to demonstrate viability of community based tank
management approaches, first of its kind in the country. The project was designed to ensure
participation of all stakeholders of the tank system, from preparation of design, implementation,
and Operation & Maintenance (O&M) and to ensure sustainability of the tanks. The project
approach was not only to rejuvenate the tank structure but also to enhance agriculture
productivity, additional income generation, improved livestock, forestry, environment etc.




                                               98
Project Strategy

        The strategy adopted by the project to implement Community Based Tank Management
Project is to mobilize the community to formulate sustainable Tank Management Institutions
(TMI), train and empower the community to plan and implement tank development plans, build
capacity to maintain and operate the tank system.

Project Expectations

     Community based, self supporting and sustainable tank development institutions in place
      and functioning.
     Meaningful participation of traditionally marginalized tank users.
     Increase in agriculture production (productivity and area).
     Household income of direct stakeholders increased.
     Amount of fund generated and retained by user groups/ local governments for operations
      and maintenance.
     To ensure involvement of local governments (i.e. Panchayat Raj Institutions) in planning
      and coordinating technical support for improving tank systems.

Project Cycle

       The project cycle for each tank was 20 months during Phase I which was later enhanced
to 30 months based on the experience of Phase I.

Project Funding:

         The ongoing project’s final outlay was Rs.508.63 crores (104.33 m USD) - Rs.401.82
crores (IDA), Rs.86.47 crores (GoK), Rs.20.34 crores (Community). Additional financing Project
was approved by the World Bank based on the encouraging results / lessons learnt during Phase I.
The outlay for the project was Rs. 306.98 Crores (73.10 m USD) - Rs.138.14 Crores (IDA), Rs.
138.14 Crores (IBRD), Rs. 23.20 Crore (GoK), Rs.7.50 Crore (Community).

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION STRUCTURE & MECHANISM
Jala Samvardhane Yojana Sangha

        Jala Samvardhane Yojana Sangha (JSYS) was registered on 23.10.2000 under Karnataka
Societies Registration Act 1960 as an autonomous and independent society, a special purpose
vehicle with the mandate of conceptualising; preparing and implementing community based
participatory tank management projects for the efficient integrated management of tanks with
enhanced returns to all stake holders.

Tank Management Institutions (TMIs)

        Tank Users Groups are institutions at tank level. Two members from each household,
one male and one female would join as members in the TUG.       In the project 3126 TMIs were
constituted covering 3710 tanks in 18 districts comprising 3007 TUGs registered as societies and
119 as GPSCs.



                                              99
NGO Teams at Clusters level

         The entire project is implemented through the community; NGOs were engaged for the
entire project period to train, guide, and facilitate the community to establish a sustainable TMI
for implementation of the project. The project had established 57 CFTs for Phase-I and 84 CFTs
for Phase-II.

District Project Units (DPU)

        DPUs are established to oversee implementation of project in around 200-300 tanks and
were coordinating with other line departments so as to converge various schemes implemented by
different departments. The project had established 18 DPUs, 9 during Phase-I and 9 during Phase-
II.

Integrated Tank Development Plan (ITDP):

        ITDP were prepared by the community through a participatory process for all the tanks,
covering various aspects such as Tank system improvement and Management, Agriculture and
Tank based income generation, Environment Management, Resettlement Action plan, Tribal /
Vulnerable Groups Development plan, Gender Action plan, and TMI – Organization and
sustainability.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

        The funds required for the implementation was made available initially by the State
Government which was reimbursed by the World Bank. JSYS released funds to the TUGs in four
installments. 12% of the ITDP civil works cost is met by community, 6% in cash and 6% by way
of Shramdhan.

       The expenditures / accounts were audited at three stages viz JSYS Audit staff, Internal
Auditors and Statutory Auditors. About 90% of the funds spent for the project are reimbursed by
the World Bank. The total expenditure incurred was Rs.690crores (84.69%) as against a target of
Rs 815.61Crors.

Procurement

        Bulk of the procurement under the project was with respect to civil works, NGOs and
survey works. The civil works procurements were carried out at the community level. The
contracts were finalized and awarded following shopping and National Competitive Bidding
procedures.

PROJECT COMPONENTS AND PERFORMANCE

Component A: Establishing enabling environment:
Sub Component A1- Policy, Planning & Legal Environment

        The overall objective of the Component is to establish a conducive environment in which
the project objective can be fulfilled. The National Water Policy of 1987, Guidelines by Ministry
of Water Resources (GoI), Karnataka Vision Statement 2001, State Water Policy during 2002,




                                              100
Tank Maintenance Policy in 2001-02 have provided an environment for popularization of
Participatory Irrigation Management in the State and empower the Tank User Groups (TUGs)

         During the project period, GoK has effected improvements in the existing legal frame
work by brining necessary amendments to the Karnataka Irrigation Act and issuance of GO
giving first priority to TUGs for fishing rights. This has enabled adequate empowerment of TUGs
to collect water charges and exercise control on day to day operations and management.

Sub Component A2: Project Management

         Initially in the Phase I, the project was anchored by NGOs at CFT level for facilitating
community mobilization and implementation of civil works, whereas during Phase II the NGO
role was limited to community mobilization only. In view of this shift in policy more engineering
staff were inducted in to JSYS during the Phase II, through deputation from Government and
direct contracting.

Management Information System (MIS):
        The required MIS was developed in house and used for monitoring online procurement
and web based progress of civil works.

Geographical Information System (GIS):

         GIS was well developed and used by the project quite effectively. Hydrological studies,
rainfall data, land use details and Tank features were used by the DPUs for preparation of ITDPs.


Component B: Strengthening Community Development
Sub Component B1: Human & Institutional Resource Development:

        NGOs were entrusted with the responsibility of awareness creation, capacity building of
community and facilitating the TUGs in the implementation of the project and to sustain O&M
of tanks successfully.

       Under the project, 136 Cluster Facilitation Teams (CFTs) and 5 District Facilitation
Team (DFT- directly managed by JSYS) were engaged.

         Initially an anchor NGO concept was tried in the project with assignment of training the
project staff (DPU and NGOs) and Tank Users Groups. Based on this initial experience the task
was taken over by JSYS and the training activities were carried out with the help of cluster
NGOs.

Training Module:

     During Phase I, trainings were imparted to the community/TUGs as per the twenty training
modules prepared by JSYS. Subsequently these training modules were refined                and
restructured to 14 modules.

        In addition to the trainings based on 14 modules, various other trainings such as
Orientation workshop for Agriculture and Horticulture; GIS training; Entrepreneurship
development training for SHG members; staff trainings related to Accounts and Procurement;



                                              101
Regional workshop on social component and quality control; Vision building workshop to
facilitate formation of TUG federation etc.

Sub component B2: Gender action plans and Safeguard measures:

         The project has mainstreamed gender concern in all the activities and at all levels of
institutional structure to ensure equitable benefit sharing among women and men. Opportunities
were provided to women for enhancement of skills, knowledge and abilities. Women, SC/ST and
other vulnerable groups have large representation in TUGs. The participation of women in the
project is 48.68% (general body), and 40.74% (EC of TUGs), 12.86% (presidents), 21.9%
(secretaries) and 69.90% (treasurers). Representation of SC and ST communities in TUG
membership is 18.28% and 11.50% respectively.

Resettlement Action Plan:

      The project envisaged eviction of tank land encroachments and restoration to the
community by way of voluntary vacating of such occupied land by the encroachers through
persuasion and collective decision of the community. To mitigate adverse effects on the displaced
poorer sections, the project provided under Resettlement and Rehabilitation.

       Encroachments in 1324 tanks with an area of 2038 ha were cleared. This task was
accomplished through a consultative approach on a voluntary basis of the community. 495
eligible project affected families were provided relief amounting to rs.195.75 lakh under
rehabilitation and resettlement.

     Impact Study by CMSR (2008) on Rehabilitation and Resettlement has indicated that the
income levels of these families have increased in the post resettlement period from Rs.6855 to Rs.
13670, increased social status of the affected families and their asset ownership pattern has also
improved.

Income Generation Activities (IGA):

     To ensure social inclusiveness and equitable distribution to all vulnerable groups, Income
Generation Activities (IGA) was taken up under the project.

      Activities taken up are rearing of milch cattle, sheep, rabbit / poultry under GAP and
Basket weaving / sheep rearing / poultry / petty shop / brick making etc. at a cost of Rs.60.86
Crore with 33.26 Crore under the project the rest being funded through banks, SHGs and line
department linkages.

        In all 99,453 beneficiaries were benefited during the first rotation with an average income
of Rs.13,540 per beneficiary per annum across the activities implemented under IGA. Every year
the amount is rotated to similar number of beneficiaries.

Sub Component B3: Management Support to TUGs:

     TUGs (3126) were provided administrative support amounting to Rs.6.84 crore. Capacity
enhancement trainings and exposure trips were organised inside and outside Karnataka for TUG
members.
Sub-component B-4: Environment Management Plan (EMP)



                                               102
        The Tank system development involves a number of associated activities and program
aimed at improvement in the ecology and environment. The aspects addressed under this
component are Integrated Pest Management (IPM), Integrated Nutrient Management (INM), use
of bio-fertilizers/pesticides, tree planting, imparting training to staff and TUG farmers in EMP,
Neeraganti training, promotion of vermi-composting, use of plant based pesticides and
undertaking special studies on usage of tank silt in farming, etc. Environment Management
Committees were constituted and environmental management plans were prepared for all the
Tanks.

       Importance was also given to promote farming by using eco-friendly inputs like bio-
cultures (for manurial purposes), tank silt, vermi-compost, use of plant based pesticides, eco-
friendly IPM measures like barrier crops, trap crops, light traps and bio-cultures etc.

Plantation Development:

       In Phase-I, plantation development in tank foreshore was taken up in 2.5 to 5 hectares with
around 1000-2000 plants per tank based on the area available for planting. Plant seedlings like
Pongamia pinnata, Acacia auriculiformes, Eugenia jambolana, Terminalia arjuna, Acacia
nilotica, Silver Oak, Bamboo were planted.

      In Phase-II 15.77 lakhs seedlings were planted in the foreshore area of 1057 tanks and
26.36 lakhs seedlings were supplied to the farmers free of cost in 1789 tanks.

Sub Component B5: Communication:

         To bring in the required behavioural changes in the communities/the project staff and to
provide information on the project; communication and information dissemination materials were
developed, that included slides/power point presentations in Kannada & English on themes of the
Project; documentaries on themes of JSYS, audio songs on water and tanks; publications such as
news letter, books and booklets, pamphlets, broachers, news paper articles on success stories;
technical manuals, training manuals, information on line department programmes, etc. Slides,
Documentary films on DVDs, Audio cassettes were also brought out and issued to the TUGs.

Component C: Tank System Improvement
Sub Component C1: Tank Civil works Improvements:

         The scope of work for tank improvement and the supporting activities to improve
agricultural and other income generating activities associated with each tank was determined on
the basis of detailed Integrated Tank Development Plans (ITDP) prepared based on topographic
survey of tanks and through a participatory consultation process (PRA). The activities selected for
inclusion in an individual ITDP was chosen amongst from a menu of possible candidate physical
works and specific supporting activities for improving agricultural production and incomes from
various other income generating activities for each tank. As part of project implementation,
irrigation tanks were rejuvenated by the community, covering catchment, tank bed, tank bund,
irrigation channels, waste weir, sluice etc. Part of the silt was also removed and tank capacity
restored, to conserve more water and help increased agriculture production. Additional water also
helped in availability of water for extended period for cattle, fisheries and other domestic
purposes.




                                               103
        In addition to internal quality control through DPU and SPU engineers, independent third
party consultants were engaged which has ensured the quality of the civil works.

        3710 tanks, with 160425 Ha of command area were taken up under the project. Rs.360.96
Crores was spent on rehabilitation and rejuvenation of these tanks (Works were completed in
2800 tanks), of which 1640 tanks were handed over to the TUGs for Operation and Maintenance.

Sub Component C2: Agriculture and Horticulture Development:

        The project demonstrated the improved agricultural technologies, with special thrust on
higher water use efficiency, improved cropping pattern by way of increasing cropping intensity,
ultimately aiming at increasing the net income & empowerment of tank beneficiaries and
safeguarding natural resources. The services of Agriculture Universities in the State were
engaged for conducting On-Farm Water Management, Arable and Horticulture crop
demonstrations, Fodder development demonstrations.

        To enhance the capacities of the communities a variety of training program like Farmers
Field School, JSYS Staff technical training, trainers training, farmers & farm women training,
Cluster level workshops, cluster level inter-command inter active sessions, study tours, annual
workshops and joint workshops were organized. Integrated nutrient management and integrated
pest management, vermi composting techniques, use of plant based pesticides, and use of bio-
cultures were demonstrated. As result of Agriculture and Horticulture interventions, CMSR 2012
study covering the impact of Agriculture and Horticulture intervention of 200 sample tanks
indicated an increase of 20% cropped area and 21% agriculture productivity. Per capita income
has also gone up 33.21%. Net income per acre from agriculture has doubled.

        In agriculture, new crops of higher value required for agro-processing were explored.
Low pressure pipe irrigation systems including drip irrigation for paddy was introduced in
Pitchaguntlahalli in Kolar district.

Fisheries

    Fisheries developments were taken up to augment the resources of the vulnerable
communities and to provide stream of revenue to the TUGs for taking up O&M activities.

       The pisciculture is taken up in 1403 feasible tanks at a cost of 114 lakhs covering 7800
beneficiaries. Income per beneficiary from fisheries varied from Rs.3818 to 11000. Income per
TUG varied from Rs.14213 to 38032. Fish production increased three fold due to project
intervention over the pre-project situation.

PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT AGENCIES:

JSYS: Success achieved despite the challenges:

        Notwithstanding several challenges faced, JSYS could successfully complete
implementation in 1829 tanks at a lower cost than planned and handed over 1640 tanks to the
communities for further operation and maintenance. Further, in Phase II, given the short period of
less than 30 months for project implementation cycle, works were completed in all respects in
900 tanks out of 1881 target tanks, which is appreciable given the constraints.




                                              104
     The Department of Economic Affairs (GoI) and Comptroller of Aid Accounts and Audit
(CAAA) have extended full cooperation and timely clearances and approvals to the project.
    The GoK has extended utmost cooperation and guided the project throughout and has
committed to fund the unfinished works under the project. Mainstreaming the concept of
community based tank management in the State is under the consideration of GoK.
         The World Bank support to the project is encouraging. The Bank has regularly offered
critical suggestions for improving project implementation. Mission field visits and aide memoirs
greatly helped in guiding implementing agencies for realizing project outputs.
       The tank Communities, the Panchayath Raj Institutions (Gram Panchayath) and the line
departments are responsive to the project concept and its implementation.

LESSONS LEARNT

     Project demonstrated the viability of community based approaches to tank rehabilitation
      and management to a large extent.
     Most significant learning experience is that the community in general has accepted
      vulnerable sections of the society as stakeholders in the tank system.
     It is found that the integrated approach involving not only the tank rehabilitation but also
      the catchment and command area treatment gives better results.
     Integration of on-farm agricultural demonstrations with water management techniques
      has improved the economic returns to the community.
     Introducing income generation activities along with other interventions ensured
      participation of all stakeholders in the project.

SUSTAINABILITY

        The project objective of KCBTMP is “to demonstrate the viability of community based
approaches to tank management? and to reduce poverty by improving the tank system in an
integrated manner and thereby improve productivity in agriculture and other tank based activities.

         Tank Users Groups(TUGs) were established and trained adequately to manage the tanks
efficiently such as management of catchment area, control of encroachments, maintenance of tank
canal system, water management and O&M of the tank post project.

        The TUGs were also trained in activities related to resource mobilization and would
continue to explore other avenues to augment the existing revenue sources like water charges,
income from fisheries, sale of silt, income from IGA revolving fund etc.

         The Government has constituted a Taluk Level Committee comprising line department
officers as members and the Executive Officer of the Taluk Panchayath as Chairman to help the
TUGs to avail Government schemes and grants.

WAY FORWARD

        The World Bank funding to KCBTMP ended on 31st January 2012. The State
Government is fully committed to completion of project with current scope and implementation
arrangements beyond January 2012 and made necessary budgetary provision of Rs.120 crores for

         It is the policy at the National and State level that the management of water resources
shall be through adoption of participatory approaches by transferring operation, maintenance,
management and collection of water charges to user groups. JSYS was established during 2000 as
a special purpose vehicle to spearhead the implementation of community based tank management
in the State. This was taken up in project mode (Karnataka Community Based Tank Management
Project) with financial assistance from the World Bank. During the project period 2002-2012,
community based participatory management was taken up in 3710 tanks. In the process JSYS
gained considerable experience and expertise in mobilizing the communities towards
participatory management of tanks. The mainstreaming of community based tank management is
under the consideration of the GoK. In pursuance of this, during March, 2012, Rural
Development and Panchayath Raj Department (GoK) has accorded in principle concurrence to
JSYS for taking up of rehabilitation of about 3900 tanks under Zilla Panchayaths in the State
through community based participatory tank management.
