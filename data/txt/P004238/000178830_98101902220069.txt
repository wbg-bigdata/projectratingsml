REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR A
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$19.0 million to help finance a
Third Education Project.   The loan would have a term of 25 years, inclu-
ding 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/h percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         The latest economic report (No. 217-MA) was circulated to the
Executive Directors in August 1973.   An annual economic mission visited
Malaysia in January/February 197h, and its report will be circulated
in due course.   Country data for Malaysia are included as Annex I.
3.         With a per capita GNP of about US$400'(1971), Malaysia is one
of the most prosperous developing countries in Southeast Asia. The
economy has maintained fairly high rates of real growth, the GNTP growing
at an average of about 6 percent a year during the last decade, with an
increase to 6.5 percent forecast for the first half of the 1970's.
Exports, which account for over 4O percent of GNP, have been growing at
4 to 5 percent a year.   The country's balance of payments position is
sound.   There are few foreign exchange controls and external reserves
are equal to eight months' imports.
4.        Malaysia has significantly diversified its exports in the last
few years. Whereas in 1961 nearly 50 percent of merchandise export earnings
was derived from rubber, in the last few years only about one-third origina-
ted from this source.   Timber and palm oil exports have risen substantially,
in 1973 representing an estimated 14 percent of merchandise exports. This
trend is expected to continue.
5.         It is too early to forecast with any precision how the world-
wide energy problems will affect the Malaysian economy, but it is unlikely
that Malaysia will suffer a shortage.   In 1973 Malaysia's production of
crude petroleum was about 100,000 barrels per day, or 4.5 million long
tons during the year, and in about four years is expected to increase five-
fold.   In 1973 Malaysia was still a net importer of petroleum products,
at a net cost of about US$40 million; however, based on present production
and consumption trends, Malaysia is expected to become a net exporter of
petroleum by 1977.   Substantial reserves of natural gas have been found
which in the next few years will become an important foreign exchange earner.
Malaysia's hydroelectric potential is fairly large and detailed investi-
gations of known possible sites are being accelerated.



-  2-
6.         Agriculture has accounted for about 30 percent of the country's
GDP and about 50 percent of employment but the manufacturing sector is
making an increasingly important contribution.    During the Second Malaysia
Plan (SMP) period (1971-75), agricultural growth is expected to average
about 8.5 percent, while the projected growth rate for the manufacturing
sector is 14 percent.   The manufacturing sector now accounts for 15
percent of GDP, about 22 percent of merchandise exports, and employs
10 percent of the working population.
7.         Although Malaysia achieved satisfactory rates of growth of
production during the 1960's, a decline of 20 percent in the terms of
trade reduced real income growth from 6 to about L.5 percent per annum,
resulting in a less than 2 percent increase in per capita income. This
trend continued into the early years of the present decade. However,
during 1973 a boom in export prices improved the terms of trade, boosting
real GNP by about 10 percent, and leading to a real per capita income
growth of 7 and 8 percent.
8.         Population growth rates will remain high for some time, around
2.7 percent per annum, accompanied by a growth in the labor force of about
3.3 percent per annum, but Malaysia's physical resources and employment
potential are great.   The Second Malaysia Plan (SMP) projects an average
annual increase in employment of 3.4 percent accompanied by a reduction
in underemployment.   In the longer term, over the next two decades, Malaysia
expects to reduce the unemployment rate from 7.5 to 4 percent. During
this period, the agricultural share of the labor force in Peninsular
Malaysia is expected to drop 'Dy almost 20 percent to 33 percent, and the
employment share in manufacturing is expected to more than double, rising
to 24 percent.
9.         During the last several years the Government's long-term planning
has concentrated on the problems of reducing the economic disparity between
the Milays, who account for a little over half the population, and non-
Malays, who are predominantly Chines,.    Over the next 20 years the NZew
Economic Policy, as it is called, aims to eradicate poverty and to restru-
cture society so that the present identification of race with economic
activity will eventually be eliminated.   The basic outlines of the policy
are sound and allow for continued growfth for each of the principal ethnic
groups while at the same time enlarging economic opportunities for Malays.
The SMP seeks to support these two objectives by encouraging economic growth.
10.        The SMP also reflects the Government's choice of a more vigorous
role for the public sector in the country's development effort. The
revised plan proposes an allocatior. of US$4 billion for public devel-
opment expenditures,  twice the level   under the first plan.  The
public sector's planning and implementation capacity has been expanded,
although several planning and operating agencies still suffer from
substantial manpower shortages.   The improvement of the Government's
capacity to prepare and execute projects resulted in expen.'iture during
the first three years of the plan period that were already two-thirds
of the original plan allocation.   The revised plan levels anticipate a
further strernthening of project identification and implementation in the
public sector.   Most of the increased allocation is earmarked to support
the NTew Economic Policy, including among other items (i) the expansion



of land settlement programs to piovide employment opportunities, (ii)
increased support to the manufacturing sector to diversify the economy
and to provide increased employment in higher income jobs, and (iii) the
provision of training and education to upgrade the job opportunities of
the low-income groups.
11.        During the first three years of the Secona Malaysia Plan,
1971-73, total public sector development expenditures amounted to about
US$2.2 billion, of w,hich 50 percent was financed by net domestic borrow-
ing and 16 percent by net foreign borrowing.    The balance was financed
largely by current surpluses.   The Bank has provided slightly less than
40 percent of the foreign loan commitments; and bilateral aid, mainly
from the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth countries, Germany, Japan,
and loans from the Asian Development Bank, provided the rest. Domestic
financing resources for the remaining two years of the SMP is con-
sidered adequate.   Government revenues are satisfactory, accounting
in 1972 for 22 percent of GNP.   In addition, the Government can readily
borrow substantial amounts from domestic resources, notably from the
Government Employees' Provident Fund.    The estimated external net inflow
requirements of public medium- and long-term loans will amount to about
US$190 million.   New foreign loan commitments are expected to come from
the same sources with a significant increase in Japanese lending. New
commitments from the Bank are expected to remain at about 40 percent
of the total.   This level of foreign borrowing is well within Malaysia's
debt-servicing capacity.   Debt service obligations at present are about
3.5 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services and are estimated
not to exceed 8 nercent during the late 1970's. The current Bank share of
Malaysia's debt service payments is 22 percent and is expected to increase
to about 25 percent by the end of 1978.
PART II - BANTK GROUP OPERATIOFS ID MALAYSIA
12.        The Bank has made 24 loans to Malaysia for projects in edu-
cation, population, agriculture, foreotry, industrial finance, power,
water supply, telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and-urban trans-
port. Although in a few cases disbursements were slow, the execution of
these projects has generally been satisfactory.    As of January 31, 1974,
the loans to Malaysia held by the Bank amounted to US$350.9 million.
In addition, the Bank made a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board,
Singapore (Loan 405-MA), guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johore
River Water Project.   The amount held by the Bank under that loan is US$5.2
million. Seven loans have been fully disbursed. Annex IT contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and TFC investments as of January 31, 197h, and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.        Bank assistance to Malaysia is intended to sunoort the Govern-
ments efforts within the framework of the NTew Economic Policy to
redress imbalances in rural and urban incomes, to create employment for
the urban unemployed and to reduce rural underemployment.     Since
Malaysia's land development and rural development programs provide the
most effective Government instrument for tackling the issues of
unemployment and income imbalance, the Bank will continue to give
financial support to these programs.    So far, the Bank has made three



loans for lard settlement projects in the TJen-Ica Triant,gle area where
about 100,000 acres of' land are being developed and about 10,000 sniall-
holders are being settled, and one loan for land settlement in the State
of Johore where about 4,500 families wrill be settled.  Thle Bank will
continue to as-sist Malaysia in ecu.cation, par',;cularly to increas'!
educational opportunities i.n rurc.K areas as under the proposed loan. Also,
thne Bank will continue assistin- the cevelopment of inf-rastructuro
that will improve conditions in the urban areas and help support manu-
facturing.  The Bank hlas helped the Government to prepare projects
either in the course of its- lending operations 3r by actin{.: as Execut-
ing Agency for UNDP-financed studies.   The ,ank has also helped
strengthen puibic aeenciae pons      e fo: uarryi-i ouU iJy:n tant p,a,,_

will be reflected in the loans t3o be aresentud to the Bxesuti ,e
Directors in the ne:.t year or so, Thl-ese loani would be for projects
involvins, agricultural development, a,rici' ltuu-al credit, agricultural
research, public utilities, and. infrastructu.re development. In a,-ricul-
ture, where the forei,,.,n exchan-e content of projects is often small, the
Bank w,ill continue to cover a Dortion of local costs.
14.      IFC has been active in Ialaysia since 1 963 and has mace five
investments totalin?^, TJS$53.7 mi,illion (Annex. II)  The total coimmitmients
under those investments held b-r IFC as of Januay 31, 1 974, amiounted to
uS$hoè nillion.  The Corpor-ation has under preliminary consideration a
wood processing and a pulp and paper project.
PART III - EDUCATlION AND T?.A-ITT-r. IN IALA7-JL,
15.       Enrollment ratios in the Malaysia education- systemt are higa.
Assisted schools, i.e0 G-ov,ernment schools and Covernnent-aidcd schools,
enrolled in 1972 some 90 ,.ercent of the 6 to 11 years age -roup at the
prinary level (grades 1 to 6), about o0 percent of the 12 to 1. y,ears
a,r,e g,roup at the lower secondary level (grades 7 to 9), and 2? percent
of the 1, to 16 yea-s aLe .-,roup at the upper seconda-y level (,:,race3 10
to 1 1). Private primary school en:rollments are negli-ible; at the
secandary level, they amiount'U to about 9 percent of the numwber in
assiste.d sch_ols.
16.       At present, the dist-ibution of educational facilities still
favors the ur1ban areas whlich lara- ely. contain the non-Malav ,roups of the
population; also, school facilities are generally less ,ood an
the 'oirneo States of Sabah an`r sra-a-rakL than in Peninsular I'alaysia,
Emphasis on acaodemic courSes has lseen stron. and little use .as so far
been made of nodern teachain  methods.  hie quality of teacher trainin'7
at all levels, includinc, in- e- n ce training;, is improvin-,but an increase in
the output of teachers is required.
17.       Total expenditures for education and training, were estimated
at 6.8 percent of GNP in 1972, which is relatively hig-,h when compared



with other countries. Government capital expenditures on education and
training amounted to M$330 million or 8 percent of total public capzital
spending7 during the First Malaysia Plan (1966-1970).  The SMP provided
M$5L0 million for education, subsequently revised to M$735 million or
7.8 percent by the Mid-Term Review of the Plan.
18.       Primary, secondary, including vocational and technical educa-
tion, as wrell as teacher training, are primaarily the responsibility of
the IMinistry of Education. The Ministry of Agriculture is operating a
small number of vocational sclhools, mainly for the training of junior
agricultural assistants; the MIinistries of Labor and Health are also
involved in the training of techmicians, and so is EMEA, a Government
agency set up to promote economic and social development, particularly
in rural areas.
T9.4      The majo- objectives of IMalaysia's long-term educational
strate(lV, set forthl in the .econd 'Malaysia Plan (S1P) and confirmed in
the  id-TerLr Review of the plan, are to promiiote national unity, to meet
manpowel ncetds and to improve education quality, including emphasis
on science and technology. Consolidation of the education system,
at present divided by languages and race, is therefore being
stressed.  Bahasa liaLa-.rsia is being introduced gradually as the main
lan7ua:-e of instruction, wit!h En7lish reinaining as a second language to
be tau-'Lt ijn all secondary sclhools.  The universal lower secondary
education polilcy already applied in PeninsulaI Malaysia is being
e.xtended to Jabah and Sar-awak. Priority is being given to the estab-
lishment of schools in rural areas, Cu-rricula and teaching methods will
be modernized, particularly throuSh the use of educational radio and
television.
20.      At the primary level, enrollment growth is planned at about
2.L percent per year. At this rate, virtually all of the age group will
be enrolled by 196", provided family planning programs are able to
reduce population crowt` belo, 2 percent per year. At the lower second-
ary level, enrollment growth rates will be reduced in Peninsular
M.alaysia and Saba-i from the hignh growth of the recent past, so as to
achieve an enrollment ratio of about 75 percent by 198u); this rate will
continue to be hi;h in SarawaI, where lower secondary enrollments have
been limited in thle past. At the upper secondary level, it is planned
to reduce the  apid growth rate ,f the past, nearly 15 percent per year
from 196.. to 1972, to less than 7 percent per year. However, special
provision will be made for rural areas, and emphasis will be placed on
science and practical subjects so that graduates are better prepared for
labor market needs.  At the Form VI levelj (grades 12 and 13),to/Imeet manpower
needs and supply ;ualified entrants for the universities, an enrollment
increase of about 9 percent p.a. is planned for Peninsular Malaysia
and about 16 percent p.a. for Sabah and 10 percent p.a. for Sarawak.
21 XTechmical training at all levels is being expanded and
improved. Pre-vocational courses in general secondary schools as well as
training facilities for technicians and skilled workers are being
increased.  Enrollment in technical and vocational schools and in
technician training is expected to double during the Si4P period. Coopera-



tion by all agencies involved in teclLnical trainin2, including the
employers, will continue to be sought so as to iaaintain a practical
orientation of the courses.
2 2.      For the education and training of hicih-level rnaxmower, a
distribution of responsibilities among the univercities is being
rnade, with each of the fi-ve ewistin- universities concentrating on a
different field o- level.  University enrollment is e:;pected to increase
from 11,000 by 1972 to about 25,000 by 1980 and it is planned that 60
percent of the enrollment will be in scientific and techmological fields.
23.       A comparison of the required outputs of the educational system
to meet estimated manpower needs at various levels over the years 1975-85
with the projected outputs indicates that the supply of vocational school
leavers, technicians, and university trained personnel will still fall
short of requirements, while the supply of general secondary school
graduates will exceed estimated demand. Since many general secondary school
graduates will therefore have to enter employment requiring specialized,
particularly industrial skills, and on-the-job training, the emphasis to
be given to science and practical subjects in the curriculum is well
justified.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
History
2L4.       The project would continue the assistance given under two
previous Bank loans made in 1969 and 1972 for education in Malaysia.
The first project is assisting technical, vocational, and agricultural
education; the second project includes a curriculum development center,
educational television for Peninsular Malaysia, vocational schools and
the development of a sience university.     Implementation of the projects
has generally been satisfactory, after some initial delays, particularly
in the case of the first project, due to difficulties insight acquisition
and staff shortages in the Public Works Department which slowed down
school design.
2 _.       The Government was assisted in preparing the project by a
UNESCO mission in June 1973.    The project was appraised in August, 1973.
Loan negotiations were held in February 1974,with a delegation led by
Mr. Lim Cheng Tatt, Deputy Under-Secretary, the Treasury. A loan and
project summary is included as Annex III. The Appraisal Report No.306a-
MA, dated March 8, 197a, is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors.
Description
26.        The project would assist Malaysia in implementing its educational
strategy, in improving educational opportunities for the rural population,
and in reforming secondary education.   It would support the Government's
efforts to expand and improve secondary education in Sabah and Sarawak
and would include the introduction of educational television for primary
and secondary schools in these two States. The project would also assist
in meeting manpower requirements for teachers at the primary and lower
secondary levels and for polytechnic-trained technicians. It would
include technical assistance for staff development and comprise con-
struction, furniture, and equipment for:



- 7 -
(i) Seven secondary schools, Sabah;
(ii) A junior college, Sarawak;
(iii) Four teacher training colleges, Peninsular Malaysia;
(iv)  A polytechnic at Kuantan, Peninsular Malaysia;
(v) Educational radio and television, Sabah and Sarawak.
Approximately half of the expenditures to be made under the project would
be for Sabah and Sarawak.
27.        The seven secondary schools in Sabah form part of the Govern-
ment's program to extend the basic education course from six to nine
years by progressively allowing all primary school leavers to enter lower
secondary education, as is already the case in Peninsular Malaysia.   In
Sarawak, this expansion will be financed from Government funds, and in
Sabah in part from the proposed Bank loan.   All seven schools would be
in rural areas and would provide 4,400 student places, of which 560
at the upper secondary level.   Boarding places would be provided for
those students who live more than five miles from a school. Practical
courses would be part of the curriculum at the lower secondary level
and would later be offered at the upper level.
28.        The Junior college, Sarawak, would help to increase the number
of graduates at the Form VI level. The college would be built near
Kuching, the capital city, but would recruit its students from all parts
of Sarawak. Adequate boarding facilities would therefore be provided.
Over 60 percent of the students would follow science-based courses.
29.       The four teacher training colleges, Peninsular Malaysia, each
with an enrollment of 720 students and a total output of about 1.,400
per year, would help to fill the need for qualified primary and lower
secondary teachers, particularly in rural schools.   They would offer a
two-year course which would be practically oriented and would stress
community development work.   Two of the colleges would be at Kuantan
and Kuala Trengganu on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia and the
others would be near Penang and at Ipoh.   Full boarding facilities would
be provided at all four colleges.
30..       The polytechnic, Kuantan, would enroll over 1,100 students and
would be the second polytechnic in the country. There would be 900
boarding places, mainly to provide for the needs of students from rural
areas.   Technician  courses in  civil, mechanical, electrical and elec-
tronic engineering, food technology, commerce and accountancy would be
offered.   All courses would include a six-month period of supervised
practical training in industry or commerce.   About 90 teaching staff
would be required at full development.   Teacher recruitment and training
programs have already been initiated by the Ministry of Education and a
sufficient number of qualified staff is expected to be available. Since
they would initially lack experience, the financing of 33-1/2 man-years
of expert services to assist heads of departments during the early years
of operation and of 8-1/2 man-years of training for Malaysian staff abroad
is included under the Bank loan.
31.        The introduction of educational radio (ER) and television (ETV)
in Sabah and Sarawak would complete a program introduced for Peninsular
Malaysia under the 1972 Bank project.



32.        Radio has been used for teaching in Sarawak for about ten
years.   Sabah has not yet developed a school radio system, but it has
well-deTreloped facilities for radio transmission and is now introducing
lessons by radio.   The proposed project would support educational radio
in Sabah and Sarewak by financial assistance for the construction and
equipment of two radio broadcasting studios in Sabah, about 900 radio
receivers, as well as equipment for 13 Educational Media Service Centers
(EliSC) .
33.        Implementation of ETV in Pensinsular Malaysia is proceeding
well, with priority of installation being given to rural schools. The
extension of ETV services to Sabah and Sarawak deserves high priority.
The proposed project would include studio and FEMSC equipment, about
2,200 receivers and about 1,700 generators.   ETV programs would be
produced in Peninsular Malaysia, videotaped, and flown to Kota Kinabalu,
Sabah, for broadcasting and for relay by microwave to Sarawak. Adequate
transmission time has been assured by Radio Television Malaysia and the
Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Works, Posts and Tele-
graphs.   All primary and secondary schools with a total   enrollment of
about 500,000 would be substantially covered by 1979 when the system
is fully developed.
Cost and Financing
34.        The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at about
US$i1.4 million, and the foreign exchange component at US$19.5 million.
A breakdown of costs is given in the loan and project summary at Annex
III.   Construction cost estimates are based   on costs for similar
institutions in Malaysia which were built recently.    Contingencies are
estimated at 31.8 percent of basic project cost for the six-year project
implementation period to cover unforeseen physical factors as well as
anticipated annual increasesin costs estimated at an average of 7 percent
for equipment and furniture and 10 percent for civil works. The proposed
Bank loan of US$19 million woi'ld cover about 46 percent of the total
project cost, the remainder being financed from Gove-rnment resources.
Procurement and Disbursement
35.        Contracts for civil works and instructinnal equipment would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement.    Local contractors are expec-
ted to win most of the civil works contracts.    The bulk of the instru-
ctional equipment is expected to be Procured abroad.    Local manufactur-
ers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent over the c.i.f.
price of competing imports or the existing rates of import duties, which-
ever is the lower.   The Government has decided to finance furniture
from its own resources, since most furniture items will in the future be
procured in bulk contracts to cover the requirements of all Government
departments.
36.        The loan would be disbursed against the estimated foreign
exchange component of technical assistance, civil works, and equip-
ment, as well as the ex-factory cost of equipment expected to be



procured locally,as follows: (i) 100 percent of the c.i.f. prices of
directly imported equipment and of the ex-factorv price of locally
manufactured equipment; (ii) 70 percent of total expenditure on imported
but locally procured equipment; (iii) 32 percent of total costs of civil
works: (iv) 80 percent of technical assistance costs.  Technical assist-
ance will end in 1980 and disbursements are therefore expected to be
completed only by June 30, 1980.
Implementation
37.       The existing project unit, established in the Ministry of
Education for the implementation of the first and second Bank projects,
would be strengthened and would be responsible for overall supervision
of the project. In preparing and issuing tenders, evaluating bids, and
awarding contracts for civil works, the project unit would cooperate
withi the Public Works Department which would be responsible for the
design and supervision of civil works.  Design would generally follow
the standards established for similar institutions included in tne
first and seconc Bank Projects. Simila.-ly, equipment liats would be
patterned on the master lists established fLor similar institutions-
in these projects.
Benefits and Justification
38.        The proposed p-roject is concerned with differeat aspects of
Malaysian educational needs.  The junior college in Sarawak, the four
teacher training colleges in Peninsular Malaysia, and the Kuantan poly-
technic would help to meet essential needs for trained manpower. Thiey
would provide respectively by the early 1960s about:
(i)  20 percent of the need for high-1evel mranpower (includ-
ing university entrants) in Sarawak;
(ii)  one-thirl of th-;e needs for primary and lower secondary
teachers, i.eO.teachers at the basic levels, in Peninsu-
lar Malaysia;
(iii)  one-third of the annual need for polygtechnic-trained
technicianrs for tho whole of Malaysia.
39.       Secondly, the proJect would help redress regional imbalances.
Nearly half the project expenc3i.tures, includin- all tho6e on mass media,
vouli affect thie less-developed States of' 'Sabah and Sarawak wfith thei-
p-redominantly rwual population.  Similarly, withiin Peninsular Malaysia
itself, 7)i percent of project e -penditurec w.ould benefit the relatively
less '-iell-de;veloped east coast remions. T1he boardiun facilities

PART V - LEGAL INSrrRUME,TS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the
report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section L(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and. thae text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.  The draft Loan Agreement confoinas to the normal pattern for
loans for education projects.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of AP"-reement of t-he 3ank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.      In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take
full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices.
However, available information indicates that the proposed loan remains
fully justified.
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
Loan No. 533   Jengka Triangle Project; US$14.0 Million Loan of
April 17, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Loan No. 672   Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$13.0
Million Loan of May 20, 1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$25.0
Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The projecta consist of the clearing of forest, the planting of 62,000
acres of oil palms and 35,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of 10,000
families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). The Federal Land Develop-
ment Authority (FELDA), responsible for the execution of the project, operates
efficiently and its standard of planting and maintenance is high. The first
project (533-MA) has been completed. Cost overruns are estimated to have
been about US$5 million or 20 percent of appraisal cost estimates, of which
about US$3 million is due to the US$ devaluation. The Second Jengka Project
(672-MA) is also mostly completed. But, due to timber shortages, the
housing program is somewhat behind schedule. Cost overruns are estimated
at about US$3.5 million or 10 percent of appraisal cost estimates. of which
about US$3 million is due to the US dollar devaluation. In terms of
economic viability, improved prospects for palm oil and rubber prices
have fully compensated for cost overruns on both projects. The Third
Jengka project is proceeding satisfactorily and is somewhat ahead of schedule.
Loan No. 673   Jengka Forestry Project; US$8.5 Million Loan of May 20,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
Implementation of the project, consisting of a highly complex
integrated forestry products industry established in the Jengka Triangle,
suffered because of management and technical problems, which were both
traced to the lack of previous experience of this kind in Malaysia. How-
ever, corrective steps were taken and performance, both managerial and
financial, has since been satisfactory.
I/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 579   Fourth Power Project; US$8.5 Million Loan of
January 9, 1969, Closing Date: March 31, 1974
Loan No. 700   Fifth Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
July 16, 1970; Closing Date: January 31, 1975
Implementation of the projects consisting of extensions to
existing thermal plants of the National Electricity Board system were
delayed because of manufacturers' delays, particularly in supplying
structural steels and turbo-alternators. Loan No. 579 will be disbursed
by the present Closing Date which was extended from March 31, 1973. The
Closing Date for Loan No. 700 will have to be extended.
Loan No. 753   Second Telecommunications Project; US$18.7 Million Loan
of June 21, 1971; Closing Date:   June 30, 1976
The project includes facilities and equipment to improve the
domestic and international telecommunications systems. Implementation has
been delayed but better progress is now being made and there are reasonable
prospects that the project will be completed on schedule. Orders placed
exceed. US$10 million and application for reimnbursement amounting to about
US$I million are expected to be received shortly.
Loar No. 561   Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$3.6 Million Loan
of September 27, 1968; Closing Date: September 1, 1974
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The projects consist of the improvement and expansion of water
supply facilities in the Kuala Lumpur area. Implementation of the first
project had been delayed because the main civil works contract had to
be retendered following the death of the main contractor and the liquidation
of his firm. Costs were within the original estimates and work has been
completed. However, the Closing Date had to be postponed for a second time
to September 1, 1974 to allow for the payment of retention monies. The
original Closing Date was September 1, 1972. Tenders for certain parts
of the second project have been awarded and site investigations for the
proposed dam are in progress.
Loan No. 599   Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of
May 23 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project will provide in 21 new schools about 11,000 student
places, of which about 2,500 will be in Sabah and Sarawak for secondary
education and teachers training and about 8,500, mainly in Peninsular
Malaysia, for vocational, technical and agricultural education. Project
implementation generally is about six months behind schedule, due to some
siting problems and to staff shortages in the Public Works Department which
delayed preparatory design processes, but is now progressing well. All
but one of the 21 project institutions should be completed by end 1974.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 6 pages
A start on the construction of the remaining project item, one of the
three agricultural schools in Peninsular Malaysia, was considerably delayed
by difficulties in obtaining a suitable site. Although the site is
now acquired and construction has already begun, the Closing Date will
require postponement.
Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of
April 5, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Under this project the expansion of technical and vocational
education in Malaysia, started under the first project, will be continued
by the construction of 8 schools, providing 4,700 student places, and by
the establishment at the University of Penang of science schools providing
about 2,600 student places. The project includes also the establishment
of an educational center which will provide a curricula improvement course
for teachers and the provision of educational television which is expected
to serve some 500,000 primary and secondary students. Progress is
generally satisfactory.
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project consists of the construction of new ports at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan in the State of Sabah. All civil works contracts
have been awarded but construction is behind schedule, initially due to
mobilization delays caused by the seamen's strike in Japan and the staffing
difficulties arising as a result of the project manager's death and more
recently due to difficulties in the supply of raw materials.
Loan No. 799   Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of
February 11, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project includes mainly equipment and works for a dieselization
program of the Malayan Railways (MR). Implementation is behind schedule
by about one year because of the Railways' management problems and its
initial unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement procedures. The Bank
has proposed that MR hire consultants to help MR in improving its manage-
ment.
Loan No. 851   Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$16.0 Million
Loan of July 20, 1972; Closing Date: April 30, 1977
The project is designed to improve access to Kuala Lumpur
from the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. Project implementation is
satisfactory.



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 6 pages
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The project is designed to assist Malaysia in achieving low
birth and population growth rates and thus to contribute to an increase
in per capita income growth and in the long run to ease the unemployment
problem. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) is
providing US$4.3 million in the form of a grant to finance certain components
of the project. Progress is satisfactory after initial difficulties in
coordinating activities of the Government agencies involved, which has delayed
loan disbursement.
Loan No. 931   Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million
Loan of August 22, 1973; Closing Date:   March 31, 1977
The project consists of construction and improvement of Peninsular
Malaysia's main north-south highway and also includes various studies.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 967   Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million
Loan of February 27, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
