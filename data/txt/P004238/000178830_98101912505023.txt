APPRAISAL OF A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a third education project in Malaysia for
which a loan of US$19 million is proposed.
ii.       Malaysia is a multiracial country of 11 million people, consisting
of Peninsular Malaysia and the more rural Borneo States of Sabah and Sarawak.
The Government's major policy objectives, as expressed in the Second Malaysia
Plan (1971-75), are to strengthen national unity, to eradicate poverty and
to restructure society so that the present identification of race with
particular forms of economic activity will eventually be eliminated. The
major elements to achieve these objectives are growth of output and
employment in smallholder agriculture, a continued rapid expansion of
manufacturing, and an upgrading of skills, particularly those of Malays
and other indigenous groups, through appropriate education and training
programs.
iii.      Although enrollment ratios are high, the education system has
only recently begun to reflect the country's social and economic needs.
With the launching of the Second Malaysia Plan, the Government is concentra-
ting its efforts in education on expanding the use of Bahasa Malaysia, in-
creasing the facilities for skilled worker training, setting up secondary
schools for rural areas and emphasizing science and technology. But problems
remain. As in many countries, the distribution of education facilities
favors the urban areas which, in the case of Malaysia, largely contain the
non-Malay groups of the population. There is still an excessive emphasis
on academic courses and little use has so far been made of modern teaching
methods. The quality of teacher training at all levels, including in-service
training, is improving but increased outputs are required.
iv.       The first education project, aided by a Bank loan of US$8.8
million made in 1969, is assisting technical, vocational, and agricultural
education. The second project, financed in part by a Bank loan of US$15.5 mil-
lion made in 1972, includes a curriculum development center, educational
television for Peninsular Malaysia, vocational schools, and the development
of a science university. Implementation of both projects is progressing
satisfactorily.
v.        The proposed third education project would continue these efforts
aimed at strengthening the education system by increasing educational oppor-
tunities for the rural population and improving secondary education. It
would support Government efforts to expand and improve secondary education
in Sabah and Sarawak and would include the introduction of educational
television for primary and secondary schools in these two states. The
proposed project would also assist in meeting manpower requirements for
teachers at the primary and lower-secondary level and polytechnic-trained
techniciaus. It would provide buildings, furniture, and equipment for:



- ii -
(a) seven secondary schools, Sabah;
(b) a junior college, Sarawak;
(c) four teacher training colleges, Peninsular Malaysia;
(d) a polytechnic at Kuantan, Peninsular Malaysia; and
(e) educational radio and television, Sabah and Sarawak.
Approximately half of the expenditures to be made under the project would
be for Sabah and Sarawak.
vi.       The project implementation unit already established in the
Ministry of Education for the first and second Bank education projects
would be suitably strengthened and responsible for supervising the implementa-
tion of this third project. Contracts for civil works and equipment would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding; furniture would be
procured in bulk following normal government procedures. Local manufacturers
of equipment would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% over the CIF price
of competing imports or the existing rates of import duties, whichever is the
lower. The total project cost is estimated at US$41.4 million and the
foreign exchange component at US$19.5 million equivalent. The proposed Bank
loan would meet all of the foreign exchange costs of civil works, equipment
and technical assistance.
vii.      The project is suitable for a loan of US$19 million to Malaysia
for a term of 25 years including a 5-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A first Bank loan for education, amounting to US$8.8 million,
was made in 1969 to assist technical, vocational and agricultural education.
Project implementation is now progressing well after initial delays due to
staff shortages in the Public Works Department and difficulties in site
acquisition. A second loan of US$15.5 million, signed in 1972, is financing
a curriculum development center, educational television for Peninsular
Malaysia, vocational schools and the development of a science university.
Project implementation is satisfactory.
1.02      The proposed third project would further assist implementation
of the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75) and continue support of the Bank's
educational lending strategy in Malaysia which is to assist the Government's
plans to improve educational opportunities in the rural areas and to help
reform and rationalize the secondary and post-secondary levels of education.
It would complement government efforts in the development of secondary
education in Sabah and Sarawak, including the provision of educational
television for both primary and secondary schools.  It would also help to
meet the requirements for primary/lower secondary teachers and technicians.
1.03      The government was assisted in preparing the project request by
a UNESCO mission in June, 1973, and the project was appraised in August,
1973, by a mission comprising F. Gamble (general educator), R. Johanson
(economist), S. Naimie (architect) and S. Futagami (mass media specialist)
of the Bank, and G. Watts (technical educator, consultant).
II. THE SETTING
Socio-Economic Background
2.01      Malaysia, a multi-racial country of about 11 million people, is
separated into Peninsular Malaysia and the Borneo States of Sabah and
Sarawak by the South China Sea. Each area is characterized by cultural,
linguistic and religious diversity. Peninsular Malaysia, comprising eleven
states, has 85% of the country's total population but only 40% of the total
land area (190 persons per sq. mi.). Malays form the predominant ethnic
group with 53% of the population, followed by 35% Chinese and 11% Indian.
Sabah and Sarawak have about 1.7 million people with a population density
of only 22 per sq. mile. Although non-Malay indigenous groups ll make up
1/   Dyaks, Melanau, Kadazan, Murut, Bajau, and others.



-2-
only a small part of Malaysia's total population, they account for two-thirds
of the population of Sabah and half that of Sarawak. Chinese total 26Z of
the population of Sabah and Sarawak and Malays only 12%. 60% of the popu-
lation in Peninsular Malaysia and 80% of that in Sabah and Sarawak live in
rural areas.
2.02      Income, adjusted for changes in terms of trade and for population
growth at 3% p.a., grew annually by 1.5% - 2% per capita during the last
decade to reach about US$400 in 1971 (Annex 1). However, Malaysia's diverse
racial groups have not shared equally in the benefits of this growth.
Employment largely follows racial lines. Malays and other indigenous
groups 1/ predominate in small agricultural and subsistence holdings and,
together with Indians, work on the plantations. The Chinese dominate the
manufacturing, mining, construction and commercial sectors and own a much
larger share of the corporate sector than the Malays. In 1970 the mean
monthly income of Malay households in Peninsular Malaysia was US$77, while
those of Chinese and Indian households were US$166 and US$133 respectively.
Although data are lacking, a similar if not greater disparity probably exists
in Sabah and Sarawak between the Chinese and the bumiputras.
2.03      Discrepancies in educational opportunity have accentuated income
inequalities between the rural and urban sectors, the distribution of educa-
tional facilities heavily favoring the latter. This quantitative gap is
further exacerbated by a qualitative one in that most urban schools have
better physical and human resources. Although the overall literacy rate
is 58%, it ranges from 33% in the rural areas of Sabah and Sarawak (17% among
indigenous groups) to 70% for urban areas in Peninsular Malaysia. Overall,
about 44% of the Malay population and 70% of the indigenous peoples of Sabah
and Sarawak have not received any formal education, compared with 36% of
the Chinese. Only 6% of the Malay and less than 3% of the indigenous
population have received any lower secondary education compared with 10%
for Chinese and 9% for Indians (Annex 2). These data indicate the limited
educational opportunity for bumiputras and their difficulties in seeking
employment in the modern sector.
Economic Development
2.04      Past economic performance has been encouraging despite sharp
fluctuations in the commodity prices on which Malaysia's export-oriented
economy depends. Since 1960 overall real growth in GDP has averaged about
6% annually. Agricultural products, principally rubber, timber, palm oil
and padi, account for about 30% of GDP, employ about 50% of the labor force
(64% in Sabah and Sarawak) and contribute about 60% to Malaysia's export
earnings. Although the relative importance of agriculture has been declining,
it will remain the predominant sector for the foreseeable future. Manufac-
turing, still in the early stages of development, has been growing at about
1/   Known collectively as "bumiputras," a term meaning "sons of the soil."



-3-
16% p.a. and accounts for about 15% of GDP and 10% of employment, mostly
concentrated in Peninsular Malaysia. The service sectors represent
about 35% of GDP and about 30% of employment.
2.05      Despite consistently strong growth rates in Peninsular Malaysia
during the 1960's, growth of the labor force at 2.8% p.a. has outpaced
employment creation at 2.6% p.a. As a result, unemployment, which was about
6% of the labor force in 1962 and 7% in 1968, rose to almost 8% in 1970.
Unemployment is particularly high among new entrants to the labor force and
in urban areas. In the cities the rate was 19% in 1970 among the 15-24 age
group.  Unemployment tends also to be largest in the group with the least
education although a growing number of the unemployed have completed general
secondary education. In Sabah and Sarawak labor shortages have prevailed
over the past five years but there are indications that secondary school
graduates are now taking longer to find employment.
2.06      Despite these overall labor surpluses, Malaysia has had per-
sistent shortages of technically skilled persons. In 1972 the government
service had unfilled vacancies for 250 engineers and 1,300 engineering
technicians or about one-third of the established number of positions.
Private employers also find it difficult to recruit professionals, tech-
nicians and skilled workers. They pay high salaries to attract qualified
manpower and arrange special training programs to supplement the inadequate
supply of skilled workers.
2.07      The real urgency for growth arises from the economic and social
disparities between bumiputras and non-bumiputras. The growing concern
with income inequality between (as well as among) races provided the basis
for the government's New Economic Policy. The basic aims of this policy,
as expressed in the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP), 1971-75, are:
(a) to eradicate poverty through raising income levels and
increasing employment opportunities; and
(b) to restructure Malaysian society and correct the
economic imbalance among the various races and eventually
to eliminate the identification of race with economic
function.
The upgrading of the skills of bumiputras through appropriate education
and training programs is an important element in the strategy to achieve
these objectives.
Manpower Requirements
2.08      Based on projections prepared by the Government Economic Planning
Unit, during the period 1975-85 total employment is expected to increase
at 3.2% p.a. or from about 4 million to 5.5 million and labor productivity
by about 4% p.a. Employment in the rural sector is expected to increase
by about 1.5% p.a. but in industry and services it is estimated to grow



-4-
at about 5% p.a. By 1985, it is expected that about 65% of total employ-
ment in Peninsular Malaysia and 50% in Sabah and Sarawak (compared with
50% and 37% respectively in 1970) will be in urban-related occupations.
In order to achieve this growth and transformation of Malaysia's economy,
it is necessary to improve the occupational distribution and the educational
background of the labor force. In 1970 only 0.6% of total employment was
at the professional level, compared with about 1.4% in Japan and the Philip-
pines and over 2%  in Siagapore. Most technicians and skilled workers had
received only on-the-job training. In Malaysia it is estimated that the
employment of high level manpower should grow at about 8% p.a., reaching
1.1% of total employment by 1985, that sub-professional manpower should
grow at about 7% p.a., reaching 4.2% of total employment (3.5% in 1970),
and that about 80% of the technicians and one-third of the skilled workers
entering the labor force should receive pre-service or apprenticeship
training. On this basis, manpower requirements over the period 1975-85 for
the major occupational categories are estimated as follows:
Estimated Additional Manpower Requirements (1975-85)
Occupational                   Peninsular      Sabah and
Category                       Malaysia        Sarawak        Total
Professionals                           38,000         3,000         41,000
Sub-Professionals                      110,000        16,000        126,000
Of which:
Engineering Technicians            (15,000)       (2,000)      (17,000)
"White Collar" Workers                 270,000       40,000        310,000
Skilled Workers                        290,000        35,000       325,000
2.09      A comparison between the required output of the educational system
to meet the estimated manpower needs between 1975 and 1985 and the projected
outputs, adjusted for likely labor market participation rates, shows that
demand will exceed present projected supply by about 7,000 at university
level (including about 1,000 in Sabah and Sarawak), about 12,000 from sixth
forms and technical colleges, (3,000 in Sabah and Sarawak), including 1,000
at the polytechnic level, and 75,000 from vocational training institutions
(11,000 in Sabah and Sarawak). 1/ On the other hand, the out-turn from
general upper secondary schools may exceed demand by about 160,000.
2.10      These figures indicate that the projected supply of general second-
ary school graduates is beyond the absorptive capacity of the labor market
for this group as it now appears. Many general secondary school graduates
1/   These shortfalls will be met in part by some of the 26,000 Malaysians
now studying abroad.



will therefore enter employment requiring industrial skills and need "on-
the-Job" training. Consequently, the general secondary school curriculum
should be broadened to include practical subjects as preparation for this
industrial training.
III. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
Description and Evaluation
3.01      The system (Charts 1-4 and Appendix 1) is well developed in many
respects. Assisted schools, i.e., government schools and government-aided
schools, enrolled in 1972 some 90% of the 6-11 years age group at the
primary level (grades 1-6), about 50% of the 12-14 years age group at the
lower secondary level (grades 7-9), and 23% of the 15-16 years age group
at the upper secondary level (grades 10-11). Private primary school
enrollments are negligible; at the secondary level they amount to about
9% of the number in assisted schools. Only in Sarawak are private
secondary enrollments relatively substantial, amounting to 13,000 compared
with 23,000 in assisted secondary schools. University education, provided
only in Peninsular Malaysia, enrolls about 11,000 students or 2% of the age
group. An estimated 10,000 are receiving higher education abroad.
3.02      Primary education is given in Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese, English,
and Tamil. The use of English as a medium of instruction is being replaced
by Bahasa Malaysia except in Sarawak where a final decision has not yet been
takcen. Secondary education is given in English, Bahasa Malaysia or Chinese.
Facilities and teachers' qualifications are generally good in urban areas
but rural schools usually have a higher proportion of less experienced
teachers and are for the most part less well equipped. In Sabah and Sarawak
secondary school facilities are generally inferior to those in Peninsular
Malaysia. In Sabah in particular a rapid increase in lower secondary
enrollments has been made possible only by the use of temporary premises
unsuited to secondary school work. At the beginning of 1973 only 12 of 37
government secondary schools were properly housed and some of these were
overcrowded.
3.03      The lower secondary school curriculum in schools in Peninsular
Malaysia has been broadened to include practical subjects and courses in
other subjects are being revised and modernized. It has been decided to
adopt these improved courses in Sabah and Sarawak. At the upper secondary
level (grades 10-11), about 8% of the enrollment is in technical and
vocational schools which is still a low proportion but is a considerable
increase compared with the figure of 5% in 1971: liaison with industry is
good.
3.04      Teacher training is of good quality, particularly since the
recent introduction of improved courses with increased emphasis on practical
teaching. However, the output of teachers is insufficient to meet projected
needs, partly due to the use of pre-service teacher training facilities for
in-service training of teachers of Bahasa Malaysia.



- 6 -
3.05      Throughout the education system, and especially in Sabah and
Sarawak, little use is made of modern technology but a good beginning has
been made with educational radio and television (ERTV) in Peninsular
Malaysia, now being assisted by the Bank second education project (Loan
No. 810-MA). School radio lessons are broadcast in Sarawak. In 1968
mathematics and science courses and teaching techniques were modernized
and it is expected that when the Curriculum Development Center, also being
assisted under the Bank second education project, is completed, this work,
and the associated in-service teacher training will be improved and extended.
Sabah and Sarawak have already decided to adopt the new science courses which
stress experimental work at both lower and upper secondary levels as better
facilities and teachers become available.
3.06      Educational planning on a national scale is made difficult by the
fact that, although education is a Federal responsibility, Sabah and Sarawak
control their own educational systems. The present arrangements are to be
reviewed in 1973/74. Cooperation among the different agencies involved
in education and training is not sufficiently effective. Some improvement
should result when present plans materialize to bring together the dispersed
divisions of the Ministry.
Education Development
3.07      Malaysia's current education development strategy is developed
in the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP) 1971-1975. A mid-term review of this
Plan has recently been made (1973) but the fundamental objectives have
not been changed. The objectives of the strategy are:
(a) To promote national integration and unity. The government
intends to consolidate the education system, at present
divided by languages and races, and to equalize educational
opportunity between urban and rural areas. To achieve this,
Bahasa Malaysia is to become the main language of instruction;
the universal lower secondary education policy in Peninsular
Malaysia will be extended to Sabah and Sarawak; and priority
will be given to the establishment of schools in rural areas.
(b) To meet manpower needs. It is intended to expand, improve,
and rationalize technical training at all levels. This
will be done by expanding the pre-vocational courses given
in general secondary schools and by introducing them in
Sabah and Sarawak. Technician and skilled worker training
facilities will be expanded and cooperation by all the
agencies involved, including employers, will continue to be
sought so as to achieve a more practical orientation of
courses. For the education and training of high level
manpower, a distribution of responsibilities among the
universities is being made.



(c) To improve education quality and stress science and
technology. Curricula and teaching methods will be
modernized, particularly through the use of educational
radio and television. Science teaching in schools will
be expanded and science enrollments in the universities
will be increased.
3.08      At the primary level, enrollment growth is planned at about 2.4%
p.a. for the period 1972-1985. Some 92% of the age group would be enrolled
by 1985, assuming an age group growth rate of 2.2% p.a. over the period
(Annexes 3 and 4). If family planning programs reduce the growth rate to
about 1.9% p.a., then the target 1985 enrollment would account for virtually
all of the age group. At the lower secondary level, enrollment growth rates
in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah are planned at about 4.3% p.a. so as to
achieve an enrollment ratio of about 77% by 1985; the government considers
that this will be sufficient to meet the demand.  On the other hand, lower
secondary enrollments in Sarawak, which have been limited in the past, are
expected to increase rapidly over the next decade as the government's policy
of nine years basic education for all who seek it is put into effect.  The
practical subject options now available to schools in Peninsular Malaysia in
agriculture, commerce, home science and industrial arts will be extended to
schools in Sabah and Sarawak.
3.09      At the upper secondary level (grades 10-11), the enrollment growth
rate for the period 1972-1985 is anticipated to be about 6.0% p.a. (nearly
15% p.a. from 1965-1972) thus giving an enrollment ratio of about 40% in
1985. Special provision will be made for rural areas and emphasis will be
placed on science and practical subjects so that graduates are better
prepared for labor market needs (para 2.10). The output may still exceed
estimated needs over the period 1975 to 1985 but the government does not
consider a lower rate of expansion to be acceptable in view of the great
increase in lower secondary enrollments from 1965 onwards. At the Form VI
level (grades 12-13), to meet manpower needs and supply qualified entrants
for the universities, an enrollment increase of about 9% p.a. is planned for
Peninsular Malaysia, about 16% p.a. for Sabah and 10% p.a. for Sarawak.
3.10      To provide sufficient teachers for the expansion of primary
education in rural areas, where pupil/teacher ratios are necessarily lower
than in urban areas, the present overall pupil/teacher ratio (32:1) is to be
maintained for planning purposes. This will require an expanded teacher
training program (Annexes 5 and 6) which would be assisted by the proposed
project. To improve the quality of secondary teaching, the government
proposes to increase the proportion of university graduate teachers from
less than 17% of the total to about 40% by 1980.
3.11      Qualitative improvements in the general education system also
include ERTV to assist the introduction of new curricula, especially in
mathematics and science, and to promote the national language. The
Bank second education project is assisting these developments in Peninsular
Malaysia; the proposed project would assist ERTV in Sabah and Sarawak.



- 8 -
3.12      The targets in the SMP for technical and vocational education,
indicative of the government's plans to align education more closely with
manpower needs, show doubled enrollments in technical and vocational
schools (grades 10-11) and in technician training (grades 12-13) during
the period of the plan and in accelerated training under MARA 1/ and the
Ministry of Labor. This expansion of technical education is being assisted
by the first two Bank loans (a total of 20 technical/vocational schools),
whereby a 25% p.a. increase in enrollments is being achieved. To increase
technician training, the establishment of another polytechnic along the
lines of that at Ipoh would be assisted by the proposed project. Technical
and vocational courses are being revised to become more employment-oriented
and employers and labor organizations have cooperated with the Ministries
concerned in the establishment of a National Industrial Training and Trade
Certification Board. At the local level, the existing "tracer" system,
by which records are kept of the employment of graduates and which assists
training programs to be adjusted to meet employment demands, is being
strengthened.
3.13      For the universities, the SMP proposes to expand and rationalize
the system so that each of the five universities will specialize in a
different field (e.g., agriculture, graduate studies, science, technology).
Total university enrollment is expected to increase from 11,000 in 1972 to
about 25,000 by 1980 (Annex 3), and it is planned that 60% of the enroll-
ment will be in scientific and technological fields. The Bank second
education project is assisting the development of the science-based
University of Penang.
Education Finance
3.14      The Federal Government finances virtually all of the capital and
recurrent expenditure of assisted schools, which currently enroll nearly
98% of all students in Peninsular Malaysia and over 95% in Sabah and Sarawak.
Primary and lower secondary education in Peninsular Malaysia are free in
assisted schools; in Sabah and Sarawak a monthly fee of M$ 10, remitted in
needy cases, is charged. Fees at higher levels of education are accompanied
by a large bursary program exceeding M$ 15 million in 1972. In 1972 the re-
current budget of the Miniscry of Education was equivalent to about 21%
of Federal recurrent expenditure. Including expenditures by other public
agencies, about 24% of all public recurrent expenditure was devoted to
education and training. The total education effort of the country, including
private expenditures, was estimated at 6.8% of GNP in 1972 (Annex 7). These
figures are high in comparison with other countries (Annex 1) but they reflect
the priority assigned to education and training by the Government.

a parastatal agency, under the Ministry of National and Rural Develop-
ment, to promote economic and social development, particularly in the
rural areas.



- 9 -
3.15      Expenditures by the Ministry of Education grew by 9.5% p.a.
during 1967-72. The increase was 15.5% between 1972-73 due to a reor-
ganization of the teaching service and consolidation of teachers' salaries
at civil service levels. These increased salaries raised annual recurrent
costs per student from US$50 to US$70 at primary level and from US$75 to
about US$100 at lower secondary level. 1/ On the basis of enrollment
projections (paras 3.08 and 3.09) and expected further increases in costs
per student, the recurrent budget of the Ministry of Education is projected
to increase from M$ 718 million in 1973 to about M$ 1,700 million in 1985.
However, the growth of education expenditures at 7.5% p.a. is expected to
be less than the annual increase in central government recurrent expenditures
at 9.2%. Consequently, the share of the Ministry of Education in total
government recurrent expenditure is expected to decline slightly (Annex 8).
The percentage will still be high but it conforms with government priorities
and is considered feasible in view of the country's resources. The recurrent
expenditures generated by the proposed Bank project when fully operational
in 1980 would be about M$ 18 million or some 1.4% of the projected Ministry
budget.
3.16      Government capital expenditure on education and training during
the First Malaysia Plan (1966-70) amounted to M$ 330 million or 8% of total
public capital spending. The SHP allocates some M$ 540 million to the
sector or 7.4+% of total public development expenditure over the Plan period.
High priority has been given to the improvement of general secondary educa-
tion (34% of the total), expansion of technical and vocational education
(25%) and of the university system (16%). After two years of the SMP (end
1972) actual capital expenditures had been made which, if continued to 1975,
would disburse 90% of the total amount allocated in Peninsular Malaysia and
nearly 80% in Sabah and Sarawak. This achievement compares favorably with
the 58% achievement recorded in the First Plan. In order to finance cost
overruns and new projects not anticipated at the time of drafting the SMP,
the allocation of the Ministry of Education was increased by 25% during
the mid-term review. Overall, educational allocations were increased by
36% during this review (Annex 9).

IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The project would assist in implementing the Malaysian educational
strategy (paras 3.07 - 3.13) by expanding (i) basic education in Sabah;
(ii) pre-university education in Sarawak; (iii) teacher training and
(iv) technician training in Peninsular Malaysia, and (v) introduce
educational radio and television in Sabah and Sarawak. It would comprise
construction, furniture and equipment for:

(e) Educational radio and
television, Sabah and
Sarawak
Totals                           9,220       5,950          317
Details of enrollment and staff requirements in the project schools are
given in Annex 10. The proposed schedules of accommodation are functional
and economical and would permit flexible utilization. Over the whole project,
the utilization factors average 83% for classrooms and 75Z for specialist
facilities.
Project Items
4.02      Seven Secondary Schools, Sabah.  Following the lead of Peninsular
Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak are to extend their basic education course from
six to nine years duration by progressively allowing all primary school
leavers to enter lower secondary education. This expansion will be
based generally on small rural towns. In Sarawak, where entry to lower
secondary education has so far been carefully controlled, the government
intends to expand education at this level rapidly from its own resources.
In Sabah, control has been less rigid; the relatively high enrollment in
lower secondary schools has been made possible by the use of unsuitable
facilities (para 3.02). In addition to eight new government secondary
schools being built under the SMP, the government now intends to build a
further 14 schools and the proposed project would finance seven of these.



- 11 -
4.03      The project schools would be built in the rural areas of Bingkor,
Membakut, Kunak, Penampang, Bongawan, Kiulu and Weston. Six of these
schools, with a total enrollment of 1,570, are already functioning in
inadequate premises. The seven project schools would have a total enrollment
of 4,400 places, of which 560 would be at the upper secondary (grades 10 - 11)
level. These places, included to help equalize higher education opportunities
between rural and urban youth, would provide for only about 20% of the lower
secondary output from the project schools. t,550 boarding places are pro-
vided for those students who live more than 5 miles from the school.
4.04      Lower secondary students would have two practical options, chosen
from agriculture, commerce, home science and industrial arts. As facilities
and teachers become available, it is intended to broaden the lower secondary
curriculum in this manner throughout the system. At present, practical
options are not being provided at the upper secondary level although this
is desirable on manpower grounds (para 2.10). The government has confirmed
its intention to introduce practical subjects into the curriculum for upper
secondary students in the project schools and expects to be able to do this
within five years of loan signing. No difficulty is expected in the provi-
sion of teachers for the project schools (Annex 6). As the schools will be
built in rural areas where housing for teachers is not generally available,
the project would provide 132 staff houses. The project schools would be
used for adult education outside school hours.
4.05      Junior College, Sarawak.  If, as projected in Annex 4, the Form VI
enrollment in Sarawak increases to 3,100 by 1985 from its present 920,
there will still be a shortage of output at this level and therefore at
university level (para 2.09). The proposed project item would help to meet
the shortfall, which, it is expected, would be eliminated in due course
either by the development of sixth forms in existing secondary schools or
by the establishment of further junior colleges. At present, junior college
development is to be preferred because it enables the most economical use
to be made of scarce science and mathematics secondary teachers and
facilities. (The Sabah Government is building a 660-pupil junior college
from its own resources.)
4.06      The proposed project would provide buildings and equipment for
a Junior College (Grades 12 and 13) which would initially cater also for
Forms IV and V (Grades 10 and 11). The college would be built near Kuching,
the capital; it would recruit its students from all parts of Sarawak and
provide boarding facilities for 620 to accommodate students from outside
Kuching. Over 60% of the students would follow science-based courses. There
would be no shortage of qualified entrants. The college, when fully developed,
would need 34 teaching staff, all graduates. At present, about 30 Sarawak
graduates trained in Peninsular Malaysia and abroad are returning annually.
There would thus be sufficient teachers to staff the proposed College.



- 12 -
4.07      Four Teacher Training Colleges (TTC), Peninsular Malaysia.  B3ecause
of population distribution, rural primary schools usually have a lower
pupil/teacher ratio than the larger schools located in urban areas; this
problem is accentuated by the need to provide for Malay, Indian and Chinese
racial groups. Further, the government recognizes that it is in the rural
areas that expansion needs are greatest. For these reasons, the government
is now using the existin- relatively low pupil/teacher ratio of 32:1 for
future planning purposes. The other main factor governing future teacher
needs is the annual loss of teachers on which data are lacking. Annex 5
shows the estimated output from existing TTCs and Annex 6 calculates future
needs for teachers based on various assumptions and shows that, during
1972-1985, an annual deficit of between 900-1,000 primary and lower secondary
teachers is likely. Furthermore, of the institutions listed in Annex 5, the
Penang and Seremban Day Training Colleges are inadequate for teacher training
purposes and the government wishes to close them. The former will be
demolished and the latter will provide additional classroom facilities for
a nearby secondary school.  These two colleges have a combined output capa-
city of 360 p.a.
4.08      The proposed project would provide four teacher training colleges,
each with an enrollment of 720 students and a total output capacity of about
1,400 p.a. to meet the need referred to above. The colleges would offer
a trwo-year course (grades 12 and 13) following the School Certificate.
Forrierly, the TTCs in Malaysia provided a purely academic course, very
similar to the pre-university Form VI courses, and many students used the
TTC as a stepping-stone to the University. The courses now stress practical
teaching (including six weeks teaching practice per year) and community
development work. The first year course would be the same for all students;
in the second, the students would concentrate either on primary or lower
secondary teaching. The colleges would have some specialization, two in
languages and social science and two in mathematics and science subjects for
lower secondary teachers. However, to provide flexibility, all four colleges
would have the same physical facilities. This can be done while maintaining
economical utilization factors.
4.09      Two of the colleges would be at Kuantan and Kuala Trengganu on
the east coast in accord with government plans to develop this region;
the others would be at Sungei Patani, near Penang, and at Ipoh. Full boarding
would be provided at all colleges to permit (i) a full measure of extra-
curricular activities; (ii) enrollment of students from rural areas; and
(iii) in-service courses during vacations. The government will grant
priority of admission to the project TTCs to students from rural areas,
especially from those which find it difficult to retain teachers.
4.10      There would be no lack of qualified students for entry to the
colleges. Present TTC staffs are satisfactory, consisting mainly of experienced
primary school teachers and graduates from the Faculty of Education of the
University of Malaya. No difficulty is expected in staffing the four project
colleges.



- 13 -
4.11      The Polytechnic, Kuantan. Although the government plans to
expand technical education (grades 12-13) rapidly by increasing enrollments
from 5,600 in 1972 to about 20,000 by 1985 (Annex 3) the supply will
still not meet the demand (para 2.09). At present the only polytechnic in
the country is at Ipoh which admits one in five of qualified applicants and
has an enrollment of 1,000 which will be expanded to 1,600 when its new
buildings are completed in 1974. Its projected annual output of qualified
graduates is 600.
4.12      The proposed new polytechnic would be located at Kuantan which
the government intends to develop as a major seaport and industrial area
to redress regional imbalances and diversify employment opportunities
throughout the country. The proposed polytechnic would be a national
institution; it would enroll 1,110 students of whom 900 would be boarders.
This high boarding ratio is necessary because of the limited amount of local
accommodation expected to be available and to provide for the needs of
students from rural areas.
4.13      The proposed polytechnic would offer technician courses in civil,
mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering, food technology, commerce
and accountancy. All courses would include a six-month period of supervised
practical training in industry or commerce. About 90 teaching staff would
be required at full development. Teacher recruitment and training programs
have already been initiated by the Ministry of Education and a sufficient
number of qualified staff is expected to be available. Since they would
initially lack experience, the project would finance 33-1/2 man-years of
expert servikes to assist heads of departments during the early years of the
polytechnic. It would also finance 8-1/2 man-years of training for
Malaysian staff abroad.
4.14      Educational Radio (ER) and Television (ETV) in Sabah and Sarawak.
Lessons by radio have been broadcast in Sarawak for about ten years.
Together with printed materials for use with the radio lessons, they
are prepared at Kuala Lumpur and Kuching and broadcast from Kuching to form
part of the schools daily timetable and thus provide important support to
the many under-qualified teachers in primary schools. In addition, the school
radio system provides a channel for routine administrative directives to
schools in remote areas. Sabah has not yet developed a school radio system
but it has well developed facilities for radio transmission and is now
proposing to institute lessons by radio. To further the development of school
radio there are required a number of radio receivers to meet the needs of
Sabah schools and for replacement receivers, studio facilities in Sabah and
support centers in Sabah and Sarawak. The proposed project would therefore
support educational radio in Sabah and Sarawak by financial assistance for
(a) the construction and equipment of two radio broadcasting studios in
Sabah; (b) about 900 radio receivers; (c) equipment for ,3 Educational Media
Service Centers (EMSC); and (d) transport facilities.



- 14 -
4.15      Educational television for Peninsular Malaysia was included in
the Bank second education project to improve the quality of education and
upgrade teachers, particularly those in rural schools. Implementattion is
proceeding smoothly, with priority of installation being given to rural
schools.  Following a feasibility study, the government now proposes to
extend ETV to Sabah, which has a television system, and to Sarawak, (where
TV will be introduced in late 1975), to provide the same assistance which
modern technology is giving to education in Peninsular Malaysia and to assist
national unity and integration, major elements in the SMP (para 3.07). The
proposed project item would therefore support the development of ETV by
providing financial support for (a) studio and EMSC equipment, (b) about
2,200 receivers, and (c) about 1,700 generators. All primary and secondary
schools with a total enrollment of about 500,000 would be substantially
covered by 1978 when the system is fully developed.
4.16      ETV programs would be produced in Peninsular Malaysia, videotaped,
and flown to Kota Kinabalu, Sabah for broadcasting and from where a chain
of stations now under construction would relay them to Sarawak. Adequate
transmission time has been assured by Radio Television Malaysia and the
Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Works, Posts and Telegraphs.
The effectiveness of both ER and ETV will depend on the support they receive
at the local level and the government has given an assurance that a full-
time education mass-media officer will be appointed to each of the 13 EMSCs
no later than Jupe 30, 1975.
Cost of the Project
4.17      General.  Construction cost estimates are based on recent costs of
similar institutions in Malaysia. The average cost per square foot is
reasonable at about US$7.3 for the teacher training colleges and US^$9.2
for the Kuantan Polytechnic.  Unit capital costs per student place are
reasonable. For the secondary schools in Sabah, they amount to US$1,225.
This is considerably higher than the US$950 for similar schools financed
under the first Bank loan but there has been a rapid and accelerating price
escalation since this loan was signed in May, 1969, and particular4y since
the beginning of 1973. Furniture and equipment cost estimates a;e also
reasonable; detailed lists would be prepared during the Oes48n s tve and
reviewed by the Bank bofore procurement.

costs of 1973, in both local currency and foreign exchange, are expected
to inc,rease by an average of 10% p.a. for civil works and an'avrage of
7% p.a. for.equipment and furniture.  Therefore, an additional contingency
allowance of 25% has been included for civil works and 20% for equip.uent
and furniture.  The.overall implementation period of the proJe!ct is
estimated at six years, with the physical facilities being completed in
three and half-years (Charts 5 and 6).  The technical assistance implementa-
tion period is estimated at six years and a 15% contingency allowance has
been provided. Total contingencies are equivalent to 31.8Z of.the basic
cost of the project before adding contingencies and 24.1% of the total cost
including contingencies.

4.21      Foreign exchange components.  The foreign exchange component
has been calculated on the expectation that civil works, architectural
services and furniture will be supplied locally and equipment and specialists'
services supplied from overseas. Estimated percentages are as follows:
(a) site development and construction, 32%; (b) professional fees, 10%;
(c) furniture, 15%; (d) equipment, 90%; and (e) specialists' services and
fellowships, 80%. Including contingencies, the foreign exchange component
is estimated at US$19.5 million or 47% of the total project cost.
ProJect Implementation
4.22      Administration.  The existing project unit, established in the
Ministry of Education for the implementation of the first and second
projects, would be responsible for overall supervision of the project and
liaison with the Bank. However, it needs to be strengthened to supervise
the preparation of design of civil works and equipment lists, execution of
construction and delivery and installation of equipment. During negotiations,
the government gave assurances that, within six months from the signing of
the loan agreement, (i) three full-time additional executive assistants and
(ii) a project coordinator in Sabah will be appointed to the Project Unit.
In preparing and issuing tenders, evaluating bids and awarding contracts for
civil works, the project unit would collaborate with the Public Works
Department.
4.23      Procurement.  Contracts for civil works and equipment would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Furniture would betprocured
in bulk following normal government procedures. The Malaysian building
industry is large and competitive and it is not likely that foreign con-
tractors will gain awards for civil works. Most of the instructional
equipment is expected to be procured abroad. Items would be grouped to the
extent practicable to encourage competition and to permit bulk procurement.
Local manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% or the
existing rates of import duties, whichever is the lower, over the c.i.f. price
of competing imports.
4.24      Design and supervision of civil works would be the responsibility
of the Public Works Department. Because of manpower shortages in the
education facilities section of the Public Works Department, the government
may use consultant architects to design and/or prepare contract documents
for part of the project. Design would generally follow the standards
established for similar institutions included in the first and second
projects; these standards are acceptable to the Bank. Similarly, the
equipment lists would be patterned on the master lists established for
similar institutions in the first and second projects.
4.25      Sites.  Suitable sites have been selected for the secondary
schools at Bingkor, Bongawan, Kiulu, Kunak, Membakut, Penampang and
Weston, the Junior College in Kuching, the teacher training college at
Kuantan and the Kuantan Polytechnic. During negotiations, the government
gave assurances that suitable sites for the teacher training colleges
at Ipoh, Kuala Trengganu and Sungei Patani will be selected within six



- 18 -
months of the signing of the Loan Agreement and that all sites will be
acquired in good time to avoid delays in construction.
4.26      Disbursement.  The proposed loan of US$19.0 million would finance
46% of the total project cost. The loan would be disbursed to meet:
(a) 100% of the c.i.f. price of directly imported instructional
equipment and of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured
equipment;
(b) 70% of total expenditure on imported and locally procured
equipment;
(c) 32% of total costs of civil works; and
(d) 80% of technical assistance costs.
The percentages under (c) and (d) above would be adjusted as necessary to
spread disbursements over the implementation period of the project. Savings
under one category would be available to cover overruns in other categories
or would otherwise be available for cancellation. The estimated disbursement
schedule is shown in Annex 13.
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The proposed project was selected to help Malaysia redress
regional imbalances in educational opportunity, meet its expected manpower
needs and improve educational quality, objectives to which the government
has assigned high priority. Alternatives to the proposed project were
considered during appraisal, e.g., expansion at existing institutions.
These however, were dismissed when found to be unviable or uneconomical
solutions.
5.02      Nearly half the project expenditures, including all those on
mass media, would benefit the less developed States of Sabah and Sarawak
with their predominantly rural population. Within Peninsular Malaysia
itself, 74% of project expenditures would benefit the relatively less well
developed East Coast regions. The boarding facilities provided in the
project institutions (65% of total places) would improve the access to
education of rural students.
5.03      The junior college in Sarawak, the four teacher training
colleges in Peninsular Malaysia and the Kuantan Polytechnic would help
to meet essential needs for trained manpower. They would provide
respectively by the early 1980s about:
(a) 20Z of the needs for high level manpower (including
university entrants) in Sarawak;



- 19 -
(b) one-third of the needs for primary and lower secondary
teachers - i.e., teachers at the basic levels - in
Peninsular Malaysia;
(c) one-third of the annual need for polytechnic-trained
technicians for the whole of Malaysia.
5.04      The third effect of the project would be to improve educational
quality.  The lower secondary schools would introduce practical options in
Sabah schools and these would be introduced at the upper secondary level at
a later date. The teacher training colleges would use a new and more
practical curriculum, integrating primary and lower secondary teacher
training, and stressing practical and community work. The mass media
component would improve the quality of education by bringing modern
methods and good teachers to rural school classrooms to the benefit of
teachers and pupils.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMNDATION
6.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) staffing of the Educational Media Service Centers
(para 4.16) and the Project Unit (para 4.22); and
(b) the provision of suitable sites for the teacher
training colleges at Ipoh, Kuala Trengganu and
Sungei Patani (para 4.25).
6.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$19 million equivalent to the government of Malaysia for a term of
25 years including a 5-year grace period.






APPENDIX 1
Page 1
THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
Administration
1.        Under the Malaysian constitution, education is a federal
responsibility but the States of Sabah and Sarawak control their own
education systems for the present. In accordance with the Education Law,
this situation will be reviewed shortly and it is likely that, following
this review, the system will be gradually unified. In Peninsular Malaysia,
administrative and financial control are centralized in the Ministry of
Education which also contains the federal inspectorate. Sabah and Sarawak
each have their own Department of Education, providing administrative
and financial control and an inspectorate.
2.        The Education Planning and Research Division (EPRD), the
secretariat of the high level Educational Planning Committee in the
Federal Ministry of Education, is in charge of quantitative planning and
co-ordination of curriculum development and related in-service training
activities. Although EPRD was strengthened in 1969 in conformity with a
requirement of the first Bank loan for education, it is still inadequately
staffed. In addition, some of its functions in respect to other Divisions
of the Ministry have not been defined very clearly and this leads to
overlapping of responsibilities and duplication of work. Consideration is
being given to the separation of the planning and statistical sections from
the education research sections but a final decision on this is unlikely
before the completion of the Curriculum Development Center (CDC) included
in the second Bank loan.
3.        The Ministry is housed in dispersed facilities, many of which are
inadequate for their present-day use. A site near that of the CDC has
been selected for a new building which will provide suitable accommodation
and bring together the dispersed divisions. This, and a greater use of
computerized methods in the processing of statistics, should permit better
co-ordination and utilization of resources.
4.        Financial procedures have been recently improved.  The Ministry
now employs a system of program and performance budgeting. Forward
budgeting for more than one or two fiscal years, however, is still
carried out on the basis of outmoded techniques. These also should
improve when new facilities become available.
Structure (Chart I)
5.        Schools are of three types:  government schools, government aided
schools run by non-profit voluntary bodies, and unaided private schools.
The first two types, generally known as "assisted schools" provide primary
and, in Peninsular Malaysia, lower secondary education free of charge;
fees charged for other levels and types of education (about M$ 10 million
annually) are accompanied by a large bursary program (about M$15 million
annually, including fellowships for overseas studies). The school year
runs from January to November.



APPENDIX 1
Page 2
6.        Primary education begins at the age of six and lasts six years.
The secondary course of five years comprises three years in lower and two
years in upper secondary schools; entry to the latter is based on a competitive
examination. In Peninsular Malaysia all primary school leavers are offered
lower secondary school places; this system will be followed in Sabah and
Sarawak as facilities and funds become available. At the end of the lower
secondary course (grade 9) the Lower Certificate of Education is taken.
The School Certificate follows at grade 11 and the Higher School Certificate
at grade 13.
7.        Technical and vocational education (a two-year course in Peninsular
Malaysia and a three-year course in Sabah and Sarawak) follow lower
secondary education. Upper secondary and technical students judged suitable
for universities take a post-secondary or Form VI course which lasts two
years. Post-secondary education is given in two technical institutes
and two universities. The graduates of Form VI and the best students of
post-secondary institutes have access to the universities.
General Education
8.        Primary education (Grades 1-6) is offered in one of the four
languages used in instruction - Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese, English or Tamil.
In 1970 instruction in English in Grade 1 was discontinued in Peninsular
Malaysia and replaced by Bahasa Malaysia, the developing national language.
By 1976 English will have ceased to be a language of instruction but will be
taught as a second language in all schools. Sabah and, to a less extent,
Sarawak are also implementing this policy but at a slower rate. The total
enrollment in 1972 amounted to 1.77 million, representing some 90% of the
6-11 years age group. The average rate of enrollment growth over the past
six years has been 3% p.a. About 48% of the pupils are girls. Enrollments
in private unaided schools are negligible. The system of automatic
promotion is followed and repetition rates are therefore nll. Dropout
rates are low in urban areas and in English medium schools but in the rural
areas and in Sabah and Sarawak one pupil in four drops out during the six-year
course. The report of a government-appointed committee on dropout is now being
studied at cabinet level.
9.        The total teaching force numbers about 55,000, giving a pupil/
teacher ratio of about 32:1. The government intends to maintain this
rather low overall ratio which it considers necessary to maintain educational
quality and to expand education in rural areas where pupil/teacher ratios
are unavoidably low. The academic background of new teachers is generally
good but an insufficient output from the teacher training colleges of recent
years has led to the use of more untrained teachers which now account for
about 15% of the teaching force. The standards in rural areas, particularly
in Sabah and Sarawak, are lower, many of the teachers having had only
primary education before the teacher training course. The government is
trying to raise the standards of these teachers by in-service courses
and inspectorate visits and advice.



APPENDIX 1
Page 3
10.       The primary school curriculum stresses language; social studies
receive relatively little time but are partially covered in the language
classes. Increasing emphasis is being placed on science in the upper
classes and televised science lessons are now given in Peninsular
Malaysia.
11.       General secondary education had in 1972 a total enrollment of
618,000 in assisted schools. As a proportion of the relevant age groups,
this represented:
Enrollment
Level                  Age Group         Ratio
Lower Secondary (grades 7-9)           12-14 years        51%
Upper Secondary (grades 10-11)         15-16 years        23%
Form VI (grades 12-13)                 17-18 years         3%
Over 40% of the pupils were girls and this percentage is steadily increasing.
More than two-thirds of the pupils were taught in English, the remainder in
Malay or Chinese. Enrollment in non-assisted schools (53,000) was relatively
substantial only in Sarawak (12,000). When a pupil changes his language of
instruction in moving from primary to secondary school, he is required to
spend one year in a "remove" transition class. In due course (para 8),
Bahasa Malaysia will become the language of instruction in all assisted
secondary schools in Peninsular Malaysia.
12.       About 23,000 teachers were employed in the assisted schools,
giving an acceptable pupil/teacher ratio of 27:1. However, only about
4,000 teachers were university graduates and only about 1,000 of these
were graduates in science.
13.       The curriculum is generally well balanced but little practical
work is done by the students themselves. The government is aware of this
and efforts are being made to improve the curriculum content in mathematics
and the sciences where an integrated science program is being adopted at
the lower secondary level and Nuffield type practical science courses were
introduced at the upper level in 1972. These courses stress scientific
studies within the range of the pupil's own experience and emphasize the
use of simple home-made apparatus. They demand an innovative approach on
the part of the teacher and therefore require upgrading courses for
practising teachers. These courses are given in vacation time in those
teacher training colleges which have residential facilities. Courses are
very specialized at the Form VI level, where, for instance, the science
forms spend over 70% of the time on mathematics and science. However,
much of this work is done at the university in other educational systems.



APPENDIX 1
Page 4
Technical and Vocational Secondary Education
14.       There are three upper secondary technical schools (grades 10-11)
in Peninsular Malaysia with a total enrollment of about 2,000; five
schools are under construction as part of the first Bank education
project and will provide a further 3,200 places by 1974 and another
similar school will be built under the second Bank project. The objective
of these schools is to provide the students with a good general education
together with training in engineering, commerce or agriculture. About
two-thirds of the graduates enter post-secondary colleges or Form VI classes
(grades 12-13) with a view to university education. The remaining one-third
are employed in government departments or in the private sector and
become junior technicians through experience and on-the-job training.
15.       Vocational training in industrial and commercial skills is given
in Peninsular Malaysia in eleven vocational schools (grades 10-11) and in
Sabah and Sarawak in three vocational schools (grades 10-12). Some of
these schools, provided under the first Bank project, have only recently
begun enrolling students; their total enrollment is about 4,000. When
the seven schools provided under the second Bank education project are
established, the total enrollment capacity will amount to about 11,000
places. In Peninsular Malaysia, the training leads to the Malaysian
Vocational School Certificate, which is equivalent to the general secondary
School Certificate. In Sabah and Sarawak, the industrial courses last
three years and lead to City and Guilds of London Institute examinations.
Commercial courses are of one or two years duration. Graduates are in
great demand by industry: the "tracer system" (para 3.12), organized
in most schools, indicates that, after graduation, most are employed in
the trade in which they have been trained.
Non-Formal Vocational Training
16.       The Industrial Training Institute (ITI) in Kuala Lumpur is
the responsibility of the Ministry of Labor. It provides vocational
training for apprentices and preparatory trade courses for school leavers
and adults. Its student capacity is about 600. The apprenticeship scheme
lasts four years with the apprentices spending 22 weeks at the ITI during
their first year and 11 weeks in each of the subsequent years. Malaysian
industry is still reluctant to employ apprentices but the preparatory
trade course graduates find ready employment. Another ITI is being
established at Prai with assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany
and a number of ITIs have also been established in other localities using
existing facilities, usually those of vocational schools, to provide
evening classes for apprentices and other employees.



APPENDIX 1
Page 5
17.       MARA's 1/ educational activities include four vocational training
centers and three more centers are planned which will bring the total
enrollment capacity to 3,000. In addition, MARA supports on-the-job
training by providing the participants with allowances during the period
of training. The National Youth Training Center under the Ministry of
Culture, Youth and Sports has an enrollment of about 500 but few students
'nave found employment ia their respective trades, the main reason being
the irrelevance of the tcraining. Numerous short-term courses are provided
by several other Ministries and industrial concerns. There are no reliable
figures on their enrollment, type of course, teachers, etc.
Agricultural Secondary Education
18.       At the lower secondary level an increasing number of schools
offer agriculture as an elective subject. Agricultural science is also
taught in a limited number of upper secondary schools. The Ministry of
Education runs three agricultural vocational schools (grades 10-11) each with
an annual intake of 80 students. The Ministry of Agriculture has two
schools of agriculture (grades 10-12) which train junior agricultural
assistants; of three schools of agriculture included in the first Bank
education project, two are now complete and one under construction.
These will increase the total enrollment capacity at this level from
500 to 1,400 by 1975. The schools under the Ministry of Agriculture, where
experienced extension workers are teaching the practical subjects, are of
good quality and have a strong practical orientation. The vocational
agricultural schools under the Ministry of Education are weaker because
the content of the program is too general and the instruction too academic;
as a result, the employment record of their graduates is poor. It would
be advisable to rationalize agricultural education by concentrating
training in crop and animal husbandry under one single Ministry and by
planning its development to correspond with the expected demand from the
public sector (which employs more than 80% of trained agricultural manpower).
Primary and Lower Secondary Teacher Training
19.       In Peninsular Malaysia, primary and lower secondary school
teachers are trained in a two-year course following the School Certificate.
In 1972, there were nine Teacher Training Colleges (TTC), offering pre-
service courses, with an enrollment of 3,000. Four TTCs, including one of the
nine in partial use, were being used for other purposes, two for university
work and two for intensive courses in teaching Bahasa Malaysia. The
Government has recently decided to integrate the training of primary and
lower secondary teachers and to provide this training in fully residential
colleges. The numbers enrolled in TTCs are now increasing again after
having declined sharply but the output from the existing institutions will
be insufficient to meet the needs as they are now estimated (para 9 and
Annex 6).
1/   MARA (MaJlis Ama,ah 'a'ayat - Council of Trust for indigenous People) -
a parastatal agen-y under the Ministry of Natlonal and Rural Development
to promote ecoriomic ana aocial development, particularly in rural areas.



APPENDIX 1
Page 6
20.       In Sabah and Sarawak the shortage of suitably qualified entrants
for teacher training is such that lower entry standards are still accepted.
Some primary school teachers are trained in a three-year course following
primary school graduation or in a two or three-year course following some
secondary education.  Standards are rising and all future intakes will have
completed lower secondary education. As in Peninsular Malaysia, the course
for secondary teachers lasts two years following the School Certificate.
Total enrollment in the four pre-service colleges in 1972 was about 1,200 and
the output 360 primary and 160 secondary teachers.
23.       Technical teachers for the technical secondary schools come from
the newly established National Institute of Technology (formerly the
Kuala Lumpur Technical College) and the Faculty of Engineering of the
University of Malaya. In addition to their regular studies in these
institutions, they attend courses in technical teaching at the Technical
Teacher Training College.
Post-Secondary Technical and Agricultural Education (Grade 12 onwards)
24.       Post-secondary technical and agricultural education is given in
four institutions, all of good quality. Two of them are now offering
degree courses. The Ungku Omar Polytechnic (enrollment 1,000) at Ipoh,
trains technicians in a 2-1/4 year course which includes 26 weeks of
practical experience in industry. The National Institute of Technology
(enrollment 1,600, of which 200 in degree courses) gives three-year
diploma courses in architecture, engineering, land and quantity surveying,
and town and country planning. The MARA Institute of Technology (enrollment
4,500) has inter alia a School of Engineering with an enrollment of about
350. An ultimate capacity of about 1,200 for this School is envisaged,
with an annual output of about 200 at the lower diploma level and 80 at
the higher diploma level. In general, a rapid increase in enrollment in
post-secondary technical education is planned (paras 3.12, 3.13) and accords
with estimated manpower requirements.
25.       The Agricultural University (total enrollment 1,100), formerly
the Agricultural College at Serdang, offers a three-year diploma course
and a five-year degree course was started in 1971. It has good facilities
and is well located. It is planned that the diploma course will be
retained and that the output at this level will be about 300 p.a. from
1974 onwards.
University Education (Grade 14 onwards)
26.       Until 1969 only one University existed in Malaysia, the University
of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. In 1967 the Higher Education Planning Committee
recommended the establishment of two more universities. These were estab-
lished in 1969 and 1970, both in temporary premises (para 19), one at Penang
and the other, the National University, at Kuala Lumpur. Two other
degree-granting institutions have since been established (paras 24 and 25).
The National University specializes in Islamic studies and uses Bahasa
Malaysia as the language of instruction; its permanent location has not yet



APPENDIX 1
Page 7
been decided. The other universities use English as language of instruction
but students are required to become proficient in Bahasa Malaysia. In
1972, total university enrollment in degree courses was 11,000 of which
over 40% were in arts courses and less than 20% in science courses. The
Government is anxious to redress this imbalance, largely caused by the
inadequate numbers of qualified candidates in science, by the improvement
and expansion of science-based teaching in schools and the expansion of
university science courses. Academic standards are high in all the
universities. It is estimated that about 10,000 out of a total of 26,000
Malaysian students abroad are taking higher education courses. Many of
these students are privately financed and details of the courses followed
are not available.
Technical Assistance
27.       Malaysia is receiving technical assistance in educgtion from
various multilateral (UNDP, Colombo Plan) and bilateral (U.K., U.S.A.,
Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Canada) sources. The Economic Planning Unit
coordinates assistance from multilateral sources but bilateral assistance
is handled directly by the divisions of the Ministry concerned so that it
is difficult to obtain a comprehensive overview of past, present and planned
activities. The UNDP 1972-1976 Country Program provides for assistance
in the fields of curriculum development, science, vocational and
technical education, educational television, forestry and university
engineering and post-graduate studies.






APPENDIX 2

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.        To assist in staff development and the implementation of the
Kuantan Polytechnic project item, the proposed project includes the cost
of 33-1/2 man-years of specialists' services and 8-1/2 man-years of
fellowships for training educators abroad. The total cost (excluding
contingencies) is estiz,.ated at US$1.24 million (US$1.17 million for
specialists and US$70,000 for fellowships); the implementation period is
estimated at about six years.
2.        The distribution of specialists and fellows would be flexible;
it is provisionally as follows:
