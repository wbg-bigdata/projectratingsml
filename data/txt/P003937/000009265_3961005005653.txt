MEIORANDUM AND RECOMIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PR)POSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR AN INTEGRATED SWAMPS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$65.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for twenty years, including five years
of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help
finance an Integrated Swamps Development project in Indonesia.
2.        Swamp Areas.  Indonesia has sr estimated 39 million ha of inland
and coastal swamps (about 20 percent of the total land area), nearly equally
divided between Sumatra, Kalimantan and Irian Jaya. Most of the swamp area
comprises fragile deep peat and acid sulphate soils which are less productive
and difficult to manage. It is estimated that about 7.5 million ha are
suitable for the production of rice, other food crops and tree crops under
controlled water management. Over the last 70 years about 2.1 million ha have
been developed through spontaneous settlement by Banjarese and Buginese
farmers of Kalimantan and South Sulawesi, respectively, and by local people
for rice and coconut cultivation. A further 1.2 million ha have been
reclaimed through schemes sponsored by the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to
settle transmigrants. With an average farm size of 2 ha, the 3.3 million ha
of swampland developed to date, support about 1.6 million f3milies or a total
of about 8 million people most of whom have incomes close to or below the
poverty line.
3.        Past EgMerience and Lessons Learned.  In developing swamp schemes,
GOI has followed a low coat/low technology approach by providing basic
drainage facilities and social infrastructure for the primary development
phase. This approach has successfully brought settlers to a subsistence level
and there is considerable potential for further income growth. Experience
gained under two Bank-assisted swamp reclamation projects (Swamps I and II)
indicates that increased productivity can be achieved through upgrading of
drainage infrastructure and improving operation and maintensance (O&M) and
agricultural support services. The main lessons learned from both projects
are that: (a) financing should be provided for all critical project
investments and services to ensure project success; (b) as swap reclamation
projects require inputs of s-eral sector agencies, effective coordination
among such agencies at both the provincial and national levels is a pre-
requisite for successful project implementation; (c) effective research and
extension service support is crucial for agricultural development under
difficult soil conditions; and (d) attention should be given to environmental
planning and management at an early stage in swamp development programs to
avoid degradation of the natural environment. These lessons have been taken
into account in the design of the proposed project.
4.        G01's Swamps Develosment Obiectives and Strateav.  GOI's objectives
for swamp development include: (a) making use of swamps to alleviate poverty
and support balanced regional development; and (b) maintaining the balance of



-2-
the ecosystem by protecting and conserving s%amps. GOI's current strategy
favors upgrading the infrastructure, and reinforcing agricultural development
in existing schemes rather than investing in reclamation of new araas.
5.        Bank Strateazv and Rationale for Involvement.  The key objectives of
the Bank's Countr,' Assistance Strategy for Indonesia are: (a) maintaining
economic growth with macroeconomic stability; (b) reducing poverty and
enhancing human resource develcpment; (c) enhancing private sector development
and competitiveness; (d) improving public sector management; and (e) improving
environmental management. Agriculture remains central to GOI's growth and
poverty reduction strategy, as poverty is still heavily concentrated in
agriculture, particularly in the non irrigated swamp and upland areas.
Accordingly, investment in agriculture continues to be important to the Bank's
assistance strategy in Indonesia, given the sector's role in employment
generation, poverty reduction, ststainable natural resource management, and
protection of the environment.
6.        The Bank supports GOI's efforts to enklance the potential of
existing swamp schemes for improved incomes and social welfare of existing
p.cor farmers. The proposed project is fully consistent with the Bsn)I's
Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on April 12, 1994. The
project would support GOLts objectives in the agricultural sector: sustained
growth, reduced rural poverty, and more balanced regional growth. Based on
experience gained under the previous projects, the Bank is well placed to
assist Governuent in deoigning and implementing sustainable development
programs ir. existing swamp schemes to ensure maximum benefits from sunk
investments. Bank support would also foster sound environmental practices in
swamp development and would assist Jambi, Riau and West Kalimantan provincial
governments in formulating policies and actions required for ensuring
efficient management and sustainable development of their coastal zones.
7.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project has two main objectives.  First,
it would alleviate poverty in the selected swamp schemes through further
development of their agricultural potential. Second, the project would assist
GOI in its management of the coastal zones and help ensure sound environmental
practices in swamp development.
8.        Prolect Description.  The proposed project would be implemented
over a six year period (1994 - 2000) in about twenty existing swamp schemes,
covering a potential net cultivable area of about 55,000 ha with some 30,000
farm households, in Jambi, Riau and West Kalimantan Provinces. It would
include the following main components:
(a) rehabilitation of existing and construction of new water control
structures, and support for better water management practices;
(b) promotion of food crop production through support for research and
extension with associated provision of seeds, pest control and
seasonal inputs;
(c) development of tree crops, including land titling and
certification, in an area of about 12,500 ha, of which about
8,300 ha would be located in land adjoining the swamp chemes;



(d) improvement of rural infrastructure through rehabilitation of
existing or construction of new roads, bridges and jetties, and
provision of potable water facilities; and
(e) improvement of coastal zone land use management in the three
provinces, including the preparation of an Environmental Profile
for West Kalimantan and support for the development of a )uffer
zone around the Berbak National Park in Jambi. Training ind
technical assistance would be provided to help GOI agencies with
the implementation of the proposed project.
9.        Total project costs are estimated at US$106.0 million.  The
proposed loan of US$65.0 million would finance 69 percent of the total costs,
exclusive of taxes (US$7.1 million equivalent) and vehicles and fertilil..rs
(US$6.2 million) which GOI will finance. GOI would provide US$35.8 million
and the beneficiaries US$5.2 million. A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are presented in Schedule A, and the amounts and methods of
procurement in Schedule B. A timetable for key project processing events is
in Schedule C, and the sta:us of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is riven
in Schedule D. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
12166-lID, dated May 17, 1994 i3 being distributed separately.
10.       Implementation Arrangements.  The Directorate General of Water
Resources Developmer.t (DGWRD) in the Ministry cf Public Works would be the
lead agency and would, through its Directorate of Swamps (DOS) and provincial
public works agencies, be responsible for construction or rehabilitation of
water control structures and other rural infrastructure. The Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA), through its agencies at the central and provincial level
would be responsible for implementing the proposed food crop and tree crop
development activities. The National Land Agency (BPN) would be responsible
for land titling and certification. The Directorate General of Forest
Protection and Nature Conservation (PHPA) in the Ministry of Forestry would be
responsible for implementation of the coastal zone land use management
component. To facilitate implementation, the development planning offices
(BAPPEDA) of the three provinces would coordinate all project activities
carried out by different agencies at provincial level and the national
development planning agency (BAPPENAS) would be responsible for project
coordination at central government level, including the allocation of project
funds.
11.        Proiect Sustainability.  Agricultural development on swamp schemes
has been constrained by three major factors. First, deficiencies in site
selection in past swamp reclamation schemes led to inclusion of unsuitable
land for development. Second, there are phyvsical constraints includings
(a) lack of control structures in drainage systems to prevent toxicity in
potentially acid sulphate soils a.Ld to control flooding, and (b) proliferation
of pests such as pigs and rats. Third, there are major weaknesses in tbk
organization of drainage systems development, operation and maintenance, and
agriculture and related support services. These shortcomings have been taken
into account in formulating site selection and planning criteria for the
proposed project. Also, support will be provided for community participation
through establishment of water management groups to improve O&M of tertiary
drainage systems. These measures would enhatice the sustainability of the
investments supported by the project.

12.       Role of Women.  Women are centrally involved in crop management
practices by virtue of their decision-making power, their control of the farm
budget, and their labor input. Making women knowledgeable about improved
farming practices is a key requisite for the project's success. Much of the
project's trainin8 activities will therefore be directed at women and they
vwill be encouraged to participate fully in project induced community
development activities, in particular the formation and management of farmer
groups.
13.       Environmental Impact.  The design of the project includes two masn
elements to protect the environment. First, a comprehensive environmental
monitoring and management plan has been prepared for the implementation of all
works in the 20 selected swamp schemes. The plan has been designed to
maximize utilization of exist=ng staff resources and technical capabilities
within provincial sector agencies and environmental studies centers. The
Executive Summary of the Environmental Assessment Report, which was
satisfactory, has been distributed to the Executive Directors. Second, the
project would support the three provincial governments in the management of
their coastal zones.
14.       Agreed Actions.  Government's agreement to the following key
actions has been obtained during negotiations:
(a) the schemes to be supported by the project will be selected in
accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank;
(b) in all scheme areas farmer groups will be formed, and the ability
o- those groups to manage the revolving funds ascertained, before
the input packages are made svailable to the farmers in those
areas;
(c) guidelines for the construction of roads will be prepared by DGWRD
in consultation with Bina Marga and sent to the Bank for comment by
March 31, 1995;
(d) potable water supply facilities will be constructed using a
community-based approach and the beneficiaries of these facilities
will contribute at least 10 percent of the value of the facilities
in the form of labor or any other mutually agreeable form of
contribution and fully cover the O&M costs of the facilities;
(e) for the tree crop development component the Government will provide
credit to farm families and administer smallholder cost recovery
arrangements in accordance with the procedures agreed with the
Bank;
(f) a study of options for the introduction of a drainage fee in swamp
schemes will be completed by June 30, 1998;
(g) GOI will submit to the Bank for its review and comments: (i) not
later than September 30 each year, a coordinated work program and
cost estimates for the project for the following fiscal year; and
(ii) by December 31 each year, coordinated budget proposals for the
agreed provincial work programs;



(h) GOI will carry out a technical audit every year, starting not later
than April 1, 1996, after reviewing with the Bank the terms of
reference for it; and
(i) vehicles and fertilizers required for the project will be provided
by GOI in accordance with a schedule agreed with the Bark.
15.       At negotiations Government's agreement has been obtained to the
following conditions for loan disbursement:
(a) disbursements against expenditures on agricultural labor for
coconut planting will be made only after completion of the previous
year'. cadastral surveys; and
(b) disbursements against expenditures for civil works and agricultural
inputs will be made only after the vehicles and fertilizer,
respectively, required for the first project year ha7e been
provided by GOI.
16.       Benefits.  The project would directly improve the incomes of about
32,000 poor families, including about 4,500 families ir. local farms adjoining
the tree crop development area within the 20 schemes, by some 100 percent to
200 percent through increased agricultural production and enhanced on-farm
employment opportunities. It would also assist GOI in developing new
approaches for managing its coastal zones and ensuring an environmentally
sound approach to development in settled swamp areas. The project's economic
rate of return is estimated at 15 percent.
17.       Risks.  The main potential project risks include:  (a) lack of
integration of infrastructure improvements with agricultural deve opment
activities; (b) slow progress in the farmers' adoption of the proposed
technological improvements; and (c) lapses in O&M of water management
infrastructure. With a focus on inter-agency coordination, provision of
improved agricultural support services (adaptive research, extension and input
financi-ig), promoting farmer groups' participation in project activities and
O&M, and improved O&M of the water control infrastructure, the project has
been designed to minimize these risks.
18.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and !ecommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

Project (Loan 2431-IND), Draft
/a Project processing took th.ke years which is more than the norm for
similar projects in Indonesia. This was due to the amount of effort
needed to ensure that the proposed project drew on the lessons learned
from the pravious two projects and to incorporate measures into the design
of the project to this effect.
This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission comprised of
Messrs. H. van Voorthuizen (Task Manager), G. Tumusiime, D. Leeuwrik,
R. Crooks, G. Temple, J. Pruntel, W. Soehendro (Bank) and S. Niaz (Consultant)
which visited Indonesia in January/February 1993. The Peer Reviewers were
Messrs. J. Cunningham (civil works) and K. Yeow (agriculture development) and
Ms. J. Aden (environmental aspects). Mri. M. Haug, Di-ector, EA3, and
Mr. A. Cole, Division Chief, EA3AG have idorsed the project.
