TELECOMMUNICATIONS REHABILITATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT MZD PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Lao People's Democratie Republic.
Implementing Agency: Ministry of Transport and Posts (MTP) and the
Entreprise d'Etat des Postes et Telecommunications du
Laos (EPTL).
Amount:               SDR 3.5 million ($3.9 million).
Terms:                 Standard.
Project Description:  The project is part of the investment program for the
posts and telecommunications sector during
1986-1990. The primary emphasis is on system
rehabllitation and management improvement.  The
project comprises: (a) rebabilitation and limited
expansion of the telecommunications network to
improve utilization of existing capacity; (b)
rehabilitation of the postal system; (c) improvement
of warehousing, repair and maintenance shops, and
strengthening of all other general support
facilities; and (d) technical assistance to provide
advice in all major management areas, notably: (i)
investment planning; (ii) financial management; (iii)
project engineering and coordination; (iv) operation
and maintenance; and (v) staff training.   Sector
reorganization is currently being implemented by
Government and vill be supported by this technical
assistance component.
Implementation
Period:               Jéne 1986 - December 1990
Project Benefits
and Risks:            The project vill benefit all sectors of the lao
economy. Telecommunications are more efficient in
terms of capital, energy consumption and user time
than the scarce alternative of transportation. The
principal risks associated vith the project are
delayed physical implementation and institutional
objectives being achieved less fully or more slowly
than anticipated. However, these risks are contained
at acceptable levels by inclusion of a large
technical assistance component to be financed by
UNDP.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE FXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT £0 THE
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR A TELECOMMHNICATIONS REHABILITATION
AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECr
1. *I submit the folloving report and recommendation on a proposed
developuent credit on standard IDA terus to the Lao People's Dem»cratic
Republic for SDR 3.5 million, equivalent to US$3.9 million, to help finance
a telecommunications rehabilitation and technical assistance project. The
UNDP has agreed to provide grant financing for the technical assistance
component of US$1.23 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A Country Economic Memorandum report (No. 4125-LA, dated
September 2, 1983) vas distributed to the Executive Directors. It revieved
recent economic developments and prospects for economic growth during the
1981-85 period. A new Country Economie Memorandum is under preparation.
Development Constraints
3.        The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is a landlocked
country with an area of 236,800 sq. 'km. With an estimated per capita
income of approximately $191 in 1983, it is one of the poorest countries in
the vorld, despite considerable resources of land, timber and minerals, and
its potential for hydroelectric pover. Most of the country's 3.6 million
people live in small and scattered villages. The structure of production
and employment is dominated by agriculture, which accounts for about 55% of
GDP and provides about three-quarters of total employment. The predominant
crop is rice, which takes up more than 80% of the cultivated ares.
Forestry is the second most important activity, producing about 10% of
GDP. The industrial sector is very small, contributing no more than 3% of
GDP, and it consists mainly of tin and gypsum mining, electricity
production, small enterprises processing local raw materials, particularly
food and wood, and consumer good industries serving largely the Vientiane
area. The other productive sectors - construction, transport and trade -
also provide only a small share of GDP.
4.        At such loW levels of production, the LPDR consumes virtually all
it produces, generates few exports and has very low national savings, vith
the result that it is almost totally dependent upon external assistance to
finance its development program. This dependence is reflected in a current
account deficit ranging between 9 and 17Z of GDP in recent years and an
import bill of vhich only about 30% is covered by exports. The



-2-
deficit has been financed by external assistance amounting to approximately
$100 million per annum in 1982-84. About 50-70Z of total aid originates
from socialist countries.
5.        The major development constraints facing the country are its
landlocked position, inadequate internal and external communication
networks, a critical shortage of skilled manpower and consequently weak
economic management. The pattern of suall, scattered population settle-
ments also impedes the realization of some economies of scale in production
and results in higa per capita costs for economic and social infrastruc-
ture.
Recent Economie Developments
6.        The country's inherent development constraints have been
amplified by twenty years of var, which caused serious damage and inhibited
the development of the economy. For the Government, established in 1575,
development problems were compoun_ed by a sudden decline in foreign
assistance, the emigration of a large number of its skilled and
well-educated citizens, a large decline in agricultural output in 1975-77
due to bad weather, and the need to resettle a large proportion of the
population. After an initial period of economic decline in 1975-77, the
Governuent gave greater attention to economic management and the long-term
development needs of the economy vithin the context of a socialist society.
7.        Partly as a result of good veather and of the measures
implemented in 1978-81, including devaluation of the kip and creation of
incentives to encourage production and domestie and export trade, the
economy experienced considerable growth in 1978-81, albeit trom the low
1977 base. GDP increased at about 7% per annum in real terms led by the
agricultural sector and, in particular, by the 11% per annum increase in
paddy production. In four years, the LPDR achieved self-sufficiency
whereas it earlier imported about 20% of food requirements. Considerable
growth vas also achieved in forestry, industry and external trade. During
that period, the Government succeeded in reducing the budget deficit by
increasing domestic revenue as a proportion of GNP and restricting the
growth of expenditures.
8.        The improvements in domestic economic activity were »ot
accompanied by improvements in the balance of payments. Exports rose
rapidly from a very low base until 1979 but fell in 1979-81, while imports
rose nearly continuously. As a result, the large current account deficits
(26Z of GDP in 1981) had to be financed from external assistance and the
country's meagre foreigu reserves. One positive feature, however, has been
a switch in the structure of importa away from food towards raw materials
and capital goods.
9.        During the 1981-83 period, the growth rate of the economy slowed
domn continuously from 6.8% in 1981 to 1.2Z in 1983, as agricultural output
vas adversely affected by poor weather in 1982-83. However, paddy
production rose rapidly in 1984-85 thus leading to a strong economic



-3-
recovery with GDP groving at about 92 p.à. in 1984-85. In addition to
favorable veather, the rise in agricultural output vas due to a large
increase in procurement for paddy and the promotion of improved cultivation
techniques. In the other sectors, improvement vas siover. In the
industrial sector, output did not Increase in 1981-84 mainly as the result
of shortages of imported raw materials, inadequate management and
inadequate production lncentives.
10.       These developments affected, and vere reflected in, the
goverument budget. After a sharp increase in the growth rate of goverument
expenditures by 180% in current terms in 1982, government expenditures grev
much slouer (24Z p.a.) in 1982-84 in large part as a result of cutbacks in
capital expenditures. Government revenues followed a somewhat similar
pattern, although in 1982-84 they increased at a faster rate than
government expenditures. As a consequence, the overall budgetary deficit
declined from 19Z of GDP in 1982 to about 11% of GDP by 1984.
il.       In 1985, however, the Government began implementing a series of
measures focussed on adjusting prices, vages and the management of public
enterprises. First, official prices for a number of commodities vere
raised by 300Z on average to eliminate food consumption subsidies; and
second, vages vere adjusted by increasing the average rate for government
employees by about 250% and introducing a system of bonuses in the
deterioration of wages; and third, concerning the management of public
enterprises. The main measures were (a) instructing public enterprises to
adjust prices on the basis of costs of production; (b) alloving public
enterprises to engage directly in internal and external trade; and (c)
allowing public enterprises a greater freedom in determining their
production, investment and employment targets. Although the results of
these policy changes cannot yet be fully assessed, preliminary indicators
are that they already are having a Positive impact on productivity, on
production, and on merchandise exports.
12.       Externally, after a near doubling of exports in current dollars
in 1982 due to increased electricity sales to Thailand, exports stagnated
in 1982-83, but increased slightly in 1984 due to off forestry products and
coffee.  At the sane time, the growth rate of imports (in current dollars)
declined rapidly from 21% in 1982 to 3% in 1984 so that the trade deficit
remained at the saine level in 1984 ($109 million) as in 1983. Overall, the
current account deficit vas reduced slightly from S96 million in 1983 to
$85 million in 1984 due to increased official transfers from the
nonconvertible area.
13.      At the end of 1984, disbursed external debt amounted to $413
million of which about $288 million vas owed to the nonconvertible currency
area. In recent years, loan disbursements from the convertible currency
area have been due to multilateral organizations while bilateral aid from
the same area has been in the form of grants. In 1985, debt service
payments to the convertible currency area (including repayments to the IHF)
rose to about 40% of exports of goods and services to the convertible
currency area as a result of a temporary rise in debt repayments to the
IMF.



-4-
Development Prospects
14.       The LPDR has considerable economic potential because of its
resource base of land, timber, minerals and hydroelectric pover. Rovever,
the development of these resources vill require very large capital lnvest-
ments in infrastructure and productive facilities. Growth of the economy
vill depend primarily on the ability of the country to increase expotts and
to obtain external financing for development projects. The absorbtive
capacity of the economy will also have to be increased by expanding infra-
structure and the communications network, by augmenting skilled manpover
resources and by increasing the efficiency of the state sector. Further-
more, and most importantly, attaining these objectives vill depend greatly
upon the maintenance of a government policy framework which stimulates
production and trade by farmers, forest vorkers, artisans and traders.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       The Lao People's Democratic Republic (then known officially as
Laos) became a member of the Bank in July 1961 and of the Association in
October 1963. The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's sixth opera-
tion in the country. Prior to 1975, the Bank Group's contacts with the
LPDR vere limited. Rowever, in 1966, at the request of the Covernuent and
bilateral donors, the Bank agreed to act as the administrator of the Nam
Ngum hydroelectric scheme located about 80 km north of Vientiane. The
project vas successfully completed in 1972 and has been expanded with
assistance from various sources since that time. In April 1975, the Bank
co-sponsored an Aid Group meeting on the country, chaired by the Asian
Development Bank. In early 1976, after the political transition and the
establishment of the Republic, the new Government requested IDA to begin
lending operations.
16.       Five IDA credits have been made to the LPDR to date, totalling
$53 million. The first two projects (Credit 760-LA for $8.2 million signed
on January 5, 1978 and Credit 924-LA for $10.4 million signed on June 15,
1979) zoncentrated on two major goals: (i) increasing rice production by
expanding the area under irrigation, increasing seed production and
supporting cooperative farming vith appropriate technical packages; and
(ii) enlarging pork production through the establishment of a large
food grain and pig multiplication unit. The third IDA assisted project
(Credit 1021-LA for $13.4 million signed on May 22, 1980) also supported
these objectives, but extended rice production support to Savannakhet and
Champassak Provinces in the south and financed the rehabilitation of agro
processing industries (rice mills and coffee processing) and equipment
vorkshops. The fourth credit (Credit 1197-LA for $15 million signed on
March 3, 1982) provided for the installation of a fifth turbine generator
at the Nam Ngum hydropover plant to promote increased export earnings for
the LPDR through electricity sales to Thailand. An Agricultural Production
Support Credit (Credit 1395-LA for $6.2 million signed on January 10, 1984)
vas designed to complement the investments made under the previous agricul-
tural credits and to address some of the institutional bottlenecks in the
overall implementation of agriculture projects. Project implementation



- 5-
has been slover than expected due in part to veak project management and to
lack of coordination among responsible agencies. Lessons dravw from
problems encountered under the agriculture projects are pertinent to future
projects: project design should be kept simple, adequate resources should
be devoted to strengthening of institutions, and substantial IDA supervi-
sion inputs should be provided.
17.       The Bank Group's relationship vith the LPDR has been gradually
strengthened. The approval of the five IDA credits, the work of the
economic missions in 1978, 1981, 1982, and 1985, and the appraisal of the
proposed project have created an atmosphere of increased understanding
between IDA and the Goverrment. A generally sound basis for IDA operations
has been established, and progress is being made on building a pipeline of
projects in additional key sectors, such as transport and education, where
investment is needed to facilitate grovth of the economy.
18.       Experience with other countries at a comparable level of develop-
ment indicates that a long and sustained effort by the Bank Group vill be
required before Government will be able to make fully effective and broader
use of Bank Group resources.  The Bank Group strategy therefore is three-
fold: (a) to concentrate on ensuring that existing IDA-supported projects
are properly implemented and that the benefits from these investments are
realized as rapidly as possible; (b) to undertake a carefully focused
program of economic and sector work designed to improve our understanding
of the economy and to enrich our dialogue with Government
on issues of policy and management of the economy; and (c) to identify and
prepare a suitable pipeline of projects in sectors that support the goals
of the Government's five year plan and provide a vehicle through which
policy and institutional discussions can be held.  In its economic vork,
the Bank Group is cooperating with the International Monetary Fund.
19.       The LPDR faces substantial difficulties in mounting a sustained
development effort and in mobilizing resources to finance productive
investments. Opportunities vill be sought to coordinate IDA activities,
both in project preparation and financing, with bilateral and other multi-
lateral aid programs. Nevertheless, all operations in LPDR are likely to
require relatively large commitments of staff time and finance for a high
percentage of total project costs.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background
20.       Efficient telecommunications services are important for  stimu-
lating economic development and for reducing transport costs in the Lao
PDR.  In the absence of usable roads in most of the country, a functioning
telecommunications system is of critical importance and the obvious least
cost solution to urgent communications problems. With such a system, the
efficiency of transportation can be increased through coordination of
vehicle use and substitution of travel, resulting in energy savings and
greater efficiency of productive interaction. It will facilitate the



- 6 -
extension to rural areas of health, education, and government services. It
vill al8o improve the functioning of markets by expediting and extending
access to information needed to increase productivity in agriculture and
industry and to develop trade.
21.       Largely as a result of neglect, var and the lack of trained
personnel, the Lao PDR has one of the poorest telecommunications systems in
the world in terms of equipment, access to service, quality of service and
sector organization. A national network does not exist, since many of the
principal cities are not interconneuLed. Equipment is frequently vorn,
poorly maintained or obsolete and spare parts are difficult to obtain.
Telephone density at 0.15 telephones per 100 inhabitants is one of the
lowest in the world. Quality of service is characterized by frequent
outages and radio interference. The sector is highly fragmented, consist-
ing of seventeen provincial enterprises. Qualified staff are scarce and
basic sector data are not readily available.
Sector Organization
22.       Domestic and international posts and telecommunications (P&T)
services in the Lao PDR are state monopolies. The Ministry of Transport
and Posts (HTP) supervises the sector through a Vice-Minister for P&T.
Most private and public sector requirements for telecommumications services
are met, in principle, by P&T networks. Hovever, some entities (e.g., the
national pover company, air transportation, defense, security, transport,
forests and other organizations) operate private radio circuits under
license from MTP. Radio & television are operated by the National
Committee of Press, Radio Broadcasting and Television.
23.       From 1975 to 1982, P&T services vere an integral part of each
provincial administration. In 1982, they were reorganized into 17 autono-
mous provincial P&T enterprises. Each enterprise is headed by a director
reporting both to the provincial administration and directly to the Vice
Minister for P&T. The Vice Minister is assisted by the Directors for
Telecommunications, Posts and Finance within the Ministry. Provincial
enterprise directors consult vith the provincial administrations on
personnel matters, but the relationship in operational matters is of an
informative nature only. The current organization chart is shown in
Annex 3.
24.       Investment proposals made by individual P&T enterprises are
centralized by MTP and submitted to the Council of Ministers as part of
MTP's budget.  Folloving budget approval, investment funds are allocated to
the provincial enterprises. Relatively large investments are handled
directly by the Telecommunications Department of MTP and are part of the
National Development Plan.  The Lao PDR has no telecommunications manufac-
turing industry; all equipment has to be imported.
25.       Starting about 1980, a consensus began to emerge within the
Government on the need to improve sector organization and management.  This
vas also underscored by IDA during project preparation. Given the need to



rapidly improve service, the Government decided in 1985 to merge all P&T
enterprises into a single autonomous state enterprise, the Enterprise
d'Etat des Postes et Telecommunications du Laos (EPTL). EPTL vas legally
established as from January 1, 1986, with MTP remaining the regulatory
authority. The proposed organization is similar to that of other
autonomous state enterprises, such as Electricite du Laos (EDL). In
contrast to EDL, however, EPTL is responsible for distribution of service
to the user level. This requires specific regulations with regard to the
type and quality of service, financial management and administration. The
technical assistance component of the proposed project is designed to
support this sector reorganization.
26.       EPTL's statutes were reviewed during negotiations.  These
documents are satisfactory and vill enable EPTL to be managed and operated
on a commercial basis and with considerable autonomy. During negotiations,
assurances vere obtained that EPTL's Director General and principal
department managers vill be appointed by December 1, 1986, and that EPTL's
internal regulations will be issued by December 31, 1986.
Staffing
27.       As of end-1985, the combined P&T enterprises had a total staff of
about 1,500, of whom 700 vere for telecommunications and 800 for posts.
The ratio of 120 staff per 1,000 DELs in service is very high but not
uncommon in countries vith comparable levels of development and with
overhead lines in remote and rugged terrain. The staff ratio is expected
to improve to about 80 by 1991 as more subscribers are connected and
recruitment is controlled. This ratio vould be one of the principal
performance indicators to be monitored during implementation (para 61).
28.       There is a serious shortage of trained staff at all levels and in
ail areas. The majority of staff only receive on-the-job training. The
existing training school (Centre National de Formation des
Telecommunications') can accommodate up to 120 students. In 1984, training
was improved and strengthened vith ITU assistance under UNDP financing. A
project coordinator and tuo experts provide basic technical and
administrative training (para 48). These arrangements are satisfactory.
UNDP will review the progress of the ongoing training program by end 1986
and decide upon extension and curriculum adjustments as necessary.
Existing Facilities
29.       Existing telecommunications facilities are summarized in Annex 4
and described in detail in Annex 5. Although total installed telephone
exchange capacity as of the end of 1985 vas 8,159 telephone lines (DELs),
only about 5,900 DELs (73%) can actually be used, and all are in service.
This de facto 100% exchange fill has resulted in unacceptable exchange
congestion, which contributes to the poor quality of service. Local line
networks consist essentially of overhead lines using unsupported field
wires. Subscriber outside plant is generally in ver7 poor condition.
Domestic long distance circuits are operated manually and during the day



- 8 -
ouly. Much of this equipment is obsolete and spares can no longer be
obtained. Telex service is available in Vientiane only. Total telex
exchange capacity is 190, but only 40 subscribers are connected.
International telephone and telex facilities are limited but adequate for
current traffic.
Accese to Service
30.      The average density of only 0.15 DELs per 100 inhabitants is far
below the regional average (1.63), and is comparable to that of the poorest
countries. Even in Vientiane, which has 65% of all telephone lines, the
density is only 2.85 lines per 100 inhabitants. Limited telephone service
is available in all 16 provincial capitals and in 67 so-called autonomous
cities (OMuong'). In the largest four provincial capitals, the number of
DELs ranges f rom 75 to 210; in the remaining 12 capitale the average is 50
DELs; and in those Muong where service is provided, the average is about
15 DELs. Nationvide, only about 16% of the population has access to
telephone service.
31.       Government accounts for 77Z of total DELs in service, residences
for 20Z, and embassies and international organizations for 3%. Many
telephones classified as residential are also used for business purposes,
and a significant percentage of Government DELs is used by public sector
enterprises. A conservative estimate would put business usage at about 40%
of total traffic.
32.       Although expressed unsatisfied demand for service is only about
1,000 lines, suppressed demand is much larger because: (a) people know
that it is virtually impossible to get a telephone; (b) those who are
willing to face an indefinite waiting period are discouraged from signing
an to the waiting list because P&T cannot give an indication of delivery
time; (c) the quality of service is poor; and (d) no attempt has been made
to measure demand in those parts of the country that presently have no
service.
Quality of Service
33.       The quality of service is as poor as the access to it.  In the
five cities with automatic exchanges, only local calls can be switched
automatically. Long distance -and international calls (the latter possible
from Vientiane only) have to be booked through an operator. In the 12
provincial capitals with manual exchanges, interurban calls can be made
only to Vientiane and from the local exchange switchboard or public call
station, not from customer premises. In the 67 Muong, only local calls can
be made. Thus, a basic integrated national network does not exist, and
most calls can be made only after long delays.
34.       In addition, almost every telephone is out of order for extensive
periode of time, on average twice a year. Even during the dry season, most
calls are disturbed by heavy cross-talk, frequent interruption, ionospheric
disturbance and radio interference from transmissions in other countries.



-9-
There are no reliable statistice on fault rates and other service quality
indicators. Development of such a data base is part of the technical
assistance component of the proposed project (para 47).
Postal Service
35.       Rehabilitation, modernization and extension of all postal facili-
ties ij also urgently required. Practically no means of transportation are
available to the postal service. Construction of the main post office and
mail handling installations in Vientiane vas started in 1975 and never
completed. Administrative and operational services share the same
congested buildings, thus impeding efficient service. Some provincial
towns have no postal buildings, and facilities are shared with other
Governnent agencies.
36.       As in the case of telecommunications, access to postal service
outside the provincial capitals is limited. Mail transport on Internation-
al routes to and from Vientiane and on the various inland routes is slov,
hampered by the scarcity and poor condition of roads, the shortage of
vehicles and the limited capacity of the domestic air transport system. To
compensate for this, the postal service developed a relatively efficient
river transport system, which covers all principal post offices (most
important cities are located at or near a river that is navigable with
small motor boats). However, it may still take up to a month for mail to
reach the m st distant locations.
37.       Nevertheless, the postal service is relatively well organized.
In Vientiane, with 7 post offices, and in the 16 provincial capitals, there
are Class I post offices; in 33 of the Muong there are Class II, and in 29
of the district headquarters Clase III post offices. Clss I and Il
provide: (a) inland and international letter, parcel and small packet
post; (b) inland mail and telegraphic money orders; (c) mail and telegraph-
ic noney orders to and from France; and (d) philatelic service. Class III
offices provide only inland and International letter mail service. In
Vientiane the mail is distributed twice a day, and in provincial capitals
once a day.
Sector Constraints
38.       The principal sector constraints are institutional, physical and
financial. The institutional constraint is the shortage of qualified
managerial,technical and administrative staff at all levels; the
organizational veakness is being addressed through the sector restructuring
nov undervay. There are only ten qualified telecommunications engineers in
the entire P&T system, and no qualified accountants. The physical
constraint is an old, poorly maintained telecommunications system in rugged
terrain, combined with considerable transportation probleme. The financial
constraint is the scarcity of resources for telecoomunications
developuent. This reflecte both the low priority given to
telecommunications in the past due to a lack of foreign exchange, and the
past lack of clear financial performance targets for the sector.

Sector Goals
(a) Telecommunications
39.       Under the draft second five year plan (1986-1990), Government has
made rehabilitation and expansion of telecommunications facilities a
priority in order to upgrade service and satisfy essential requirements.
To this end: (a) existing exchange and network facilities should be fully
rehabilitated; and (b) where justified by the amount of traffic, interurban
links should be restored or established between Vientiane, the provincial
capitals, the Muong, and the various economic and agricultural development
centers in the country, by 1990.  Rehabilitation and limited expansion of
facilities would increase total exchange capacity by about 50%, and lines
in service from 5,900 iin 1985 to about 9,000 in 1990. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that Government/EPTL will not, vithout prior
consultation with IDA, undertake in any one year additional capital
expenditures exceeding 10% of its investment program expenditures in that
year.
(b) Posts
40.      The sector goal for the postal system is to provide service to all
cities and towns down to district headquarters level, and to upgrade
existing facilities. This implies expansion and modernization of
Vientiane's main post office, and construction of an additional 30 post
offices throughout the country, bringing the total to 125.
(c) Institutional
41.       Additional sector goals are improved management through the
recent sector reorganization, and improved financial performance.
Recognizing the commercial nature of P&T, the Government decided in January
1985 that the P&T enterprises' operating revenues should cover operating
expenses and minor capital expenditures, thus ending provincial budget
support for these purposes. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that EPTL will finance from net internal cash generation at least 20% of
its average annual capital expenditures, starting in 1988. This target may
have to be modified as financial accounts become available in 1988 (para
58).
IDA's Strategy and Rcle
42.       Given the constraints affecting the sector, IDA's strategy is to
finance only the most urgent needs and, through technical assistance, to
support sector reorganization, management improvement and development of
the technical and fiuancial data base necessary for efficient operation and
future investments. System rehabilitation and limited expansion to improve
utilization are obviously necessary and justified, but sustained efforts
are needed to ensure that maintenance vill be brought to a level that vill
prevent future deterioration of the network. In a possible follow-up
project this emphasis would remain, but the focus would shift towards



- il -
system expansion and modernization (para 47). Government initiatives to
reorganize the sector and correct serious management problems go in the
right direction. Rovever, given the scarcity of managers and the lack of
expertise, these decisions can only be implemented vith the aid of
technical assistance, which vill be provided under the proposed project.
IDA can provide the sector with sustained support, a broad advisory
approach that covers financial and managerial as vell as technical aspects,
and access to equipment at competitive prices. IDA brings vide experience
to this task, obtained in other countries vith problems similar to those
facing Lao PDR.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
General
43.      The proposed prolect vas prepared in consultation between
Government and IDA. Folloving an exploratory IDA sector mission, agreement
vas reached vith Government that priority should be given to sector
reorganization and immediate rehabilitation and limited expansion of P&T
services throughout the country. The project covers only the most obvious
high priority items and is.included in the draft 1986-90 National
Development Plan. Government officially presented the project to IDA in
September 1984, vith a request for financing.  In early 1985, Government
asked UNDP to cofinance the technical assistance required under the
project. IDA missions appraised the project in January and July, 1985 and
negotiations vith Government were held in Vientiane from February 10
through 18, 1986 . The Lao delegation vas headed by the Vice-Minister of
Transport and Posts, responsible for the telecommunications subsector. Due
to the paucity of technical and financial data, and the fact that this is
essentially a rehabilitation and technical assistance project, a separate
appraisal report is not being issued.  A credit and project summary appears
at the beginning of this report, and supplementary data are given in
Annexes 3 through 11.  A map is attached (IBRD 19064).
Project Objectives
44.       The project aims at:
(a)   rehabilitating existing equipment to ensure optimal
functioning and to improve essential postal and
telecommunications services;
(b)   promoting efficient operation and maintenance of the
rehabilitated systems;
(c)   providing limited expansion of the telecommunications and
postal systems;
(d)   helping implement sector reform and institutional
development through technical assistance; and



- 12 -
(e)   improving financial management and performance by
introducing an appropriate accounting system and setting
financial performance targets that require increased
operating efficiency.
Through implementation of this project, most sector goals (paras 39-41)
would be met.
Project Description
45.       The project is part of the 1986-90 P&T investment program.  It is
of the highest priority due to the poor condition of existing facilities
and the lack of alternative means of communication.  It comprises the
following components:
(a) Rehabilitation of:
(W)   the telephone exchanges in Vientiane and the four main
provincial capitals (Luang Prabang, Pakse, Savannakhet, and
Thakhek). Siniultaneously, exchange capacity vould be
increased from 4,000 to 5,000 lines in Vientiane and from an
average of about 200 lines to 750 lines la the provincial
capitals; and
(il) the local cable network in Vientiane, through replacement
(60Z) and repair (40Z); replacement of excessively long and
vulnerable overhead lines by cables in the four major
provincial capitals; and limited extension of subscriber
cable networks and outside plant to match the rehabilitated
existing exchange capacity;
(b) Provision of:
(i)   duplex HF radid circuits for telephony and telex between
Vientiane and the four provincial capitals with automatic
exchanges, and transfer of their present equipment to other
provincial capitals;
(ii)   1F radio circuits for telephone and telegraph links between
Vientiane and some provincial capitals, and between
provincial capitals and smaller cities;
(iii) equipment for the relocated HF radio receiving station in
Vientiane and a buried cable between the new station and the
Vientiane telephone exchange;
(iv) suall manual and automatic telephone exchanges in suall
cities;
(v)   equipment for regional maintenance centers in Luang Prabang
and Savannakhet, establishment of a warehouse for cables and



- 13 -
other materials ïn Vientiane, and improvement of existing
repair shops; snd
(vi)   specialized vehicles, machinery, accessories and tools for
construction/maintenance of the networks and for postal
services, power supply, air conditioning, building and
accounting equipment, and supplies/equipment to carry out
the project and for training;
(c) Construction of:
(i)   a relocated HF radio receiving station in Vientiane; and
(ii)   buildings and facilities for posts in Vientiane, and 30
additional post offices to extend the postal network;
(d) Technical Assistance and Training consisting of:
(i)   foreign experts (90 manmonths) to advise EPTL in finance and
accounting, project engineering and implementation,
investment planning, operation, maintenance and training;
and
Cii)   overseas fellovships for EPTL staff (40 manmonths).
The breakdown and summary costs are given in Annex 6. The implementation
period is June 1986 to December 1990 (Annex 7).
Technical Assistance
46.       Due to the lack of expertise and experience of P&T management and
staff, technical assistance is indispensable to program implementation and
sector reform. Technical assistance would cover all major areas of
weakness and is divided into long-term and short-term assistance. UNDP has
agreed to provide grant financing for this project component at an
estimated cost of $1.23 million, with UNDP's Office of Project Execution
(OPE) as executing agency. During negotiations, assurances vere obtained
that EPTL will employ consultants in accordance witn the agreed terms of
reference and implementation schedule. Approval by Government of the
consultants selected is a condition of credit effectiveness.
47.       The sector lacks managers experienced in running a nationwide
enterprise in a sector that needs to be rehabilitated, expanded and
operated on a commercial basis. Management expertise is slim and untested
in Vientiane, and probably even more so in the provinces. Under the
proposed project, two senior experts would be provided for three years each
to advise and assist EPTL in: (a) medium and long term planning,
coordination and implementation, operation and maintenance; and (b)
financial management, accounting, billing and collection, management



- 14 -
information and tariffs.  These experts vould also provide, in their
respective fields, staff training and advice on organizational matters. An
important task of the experts vill be to identify potential managers at all
levels and to provide them vith on-the-job training. Short-term experts
are necessary to advise and assist on detailed technical planning,
procurement, installation acceptance, operation and maintenance, and
relevant field training (Annex 6, page 2). The technical assistance under
this project would alo cover assistance in the preparation of the next
phase of the investuent program, including a survey of requirements and
feasibility studies, to be ready by the end of 1987. This next phase could
possibly include installation of a microwave system and related investments
in local telephone systems where justified by demand.
Training
48.       Under the proposed project, UNDP vill also finance 40 manmonths
of fellowships ($180,000). The UNDP financed experts (paras 46 and 47)
vill advise on distribution of the fellovships, in agreement with EPTL, to
maximize benefits from the ongoing training program (para 28). On-the-job
training vill also occur by assigning suitable counterparts to the
experts. These arrangements are satisfactory.
Proiect Cost and Financing
49.       The total project cost is estimated at $7.75 million, consisting
of $6.40 million for equipment and installation, and $1.35 million for
technical assistance. The foreign exchange component is $4.29 million,
including $3.06 million for equipment and $1.23 million for expert and
support services and fellovships. Details of the project components and
costs are shown in Annex 6. A summary of project costs and the financing
plan is provided below:

50.       The proposed IDA credit of SDR 3.5 million ($3.9 million) vill
finance 67% of the foreign exchange cost of imported goods and services
totaling $2.9 million and 30Z of total local costs, up to a maximum of
$1.010 million. The percentage of local cost financing corresponds to the
estimated foreign component of the local cost of IDA-financed project
items. These local costs consist essentially of civil works for buildings,
subscriber outside plant and local network construction. Technical
assistance vith a foreign exchange component of $1.23 million (29Z of total
foreign costs) for consulting services, fellowships and support services,
vill be financed by UNDP. All remaining local costs of $2.45 million
equivalent and 4% of foreign costs vill be financed by Government/EPTL.
51.       Base prices used for equipment and installation are at end-1985
level. Price contingencies are based on standard cost increases averaging
7X in 1986 and 1987; 7.5% in 1988; 7.7% in 1989; 7.6% in 1990; and 4.5X in
1991-93 for foreign costs and 12% per annum for local costs. Because the
project still requires a diagnosis of the detailed rehabilitation
requirements, physical contingencies of 10% for foreign costs and 15% for
local costs of equipment, works and services have been added to the base
cost.
Procurement

about 20 packages, financed by IDA, vill be procured by ICB in accordance
with IDA guidelines. The bid documents and contracts over $100,000, about
80% of the total, would be subject to prior IDA revieu. The remainder
would be subject to post-avard review by IDA. Negotiations vith original
suppliers, or their licensees, would be used to procure $700,000 of
equipment and spare parts to be financed by IDA. This procurement method
will result in prompt restoration to service of existing equipment and fin
standardized operation and maintenance. Prior IDA approval will be
required for negotiated contracts over $100,000 each, about 80% of the
total, to ensure that prices obtained are reasonably in line vith those
likely under ICB. Limited international bidding (LIB) vould be used to
procure about $200,000 of small specialized items with a limited number of
suppliers such as pover supply, measuring and construction equipment.
These items vould be grouped into packages of not less than $20,000 and
bids would be obtained from at least three suppliers from at least three



- 18 -
countries. Disbursements for LIB items of less than $20,000 would be made
against statements of expenditure (SOE). Local costs of SL.4 million in
IDA-financed items cover buildings and other civil and structural works,
minor supplies and services. Procurement in the Lao PDR vill be in
accordance with local procedures which are acceptable to IDA. Civil works,
comprising two-thirds of local costs, would be undertaken by state-owned
construction enterprises, the only ones locally available.
Disbursements
54.        The IDA credit will be disbursed against full standard documen-
tation (or suimmaries in the case of disbursements against SOE) on the basis
of:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures on civil works,
equipment (including installation), materials and
vehicles; and
(b) 30% of eligible local expenditures for civil works,
equipment (including installation), materials and
vehicles not to exceed SDR 900,000 ($1,010,000).
Governuent advised IDA that for contracts for goods, works and services
procured locally by EPTL which have an identifiable foreign component, the
cost of such component would be expressed in foreign currency for purposes
of disbursement of IDA funds. Corresponding expenditures estimated at
about 50Z of the contracts amounts vould be financed 100% under the
credit. Disbursements against other local expenditures expressed in local
currency (Kips) vill be based on 30% of such expenditures. Such
disbursements shall not exceed the equivalent of SDR 900,000 ($1,010,000).
In order to expedite disbursements, a Special Account will be established,
in US dollars, with a local bank in the name of EPTL. The initial deposit
in the account would be $300,000, equivalent to an average of three months
expenditures under all categories. For amounts less than $20,000,
disbursements vould be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOE). The
estimated disbursement achedule in Annex 8 is in line vith IDA's
disbursement experience in the East Asia and Pacific Region, resulting in a
disbursement period of eight years. Bowever, since this is a small and
relatively simple project, the project should norbaally be completed by
Deceimber 31, 1990 (para 45), and the closing date would be June 30, 1991.
Project Implementation
55.       Government will be the Borrower of the proposed credit.  EPTL
will be the implementing agency. EPTL management and staff will be
assisted by the UNDP-financed experts in determining detailed
rehabilitation and expansion requirements, detailed project specifications,
and project implementation procedures. With assistance from the planning
expert, EPTL's project implementation unit vill issue tenders and follow up
on implementation and acceptance of the vorks. A meeting will be held in



- 19 -
the last quarter of 1987 between EPTL, IDA and UNDP to review progress made
in project start-up and procurement. Periodic review of progress made in
project implementation will be an integral part of performance monitoring
(para 61).
Financial Aspects
56.       Accounts.  Accounts are kept on a single-entry cash basis.  In
Vientiane these accounts appear reasonably well kept, although posts and
telecommunications expenses are not separated and a balance sheet is not
prepared. In the provinces, accounting is virtually nonexistent. The
accounting system is designed only for basic administrative control and
does not provide the financial information needed to manage an enterprise.
Moreover the data produced by the current system are unreliable. Under the
project, the long-term finance expert will prepare a basic accounting
manual and setting up a double-entry accrual accounting system. The system
vould separate posts and telecommunications revenues and expenditures,
establish an opening balance sheet and produce basic management information
and budget control systems. During negotiations, assurances vere obtained
that EPTL vill introduce an aecrual accounting system effective January 1,
1988.
57.       Audit.  In the past, P&T enterprises vere not subject to annual
external audits. Internal control is exercised by P&T's Control
Committee. NPT's Finance and Accounting Department also carries out
regular checks in Vientiane. During negotiations, assurances vere obtained
that EPTL vill submit to IDA: (a) income statements and such other
financial statements as vill become available in subsequent years, vithin
six months after the end of each fiscal year, starting with the results of
1987; and (b) complete and audited financial statements vithin nine months
after the end of each fiscal year, starting vith the results of 1988,
audited by external auditors acceptable to IDA.
58.       Financial Performance.  In the absence of adequate accounts, it
is not possible to establish the consolidated past financial performance of
the P&T enterprises or to prepare financial projections. It is believed
that the provincial enterprises have generally been operating at a loss,
while the Vientiane enterprise has turned in a surplus. There is growing
awareness in Government that P&T should be able to operate profitably on a
consolidated basis, transfer a share of the operating surplus to
Government, and finance part of investments from net internal cash
generation. This is a positive development and in line with Bank/IDA
policy in this sector. The financial covenant (para 41) represents a best
estimate of what might be feasible, given stated Government objectives. By
the end of 1988, actual sector performance will be known and financial
targets can be adjusted as appropriate.
59.       Billing and Collection.  Most subscribers are billed monthly for
local and long distance calls; in outlying areas, billing is bimonthly.
For international calls, private subscribers are billed every 10 days, and
are required to pay in dollars (except for government subscribers).
Disconnection procedures are in theory very strict: subscribers are allowed



- 20 -
only ten days after billing to settle the amounts due. In practice,
however, procedures are not rigorously applied. As of mid-1985, arrears
vere reportedly equivalent to about four months of billing, vith 60% of
unpaid bills being due from Governîent.  During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from Government that it vill reduce its telecommunications
arrears to a maximum of four months of billing by June 30, 1987 and that it
will promptly settle future bills. Also during negotiations, assurances
vere obtained that EPTL vill reduce arrears from non-Government subscribers
to two monthe of billing by the same date.
60.       Tariffs.  International telecommunications tariffs vere increased
by 50Z on February 1, 1983, and domestic tariffs by 400Z effective
September, 1984, and by an average of about 200Z effective October 1985.
At current official exchange rates ($1 - KN 10), the tariffs appear very
high. The telephone installation fee is $1,630 equivalent and the monthly
service charge about $100. Local calls cost $1.00 per call of unlimited
duration and interurban calls are $4.00 per minute, regardless of
distance. There is no peak/off peak pricing. Hovever, at free market
rates ($1 - KN 400), tariffs appear very low. A suumary of tariffs is
shown in Annex 9. Improvements in the tariff structure are desirable, but
a thorough tariff study should vait until good accounting and management
information systems are in place; such a study could be part of a follow-up
project. Hovever, the long-term experts vill advise EPTL on immediate
measures that can be taken to improve the tariff level and structure and
EPTL's financial performance.
Performance Monitoring
61.       Development of a technical and financial data base will be a
prime task of the long term experts. Performance monitoring indicators and
a project implementation schedule have been prepared (Annex 10 and Annex
7). In many cases, actual data are lacking and vill have to be provided by
EPTL during project implementation. The performance indicators for 1986
and 1987 and the project implementation schedule vere agreed upon during
negotiations as representing desirable and feasible targets. During
negotiations, assurances vere obtained that EPTL vill review by September
30 of each year, the performance indicators and the project implementation
schedule for the current year and the next year; present a copy if this
revieu to IDA; and take corrective measures if necessary.
Benefits and Return on Investment
62.       Improved telecommunications services vill ultimately benefit all
sectors of the Lao economy. Telecommmunications are undoubtedly more
efficient in terma of capital, energy consumption and user time than the
scarce alternative of transportation. With adequate telecommunications
facilities, the level and variety of productive communication can be
increased considerably, and activities which would not othervise be
feasible can be realized. Recognizing those benefits, Government has
accorded priority to rehabilitation and development of the sector.



- 21 -
63.       Telecommunications can be expected to play a significant role in
the Lao PDR, and vould support Government's concerted effort to develop the
economy and improve services. The project aims specifically at: (a)
extending access to information as needed to develop production, services
and regional trade; (b) increasing the efficiency of transportation through
coordination of vehicle use and substitution of travel, resulting in energy
savings; (c) facilitating the extension of health, education, governuent
administration, production and other services to rural areas; and (d)
mobilizing domestic savings by transferring part of the net income from
telecommunications operations directly or indirectly to Government.
64.       Government and business subscribers will benefit most from
rehabilitation and modest expansion of telecommunications service.
However, as the project would also rehabilitate and expand the local
telephone network outside Vientiane (about 40% of the total project cost),
the rural population will also benefit directly. The same argument applies
to expansion of the postal system.
65.       The agreed investment program represents the least-cost solution
for providing the planned service levels vithin the constraints imposed by
the configuration and technology of the existing telecommunications
network. The timing and dimensioning of various elements in the system are
based on generally accepted engineering practice for selection of
techniques and equipment after study of the feasible alternatives.
Return on Investment
66.       Internal financial and economic rates of return cannot be
calculated for this project due to the absence of basic financial data.
Rates of return for expansion programs in countries with similar levels of
development are on average about 15% (financial) and 23Z (economic)
respectively. However, since this is essentially a rehabilitation project,
rates of return are expected to be even higher.
Risks
67.       One source of risk is that the implementing agency (EPTL) faces a
major task in centralizing seventeen enterprises and establishing an
effective management system. This institutional risk is somewhat reduced
because the reorganization of the sector takes place during a period where
Government has announced overall economic reforms in this direction. A
second risk is that physical implementation may be delayed due to slowness
in getting the approvals needed in the procurement process. However, it is
felt that the technical assistance component should ease management
constraints and reduce time required for implementation. Combined with
frequent supervision by IDA, this should keep these risks dowm to an
acceptable level.



-22-
Environment and Realth Aspects
68.   No adverse environnental or health effects are expected as a result
of the project.. In fact, improved communications and savings on transport
should lead to benefits in both areas.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
69.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS REHABILITATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Existing Telecommunications Facillit!s
1.        The existing automatic telecommunicatlons network consists of
about 3,800 DELs in service in Vientiane and 900 DELs principally in the
four provincial towas of Luang Prabang, Pakse, Savannakhet and Tbakhek.
These electromechanical crossbar exchanges were installed during 1971-1978;
total installed capacity is about 5,900 DELs. The manual network consists
of about 1,200 DELs served by exchanges of 20-30 line capacity each in the
other 12 provincial capitals, and by even sumAller exchanges in 67 out of
the 100 "Huong throughout the country. Local line networks are partly
underground, up to about a mile from the exchanges in Vientiane, but
consist essentially of overhead lines using unsupported field vires.
Subscriber outside plant is generally in very poor condition.  All in all,
some form of telephone service is available in 84 towns in the country.
Though the exchange fill is theoretically oaly 73Z, de facto it is IOOZ.
This is because the total number of about 5,900 DELs in service represent
total usable capacity.
2.        Domestic long distance voice communication is by means of HF
links connecting Vientiane to 12 provincial capitals. All circuits are
operated manually and part time, during the day only. The equipment and
antennas used are obsolete and spares can no longer be obtained.
Consequently, the equipment cannot be adequately maintained and operated
and service is becoming increasingly unreliable.
3.        International telephone and telex service is provided through
four outlets: (a) a microvave link to Bangkok for trafflc to Thailand;
(b) a satellite link via Moscou for traffic to the USSR and several East
European countries; (c) an HF radio link to Hanoi for traffic to Vietnam;
and (d) an HF link via Hong Kong for traffic to other countries. Given the
relatively small amount of traffic, these arrangements are satisfactory.
Though relatively recently installed (between 1977 and 1982), the equipment
suffers from inadequate maintenance, lack of spare parts and difficult
operating conditions in dilapidated buildings. Also, many parts of the
heavily used link via Hong Kong are no longer manufactured and are
difficult and costly to maintain and operate.
4.        Domestie and international telegraph service is available in all
provincial capitals and in 75 Muong, 18 of which have no telephone
service. Telegrams are transmitted manually by morse code on HF radio

systems using diverse and obsolete equipment, operating on shared time
basis between Vientiane and the provinces. This can lead te long delays.
Though slow, the service is basically reliable.
5.        International telex service is available in Vientiane via a
manual exchange, in operation since 1980, vith capacity to connect about
190 subscribers: only 38 vere connected at the end of 1984. Demand for
additional connections cannot be satisfied at present due to the lack of
cable pairs. Also, a small electromechanical crossbar telex exchange,
installed in 1976 vith 80 lines capacity, has been out of service since
1980, due to lack of parts and accessories. Apart from cable faults, which
affect telex as much as telephone subscribers, the telex service functions
well.
