                  Partially Achieved. During the 2009/10 and 2011/12 cropping seasons, about 45
                  tons of foundation seed were produced, against a target of 60 tons. The target
                  was not achieved due to climatic conditions (floods) and not to any lack of
                  capacity at Koba research station. It is worth mentioning, however, that during
Comments          the 2011/12 cropping season, the government allocated exceptional funding out
                  of its own budget to support IRAG’s foundation seed production activities,
                  leading to the production of an additional 200 tons of basic seed. Of that
                  quantity, about 30 tons went to seed producers under the project. Thus in the end
                  the project had more than 60 tons of foundation seed for further multiplication.
                  Quantity of improved seed produced by seed producers purchased, certified,

              2,000 tons. Following the Banks’s re-engagement, there were difficulties with
              the procurement of the remaining fertilizer and the government agreed to provide
              1,000 tons of fertilizer for project activities which were to be refunded once the
Comments      procurement of the same quantity under the project was effective. Unfortunately,
              due to delays in completing the procurement process, the project could not
              acquire the 1,000 tons as initially planned, and in the end a total of 2,400 tons
              were available under the project. For this reason, the project exceeded the target
              in covering beneficiaries while procuring less fertilizer than originally envisaged.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Guinea is a low-income, food-deficit country of 10.2 million, which ranked 160
out of 175 countries in the United Nations Development Programme’s Human
Development Index for 2007. Over the past 15 years, Guinea has been plagued by
political instability. Starting in early 2000, the country has been strongly affected by
military conflicts in neighboring countries, including Liberia and Sierra Leone. Since
then Guinea’s economy has experienced low growth and double-digit inflation. In
January and February 2007, strikes and confrontations between security forces and
demonstrators in urban areas were partly caused by high food and fuel prices. As a result
of the 2008 global food crisis, consumer prices for food had risen rapidly in Guinea. The
price of a kilogram of imported rice in Conakry increased 96 percent from June 2007 to
June 2008. Similarly, the price of locally produced potatoes and palm oil increased
during the same period by about 80 and 64 percent, respectively, while annual inflation,
which had declined to 12.8 percent at the end of 2007 from 39.1 percent at the end of
2006, had rebounded to 24.6 percent at the end of June 2008.

2.      In light of these challenging developments, the Government of Guinea formulated
a strategy for responding to the food price crisis. The strategy had two main pillars: (i)
supporting access to food for the most vulnerable populations and (ii) supporting
increases in agricultural production. The pillar to improve access to food included: a
temporary reduction in rice customs duties from 12.75 to 2.75 percent; the distribution of
take-home food rations for children for families of five or more members; emergency
school feeding and nutrition support; and building an emergency food reserve of 25,000
metric tons. The pillar to increasing agricultural production included emergency support
in the 2008 planting season to supply fertilizer, improved seed, veterinary inputs; repair
and maintain agricultural assets; construct storage facilities; and build capacity in
agricultural services. The second pillar also included support over the medium to longer
term to intensify rice production and ensure a more stable national food supply through
investments in irrigation infrastructure and improved inputs, water management,
technology transfer, technical assistance to producers, and diversification of crop
production.

3.     Food insecurity is chronic in Guinea. Despite its strong agricultural potential, the
country imports approximately one-third of its rice needs. About 6 percent of households
are severely food insecure, 1 and 35 percent of the population consistently has problems
meeting minimum daily caloric requirements. The concern was that higher prices could
reduce the quantity and quality of food consumption and induce higher rates of acute
malnutrition, especially during the lean season prior to the harvest. The Bank proposed an
emergency program (the Guinea Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Program)

                                                   1
that focused on measures to address both the short-term as well as the medium- to long-
term implications of the global food crisis for Guinea. Guinea’s International
Development Association (IDA) program was limited and fully committed, so the
proposed interventions were financed out of the newly created Food Crisis Response
Trust Fund. The trust fund supplied US$ 5.0 million as a component of a US$ 10.0
million support to the Bank’s Guinea Emergency Food Crisis Response Program, which
consisted of a Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant (US$ 2.5 million) and an
additional financing to the Third Urban Development Project (US$ 2.5 million).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as
    approved)

4.      The development objective of the project was to increase smallholder rice
productivity on 35,000 hectares of rainfed rice through the timely provision of improved
inputs (seed, fertilizer, and pesticide) and technical advisory services. 2

5.      In line with this objective, three sets of activities were envisioned: (i) support for
the production of 2,000 tons of improved and certified seed during the 2008/09 cropping
season by scaling up the farmer seed network and purchasing, treating, and stocking the
seed for distribution during the 2009/10 cropping season; (ii) the purchase of 2,000 tons
of fertilizer and 20,000 liters of herbicide and pesticide; (iii) the distribution of input
packages (seed, fertilizer, herbicide/pesticide) though farmer organizations’ existing
networks, and the provision of support for advisory services and technical assistance to
smallholders.

6.      The Project Appraisal Document specified the following key outcome indicators:
(i) the rice yields of targeted smallholders increased by 30 percent; (ii) 70,000 of direct
project beneficiaries (of which 40 percent are female). The intermediate outcome
indicators were: (i) 2,000 tons of improved seed for rainfed rice systems (mangrove,
lowlands, and inland plains) produced, certified, purchased, treated, and stocked; (ii)
2,000 tons of fertilizer and 20,000 liters of herbicide and pesticide procured; and (iii)
70,000 smallholders have received input packages and adequate technical advisory
services.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

7.     The project PDO was not revised. However, to account for a likely positive effect
of an extended implementation period (more cropping seasons) and the availability of
additional improved seed recovered from producers, the key outcome indicators were
revised upward on February 11, 2011 while processing the extension of the project


2
  Note that the formulation of the PDO as it stands in the financing agreement differs from the one found in
the PAD, in which the development objective of the project was to produce 2,000 tons of certified seed
through a smallholder seed multiplication network and provide input packages and technical assistance to
80,000 smallholders to increase their productivity on 40,000 hectares of rainfed rice.

closing date. 3 The project was initially planned to be implemented only for the 2008/09
cropping season. Disbursements were frozen, however, when the World Bank policy
regarding de facto governments (OP 7.30) went into effect in December 2008, following
the military coup. When the OP 7.30 was lifted on January 19, 2011, the project had
disbursed only US$ 2.0 million out of the original US$ 5.0 million Grant. Extension of
the closing date to June 30, 2012 was necessary to complete project activities and achieve
the PDO.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.     The project focused its interventions on Guinea’s three major rice-producing
areas: Lower Guinea (Boke, Boffa, Dubreka, Forecariah, and Kindia), Upper Guinea
(Kourroussa, Faranah, Kankan, Kerouane, Mandiana, and Siguiri), and Forest Guinea
(Beyla, Guedeckou, Kissidougou, Macenta, Lola, and Nzerekore). About 90,000
smallholders were expected to benefit from project interventions. The Agricultural
Research Institute of Guinea (Institut de Recherche Agronomique de Guinée, IRAG),
National Agency of Agricultural Advisory Services (Agence Nationale de Promotion
Rurale et du Conseil Agricole, ANPROCA), government seed centers, as well as the
ministry in charge of agriculture received operational support under the project. Finally,
input suppliers, local traders, and transporters were expected to benefit indirectly from
increased rice production and trade.

9.      To ensure that the poorer farmers would benefit from the project, especially from
inputs distributed by the National Confederation of Farmer Organizations of Guinea
(Confédération Nationale des Organisations Paysannes de Guinée, CNOP-G), high
priority was given to smallholders who had less than two hectares and were members of
producer organizations. The rationale was to give each beneficiary access to a sufficient
package of inputs while reaching the largest possible number of eligible producers.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.   As specified in the Project Appraisal Document, the project had three
components:

        Component 1: Support for the production of 2,000 tons of improved and certified
        seed during the 2008/09 production season by scaling up the farmer seed
        multiplication network, including the purchase, treatment, and stocking of seed
        for distribution during the 2009/10 cropping season.

        Component 2: Procurement of 2,000 tons of fertilizer and 20,000 liters of
        pesticide.




3 The number of direct beneficiaries shifted from 70,000 to 90,000, and the increase in rice yields moved
from 30 to 50 percent. This decision was quite challenging, as project funding remained unchanged at
US$ 5 million.


                                                   3
       Component 3: Distribution of input packages (seed, fertilizer, pesticide) through
       the existing farmer organization networks, support for advisory services, and
       establishment of a revolving fund in which funds recovered from input sales were
       deposited and used to capitalize future input purchases.

1.6 Other Significant Changes

11.    The project’s original closing date (March 31, 2010) was extended to June 30,
2012 to allow the government to complete project activities and attain the project’s
development objective. The project’s implementation was delayed following the military
coup in December 2008 (2.5 months after effectiveness), upon which the Bank triggered
OP 7.30 on de facto governments. Disbursements were suspended for more than two
years.

12.    With the lifting of OP 7.30 on January 19, 2011, the government requested an
extension of the closing date until June 30, 2012. A detailed work plan for the period of
the extension and a revised procurement plan were prepared. The project was thus
implemented during two cropping seasons (2009/10 and 2011/12) (note that the cropping
season extends from one year to the next and that crops are harvested between October
and January).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

13.     The Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project was prepared by an
experienced task team brought together by the Bank. The team also received strong
management support. Emergency procedures under OP 8.0 were used. Preparation of the
project was initiated on July 3, 2008; it was approved on September 18, 2008 and became
effective on October 4, 2008. The project design took into account the specific context of
Guinea, including households’ consumption patterns and farmers’ need for inputs
supplied through a sustainable mechanism. Although diversifying the array of food
staples is an important element of a longer-run food security strategy in Guinea, this
project focused on rice productivity, given the importance of rice in household
consumption and the share of rice in overall crop production patterns. Moreover, in the
absence of a functioning private sector input distribution system and limited access to
rural finance, and in the presence of weak and non-transparent public distribution
channels, a decision was made to focus on organized smallholders (about 40 percent of
smallholders are members of producer organizations) as the entry point for building a
sustainable and transparent input distribution system.

14.    The appraisal mission held extensive discussions with representatives of the
government and representatives from the European Commission, France, and key United
Nations (UN) agencies. A rapid food assessment had been completed by the World Food
Programme on May 12-23, 2008, identifying priority sectors for response. The result was



                                            4
a UN-family response from the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children’s
Fund, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health Organization, and the
United Nations Population Fund. The Bank’s strategy for emergency support was aligned
with the government’s strategic approach and the agreed joint UN response. The project
was designed to specifically address the government’s food security program.

15.    Based on relevant lessons learned from similar interventions, some strategic
choices were made. The first was that the project would have a strong focus on
immediate investments in improved inputs and better cropping practices, as these
investments offer a substantial payoff in the short run—particularly for smallholders—
although investment in water management infrastructure is a necessity to increase rice
productivity in Guinea in the medium to longer term. The second was that the project
would not simply be a one-time emergency effort; it would aim to lay the foundation for
a more sustainable input distribution system, and thus its implementation arrangements
and design would rely on sustainable institutional structures.

16.     As noted, the project targeted its interventions on Guinea’s three major rice-
producing areas: Lower Guinea, Upper Guinea, and Forest Guinea. To ensure that the
greatest number of poorer farmers would benefit from the project, inputs were made
available to smallholders with less than 2 hectares. The project worked through CNOP-G
and its member federations and unions. CNOP-G was responsible for distributing the
input packages. Inputs were sold to members on a “cropping-season? credit basis. CNOP-
G was to manage revenues from the sales according to a procedural manual that was to be
approved by the steering committee and satisfactory to the Bank.

17.     To ensure that support reached the intended beneficiaries, the project was
designed to rely on the Coordination Unit for the existing World Bank–funded Village
Communities Support Program (Programme d’Appui aux Communautés Villageoises,
PACV) for all aspects of fiduciary management. That unit had a strong track record in
overall project and financial management for PACV. Overall coordination and technical
responsibility for the project rested with the National Directorate of Agricultural
Advisory Services, which had already managed a successful seed multiplication system
financed previously by the World Bank and other donors. Implementation was carried out
by technical services of the Ministry of Agriculture and the CNOP-G, which benefited
from funding and technical assistance from other donors active in the sector (Agence
Française de Développement and the European Union). This arrangement was probably
quite an innovative aspect of the project in the Guinean context, especially in view of the
fact that the government ultimately modeled its own subsidy program on this approach as
part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion triggers.

18.     The risks identified and mitigation measures proposed under the project were
quite adequate. For example, to mitigate the risk that inputs would not be available on
time because of low domestic stocks, the operation targeted the 2009/10 cropping season
and the 2008/09 dry season to allow sufficient time for inputs to be produced and
procured. To mitigate the risk that achievements would not be sustained after the project
closed, for implementation the project was structured to rely on, and build the capacity



                                            5
of, existing government structures and producer organizations. The risk that beneficiaries
would not be targeted in a transparent manner was partially mitigated by fully involving
CNOP-G and its members in implementation.

2.2 Implementation

19.     The project became effective on October 4, 2008, but after the president’s death
on December 22, 2008, political chaos and a military coup ensued. These developments
caused disbursements to be frozen on December 23, 2008, when the World Bank policy
regarding de facto governments (OP 7.30) went into effect. Because the initial deposit
(US$ 2.0 million) to the designated project account was already available on November
5, 2008, the project nonetheless could start operations in the 2009/10 season. In
consultation with the Bank, and in line with the resources available in the designated
account, project targets were reduced for the 2009/10 planting season (for example, for
inputs to be procured and numbers of beneficiaries and hectares to be covered). As of
December 31, 2010, 400 tons of fertilizer, 4,710 liters of pesticide, and 500 tons of
improved seed were procured and distributed to 23,825 smallholder rice producers with
8,075 hectares. The cost recovery rate was 78 percent for the fertilizer and 91 percent for
the improved seed. The research station at Koba was unable to produce seed during the
2008/09 cropping season as initially planned because flooding delayed crop development.
While OP 7.30 was in effect, the Bank conducted no formal supervision missions, but
audio-conferences were regularly held with the project team to address implementation
issues informally.

20.     Once OP 7.30 was lifted, on January 19, 2011, the Government of Guinea
requested that the project’s closing date be extended to June 30, 2012. The request was
evaluated and processed during the January 2011 Sustainable Development re-
engagement mission and became effective on February 11, 2011. It should also be noted
that delays arose after a new project coordinator took charge in March 2011, because the
new coordinator required time to become fully conversant with Bank procedures and
other elements of managing Bank-financed projects. There were no significant changes in
the project’s design, targeting mechanism, and implementation arrangements. To account
for the positive effect of extending the implementation period over additional cropping
seasons and the availability of additional improved seed from producers, the key outcome
indicators were revised upward. General oversight and direction for the project were the
responsibility of the Project Steering Committee, which was specifically tasked with: (i)
reviewing and approving the proposed consolidated Annual Work Plan and Budget; (ii)
reviewing annual progress toward achieving the project’s objective; and (iii) deciding on
any corrective actions needed in relation to project implementation. Overall project
coordination and technical responsibility rested with the Directorate General of
ANPROCA, which was responsible for: (i) overall coordination and supervision of
project activities; (ii) planning of activities, in close collaboration with CNOP-G, the
National Directorate of Rural Engineering (Direction Nationale du Génie Rural, DNGR),
and the National Directorate of Veterinary Services (Direction Nationale des Services
Vétérinaires, DNSV); (iii) preparation and follow-up for the Annual Work Plan and
Budget; (iv) satisfactory adherence to the Project Implementation Manual; (v) internal



                                            6
monitoring of implementation and consolidation of monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
activities; (vi) communication with the various stakeholders regarding the project; and
(vii) the consolidation of progress reports into overall quarterly progress reports. Overall
fiduciary management was ensured by the Fiduciary Unit of the World Bank–funded
Village Communities Support Project (PACV-2). To ensure close implementation
support following the Bank’s re-engagement, a consultant was hired to carry out regular
implementation support missions. These missions took place on March 16-26, 2011;
August 11-27, 2011, and November 21 to December 10, 2011. In addition, guidance from
the Task Team Leader was sought by the project team whenever necessary. A full-
fledged Bank supervision mission took place on June 22-29, 2012.
21.     Two stages of project implementation can be identified. In Stage 1, target
quantities (of inputs procured and numbers of beneficiaries and hectares covered, for
example) for the 2009/10 planting season were reduced in line with the resources
available in the designated account (about US$ 2 million). All of the Stage 1 quantitative
objectives were achieved with minimal Bank monitoring. The Koba research station
produced about 28 tons of seed during the 2011/12 cropping season. Stage 2, with a
budget of about US$ 3 million, started when disbursement resumed and the project was
restructured in February 2011. Stage 2 covered the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons. Despite
Bank support, agricultural inputs were not always delivered on time to producers, forcing
them to postpone using those inputs until the subsequent cropping season.

22.    The Project Coordination Unit procured farm inputs through competitive bidding
and delivered them to CNOP-G, which was fully responsible for selling them on credit to
producers at the government-subsidized rate. Producers were to reimburse the credit in
cash after the harvest, and CNOP-G was also in charge of recovering input credits.
CNOP-G’s regional and local branches distributed the inputs. More specifically, CNOP-
G (i) identified the demand for agricultural inputs from all producers or their
associations; (ii) balanced the overall demand for inputs with the quantity available to
determine the allocation of inputs for each region of the country; (iii) managed input sales
points where uniform input prices were displayed; (iv) ensured that individual purchases
were consistent with subsidized prices set by the government and did not exceed agreed
upon ceilings per producer; (v) ensured that the proceeds from input sales were paid into
bank accounts opened for that purpose; and (vi) kept records of all transactions to
produce regular reports on the status of input distribution and credit recovery. Overall,
CNOP-G carried out these functions as agreed.

23.    As indicated, funds recovered at the end of the cropping season were lodged in a
separate account managed by CNOP-G and used to capitalize a revolving fund for
purchasing inputs in future seasons. The government reported a total amount recovered at
project closing of about GNF 1,035,000,000. A manual clearly specifying the
management and fiduciary procedures applicable to this revolving fund was unfortunately
not prepared, however. The main reason for this omission was that the Government of
Guinea did not view preparation of the manual as a priority and did not give it the
importance it deserved during implementation. Terms of reference and an orientation
note for the manual were prepared, but efforts never went beyond that stage owing to
poor follow-up both from the project team and government.


                                             7
24.      The project awarded a contract to supply 1,000 tons of fertilizer, to be delivered by
June 2011. Unfortunately, the selected firm was not able to deliver by the agreed date. To
help resolve the problem, the government provided fertilizer from its own stocks to the
project, with the understanding that it would be replaced through the project. The project
could not launch a new competitive bidding process until January, 2012, however,
because the decision to nullify the initial contract was taken by the government in
December, 2011. Eventually a new supplier was selected, but the contract was not
introduced for signing by the Minister of Finance until May, 2012. Since the project’s
closing date was in June, 2012, the firm did not have sufficient time to deliver the
fertilizer even with the signed contract. Therefore, to avoid ineligible expenses, the
Minister decided not to sign the contract. This second unfruitful procurement process led
to an undisbursed balance at the end of the project because less fertilizer was procured
than originally envisaged. At the same time, it is important to note that the project met the
number of targeted beneficiaries as planned because of the 1,000 tons received from the
government.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

25.     M&E was to be carried out at two levels. The first (technical) level of M&E
involved CNOP-G and regional staff of the National Directorate of Agriculture in
tracking actual input use and results on farmers’ fields. Those data were to be transmitted
to the National Office for Studies and Planning (Bureau de Stratégie et de
Développement, BSD) for consolidation and reporting (the second level of M&E).
CNOP-G also collected and maintained data on the distribution of inputs and cost
recovery (although not in electronic form). It was mainly at the second level of M&E (the
BSD) that the relevant monitoring activities were not undertaken. Instead, ANPROCA
collected, processed, and reported data on yields and area, and the initial objective of
involving an independent public institution like BSD, which had previously specialized in
project M&E, was unsuccessful. This outcome partly explains why the results framework
and component indicators, although well prepared, did not serve as a clear guide for
monitoring and taking corrective action during implementation. For this reason, the
performance of the M&E system under the project was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

26.     Safeguards are rated Moderately Satisfactory. From an environmental and
social safeguards standpoint, the Guinea Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support
Project was a Category B project. This classification implies that the project’s
environmental and social impacts, for the most part, were minimal, site-specific, and
manageable to an accepted level. The project triggered two safeguard policies: the
Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 4.01) and the Pest Management Policy (OP 4.09),
based on its objectives of increasing agricultural production and productivity by
providing certified seed, pesticide, and fertilizer to rice producers. The preparation and
disclosure of the PMP was delayed due to OP 7.30. In the meantime, the project adopted
and implemented the already-disclosed PMP of the West Africa Agricultural Productivity
Program (WAAPP 1-C) until a separate document was submitted to the Bank for review



                                              8
and disclosure in February 2011 to ensure de jure compliance with the dated covenant in
the Grant Agreement.

27.      The PMP action plan recommended four categories of activities: (i) improvement
of the institutional and legal framework, including support for preparation of a National
Pest and Pesticides Management Plan; (ii) technical measures, including updating the
inventory of pests affecting crops and stored farm products; (iii) training and capacity-
building activities; and (iv) M&E of the action plan. Some of the mitigation activities
were not carried out until the second stage of implementation (the 2011/12 cropping
season). Of the four categories of activities just mentioned, mitigation activities focused
mainly on training and capacity building for producers and extension agents. The project
financed training related to the recommended best practices for storing fertilizer and
pesticide, as well as on adequate and safe use of fertilizer and pesticide. Through the
training, participants gained a better understanding of other mitigation measures included
in the PMP, but the other three mitigation activities under the PMP (improvement of the
institutional and legal framework, technical measures, M&E) did not receive sufficient
attention during implementation. For this reason, the implementation of environmental
and social safeguards under the project was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

28.     Procurement is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Although procurement was
envisaged to be completed shortly after effectiveness, the process took more time than
necessary and deliveries of inputs to beneficiaries were delayed. For example, the target
date for procuring 3,000 liters of herbicide and 2,000 liters of insecticide was September
19, 2008; the actual procurement date was December 5, 2008. Similarly, the target date
for procuring 1,000 tons of fertilizer (urea and NPK) was November 26, 2011, and the
actual date was April 11, 2012. The last fertilizer procurement under the project could not
be completed before the closing date, leading to an undisbursed balance of about US$
1,147,831. Nevertheless, the final review of project procurement confirmed that the
Procurement Plan developed during preparation and updated during implementation was
adequate. It also found that the filing of procurement documents was good and allowed
procurement to be tracked easily.

29.     Financial management is rated Satisfactory. The Project Coordination Unit of
PACV-2 provided fiduciary oversight for the project, handling all financial,
administrative, and accounting arrangements. The unit provided the required information
to the Bank on financial management through quarterly Interim Financial Reports, which
were of adequate quality and responsive to Bank recommendations. The final Interim
Financial Report was received with no comment from the Bank. Taking the
recommendations of the financial management assessment into account, the project
provided the Project Coordination Unit with technical assistance in financial management
and procurement by developing and adopting a Financial Management Manual, training
staff, upgrading the accounting software, and mainstreaming it throughout the financial
reporting system to track the use of Grant proceeds on a quarterly basis. The audit of the
project account for 2011 was unqualified.

30.    At closing, about 77 percent of Grant proceeds had been disbursed, with an
undisbursed balance of US$ 1,147,831. A consultancy firm has been selected to conduct


                                            9
an external audit of the project’s Designated Account for handling Grant proceeds. The
audit report will be submitted to the Bank by March 31, 2013.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.     The first Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project (Programme
d’Urgence d’Appui à la Productivité Agricole, PUAPA-1) succeeded in expanding rice
producers’ access to improved seed, fertilizer, and pesticide. The project also supported
government-run emergency mechanisms to ensure the short-term distribution of those
inputs and services, while strengthening the capacity of existing organizations (CNOP-G
and ANPROCA).

32.     Based on the lessons from implementing PUAPA-1, and considering that
beneficiaries had highly valued the project’s achievements, a second Emergency
Agricultural Productivity Support Project (PUAPA-2), was financed from the Food Price
Crisis Multi-Donor Response Trust Fund under the Global Food Crisis Response
Program (GFRP) framework for a total of US$ 20 million. The development objective of
this project is to improve the productivity and value-added of targeted commodities (rice,
maize, cassava, and traditional poultry). The government has also committed its own
resources to provide inputs to producers since the 2011/2012 cropping season. The
experience under PUAPA was used to establish a national procedure for the distribution
and cost recovery of inputs procured through public resources.

33.     Aside from building on and consolidating activities initiated under PUAPA-1,
PUAPA-2 supports the government’s medium-term objectives in four ways. First, it
targets the rehabilitation and sustainable management of about 3,620 hectares of
smallholder irrigated rice to further enhance yields and increase the efficiency of input
packages. Second, it intends to scale up the distribution of inputs to include smallholder
maize and cassava producers in addition to producers of irrigated and rainfed rice.
PUAPA-2 will rely on institutional arrangements piloted successfully under PUAPA-1 to
provide a framework in which a sustainable, market-based mechanism can emerge for
smallholders to access inputs. With the recently approved Policy and Human Resources
Development grant for WAAPP-1C in Guinea (which supports rice productivity research
and seed multiplication). PUAPA-2 is an important instrument for the World Bank to
support Guinea’s agricultural sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

34.     Designed as a response to the 2008 food crisis, the Emergency Agricultural
Productivity Support Project supported the government’s high-priority actions to enhance
domestic food production by delivering critical inputs and advisory services. In this
respect, the project’s objectives were relevant and timely.

35.    The Transitional Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (TPRSP) provides a clear
statement of the government's commitment to poverty reduction. The TPRSP, an


                                           10
extension of the full PRSP formulated in 2007, provides the framework for action toward
poverty reduction in 2011/12. The poverty reduction strategy is based on three main
pillars: (i) to sustain faster economic growth and create income-earning and employment
opportunities, particularly for the rural poor; (ii) to improve and extend access to basic
services; and (iii) to improve governance and strengthen institutional and human capacity.
Agriculture and mining are expected to provide the key sources of growth. In agriculture,
the objectives are to make better use of the large potential for expanding rice production,
enhance food security through diversification and better extension services for
smallholders, and foster agribusiness to increase processing and exportation of
agricultural products (including non-traditional exports).

36.    The Interim Strategy Note for 2011/12 was approved on March 24, 2011. The
note supports the government’s priorities of making agriculture a key engine of growth
with an initial focus on food security and smallholder rice and food crop productivity to
support the government’s Priority Action Plan. Moreover, the project’s focus on short-
term as well as medium-term food production fits well with the Country Poverty
Reduction Strategy, which emphasizes measures to enhance domestic food production in
the short, medium and long term to respond to rising food prices. Synergies and
complementarities between World Bank–supported projects were highlighted in the
implementation design of the project and at the same time created a foundation for
improved preparedness in the event of future food security threats.

37.     The design of the project was also consistent with the broader objectives of the
GFRP, which were to: (i) reduce the negative impact of high and volatile food prices on
the lives of the poor in a timely way; (ii) support governments in the design of sustainable
policies that mitigate the adverse impact of high and more volatile food prices on poverty
while minimizing the creation of long-term market distortions; and (iii) support broad-
based growth, productivity, and market participation in agriculture to ensure an adequate
and sustainable food supply response.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

38.     The overall achievement of the PDO is Satisfactory. The development
objective was to increase smallholder rice productivity on 35,000 hectares. The project
aimed at mitigating the short-term impact of increased food prices on households and
expanding food crop farmers’ access to agricultural inputs in the medium and long term.
This development objective was to be achieved by expanding food crop producers’
access to improved seed, fertilizer, pesticide, and advisory services. Specific key
outcomes envisioned for this project included an increase in rice yields by 50 percent and
reaching about 90,250 direct beneficiaries.

39.     Increase in rice yields of targeted smallholders: Achieved. Data collected
during the impact evaluation from a sample of farmers across agro-ecological zones
indicate that rice yields increased by 96 percent against the target of 50 percent. Surveys
conducted on beneficiaries’ plots within the framework of the WAAPP-1C baseline study
showed yield increases of 138 percent in Lower Guinea (from 1.3 to 2.8 tons per hectare),


                                            11
60 percent in Upper Guinea (from 1.5 to 2.4 tons per hectare), and 92 percent in Forest
Guinea (from 1.3 to 2.5 tons per hectare) for producers using the recommended
technologies.

40.     Number of direct beneficiaries reached by the project: Achieved. Field data
indicate that the target number of beneficiaries was reached. Against a target of 90,250
producers, the actual number of direct beneficiaries was 110,000 producers.

41.     The achievement of intermediate performance indicators is assessed below for the
three technical components of the project.

42.    Production, certification, purchase, and storage of base seed by research
stations for multiplication: Partially Achieved. During the 2009/10 and 2011/12
cropping season, about 45 tons of foundation seed were produced against a target of 60
tons. The Koba research station was not able to produce foundation seed during the
2008/09 season because of factors beyond its control (floods hampered seed production).
During 2011/12, the government allocated exceptional funding out of its own budget to
support IRAG’s entire foundation seed production activity. In the end, the project had
more seed for onward multiplication by seed producers than the 45 tons procured out of
the Grant proceeds.

43.     Production of improved seed by producers: Achieved. During the 2009/10 and
2011/12 cropping seasons, about 2,600 tons of improved seed were produced against a
target of 2,300 tons.

44.     Training in seed multiplication for producers: Achieved. During the 2009/10
and 2011/12 cropping seasons, about 250 producers were trained in seed multiplication
against a target of 250.

45.    Procurement of fertilizer: Partially Achieved. During the 2009/10 and 2011/12
cropping seasons, about 1,400 tons of fertilizer were purchased against a target of 2,000
tons. However, the government provided 1,000 tons of its own stocks, which meant that
2,400 tons of fertilizer were ultimately available for the project.

46.     Distribution of improved input packages and provision of advisory services
to producers: Achieved. Against a target of 90,250 producers, the actual number of
beneficiaries of input packages and advisory services was about 110,000 producers. The
project significantly increased rice producers’ access to improved inputs and advisory
services. For example, the average distance to travel to get improved seed dropped from
16 kilometers to 2 kilometers, while for herbicide and fertilizer, the average distance is 3
kilometers compared to 21 kilometers without the project. Moreover, the project
promoted producers’ awareness of the importance of using inputs of good quality
(improved seed, fertilizer, and pesticide).

47.   Tables 1 and 2 summarize progress against the PDO indicators and intermediate
outcome indicators, respectively. In many cases, the project performed above targets.

3.3 Efficiency

48.     As stated in the Project Appraisal Document, no cost-benefit analysis was
conducted prior to the project, given its emergency nature and short preparation period.
However, the economic impact of providing improved seed, fertilizer, pesticide, and
advisory services to farmers was positive. Aside from being procured and delivered to
rice producers, the subsidized inputs provided through the project were procured at half
the prevailing market price.

49.    The impact of rice producers’ access to improved seed, fertilizer, pesticide, and
advisory services was significant in the short term. Without access to improved inputs,
production remains essentially at the subsistence level and yields little if any marketable
surplus. The advisory services provided under the project enabled farmers to use fertilizer
and improved seed more effectively.

50.     An ex post farm budget analysis, based on farm survey data, found that on
average the project generated significant financial benefits for producers (Annex 3). In
the absence of the project, average rice yields range from 1 to 4 tons per hectare, and the
average net income per hectare is GNF 8,500,000 (1,146,100–16,300,000). Under the
project, however, average rice yields ranged from 2 to 5 tons per hectare, and the average
net income per hectare was GNF 11,000,000 (2,670,000–19,862,500).

51.    These results show that the incremental benefits derived from yield increases
outweigh the additional costs incurred by producers. When fertilizer and pesticide are
valued at the market price rather than the project’s subsidized price, however, the net
income for rice producers under the project remains positive for the best performers but
becomes negative for some producers. The implication is that there is still room to
improve productivity.




                                                  14
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

52.     The overall project outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This rating is based
on the high relevance of the PDO, the achievement of most of the agreed performance
indicators, and evidence of the project’s efficiency, moderated by shortcomings in the
establishment of the revolving fund. Another consideration is that timeliness was
important, given that the project was an emergency operation. Since the project’s
implementation was unavoidably delayed by national events that could not have been
foreseen, an overall outcome rating of marginally satisfactory appears to be appropriate.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

53.     Poverty impact. The Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project
targeted poor rural households and small-scale producers effectively. Increases in rice
yields and production made more rice and more income available to producers.
According to reports from project stakeholders at the Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) workshop, the increase in farm income allowed poor rural people to invest in other
needs, such as healthcare and schooling.

54.     Gender. The project faced the same gender issue as most projects of this nature,
in that the majority of the beneficiaries were men. Few women were represented at the
stakeholder workshop. Although women’s involvement in rice production typically
occurs in processing and marketing rather than in production, and although women’s
involvement in production varies by geographical area, gender mainstreaming should
have been considered more actively in implementing the project. A gender
mainstreaming framework has been developed and adopted to better address gender
issues in the next phase of the project (PUAPA-2).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

55.    Institutional change. Independent evaluation conducted after project closing
showed that the project significantly strengthened the synergy and complementarity
between various implementation agencies, including CNOP-G and ANPROCA, and thus
created greater trust between the producers and extension agents. The project has also
helped to improve the structuring of producer organizations at all levels (national,
regional, local). Finally, the project allowed a transfer of competencies (input distribution
and credit recovery) from the state to producer organizations.

56.     Capacity building. The project’s implementation arrangements played a key role
in building institutional capacity and enhancing sustainability. The project (i) relied on
farmer organizations (CNOP-G and its member federations, unions, and village
associations) for input distribution and credit recovery; (ii) scaled up a successful farmer-



                                             15
based seed multiplication network to provide sufficient quantities of improved seed; and
(iii) provided resources to reinvigorate the national agricultural extension services
(ANPROCA) and seed production centers, which had ceased activity 10 years beforehand.
Beneficiaries confirmed that the training was useful in improving their capacity,
especially in seed multiplication. They suggested that resources also be made available
for training in farm management.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

57.     The input subsidy model and implementation arrangements developed under the
project (as described in paragraph 22) were adopted by the government for its own
program as part of the HIPC completion point triggers. This is a major achievement of
the project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

58.     The stakeholder workshop held on November 1, 2012 confirmed that the project
achieved its development objectives, substantially increasing rice productivity and thus
significantly improving farmers’ revenues. Through the project’s interventions, rice
cropping techniques improved and production increased. Stakeholders indicated that
living conditions had improved for most of them, as seen from such indicators as greater
access to food, improved food quality, schooling of more children, roof renovation, the
construction of more permanent and durable houses, and so on.

59.    Stakeholders regarded procurement under the project as not entirely satisfactory,
especially considering the slowness and administrative hindrances in procurement
processes. The producers felt that procurement could be transferred to producer
organizations at the regional level. They also stressed the need for better coordination
among the implementing agencies to ensure timely delivery of improved farm inputs.
They really appreciated the contribution of the project to capacity building and
considered the training topics relevant.

60.     With respect to the production and distribution of improved seed, stakeholders
mentioned that the timeliness of fertilizer distribution could improve. Delays in
distributing seed to producers also indicate the need for better distribution planning. No
environmental or social issues were reported in relation to the use of fertilizer, herbicide,
or insecticide by project beneficiaries.

4. Assessment of Risks to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

61.    Risks to development outcome and sustainability of project achievements are
assessed against economic/financial, institutional, social, and environmental criteria.
Overall, the risk to development outcome is evaluated as Moderate.

62.    The economic and financial risk to development outcome is rated Significant.
Increased rice production achieved under the project helped the country increase food


                                             16
availability. On the other hand, high fertilizer subsidies impose a growing fiscal burden
and complicate an already difficult budget situation for the government. The major risks
relate to uncertainty concerning the government’s ability to: (i) pursue a food security
policy that empowers producers and gives the private sector a prominent role as an
engine of growth, including a prominent role in supplying farm inputs; (ii) design and
implement a consistent input subsidy policy; and (iii) conduct key structural reforms in
the agricultural sector. The key challenge is to move gradually toward a more sustainable,
market-based approach for delivering inputs to food crop producers. The second phase of
the project (PUAPA-2) will build on the input supply mechanism pioneered under
PUAPA-1, broaden its outreach, and also undertake initiatives (analytical studies and
policy dialogue) to promote the shift toward a sustainable, market-driven mechanism.

63.     The institutional risk to development outcome is rated Moderate. Capacity
building under the project improved the government’s readiness to deal with emergency
food security issues and its capacity to rely on producer organizations to deliver services
that were hitherto the government’s prerogative. As indicated, the input subsidy model
and implementation arrangements developed under the project were adopted by the
government for its own program as part of HIPC completion point triggers. Failure to
produce an implementation manual on the revolving fund has hampered progress toward
a sustainable input distribution system, however.

64.     The social risk to development outcome is rated Moderate. The project’s
interventions contributed significantly to increases in rice production, which has a
positive impact on household food security. These outcomes might be jeopardized by
renewed surges in food prices on international markets, which would increase the
vulnerability of farm households lacking diversified sources of income.

65.    The environmental risk to development outcome is rated Low. According to
the environmental and social assessment, the project received a B classification.
Although the project triggered two World Bank safeguard policies—Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Pest Management (OP/BP 4.09)—its activities had few
environmental effects. No cases of environmental damage or injuries to producers arising
from inadequate or improper use of fertilizer and pesticide were reported in the project
area.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    Rating: Satisfactory

66.    The project started on a strong footing because its design incorporated guidance
from the GFRP Framework document, lessons from similar operations in other countries,
and experiences from other donors. Extensive consultation with partners made it possible
to harmonize views on suitable approaches for implementation. The process ensured that



                                            17
the project, aside from meeting short-term needs, included a mechanism (the revolving
fund) for more sustainable access to farm inputs.

67.    Bank management provided resources to prepare the project adequately. It
mobilized a multi-sectoral team 4 that received high-level support on fiduciary, legal,
disbursement, and safeguard concerns. All parties within the Bank, up to and including
the Region’s Front Office, made the arrangements (including an effective backup system)
required to ensure continuity and maintain the momentum of project preparation, using
emergency procedures under OP 8.00.

68.    The inclusion of producer organizations in the implementation design was
commendable and beneficial. These stakeholders contributed considerably to the
arrangements for input distribution.

(b) Quality of Supervision
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.     Given the circumstances prevailing in Guinea (OP 7.30 and suspension of
disbursements from December 2008 to January 2011), no formal Bank supervision
missions were undertaken during that period, and the project had no mid-term review.
Regular audio-conferences were held with the project team during that time, however.
Following the Bank’s re-engagement, supervision missions resumed from 2011 onward
(January 17-28, 2011; March 15-26, 2011; August 11-27, 2011; October 6-19, 2011; June
22-29, 2012). The missions provided effective technical support for project
implementation and achievement of development objectives, although recommendations
from supervision missions were not always carried out as effectively as they should have
been. The team also benefitted from regular support from experienced safeguards,
financial management, and procurement staff. The Bank should have followed up more
aggressively on the finalization and disclosure of the PMP, however.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.     The project was well designed, successfully implemented, and achieved most of
its performance targets. Beneficiaries are satisfied with the project’s interventions.
However, the project was unable to put in place instruments to manage the revolving
fund, which would have increased the sustainability of input procurement and distribution.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.     The Government of Guinea set up the institutional arrangements necessary to
implement the project according to the planned design and mechanisms. The government
satisfied the prerequisites for disbursement and released its counterpart contribution with
the provision of 1,000 tons of fertilizer to rice producers. However, the government failed
to provide swift, effective procurement arrangements. As a result, the last fertilizer
procurement was not completed before the project’s closing date, leaving an undisbursed
balance of US$ 1,147,831. In addition, the government had been mandated to prepare and
adopt a manual that would clearly spell out how the proceeds from sales of subsidized
inputs would be managed and used efficiently. This key activity unfortunately was not
completed by project closing.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.     The project delivered on most of its commitments. It was responsive to a certain
extent in providing the Bank with information to monitor its performance. The project
complied satisfactorily with the Bank's financial management requirements through
regular, timely submission of financial reports and annual audits.. The implementing
agencies (ANPROCA, CNOP-G) were not sufficiently proactive in carrying out
recommendations of the supervision missions, however. ANPROCA was responsible for
overall project coordination, management, and technical oversight. Despite all efforts,
there was insufficient coordination among implementing agencies and follow up of
project activities. Reporting was insufficiently timely to allow for corrective actions—
hence the undisbursed balance of US$ 1,147,831 at project closing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.    The overall borrower performance is rated Marginally Satisfactory, taking into
account the marginally satisfactory government performance and marginally satisfactory
performance of the implementing agencies.

6. Lessons Learned
74.     Strong involvement of producer organizations in project implementation is a
key factor for success on the ground. Involvement of CNOP-G—including its farmer
federations at the regional level and unions at the prefecture level—and village
associations in distributing the input packages fostered a sense of ownership at the
grassroots level and was central to the success of PUAPA-1. As most federations and
unions are still young organizations, PUAPA-2 contains provisions for strengthening



                                            19
their management and implementation capacity while promoting good governance,
internal democracy, and transparency.

75.     Innovative solutions enable project implementation to continue in a context
of political instability and social unrest. The December 2008 military coup after the
death of the president, followed by political instability and social unrest, negatively
affected the project’s implementation and outcomes. The project lost momentum because
seed was not delivered on time for planting. Procurement of seed and fertilizer was
delayed, and the government lost the proceeds of the Grant. Such circumstances
demanded innovative mechanisms to help the project stay afloat. In that respect, the task
team’s decision to hire a consultant to provide technical support to the project team and
monitor implementation when formal Bank supervision missions were suspended was
very commendable.

76.    Capable producer organizations may be a good entry point for a sustainable
input distribution mechanism. Where private input distribution systems are ineffective,
access to rural finance is limited, and public distribution channels are not robust or
transparent, well-organized smallholders can act as an entry point for building a
successful, sustainable input distribution system. Successful implementation of that
approach is one of the project’s key achievements. The project’s second phase will build
on the input supply mechanism used under PUAPA-1, broaden its outreach, and
undertake initiatives (analytical studies and policy dialogue) to promote the shift toward a
sustainable, market-driven mechanism.

77.     Capacity building is essential for public entities to fully match their
capabilities to their responsibilities in project implementation. ANPROCA has some
experience managing Bank-funded projects, but its capacity for implementing large-scale
operations is still weak, mainly with respect to its internal planning capacity and the weak
M&E mechanism for updating results indicators in a timely way. PUAPA-2 is designed
to address ANPROCA’s capacity-building needs. At the same time, the operational
capacity of research stations and seed multipliers remains weak, and the national
certification mechanism has yet to become operational. PUAPA-2 contains provisions to
complement the efforts of WAAPP-1C to strengthen the institutions involved in the seed
sector and build capacity among all of its stakeholders.

78.     In Bank-supported emergency food security projects, effective and visible
gender mainstreaming will lead to more focused actions and better achievement of
PDOs. The absence of a gender mainstreaming framework was partly responsible for
women’s limited involvement in some project activities, including the provision of input
credits and capacity building.

  The last fertilizer procurement was to compensate for the 1,000 tons that the government had already
provided to the project from its own stocks. Owing to delays in the procurement process, this could not be
finalized prior to project closing.

The achievements under the three components of the project are as follows:

Component 1: Production of improved and certified seed. Under Component 1, the
project produced 1,503 tons of improved and certified seed (503 tons in 2009/10 and
1,000 tons in 2011/12). The recovery-in-kind system implemented for seed stocks
allowed the project to provide 2,600 tons of seed to rice producers. The Department of
Seeds, Plants, and Fertilizers of the National Directorate of Agriculture was responsible
for the control, treatment, and certification of the improved seed.

Component 2: Procurement of fertilizer and pesticide. CNOP-G bought seed from
producers through its regional branches with the support of ANPROCA. Fertilizer and
pesticide were purchased through competitive bidding by the project and transferred to
CNOP-G for distribution to rice farmers. During the 2009/10 cropping season, 400 tons
of fertilizer (200 tons of NPK and 200 tons of urea), 1,950 liters of herbicide, and 2,760
liters of insecticide were purchased. For 2011/12, 1,000 tons of fertilizer (550 tons of
NPK and 450 tons of urea), 13,050 liters of herbicide, and 2,240 liters of insecticide were
purchased. Overall, the project supported the purchase of 1,400 tons of fertilizer (750
tons of NPK and 650 tons of urea, out of a total 2,000 tons planned), 15,000 liters of
herbicide, and 5,000 liters of insecticide.

Component 3: Distribution of input packages (seed, fertilizer, pesticide). Fifty-
kilogram bags of seed were distributed to farmers and refunded in kind. For every 50
kilograms of seed received, farmers were asked to give back 75 kilograms at harvest as
reimbursement in kind. (An exception was made for Upper Guinea in 2009/10, when
farmers were asked to supply 50 kilograms of seed for every 50 kilograms received.) The

                                                   23
payback conditions were harmonized for all farmers in 2011/12 in the project area: 75
kilograms of seed for every 50 kilograms supplied. Inputs were sold to farmers on a
“cropping-season? credit basis. Fertilizer was sold to farmers on credit at GNF 140,000
per 50-kilogram bag during 2009/10 and for a cash payment of GNF 125,000 per 50-
kilogram bag in 2011/12. Pesticide was sold on credit at GNF 35,000 per liter during
2009/10 and for a cash payment of GNF 30,000 per liter during 2011/12. The decision to
reduce fertilizer and pesticide prices and move from credit to cash payments during
2011/12 was motivated by the low recovery 6 of input credit observed in many farmer
organizations during 2009/10.

Rehabilitation of water management infrastructure. Aside from the above-mentioned
activities, small civil works were carried out from February to December 2009, including
the rehabilitation of water management infrastructure for dry-season seed and paddy
production. Of the 1,000 hectares targeted, about 900 hectares were rehabilitated in
Kindiady under the supervision of DNGR. Twenty-four users and two ANPROCA staff
members were trained by DNGR in water management and irrigation infrastructure
maintenance. DNGR also participated in the establishment of the Management
Committee for the rehabilitated perimeter. The Management Committee levies an annual
fee of GNF 100,000 per hectare to access the developed perimeter and a fee of GNF
10,000 per hectare to access the remainder of the land. These fees are used to maintain
the rehabilitated infrastructure. Despite the fact that fees are charged, the entire reclaimed
area is allocated to producers, reflecting their high demand for irrigated land, which can
yield as much as 5-6 tons of rice per hectare versus 2-3 tons in undeveloped areas.

Support to post-harvest activities. To support post-harvest activities, the project funded
the acquisition of two rice processing units consisting of 2 parboilers, 1 huller, 1 thresher,
1 polisher, and 4 tarpaulins. These units have been installed in Macenta and Kindia to
benefit women's groups. As in many locations in Guinea, women are primarily
responsible for rice processing (threshing, parboiling, and hulling). At each location, a
Management Committee was set up with project support.

The project trained the women’s groups in the importance of the Management
Committee, rice parboiling, use of the equipment, record-keeping and management (book
of minutes, weighing), and accounting. In Kindia, for example, the unit is managed by a
Management Committee set up by the women’s groups. The committee sets fees for
using the equipment: The fee for parboiling is GNF 1,500 per 50-kilogram bag of paddy;
fees for milling are GNF 500 per kilogram (for non-members) and GNF 400 per kilogram
(for group members). Revenues from the processing operation allowed the women’s
groups to purchase of a pair of oxen to plow their plots. The budget for the 2011/12
cropping season revealed a net income of GNF 8,378,900; of this, GNF 7,200,000 was

 The average recovery rate for improved seed was 90.68 percent in 2009/10 and 98.96 percent in 2011/12.
Recovery rates for fertilizer and pesticide are much lower. The average recovery rate for fertilizer was
78.57 percent in 2009/10, dropping to 51.7 percent in 2011/12. The average recovery rate for pesticide was
about 12.50 percent in 2009/10 and 69.90 percent in 2011/12.

members to grow vegetables, groundnuts, and cassava.

                     Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Overview

1.     This annex presents results of the financial analysis of the Emergency
Agricultural Productivity Support Project. An ex post economic analysis was not carried
out. The PDO was to increase rice productivity on smallholders’ farms so as to increase
production and mitigate the short-term impact of rising prices on households.

2.      The analysis is based on an ex post evaluation of the project’s performance,
taking into account the characteristics of farms adopting improved technologies under the
project and the cost and benefit streams projected to be associated with the use of
improved input packages. More specifically, the financial analysis documents the returns
from improved rice production arising from increased access to improved agricultural
inputs (improved seed, fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide) and advisory services. The
analysis compares typical farm models for rice production under the project and in the
absence of the project (“with and without project? farm budget analysis).

3.     The incremental financial benefits arising from additional rice production at the
farm level under the project are calculated, net of farm cost increases. Almost all
improvements in productivity are associated with increased farm costs, because the
quantity or quality of purchased technologies increases or because more labor is needed
(for improved soil preparation prior to planting, for example, or for handling the
additional production).

B. Profile of rice farms without project intervention

4.     In Lower Guinea. Without the project, average rice yields range from 2.5 to 4
tons per hectare, and the market price is GNF 5,000 per kilogram. On average, net farm
income per hectare is GNF 7,725,000-16, 300,000, depending on the type of production
system.

5.     In Forest Guinea. Without the project, average rice yields range from 1 to 2 tons
per hectare, and the market price is GNF 5,000 per kilogram. On average, net farm
income per hectare is GNF 970,000-2,760,000, depending on the type of production
system.

6.     In Upper Guinea. Without the project, average rice yields range from 0.95 to 1.3
tons per hectare, and the market price is GNF 5,000 per kilogram. On average, net farm
income per hectare is GNF 1,146,100-2,331,100, depending on the type of production
system.

C. Improved net farm income with the project

7.     In Lower Guinea. With the project, average rice yields range from 3.0 to 5 tons
per hectare, and the market price is GNF 5,000 per kilogram. On average, net farm
                                           26
income per hectare is GNF 8,605,000-19,862,500, depending on the type of production
system.

8.     In Forest Guinea. With the project, average rice yields range from 2.5 to 3.5 tons
per hectare, and the market price is GNF 5,000 per kilogram. On average, net farm
income per hectare is GNF 2,670,000-5,753,750, depending on the type of production
system.
9.     In Upper Guinea. With the project, average rice yields range from 2 to 2.5 tons
per hectare, and the market price is GNF 5,000 per kilogram. On average, net farm
income per hectare is GNF 3,289,500-5,059,400, depending on the type of production
system.

D. Conclusion

10.    Net benefits (the difference in profits with and without the project) are positive
for beneficiaries. In other words, the incremental benefits derived from yield increases
outweigh the additional costs incurred by producers.

The beneficiary workshop held on November 1, 2012 confirmed that the project achieved
its development objectives and substantially contributed to increasing rice productivity,
thereby significantly improving farmers’ revenues. Through the project’s interventions,
rice cropping techniques improved and production increased. Stakeholders indicated that
living conditions had improved for most of them, as seen from such indicators as greater
access to food, improved food quality, schooling of more children, roof renovation, the
construction of more permanent and durable houses, and so on.

Stakeholders regarded procurement under the project as not entirely satisfactory,
especially considering the slowness and administrative hindrances in procurement
processes. The producers felt that procurement could be transferred to producer
organizations at the regional level. They also stressed the need for better coordination
among the implementing agencies for timely delivery of farm inputs. They really
appreciated the contribution of the project to capacity building and considered the
training topics relevant.

Stakeholders mentioned that fertilizer distribution for the production of improved seed
needed to be timely. Delays experienced in distributing seed to producers indicate the
need for better distribution planning. No environmental or social issues were reported in
relation to the use of fertilizer, herbicide, or insecticide by project beneficiaries.

                            Conakry, le 1er Novembre 2012

    1. Introduction

Le Ministère de l’Agriculture a organisé le 1er Novembre 2012, dans la salle de
conférence du Programme d’Appui aux Collectivités Villageoises (PACV), l’atelier
national des parties prenantes du Projet d’Urgence d’Appui à la Productivité Agricole
(PU-APA). Cet atelier, tenu en présence d’experts de la Banque Mondiale s’inscrivait
dans le cadre de la finalisation du rapport national d’achèvement du PUAPA préparé par
le Gouvernement.

Placé sous la présidence du Directeur Général de l’Agence Nationale de la Promotion
Rurale et du Conseil Agricole (ANPRO-CA) et Coordonnateur du PUAPA qui avait à ses
côtés Messieurs Yao HACCANDY et Erick ABIASSI de la Banque Mondiale, l’atelier a
connu la participation active des invités représentant du Ministère de l’Agriculture
(Agence Nationale de la Promotion Rurale et Conseil Agricole, Bureau de Stratégie et du
Développement, Direction Nationale du Génie Rural, Direction Nationale de
l’Agriculture, l’Institut de Recherche Agronomique de Guinée, Service National de la
Protection Vétérinaire et des Denrées Stockée), du Ministère de l'Economie et des
Finances, des Projets/programmes ( PACV, WAAP), la Confédération Nationale des
Organisations Paysannes de Guinée et des représentants des producteurs bénéficiaires.

L’atelier avait pour :

Objectif : Recueillir les contributions des acteurs de mise en œuvre et bénéficiaires du
projet en vue de la finalisation du rapport d’achèvement du Gouvernement.
Résultat attendu : Les contributions des parties prenantes aux conclusions du rapport
d’achèvement sont recueillies.

2. Déroulement de l’atelier

2.1 Allocution de bienvenue et d’ouverture

La cérémonie d'ouverture a été marquée par l’allocution du Directeur Général de
l’Agence Nationale de la Promotion Rurale et du Conseil Agricole (ANPRO-CA),
Coordonnateur du projet qui a souhaité la bienvenue à l’ensemble des participants et loué


                                           31
les efforts déployés par le PU-APA au profit des populations rurales dans le cadre d’une
contribution à la sécurité alimentaire.

Après avoir souhaité la bienvenue aux participants, le coordonnateur du projet présentera
le contexte de l’atelier tout en expliquant ce que c’est qu’un rapport d’achèvement, son
importance et la nécessité de partager son contenu avec l’ensemble des acteurs et
bénéficiaires des actions du projet. Par conséquent, il exhortera les participants à une
réflexion collective pour dégager un consensus sur l’appréciation des objectifs, de la
stratégie de mise en œuvre, des résultats obtenus, de la performance des parties prenantes,
des enseignements tirés et recommandations pour le futur. Il adressera, au nom du
Ministre de l’Agriculture les vifs remerciements au Gouvernement et à ses différents
partenaires financiers pour le financement du projet. Enfin, il souhaitera aux participants
plein succès dans les travaux avant de déclarer ouvert les travaux de l’atelier.

Il reviendra ensuite à Monsieur Erick ABIASSI de la Banque Mondiale de s’exprimer au
nom de la mission de l’équipe de la Banque. Dans son intervention, il s'est tout d'abord
réjouit de sa participation à cet atelier. Ensuite il a bien voulu informer les participants du
caractère particulier de ce projet qui est le premier du genre à être financé par la Banque
Mondiale et a évoqué l'importance qu'il représente pour la Guinée et la Banque qui
doivent en tirer bonnes leçons. Il est revenu sur l’importance du rapport d’achèvement et
a expliqué son caractère obligatoire en respect des procédures de la Banque et des termes
de l’accord de financement entre le Gouvernement et l’Association internationale pour le
Développement (IDA). Il a en outre souligné que l’élaboration de rapports d’achèvement
par les pays bénéficiaires de financement d’une part et par la Banque d’autre part, est une
opportunité pour chacune des parties, de prendre du recul et apprécier la qualité de
conception et de mise en œuvre des projets, les résultats atteints, la performance des
parties prenantes, d’en tirer des enseignements et formuler des recommandations pour le
futur. Par conséquent il se dira rassuré que l’atelier prendra en compte les opinions
objectives des parties prenantes qu’elles soient positives ou négatives (éventuellement) et
a exhorté les participants à contribuer efficacement à l’amélioration du rapport
d’achèvement soumis à leur approbation afin de permettre au Gouvernement de le
finaliser et le transmettre à la Banque dans les délais requis. Il a enfin souhaité plein
succès à l’atelier pour l'atteinte de l’objectif de finalisation participative du rapport
national d’achèvement du PUAPA.

A l’issue de la cérémonie d'ouverture et conformément à l'agenda, l’opportunité sera
donnée aux participants de se présenter et d’approuver le programme de travail de
l’atelier présenté par le modérateur qui s’articulait autour de la présentation du projet et
des conclusions de l’étude d’impact réalisée par un consultant indépendant.

2.2 Présentation du projet

Après l’adoption du programme de la journée Mr Alpha Bacar BARRY a donné un
exposé détaillé la mise en œuvre du projet. Le plan de l’exposé s’articulait autour de trois
chapitres essentiels notamment :



                                              32
 Présentation du projet (contexte et justification, objectifs, composantes, Dispositif
  institutionnel, Modalité de mise en œuvre)
 Résultats atteints par composante
 Difficultés rencontrées.

Les principaux résultats relevés sont les suivants :

       la production de 45 tonnes de semences de base sur les 90 tonnes attendues, soit
        50% de réalisation ;
       la multiplication des semences menée par des producteurs semenciers a impliqué
        les services compétents en matière de conditionnement, de contrôle et de
        certification des semences, ce qui a facilité l’approvisionnement des différentes
        zones du projet : au total 1503 000 tonnes de semences de meilleures qualités ont
        été achetées ; Des mécanismes internes de recouvrement mis en place ont permis
        de relever cette quantité à la hausse atteignant 2 437 312 kg, permettant ainsi
        d’obtenir un taux de réalisation de 121% de l’objectif du projet en matière de
        distribution de semences ;
       Pour les autres intrants, les achats ont concernés 1 215 tonnes d’engrais (60,75%
        de taux de réalisation), 15 000 litres d’herbicide (100% de taux de réalisation) et
        4190 litres d’insecticides (83,8) ;
       L’aménagement de 900 ha à Koba sur 1000 ha prévus, soit 90% de réalisation ;
       Deux unités pilotes d’équipements post-récolte prévues ont été installées et sont
        opérationnelles ;
       les activités d’appui conseil ont été développées dans l’ensemble de la zone du
        projet et ont permis la diffusion de paquets technologiques accompagnant les
        intrants ;
       Sur un objectif de couverture de 35 000 ha le projet a couvert 38 970 ha, soit
        111% de taux de réalisation
       Sur 450 parcelles de démonstration prévues 375 ont été installées soit 83,3% ;
       Des rendements relevés au niveau de carrés installés dans les champs des
        producteurs donnent des taux d’accroissement allant de 60% en Haute Guinée à
        92% en Basse Guinée et 138% en Guinée Forestière.
       En matière de formation 37.777 producteurs et 242 techniciens soit au total
        38.019 personnes ont bénéficié de formation dans divers thèmes réparties comme
        suit : 37613 (dont 37500 producteurs et 113 techniciens) sur les itinéraires
        techniques, 256 (dont 205 producteurs et 51 techniciens) sur l’utilisation des
        équipements et produits phytosanitaires, 30 (dont 24 producteurs et 6 techniciens)
        sur les techniques de production et contrôle des semences de riz, 30 (dont 24
        productrices et 6 techniciens) sur les techniques améliorées d’étuvage du riz, 26
        (dont 24 producteurs et 2 techniciens) sur la gestion et l’entretien des ouvrages et
        64 techniciens formés sur la collecte des données et le remplissage des fiches de
        suivi évaluation.

Les difficultés ressorties étaient les suivantes :




                                               33
      Les changements intervenus dans la vie sociopolitique du pays depuis Décembre
       2008 a entrainé des suspensions successives des projets financés par la Banque.;
      Le ratio d’encadrement élevé au regard de l’objectif en termes de familles
       paysannes par rapport à l’effectif des conseillers agricoles détachés au compte du
       PUAPA ;
      L’insuffisance de personnel technique au niveau de la CNOP-G pour assurer le
       suivi de proximité des opérations de distribution et de recouvrement des coûts
       des intrants ;
      L’insuffisance d’infrastructures appropriées de stockage des semences, engrais et
       pesticides dans les grandes zones de production ;
      Lenteur dans le traitement des dossiers de passation de marché ;
      Retard (par rapport au calendrier cultural) dans le transport des intrants à
       destination de certaines zones de production ;
      Non prise en compte du suivi évaluation interne dans la conception du projet.

Au terme du PUAPA, les principales leçons tirées ont été les suivantes :

      La conception et la mise en œuvre du PUAPA répondent à un besoin réel et les
       actions réalisées suscitent un grand intérêt chez les bénéficiaires.
      La mise en œuvre du PUAPA a permis de confirmer l’intérêt que les producteurs
       portent aussi bien à la disponibilité et à l’utilisation des d’intrants (semences,
       engrais, pesticides) qu’aux aménagements hydro-agricoles pour obtenir un
       accroissement subséquent de la production agricole.
      L’augmentation effective des rendements du riz chez les producteurs qui ont
       bénéficié des paquets technologiques et des conseils pour leur bonne application
       montre que les objectifs initiaux du projet sont pertinents et réalisables
      L’application des connaissances reçues a permis aux producteurs d’améliorer les
       rendements du riz et augmenter la production. Il existe une certaine
       complémentarité entre les actions du projet et celles de certains organismes et
       institutions de développement qui renforce les changements positifs et l’impact
       des interventions.
      L’implication de la CNOPG dans la mise en œuvre du projet a accru sa crédibilité
       vis-à-vis de ses membres, des décideurs et de certains bailleurs. Les résultats
       obtenus ont favorisé le raffermissement de la position et du rôle des organisations
       des producteurs dans le développement agricole.
      La dynamique des groupements sur le terrain, l’appropriation faite des techniques
       culturales, la disponibilité de l’eau d’irrigation dans la zone réhabilitée, la
       facilitation de l’accès aux intrants (semences, engrais, pesticides,) sont des
       facteurs favorables à la poursuite et au développement des actions initiées par le
       projet.
      Grâce à la pertinence de l’intervention, à l’efficacité des acteurs et à la dynamique
       des bénéficiaires, les résultats obtenus par le projet vont dans le sens de l’atteinte
       des objectifs, induisent un impact perçu et reconnu par les bénéficiaires, justifient
       et encouragent un tel projet d’appui en faveur des populations rurales. Cependant
       ces acquis restent encore fragiles et requiert une consolidation dans les années à
       venir.

Cette 1ère présentation a été suivie de questions d’éclaircissement posées par les
participants et de débats par composante, animés par le modérateur. Il s’en est suivi
également des commentaires et analyses formulées par Monsieur Yao HACCANDY de
la Banque Mondiale. Ce qui a permis aux participants d’avoir le même niveau de
connaissance du contenu du projet et des résultats obtenus. Ainsi, des débats fructueux et
enrichissants dirigés par le modérateur, ont permis non seulement de faire des
observations, mais aussi d’analyser et d'amender le rapport. Au cours des débats, des
questions pertinentes ont été soulevées, auxquelles des réponses satisfaisantes ont été
données par la coordination et ses partenaires impliqués dans la mise en œuvre du projet.

2.3 Présentation des résultats de l’évaluation finale du PUAPA

La seconde présentation qui a été donnée par Docteur Miaman Koné, consultant a porté
sur les conclusions liminaires de l’évaluation finale du PUAPA. L’objectif de cette
évaluation était de reconstituer les informations clés sur les principales réalisations du
projet d’une part, et d’évaluer ses effets et impacts d’autre part.
L’exposé s’articulait autour de : i) rappel des objectifs et résultats attendus de
l’évaluation, ii) aperçu de la démarche utilisée, iii) principales réalisations, iv) effets et
impact induits, v) niveau de satisfaction des bénéficiaires et vi) recommandations. Il est
ressorti de la présentation sur l’évaluation finale du projet une confirmation des résultats
présentés par le premier intervenant. Par ailleurs les effets et impacts relevés sont les
suivants :

   Le renforcement de l’opérationnalisation et de la synergie des services impliqués ;
   La dynamique insufflée par le projet a facilité l’intervention d’autres partenaires
    (PAM, PNUD, FAO, ONG, etc.)
   Le renforcement de la confiance entre les producteurs et les agents d’encadrement.
   Le projet a suscité chez les producteurs le besoin de s’organiser en groupements puis
    en union de groupements pour bénéficier plus facilement d’appui. Les organisations
    qui existaient déjà ont vu leurs activités redynamisées et ont enregistré de nouvelles
    adhésions.
   Le renforcement de la collaboration et de la synergie de travail entre la CNOPG,
    l’ANPROCA, et d’autres partenaires au développement;
   Le renforcement de la cohésion et de la solidarité au sein des producteurs membres de
    groupements :
   L’accroissement de l’utilisation rationnelle des intrants et l’amélioration des
    méthodes culturales.
   La résolution partielle des difficultés liées à l’indisponibilité des intrants et à leur
    accessibilité en milieu paysan au moment des travaux agricoles

Les résultats de l’évaluation (méthode de scoring avec notation sur 5 points) par les
unions des groupements de producteurs concernant le niveau de satisfaction des

                                             35
bénéficiaires montrent par ordre décroissant du niveau de satisfaction : 1) la démarche du
projet 2) la satisfaction des besoins en semences 3) la satisfaction des besoins en conseil
agricole 4) la satisfaction des besoins en engrais et 5) la satisfaction des besoins en
pesticide. Par ailleurs l’évaluation soulève trois préoccupations à savoir :
     Comment renouveler les semences en milieu paysan ?
       Quelles ressources pour racheter les stocks des producteurs de semences ?
       Comment relever le taux de recouvrement au niveau de l’engrais et des pesticides
        pour éviter l’arrêt de l’opération avec l’arrêt des appuis

Au terme de l’évaluation les enseignements tirés ont été les suivants :

   Dans le cadre de l’exécution des projets/programmes, lorsque les services sont
    responsabilisés en fonction de leur domaine de compétence, cela participe au
    renforcement de la synergie et à l’obtention de meilleurs résultats dans des contextes
    de projets d’urgence ;

   Le fait de responsabiliser les producteurs et leurs organisations dans la conduite du
    projet facilite la distribution et le recouvrement des intrants et constitue l’un des
    gages majeurs pour l’internalisation et la pérennisation de l’approvisionnement des
    producteurs en intrants ;

   Quand le paysan bénéficie à la fois de semences, d’intrants et de conseil agricole dans
    le temps, il s’en suit une amélioration de la productivité agricole ;

   Quand les exploitants ont accès au crédit, ils travaillent plus qu’habituellement. En
    effet, l’acquisition de semence, de l’engrais et des herbicides concoure à accroître
    significativement la taille des exploitations et le rendement ;

   Quand les producteurs sont formés sur les itinéraires techniques à travers des
    démonstrations, ils sont à mesure de mieux expliquer les résultats enregistrés et
    d’instruire leurs pairs

   La mise en œuvre du PUAPA a permis de susciter un débat sur la nécessité de mettre
    en place un système permanent d’approvisionnement des producteurs ;

   L’installation des unités de transformation au profit des groupements de femmes
    devrait être soumise à une étude de faisabilité préalable et les promoteurs doivent être
    assistés avec un conseil spécialisé ;

   Pour une meilleure évaluation de l’impact d’un projet avec une possibilité de
    quantifier les progrès enregistrés, il est impérieux de développer un suivi évaluation
    interne qui travaille à constituer les informations clés pouvant servir à l’évaluation de
    l’impact ; la définition d’une situation de référence et d’un système de collecte de
    données au démarrage du projet en sont des éléments clés.

   Les agents du conseil agricole ont besoin de disposer d’informations précises sur les
    exploitations pour leur propre gouverne et pour les communiquer aux paysans. La

                                                 36
   non-maîtrise de ces informations peut conduire de l’écart entre les déclarations des
   exploitants et ceux des agents.

Au terme de l’évaluation, deux types de recommandations ont été formulées : les
recommandations de mesures générales et les recommandations de mesures spécifiques :

Recommandation de mesures générales
   - Entretenir les acquis du projet en vue de les consolider durablement
   - Poursuivre les actions de redynamisation des services agricoles :
   - Développer des stratégies pour faciliter l’écoulement des surplus de production du
     riz ;
   - Développer une politique volontariste de réhabilitation des pistes rurales de
     désenclavement des zones de production
   - Etendre l’initiative d’aménagement et de réhabilitation des plaines et des bas-
     fonds :


Recommandation de mesures spécifiques
   - Responsabiliser au niveau de l’ANPROCA un service pour assurer le suivi-
     évaluation interne des projets sous sa tutelle et renforcer les capacités des agents à
     cet effet ;

   -   Mettre un accent sur l’informatisation du service. L’acquisition de matériels
       informatiques et le développement d’un système intranet sont de nature à faciliter
       la circulation de l’information, l’apprentissage, le rapportage, la gestion et
       l’archivage des données (la création d’une mémoire institutionnel) ;

   -   Développer une situation de référence pour faciliter les activités d’évaluation à
       mi-parcours et finale de la deuxième phase du projet.

   -   Au titre de la production des semences de base, i) renforcer les capacités des
       stations de recherche de l’IRAG pour qu’elles soient en mesure de fournir des
       semences de base aux multiplicateurs semenciers. ii) évaluer la demande de
       semences de base de chaque campagne afin de planifier leur production au niveau
       des stations de recherche ou toute autre structure spécialisée.

   -   Au titre des semences améliorées, envisager de poursuivre les actions d’appui en
       faveur de la multiplication et du conditionnement des semences pendant encore
       quelques années afin de mieux internaliser les mécanismes et acquis du projet.

   -   Au titre de l’approvisionnement des producteurs en intrants, tenir compte du
       calendrier cultural des régions naturelles, développer un système d’évaluation
       rapide des besoins en intrants et lancer le processus d’acquisition et de
       distribution à temps.



                                            37
   -   Le faible niveau de recouvrement des coûts des pesticides et engrais constaté doit
       faire l’objet d’investigations plus approfondies. Des ateliers devraient être
       organisés au niveau des préfectures touchées avec les unions pour mieux en
       cerner les causes et rechercher des solutions. Les expériences réussies devraient
       être répertoriées, documentées en vue de leur généralisation ;

   -   Au titre du renforcement de l’appui aux OP, il est important d’apporter un appui à
       la structuration des OP et de développer un conseil spécialisé en leur direction :

   -   Au titre du conseil agricole, il est recommandé, pour l’amélioration de la qualité
       des services fournis par l’ANPROCA, de poursuivre le déploiement et le
       renforcement des capacités des agents sur le terrain. Ces formations doivent être
       élargies aux Chefs des Opérations Agricoles et aux Directeurs Régionaux et elles
       doivent prendre en compte certains thèmes jusque-là marginalisés tel que l’appui
       à la structuration et à la gestion des OP, aux technologies post récoltes.

   -   Il est souhaitable de renforcer les représentations régionales en moyens de
       locomotion (véhicule de type 4x4 et motos) en équipements informatiques pour
       leur permettre d’assurer une meilleure coordination des activités sur le terrain.

   -   Au titre de la gestion du périmètre irrigué de Koba, il est recommandé de
       redynamiser le comité de gestion. Il s’agira plus spécifiquement de renforcer
       périodiquement les capacités du comité en matière d’entretien et de maintenance
       des ouvrages d’une part, et de renforcer les capacités de gestion du comité :
       mettre en place une base de données des producteurs, supports de gestion
       (maîtrise de la situation des personnes installées, gestion des redevances, entretien
       du périmètre) d’autre part.

   -   Renforcer également les capacités de l’union des groupements des producteurs
       travaillant sur le périmètre en vue de promouvoir un leadership permettant, outre
       une meilleure représentation des producteurs dans le comité de gestion du
       périmètre et la défense des intérêts de ses membres, de traiter efficacement les
       questions de formation de ses membres, d’approvisionnement en intrants et de
       commercialisation de la production.

2.4 CLÔTURE

Les cérémonies de clôture ont été précédées de la présentation par le modérateur et de
l’adoption par les participants, de la synthèse des éléments d’amendement du rapport
d’achèvement.

Monsieur Yao HACCANDY a saisi l’opportunité pour faire un rappel sur les bonnes
relations entre la République de Guinée et la Banque Mondiale et exprimer la
disponibilité de celle-ci à appuyer le Gouvernement dans son effort de lutte contre
l'insécurité alimentaire et la pauvreté. Il a en outre demandé que le rapport d’achèvement


                                            38
soit finalisé et transmis à la Banque dans le délai imparti tout en précisant que le rapport
d’achèvement de la Banque doit annexer celui du Gouvernement pour être déposé.

C’est ensuite le Directeur Général de l’Agence Nationale de la Promotion Rurale et du
Conseil Agricole (ANPRO-CA) Coordonnateur du PUAPA qui a, au nom du Ministre de
l’Agriculture, affirmé l’engagement du Département à faire siennes les contributions des
parties prenantes issues de l’atelier et à en prendre compte pour la finalisation du rapport
national d’achèvement du PUAPA. Il a félicité l’ensemble des participants pour la qualité
des résultats auxquels ils ont abouti avant de déclarer clos les travaux de l’atelier des
parties prenantes du PUAPA.

       RAPPORT D’ACHEVEMENT DU PROJET D’URGENCE D’APPUI A LA
            PRODUCTIVTE AGRICOLE (PUAPA-1) (Novembre 2012)

INTRODUCTION
Le Projet d’Urgence d’Appui à la Productivité Agricole (PUAPA) a été initié en 2008
par le Gouvernement Guinéen avec l’appui financier de la Banque Mondiale. Son objectif
était de contribuer à l’accroissement de la production du riz paddy à hauteur de 50% au
moins sur 35 000 hectares dans les régions de la Basse Guinée, de la Haute Guinée de la
Guinée Forestière. L’intervention devrait initialement concerner près de 70 000 ménages
agricoles mais rehausser à 90.250 ménages. Le projet est financé à titre d’un Don IDA
(Banque Mondiale) sur fonds d’urgence accordé au gouvernement Guinéen pour
assistance à la crise alimentaire à hauteur de 5 Millions de dollars US sans contrepartie
Guinéenne.
Le PUAPA est placé sous la tutelle du Ministère de l’Agriculture qui a délégué la
coordination à l’Agence Nationale de la Promotion Rurale et du Conseil Agricole
« ANPRO-CA ». Le projet s’est déroulé en deux phases : La première correspondant aux
campagnes de 2009 et 2010 et la seconde aux campagnes de 2011 et de 2012.
Au terme du Projet qui a clôturé le 30 juin 2012, il revient au Gouvernement d’apprécier
les résultats obtenus au regard des objectifs fixés, d’appréhender les impacts direct,
indirect ou induit et d’en tirer les leçons pour le futur.
C’est dans ce cadre que le présent rapport d’achèvement qui couvre ces deux phases a été
élaboré avec l’appui d’un consultant national dans un processus participatif impliquant
les différents acteurs de la mise en œuvre du projet en vue de prendre de façon privilégiée
leurs déclarations et opinions. Ce processus inclue i) l’exploitation de la documentation
disponible au niveau de la coordination du projet et de ses partenaires ii) la prise en
compte des résultats issues des enquêtes de terrain auprès des bénéficiaires dans le cadre
de l’évaluation finale du projet (réalisée par un consultant externe) et la contribution des
parties prenantes pour la finalisation du rapport, lors de l’atelier national organisé à cet
effet.
Ce rapport est donc une synthèse des principaux résultats et impact obtenus dans le cadre
de la mise en œuvre du PUAPA. Sa présentation tient compte du canevas accepté par
Banque mondiale en la matière et est structurée en cinq parties à savoir :
  I.     Description et démarrage du projet
 II.     Conception, réalisation et impact du projet
III.     Evaluation économique et financière du projet
IV.      Perspectives pour le futur pour la pérennisation des acquis
 V.      Conclusions

                                             41
   I- DESCRIPTION ET DEMARRAGE DU PROJET
   1.1 Historique du projet
La République de Guinée à l’instar des autres pays d’Afrique, a subi les effets néfastes de
la hausse des prix des produits alimentaires (notamment le riz) et pétroliers provoquée
par la crise alimentaire qui a ébranlé tout le monde entier et dont les soubresauts se font
encore sentir. Le riz constitue l’aliment de base de la majorité de la population, au cours
des années 2007-2008, le prix du sac de 50 kg de riz est passé de 120 000 GNF à 250 000
GNF en l’espace de quelques mois. Cette hausse des prix non seulement affecte très
sérieusement toute la population, en particulier les couches pauvres en zones rurales et
urbaines, mais aussi engendre des troubles sociaux préoccupants pour la stabilité
politique, et le développement économique du pays.
Dans le cadre de la résolution de cette crise alimentaire qu’a connu le monde entier en
général et en particulier les pays en voie de développement , le Gouvernement Guinéen a
pris d’importantes mesures d’ordre social et économique (la réduction provisoire des
taxes à l’importation du riz, l’augmentation des primes de transport des fonctionnaires et
des bourses des étudiants, la subvention du transport des élèves etc. ) en vue de résorber
la dite crise et la flambée des prix dont l’impact sur la stabilité et le développement
économique du pays sont fort préjudiciables.
Au terme des échanges du Gouvernement Guinéen avec les différents partenaires au
développement, une stratégie d’urgence a été définie avec une note technique sur la
sécurité alimentaire échéance 2008-2015. Cette note a fait l’objet d’échanges et de
discussions avec les partenaires au développement dont la Banque Mondiale sur la
possibilité d’atténuer la hausse des prix. A l’issue de ces discussions, la Banque Mondiale
et le Gouvernement de Guinée ont convenu de préparer et mettre en œuvre le projet
d’Urgence Appui à la Productivité Agricole (PUAPA) en Juillet 2008. La mise en œuvre
a débuté en novembre 2008.
De ce fait, le projet s’est déroulé en deux phases. La première correspondant aux
campagnes de 2009 et 2010 et la seconde aux campagnes de 2011 et de 2012. Les
indicateurs-clés de performance du projet sont : (i) au moins 50% d’accroissement de
rendement chez les petits producteurs de riz bénéficiaires du projet et (ii) au moins
90 250 petits producteurs et productrices sont des bénéficiaires directes du projet.
Le projet est financé à titre d’un Don IDA (Banque Mondiale) sur fonds d’urgence
accordé au gouvernement Guinéen pour assistance à la crise alimentaire à hauteur de 5
Millions de dollars US sans contrepartie Guinéenne.
Pour une meilleure efficacité, dix huit préfectures sur trente trois que compte le pays
reparties dans trois régions naturelles sur quatre ont été couvertes soient :

   •   Basse Guinée : Préfectures de Boké, Boffa, Dubreka, Coyah, Forécariah et Kindia

   •   Haute Guinée : Préfectures de Kouroussa, Faranah, Kankan, Kérouané, Mandiana
       et Siguiri


                                            42
   •   Guinée Forestière : Préfectures de Beyla, Guéckédou, Kissidougou, Macenta,
       Lola et N’Zérékoré.
Le choix de la zone de couverture du projet a reposé essentiellement sur les potentialités
rizicoles de chaque région et sur les possibilités d’accès.
Le projet est sous la tutelle du Ministère de l’Agriculture qui a mis en place un Comité de
Pilotage avec une bonne représentation des autres institutions non étatiques au sein de ce
comité. La coordination du projet a été déléguée à l’Agence Nationale Promotion Rurale
et du Conseil Agricole (ANPROCA). La mise en œuvre des activités de distribution des
paquets technologiques et de recouvrement du coût des intrants était confiée à la
Confédération Nationale des Organisations paysannes (CNOP-G) et la gestion fiduciaire,
est assurée par l’unité de gestion fiduciaire du Programme d’Appui aux Collectivités
Villageoises (PACV) financé par la Banque mondiale. Les activités de terrain ont été
exécutées par les services techniques du Ministère de l’Agriculture.
   1.2 Objectifs du Projet
L’objectif sectoriel à long terme est de contribuer en Guinée à la réduction de la pauvreté
et à la sécurité alimentaire dans les zones couvertes par le projet.
L’objectif spécifique à court terme est de contribuer à l’accroissement de la production
du riz paddy à hauteur de 50% au moins sur 35 000 hectares pour une production de 90
000 à 100 000 tonnes dans les régions de la Basse Guinée, de la Haute Guinée de la
Guinée Forestière. L’intervention devrait initialement concerner près de 70 000 ménages
agricoles mais rehausser à 90.250 ménages.

   1.3 Composantes du projet : objectifs et résultats attendus
Le projet s’articule essentiellement autour de trois principales composantes à savoir :
 (i) Production et approvisionnement en semences améliorées qui visait à renforcer les
capacités des petits producteurs semenciers et à appuyer la production de 90 tonnes de
semences de base, et d’approvisionner les petits producteurs avec 2 000 tonnes de
semences améliorées. Les activités qui étaient prévues dans ce cadre étaient : la collecte
et le contrôle de la qualité des semences, l’achat et le transport vers les centres de
traitement, le conditionnement et le stockage des semences, le contrôle de qualité à
postériori et la distribution des semences.
 (ii) Approvisionnement en engrais et pesticides : Cette composante visait à rendre
disponible pour les petits producteurs 2 000 tonnes d’engrais et 20 000 litres de pesticides
dont 15 000 litres d’herbicides et 5000 litres d’insecticides pour couvrir 35 000 hectares
de riz. A ce titre les activités prévues étaient les suivantes: préparation et lancement de
DAO, passation des marchés et réception et le transport des engrais et pesticides.
(iii) Distribution des paquets d’intrants et Appui conseil : Cette composante visait à
rendre disponible et à distribuer à temps et de manière transparente les intrants agricoles
et assurer le conseil agricole. Les objectifs poursuivis à ce niveau étaient les suivants :


                                            43
        Formation technique de 90.250 chefs d’exploitation et de 115 techniciens ;

            PROJET
2.1      Evaluation de la conception
Le projet est globalement pertinent puisque répondant à des besoins réels de populations
démunies, vivant dans des zones pauvres de la Guinée. Il existe un cadre logique cohérent
entre les différents composants du projet. L’objectif général et les résultats attendus sont
clairs et logiques, tout comme les objectifs spécifiques qui sont bien distincts. Ils sont
cohérents à travers leur conformité aux priorités et stratégies de la Banque. Les objectifs
spécifiques étaient bien distincts et réalisables compte tenu de l’opérationnalité des
acteurs impliqués dans la mise en œuvre.
Pour la mise en œuvre, les moyens et les activités prévus ont été globalement appropriés
et respectés pour atteindre les objectifs spécifiques et globaux. Ainsi, grâce à la
pertinence du projet et à l’efficacité des acteurs, les résultats atteints à ce jour vont dans
le sens de l’atteinte des objectifs spécifiques.
Le degré de pertinence de la logique d’intervention s’avère toujours d’actualité et les
résultats atteints dans la mise en œuvre du projet justifient et encouragent un tel
financement. Il s’agit pour le Gouvernement de trouver des voies et moyens de
consolidation des acquis et de valorisation des expériences acquises. Evidemment, cela
ne va pas sans le soutien financier des partenaires au développement intéressés par
l’appui au développement agricole et rural en faveur des pauvres.

2.2      Evaluation des principaux résultats au regard des objectifs
L’évaluation des principaux résultats au regard des objectifs se présente comme suit.
Composante Production et approvisionnement en semences améliorées : le volet
production de semence de base a été confié à l’Institut de Recherche agronomique de
Guinée (IRAG) à travers deux de ses stations de recherche (Kilissi et Koba). Sur une
prévision de production de 90 tonnes de semences, 45 tonnes ont été produites par le
centre de Kilissi soit un taux de 50%. Le centre de Koba a enregistré un échec dû à des
crues imprévues qui ont inondé la parcelle de production de semence. Le projet a
également acheté et fait distribuer 1503 tonnes de semences de variétés améliorées de
qualité acceptable pour une prévision de 2000 tonnes soit un taux de réalisation de 75%.
Les semences ont été vendues à crédit puis recouvrées en nature à la fin de la campagne.
Les 488, 085 tonnes de semences distribuées pour la campagne agricole 2009-2010 ont
été recouvrées à près de 90,68%. En 2011-12 le taux de recouvrement a atteint 98,96%
pour 1641, 880 tonnes distribuées.
Globalement le projet a été une opportunité pour restaurer après une dizaine d’années, le
système de production de semences de riz en Guinée. Le projet a notamment favorisé la
reprise des activités des institutions en charge de la production et du contrôle des
semences. Il a permis de renforcer les activités des centres de conditionnement qui étaient
quasiment interrompues, renforcer la dynamique associative au niveau des producteurs,
assurer un appui conseil plus rapproché des producteurs semenciers, renouveler l’intérêt


                                             45
de voter et de promulguer une loi semencière et renforcer la synergie d’actions et la
complémentarité des différents acteurs impliqués.
Composante Approvisionnement en engrais et pesticides :
Cette composante visait à acheter et rendre disponible au niveau des petits producteurs
2000 tonnes d’engrais, 15. 000 litres d’herbicides et 5000 litres d’insecticides pour
couvrir 35.000 hectares. La mise en œuvre de cette composante a permis d’acheter
effectivement les quantités les quantités prévues d’herbicide et de pesticides soit un taux
de réalisation de 100%. Ce qui n’a pas été pour les engrais avec un achat de 1215 tonnes
soit 60,75% des prévisions dont 625, 750 tonnes d’engrais NPK et 589, 250 d’urée. Cette
situation est due au fait que le processus d’achat de 1000 tonnes d’engrais en vue du
remboursement de l’engrais cédé par le gouvernement pour la dernière année du projet,
sur les ressources du Don au Gouvernement Guinéen, n’est pas allé à son terme avant la
date de clôture du projet. En effet face à la difficulté d’approvisionnement en engrais
constaté au début de la campagne agricole 2011-2012 le Gouvernement a cédé sous
forme de prêt 1000 tonnes d’engrais.
Les engrais et les pesticides ont été vendus à crédit puis recouvrés en espèce en fin de
campagne. Au titre de la campagne 2009-2010 le taux de recouvrement des engrais
distribués était de 78,57%. En 2011-2012 le taux était de 51,70%. S’agissant des
pesticides (herbicides et insecticides) le recouvrement au cours de la première campagne
était de 12,49% et le taux a atteint 69,9% au titre de la seconde campagne. La raison
essentielle évoquée pour expliquer la faiblesse du recouvrement concernent le retard dans
la livraison des engrais et pesticides par rapport aux périodes d’application.
L’estimation des superficies sur la base de la quantité de semence rapportée à la dose
moyenne à l’hectare (70 kg) donne une superficie de 38.970 hectares sur laquelle les
technologies ont été appliquées sur 35.000 prévus soit 111% de réalisation. Cette
superficie atteindrait 73.789 hectares quand on considère la redistribution de semences
au titre de la campagne 2012-2013 qui tire vers la fin avec les récoltes en cours jusqu’en
novembre-décembre.
Composante distribution des intrants et appui conseil aux producteurs :
Cette composante visait la formation technique des chefs d’exploitation (90.250) et des
techniciens (115) de l’ANPROCA, la mise en place de 450 démonstrations des
technologies et la diffusion des paquets technologiques à temps (y compris les activités
de post récolte et les travaux sur les ouvrages du périmètre de Koba).

Au terme du projet, l’appui conseil aux producteurs a couvert 498 villages répartis dans
90 communes rurales, à travers des formations pratiques, la mise en place et le suivi de
parcelles de démonstration. Ce sont 375 parcelles de démonstration qui ont été mises en
place sur les 450 prévues soit 83% et le cumul du nombre de producteurs ayant reçu les
paquets d’intrants et l’appui conseil représente 163% de l’objectif prévu soit 147 578
exploitants sur 90 250. Le cumul de la superficie couverte fait 73 769 hectares sur un
objectif de trente cinq mille (35 000) hectares soit un taux de réalisation d’environ 211%.
S’agissant de la réhabilitation des périmètres, sur une prévision de 1000 hectares ce sont

                                            46
900 hectares qui ont pu être effectivement réhabilités sur un même site soit un taux de
90% de réalisation. Les rendements du paddy chez quelques paysans enquêtés sont passés
de 1,3 à 2,82 tonnes à hectare soit 138% en Basse Guinée ; de 1,5 à 2,4 tonnes/ha soit
60% en Haute Guinée et de 1,3 à 2,5 tonnes/ha soit 92% en Guinée Forestière. Pour cette
composante, l’indicateur de résultat (50%) en matière de rendement est largement
dépassé chez les producteurs qui ont bénéficié de des paquets technologiques et de
l’appui conseil.
Au point de vue formation, les techniciens et les bénéficiaires directs du projet (membres
des groupements) ont tous eu accès aux actions formation. Ces formations ont concerné
aussi bien des responsables que les membres des groupements. Ils tirent largement profit
de ces formations et perçoivent les bénéfices à travers leurs activités de production. Ils
ont bénéficié de formation dans divers domaines :

      La formation technique de masse a concerné les membres de groupements et a
       porté essentiellement sur les itinéraires techniques de la culture du riz. Ces
       formations se sont déroulées en situation, dans les champs en respectant le
       calendrier cultural des producteurs. La démonstration pratiquée autour de chaque
       thème précis a été un moyen adapté dès lors que les producteurs réunis ont eu une
       participation active et un apprentissage direct qui ont favorisé la maîtrise et
       l’adoption des techniques.

      Les formations spécifiques ont concerné aussi bien des techniciens que quelques
       membres chargés d’exercer une fonction technique pour le renforcement des
       capacités des groupements.

Dans le cadre de l’appui aux activités post récolte, deux unités (sur deux prévues)
constituées de batteuse, d’étuveuses, de décortiqueuses, de bascule et bâches ont été
octroyées à titre pilote, à des groupements de femmes respectivement en Basse Guinée et
en Guinée Forestière. Les membres de ces groupements ont bénéficié de formation mais

                                           47
l’exploitation des équipements n’a pas atteint la rentabilité attendue par manque de suivi
de l’exploitation et de la gestion des recettes.
Coordination, Gestion et suivi évaluation :

La coordination et la gestion du projet sont jugées satisfaisantes. Le dispositif de gestion
financière mis en place a fonctionné correctement. Selon la Banque, la performance de la
gestion financière est jugée satisfaisante et le risque y relatif est estimé modéré. Les
comptes audités ont été certifiés sans réserve par l’auditeur.

Le taux de décaissement du projet a atteint 98%. A la fin du projet le budget global de
cinq millions (5000.000 $) a été globalement exécuté à hauteur de 78,60 %. Ce taux est
lié au fait qu’une activité importante du plan de passation des marchés à savoir la relance
de la procédure d’achat des engrais n’a pas été mise en œuvre de manière satisfaisante.
Le solde du compte désigné est d’environ un million de dollars. Ce montant devait servir
au paiement de l’engrais en remboursement de l’avance en nature faite par le
Gouvernement mais la livraison et le paiement n’ont pas pu se faire avant la clôture du
projet au 30 juin 2012.
Au niveau du suivi évaluation du projet, il n’a pas été prévu de dispositif de suivi interne
et le suivi externe est assuré par le Bureau de stratégie et de développement du
ministère de l’agriculture. Ce volet a constitué le maillon faible de la mise en œuvre du
projet et n’a pas permis d’apprécier à sa juste valeur les résultats et impact du projet

2.3    Impact du projet dans la mise en œuvre des politiques nationales
Le PUAPA est en conformité avec les priorités et politiques de développement de la
Guinée.
La stratégie de Réduction de la pauvreté (SRP) : Le Projet répond à l’objectif de
création de richesse pour une croissance pro pauvre, assigné à la Stratégie de réduction de
la pauvreté 2007-2010. En particulier, il soutient les orientations prioritaires relatives à
l’intégration des filières au marché, et notamment l’intensification et la modernisation de
la production agricole. Il s’appuie également sur les travaux qui ont été conduits pour la
formulation de la Politique Nationale de Développement Agricole Vision 2015, ainsi que
l’Initiative pour la fertilité des sols, le schéma directeur de la petite irrigation, et la
Politique foncière.

•       La Politique Nationale de Développement Agricole Vision 2015 (PNDA) Elle
vise principalement à exploiter les poches de productivité en vue de l’accroissement de la
production agricole et la réalisation des objectifs de sécurité alimentaire et de réduction
de la pauvreté. Elle se présente en trois axes stratégiques, à savoir : i) le renforcement de
la sécurité alimentaire par la diversification et l’accroissement des productions vivrières
et animales pour promouvoir la souveraineté alimentaire ; ii) l’accroissement des revenus
agricoles par le développement des opportunités économiques et l’amélioration de l’accès
au marché dans le cadre de la lutte contre la pauvreté ; et iii) le développement des
mesures transversales d’accompagnement pour garantir l’efficacité des investissements.


                                             48
A ce niveau il s’avère que le choix de la zone de couverture du PUAPA a reposé
essentiellement sur les potentialités rizicoles de chaque région et sur les possibilités
d’accès. La mise en œuvre du PUAPA s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’application des axes
stratégiques de la PNDA et les activités menées ont permis i) d’améliorer les rendements
de la culture de riz et d’augmenter la production au niveau des exploitations touchées ii)
de créer des opportunités économiques avec l’achat des semences avec les producteurs
iii) d’assurer la formation des producteurs et renforcer leurs organisations pour une
autonomie progressive.

•       Programme National d’Investissement Agricole et Sécurité Alimentaire
(PNIASA) : Deux préoccupations essentielles caractérisent le PNIASA qui sont : i)
l’amélioration des conditions de travail et l’accès au revenu des femmes qui constituent
près des 2/3 des actifs agricoles ii) l’implication et la responsabilisation des organisations
professionnelles d’agriculteurs. La mise en œuvre du PUAPA tient compte de ces axes
favorisant l’accès des femmes aux ressources (terre aménagée à Koba) aux intrants
agricoles, à l’information et à la formation. L’implication et la responsabilisation de la
Confédération Nationale des Organisations Paysannes de Guinée (CNOP-G) à travers
l’exécution des activités de distribution des intrants et de recouvrement des coûts a accru
sa crédibilité au près de ses membres, des décideurs et des partenaires au développement.
Cette implication a été également une opportunité de renforcement de capacités de ses
membres et de dynamisation de son dispositif d’approvisionnement.

•       Stratégie Nationale de Sécurité Alimentaire (SNSA) : Le Gouvernement a adopté
en 2007 une Stratégie Nationale de Sécurité Alimentaire (SNSA). Elle stipule que
l’insécurité alimentaire en Guinée est surtout causée par une faible capacité de gestion de
l’eau durant la contre saison et le manque d’infrastructures de stockage et de
conservation. Dans ce contexte la mise en œuvre du PUAPA a permis de réhabiliter 900
hectares avec une maîtrise totale de l’eau. Cela a permis à des centaines de producteurs
d’avoir l’accès aux terres aménagées, d’appliquer des techniques de production
recommandées et d’enregistrer de bons rendements.

•       Stratégie Nationale de Développement de la Riziculture : La stratégie de la
riziculture est axée principalement sur l’amélioration des rendements moyens du riz de
1,4 à 2,8 tonnes à l’hectare entre 2008 et 2018. Elle s’articule sur la création de deux
pôles de développement (Basse et Haute Guinée) par l’aménagement de superficies sous
gestion durable, le soutien à la riziculture pluviale par une large diffusion des variétés
améliorées de riz et l’accès aux intrants et équipements agricoles.
Dans ce contexte la mise en œuvre du PUAPA est en adéquation avec la stratégie
nationale de développement de la riziculture car le projet couvre trois régions dont la
Haute et la Basse Guinée et a permis de réhabiliter 900 ha en Basse Guinée, acheter et
distribuer 1503 tonnes de semences, 1215 tonnes d’engrais, 15000 litres d’herbicides et
5000 litres d’insecticides. Au cours de durée du projet les rendements du paddy chez
quelques paysans enquêtés ont augmenté de 60% en Haute Guinée, 92% en Guinée
Forestière et de 138% en Basse Guinée.

2.4       Analyse de l’action de Banque Mondiale et du Gouvernement
Les actions de la Banque Mondiale et du Gouvernement au cours de l’exécution du projet
concernent essentiellement les dispositions et décisions prises qui ont favorisé la bonne
réalisation des objectifs poursuivis. Dans ce cadre, les responsabilités des différents
acteurs et bénéficiaires ont été clairement définies au moment de la conception du projet.
Les procédures d’acquisition de biens, services et travaux appliquées sont celles du
Gouvernement et de la Banque.
La Banque et le Gouvernement ont développé de fortes capacités d’adaptation durant la
mise en œuvre du projet par rapport aux changements externes survenus. En effet, la
Banque et le Gouvernement ont su s’adapter aux situations imprévues que la Guinée a
connues en 2008 avec le changement de régime et en trouver des solutions idoines avec :

      •   l’accord trouvé entre les deux parties pour l’utilisation du montant de deux
          millions de dollars (2000.000 $) qui était déjà décaissé avant les dispositions de
          suspension des financements tout en révisant les objectifs initiaux en fonction du
          montant disponible.

      •   La demande justifiée d’une prorogation de la date de clôture au 30 juin 2012
          formulée par le Gouvernement et acceptée par la Banque qui a permis la
          programmation de l’utilisation des trois millions de dollars qui restaient sur le
          Don de cinq millions de dollars (5000.000 $). L’objectif de la prorogation de la
          date de clôture du projet était de poursuivre la mise en œuvre du projet afin
          d’atteindre les objectifs initiaux de développement et spécifiques.

2.5       Appréciation de l’action du Gouvernement au cours de l’exécution du projet
Au cours de la mise en œuvre du projet le Gouvernement s’est conformé aux accords
conclus dans le cadre du projet et aux dispositions fudiciaires prévues. Le Gouvernement
a mis en place un comité de pilotage constitué de divers représentants qui a assuré la
validation et le suivi de l’exécution des programmes de travail et budget annuels (PTBA).
Les rapports annuels étaient également soumis à l’approbation de ce comité. Les rapports
annuels d’activités et d’ateliers spécifiques ont toujours été envoyés à la Banque. Le
Gouvernement a également été attentif aux conclusions et recommandations formulées
par la Banque dans le cadre de ses missions de supervision du projet.

2.6       Appréciation de l’action de la Banque au cours de l’exécution du projet
Les objectifs du projet sont pertinents pour les priorités du pays et conformes à la
stratégie et aux priorités générales de la Banque. Ils sont réalisables au regard des
contributions au projet. Le cadre logique prévoit un enchaînement causal logique pour la
réalisation des objectifs de développement du projet. Les systèmes de passation de
marchés, de gestion financière, et de suivi sont fondés sur les systèmes qu’utilise déjà le
pays.
La Banque a régulièrement effectué les décaissements de fonds selon les procédures et
émis les avis de non objection généralement dans les délais requis. Au point de vue appui

                                              50
de la Banque, en dépit des missions de supervision qui constituent une des opportunités,
la Banque a accepté l’engagement d’un consultant qui a régulièrement effectué des
missions d’appui en faveur de la coordination du projet. La qualité de la supervision de la
banque a été satisfaisante en termes de dosage des compétences et de praticabilité des
solutions. Le suivi de la gestion du projet par la Banque a été satisfaisant.
2.6  Appréciation de l’efficacité et de la qualité des relations entre la Banque
Mondiale et le Gouvernement au cours de l’exécution du projet
Les relations entre la Banque mondiale et le Gouvernement ont été bonnes tant sur le plan
technique que sur le plan financier et toutes les décisions ont souvent fait l’objet
d’échanges au cours des missions de supervision avant leur finalisation. Sur le plan des
missions de supervision, elles ont été régulièrement réalisées et les recommandations qui
en découlaient ont été régulièrement assumées par la Banque et la partie Guinéenne
La Banque et le Gouvernement ont su tirer les leçons de la mise en œuvre du projet et
envisager de commun accord à la poursuite des expériences réussies et à la consolidation
des acquis en initiant un second projet d’urgence d’appui à la productivité agricole
(PUAPA2) d’une durée de trois ans.
2.7    Evaluation de la performance des différentes institutions et personnes
ressources ayant participé à la réalisation du projet.
Agence Nationale de la Promotion Rurale et du Coneil Agricole : La coordination du
PUAPA a été assurée par l’ANPROCA dont le Directeur Général est le Coordinateur
National du Projet. L’Unité de Gestion est chargée de coordonner, gérer, assurer le suivi
et l’évaluation du projet. De manière plus spécifique, elle était chargée de : i) Planifier les
activités du projet en concertation avec les différents partenaires, ii) soumettre le plan de
travail annuel et le budget au Comité de pilotage pour approbation ; iii) gérer le projet
avec l’appui des autres acteurs et la Cellule de Gestion Fiduciaire du PACV iv) Apporter
les appuis techniques sur le terrain.
Par ailleurs l’ANPROCA à travers ses services déconcentrés est également chargée de :
l’information et de la sensibilisation des bénéficiaires sur les objectifs et les modalités de
mise en œuvre du projet ; la formation technique des producteurs sur des thèmes relatifs à
leurs besoins ; la diffusion des technologies sous formes de paquets techniques.

Par rapport à ces missions la coordination et gestion du projet ainsi que les activités
d’appui conseil, ont été satisfaisantes car en dépit de quelques contraintes rencontrées
notamment i) le blocage successif des comptes du projet par les autorités politiques, la
lenteur administrative dans la signature des contrats de fourniture des engrais et
pesticides, le projet a pu exécuter la majorité des activités planifiées.
Cellule fiduciaire du PACV : elle était spécifiquement chargée d’assurer la gestion de la
passation des marchés, la gestion des décaissements et des demandes de remboursement
de fonds, la préparation des états et rapports financiers. Le dispositif de gestion financière
mis en place a fonctionné correctement. Selon la Banque, la performance de la gestion
financière est jugée satisfaisante et le risque y relatif est estimé modéré. Les comptes

                                              51
audités ont été certifiés sans réserve par l’auditeur. Le taux de décaissement du projet a
atteint 98% avec une exécution globale de 78,6%. Ce taux est du au fait qu’une activité
importante du plan de passation des marchés à savoir la relance de la procédure d’achat
des engrais n’a pas abouti. Ce montant devait servir au paiement de l’engrais en
remboursement de l’avance en nature faite par le Gouvernement en 2011.
Confédération Nationale des Organisations Paysannes : De par ses attributions et du
fait qu’elle dispose des structures et représentations dans les quatre régions naturelles de
la zone d’intervention du projet, la CNOP-G a été un partenaire à part entière dans la
mise en œuvre du PUAPA. La CNOP-G avait la responsabilité de :
    • l’information, la sensibilisation et l’identification des bénéficiaires,
    • l’achat des semences de riz auprès des producteurs semenciers,

   •   la distribution des kits/menus d’intrants agricoles aux producteurs,

   •   du recouvrement des coûts des intrants agricoles,
Ces missions ont été globalement accomplies de manière assez satisfaisante soit : l’achat
et la distribution des semences améliorées (122% de réalisation), recouvrement des
semences, à hauteur de 90,68% en 2009-2010 et 98,96% en 2012. Sur les quantités
d’engrais prévues 60,75% ont été fournies et le recouvrement de la valeur se chiffre à
78,57% en 2009-2010 contre 51,70% en 2012. S’agissant des pesticides, 100% des
quantités prévues ont été distribuées et les taux de recouvrement ont été respectivement
de 12,49% en 2009-2010 et de 69,9% en 2011-2012.
Direction nationale du Génie Rural (DNGR) : la DGNR était chargée de : i)la
réalisation des études pour la préparation des Avants Projets Détaillées (APD) et les
dossiers d’appel d’offres (DAO) des ouvrages à réhabiliter, la supervision des travaux de
réhabilitation etla réception des travaux de réhabilitation. Les superficies prévues pour la
réhabilitation de domaines amenagés ont été réalisées à 90%.
Direction Nationale de l’Agriculture : La DNA a travers la Division « semence,
fertilisants et plants » était responsable de : i) contrôle des champs semenciers, des stocks
et lots de semences (en magasins et au laboratoire); ii) la certification des semences
contrôlées et la formation des techniciens. Le contrôle a été effectué sans pour autant
pouvoir visiter tous les sites à cause de l’insuffisance de personnel qualifié. Les
formations ont concerné 35 techniciens et 81 producteurs.
Institut de Recherche Agronomique de Guinée(IRAG) : l’IRAG à travers les stations de
Kilissi et Koa, était responsable de la production des semences de base. Cette opération a
été bien menée au niveau de Kilissi et moins bien à koba. Au total l’objectif a été réalisé
à 50%.

Bureau de Stratégie et de Développement (BSD) : le BSD avait la responsabilité du suivi
évaluation externe. A ce titre il devra : i) centraliser, synthétiser et exploiter les fiches de
collecte de données sur les résultats du projet, ii)former le personnel concerné par les
activités de suivi évaluation iii) élaborer et diffuser des tableaux de bords et des rapports
périodiques. Au terme du projet il a été constaté que le suivi évaluation a constitué le
maillon faible de la mise en œuvre du projet et n’a donc pas permis d’apprécier à sa juste

                                              52
valeur les résultats du projet. Le système de collecte des données sur le projet n’ayant pas
été mis en place, les données fiables disponibles qui ont permis de renseigner le cadre des
résultats sont le fait de l’ANPROCA et de la CNOP-G. Ces données ont été confirmées
et/ou complétées au cours de l’évaluation finale du projet conduite par un consultant
externe.

Au titre de contrepartie guinéenne il n’y a pas eu de paiement car le financement du
projet n’en a pas prévu. Par ailleurs les taxes et autres droits liés à l’acquisition des
immobilisations et aux importations de biens et services ne peuvent être considérés
comme contrepartie car n’ont jamais fait objet de valorisation.

3.2 Coûts récurrents engendrés par le projet ayant un impact sur le budget de l’Etat
La mise en œuvre du projet n’a pas engendré de coûts récurrents en soi. Cependant la
situation de non remboursement des engrais avancés par le Gouvernement au titre de la
campagne agricole 2011 constitue un manque à gagner qui ressort dans le taux de
recouvrement des engrais livrés à crédit par le Gouvernement à travers la Chambre
Nationale de l’Agriculture. Par conséquent, la reconstitution partielle d’un fonds d’appui
à l’accès aux intrants pourrait être préjudiciable à la continuité de l’action.

3.3 Conséquences prévisibles de la fin du projet sur les structures institutionnelles
mises en place dans le cadre du projet
L’ancrage institutionnel du projet s’est appuyé sur des structures déjà existantes (services
techniques du Ministère de l’agriculture, Confédération Nationale des Organisations
Paysannes de Guinée (CNOP-G) et le PACV) qui ne sont pas liées à la durée du projet.
Toutefois le projet avait permis de recruter un personnel d’appui (assistant comptable,
secrétaire, chauffeurs) qui ont été remercié à la clôture du projet.

IV Principales leçons à tirer
Au terme du PUAPA, les principales leçons à tirer sont les suivantes :
      La conception et la mise en œuvre du PUAPA répondent à un besoin réel et les
       actions réalisées suscitent un grand intérêt chez les bénéficiaires. Les objectifs du
       projet sont conformes aux politiques et stratégies de développement agricole ainsi
       qu’à la stratégie de lutte contre la pauvreté.
      La mise en œuvre du PUAPA a permis de confirmer l’intérêt que les producteurs
       portent aussi bien à la disponibilité et à l’utilisation des d’intrants (semences,
       engrais, pesticides) qu’aux aménagements hydro-agricoles et infrastructures pour
       obtenir un accroissement subséquent de la production agricole.
      L’augmentation effective des rendements de riz chez les producteurs qui ont
       bénéficié des paquets technologiques et des conseils pour leur bonne application
       montre que les objectifs de développement et spécifiques initiaux du projet sont
       pertinents et réalisables
      Le renforcement des capacités dans divers domaines a permis aux producteurs
       d’améliorer leurs résultats techniques et économiques. L’application des
       connaissances reçues leur a permis d’arriver à améliorer les rendements des
       cultures et augmenter la production. Il existe une certaine complémentarité entre
       les actions du projet et celles de certains organismes et institutions de
       développement qui renforce les changements positifs et l’impact des
       interventions.
      L’implication de la CNOPG dans la mise en œuvre du projet a fortement accru sa
       crédibilité vis-à-vis de ses membres, des décideurs et de certains bailleurs. Les
       résultats obtenus ont favorisé le raffermissement de la position et du rôle des
       organisations des producteurs dans le développement agricole.
      La capacité de gestion des équipements collectifs augmente quand ceux-ci
       répondent à des besoins réels, ressentis comme prioritaires par les utilisateurs.
       Avant de décider la mise en place d’un équipement collectif, il convient donc
       d’identifier avec le groupe cible, le problème qu’il est censé résoudre et se
       rassurer de sa rentabilité.
      Les résultats atteints (parfois dépassant les prévisions) à ce jour sont hautement
       significatifs par rapport aux indicateurs de l’objectif global et des objectifs

                                            54
        spécifiques et contribuent à l’amélioration de la sécurité alimentaire dans la zone
        couverte par le projet.
       La dynamique des groupements sur le terrain, l’appropriation faite des techniques
        culturales, la disponibilité de l’eau d’irrigation, la facilitation de l’accès aux
        intrants (semences, engrais, pesticides,) sont des facteurs favorables à la poursuite
        et au développement des actions initiées par le projet.
       Grâce à la pertinence de l’intervention, à l’efficacité des acteurs et à la dynamique
        des bénéficiaires, les résultats obtenus par le projet à ce niveau vont dans le sens
        de l’atteinte des objectifs, induisent un impact notable perçu et reconnu par les
        bénéficiaires, justifient et encouragent un tel projet d’appui en faveur des
        populations rurales. Cependant ces acquis restent encore fragiles et requiert une
        consolidation dans les années à venir.
IV PERSPECTIVES POUR LE FUTUR POUR LA PERENNISATION DES
ACQUIS
La conception et mise en œuvre du PUAPA encourage la valorisation des expériences
réussies pour de nouveaux programmes. Ces programmes doivent partir des acquis du
PUAPA précédent pour ouvrir de nouveaux espaces d’initiatives qui contribueront
davantage au soutien et à l’amélioration de la productivité agricole. Pour ce faire :
Consolidation des acquis : Le PUAPA a pris le pari de contribuer au renforcement des
organisations paysannes autour d’activités économiques rentables : production,
transformation, commercialisation. Cette démarche doit être poursuivie et renforcée avec
un effort supplémentaire dans le domaine de l’appui à l’organisation et au
fonctionnement des groupements et des unions. Pour des programmes futurs, ce volet doit
avoir une importance réelle et explicite pour favoriser le transfert de certaines fonctions
au niveau de ces organisations de base et de niveau intermédiaire.
Aménagement hydro agricole : les réhabilitations dans les périmètres aménagés en vue
d’accroitre l’accès à un plus grand nombre de ménages doit être poursuivie et
l’exploitation en toute saison suscitée partout où les conditions sont réunies.
Renforcement des capacités des producteurs : la poursuite de l’appui aux groupements
de producteurs à travers la CNOP-G est une condition nécessaire pour qu’ils maîtrisent
les changements techniques sociaux et culturels que leur impose l’environnement ou
auquel ils aspirent. Cet appui passe par :

•   La poursuite de l’appui en matière d’engrais, de semence et de petits équipements de
    transformation ;

•   Le renforcement des acquis des groupements dans la maîtrise des fonctions qui leur
    sont dévolues dans la gestion et la mise en valeur des périmètres ainsi que de
    l’organisation des filières ;




                                             55
•   L’encouragement de synergie entre les différents groupements pour que s’impose peu
    à peu la nécessité d’un débat au niveau local et préfectoral sur des questions de
    développement agricole.

•   Des actions d’appui dans le domaine de la transformation permettant de connaître les
    marchés, développer des circuits courts de commercialisation et promouvoir la
    transformation des produits pour une meilleure conservation.

•   Des actions de formation permettant aux groupements d’acquérir des savoir-faire
    directement utilisables et de développer leurs capacités d’analyse et d’action,
    d’initiative et de négociation en vue d’améliorer leurs résultats technique et
    économique et d’accroitre leur autonomie par rapport à l’extérieur.


Renforcement des capacités des agents de terrain : Les conditions de production vont
changer pour les bénéficiaires. Cela doit nécessairement s’accompagner d’une évolution
des savoir faire tant sur le plan technique, économique que sur plan de la gestion des
moyens. C’est pourquoi la capacité des agents de terrain impliqués dans leur appui à
trouver des solutions durables sera déterminante pour l’orientation des évolutions et la
participation des producteurs. C’est dans ce cadre qu’il doit être envisagé davantage le
renforcement des capacités des conseillers agricoles. Il s’agira alors de donner aux
conseillers, un ensemble de méthodes et d’outils de travail, leur permettant au-delà des
fonctions d’information et de formation dans le cadre de transfert de technologies, assurer
une fonction d’animation d’échanges directs entre les producteurs, d’appui à la recherche
de solutions des problèmes identifiés et de conseil aux producteurs, tant au point de vue
technique, qu’économique et organisationnel.
Mise en place d’un système de suivi évaluation interne : Plusieurs acteurs et décideurs
gravitent autour des actions d’un projet aux différents niveaux d’intervention. Ces acteurs
et décideurs ont besoin d’être informés en temps réels sur les réalisations (physiques et
financières) et les résultats du projet afin de prendre les décisions qui s’imposent pour
améliorer son efficacité. Il est donc nécessaire qu’un dispositif efficace et fonctionnel de
Suivi- Evaluation interne soit mis en place dès le démarrage de futur projet. Son objectif
est d’aider les prises de décision. Il se veut donc un outil interne devant répondre aux
besoins d’informations pour la gestion interne et la supervision de tous les acteurs du
projet. Cet outil interne devra permettre à la coordination du projet et aux autres instances
décisionnelles de déterminer régulièrement les tendances, et de mesurer le niveau de
réalisation des activités par rapport aux indicateurs de performance (objectifs qualifiés) à
atteindre selon le cadre logique et le rapport d’évaluation du projet. Ce dispositif interne
ne remplace pas les mécanismes de supervision habituels et de suivi évaluation externe :
missions de supervision externe, évaluation à mi-parcours, et évaluations à la fin du
projet. Cependant les informations qu’il permettra de constituer seront utiles pour ces
supervisions et évaluations externes.

V. CONCLUSION
Le Projet d’urgence d’appui à la productivité agricole a permis de résoudre de façon
significative le problème d’accès aux intrants notamment les semences grâce à un

                                             56
mécanisme fiable de distribution et de recouvrement des coûts. Le projet a permis
également à plus de 1000 producteurs dont environ 40% de femmes d’avoir accès à la
terre et à l’eau d’irrigation au niveau du domaine réhabilité.
La présence de la CNOP-G dans le dispositif du projet est un outil important dans la
préparation du désengagement du projet. Dès le démarrage les différents acteurs et
bénéficiaires ont été accompagnés et formés dans le but de renforcer leurs capacités et
leur autonomie. Le dispositif d’approvisionnement en semences mis en place par le
projet a en soi des éléments de durabilité, mais il faudra investir d’avantage dans la
structuration des semenciers et dans la consolidation de la collaboration entre la
recherche l’appui-conseil, le contrôle et la certification des semences et les producteurs.
Ce choix stratégique est à même de garantir une durabilité et une appropriation des
actions après la phase du présent financement, ainsi qu’à engager un changement de
mentalités et de comportement des services publics, vers une approche plus performante,
plus proactive.
En conclusion générale, compte tenu des résultats actuels, des changements positifs
enregistrés, et de l’impact notable sur les bénéficiaires et leur environnement, il est
souhaitable de consolider les acquis, d’étendre et d’intensifier les actions. Evidemment,
cela ne va pas sans le soutien financier des partenaires au développement intéressés par
l’appui au développement agricole en faveur des populations rurales.
