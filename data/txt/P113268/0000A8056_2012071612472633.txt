                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project provided improved inputs and advisory services  including 1,400 tons of fertilizer and 2,600 tons of improved seed  to about 69,000 smallholder rice producers
                         operating on about 35,000 hectares. A sample of beneficiary plots indicated yield increases of 96 percent for producers using the proposed technologies.

                         The project (i) relied on the farmers' confederation (CNOP-G), and its member federations, unions and village associations, in the distribution of input packages and cost-recovery; (ii)
                         scaled-up a successful farmer-based seed multiplication network to provide sufficient quantities of improved seed; and (iii) provided resources to reinvigorate the national agricultural
