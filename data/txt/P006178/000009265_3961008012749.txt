MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THIE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO TIE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR A HYDROCARBON SECTOR REFORM AND CAPITALIZATION
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to Bolivia for SDR6.8 million, the equivalent of US$10.64 million,
on standard International Development Association (IDA) terms, with a maturity of 40 years,
including a 10 years grace period. The Credit will assist in the financing of a Hydrocarbon
Sector Reform and Capitalization Technical Assistance Project to support the Government's
reform program of the hydrocarbon sector by establishing an appropriate legal and regulatory
framework as well as by capitalizing Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), a fully
state owned national enterprise.
Background
2.    The oil and gas sector is vital to Bolivia, representing about 6.3 percent of GDP, 40 percent of
Treasury revenues, 25 percent of public investment and 25 percent of exports. In 1993, sector
revenues from domestic sales totaled US$400 million, while natural gas exports to Argentina brought
an additional US$130 million that year. However, the State monopoly has limited investment and
economic growth due to: (i) implicit barriers to entry by private sector in exploration and production;
(ii) a regulatory and legal framework that does not provide the enabling environment needed to spur
investment and develop an open, competitive and efficient private sector; and (iii) the lack of sufficient
Government response to private investor concerns. The result has been cumbersome regulations and
increased business costs.
3.    With proven reserves estimated at more than 880 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe),
potential reserves estimated at more than 4.8 billion boe and large unexplored sedimentary basins, the
sector has strong potential for attracting foreign direct investment and providing needed resources for
economic growth to Bolivia. But despite passage of the Hydrocarbons Law in late 1990, which
expanded the scope for private sector participation, eliminated some tax dis-incentives, and achieved
limited progress in attracting foreign investment, the sector has not registered significant progress.
Petroleum product prices are still administered by the Government and, for some products, bear no
relationship with border prices. The existing legal, regulatory and institutional framework in the sector,
as well as the lack of an additional secure external market for natural gas exports, continue to inhibit
foreign and domestic private investment.
4.    Currently YPFB has a near monopoly on the hydrocarbon sector, controls and manages: 85
percent of liquids production, 75 percent of natural gas production, the entire pipeline transport
network, all refining operations, as well as wholesale distribution of petroleum products and liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, a limited number of service stations, and wholesale imports of diesel

oil. The Government is not only YPFB's sole shareholder but also the de facto policy maker, and
regulator. The National Secretariat of Energy (NSE) through its Direccion General de Hidrocarburos
(General Directorate of Hydrocarbons- DGH) has supervisory authority in the areas of policy making,
coordination, regulation, technical and safety control, monitoring of environmental norms and
standards, and enforcing the Hydrocarbons Law and related regulations. Unfortunately, DGH lacks
the human and financial resources as well as the expertise and experience to do its job effectively. As a
result of the NSE weak institutional capacity, YPFB finds itself playing the governmental role of policy
maker and regulator.
5.     Government Objectives and Strategy: Bolivia's most serious challenge in its efforts to
accelerate growth and reduce poverty in the next five years is to remove the remaining barriers to
investment by:
*  reducing and rationalizing the role of the State.
*  strengthening government's capacity to play the role of a policy maker and regulator.
*  eliminating most monopolies in the productive sector, enhancing productivity and
competitiveness, and fostering private investment.
*  deregulating prices, enhancing the liberalization of capital flows and trade, and simplifying
the tax regime.
3  protecting the environment from potential adverse impacts in any area of hydrocarbon
operations.
6.     The new Govemment which assumed office in August 1993 has pledged to achieve these
objectives. The centerpiece of the Government's political platform, the Plan de Todos, is a bold
program of radical transformation of six major public enterprises including YPFB, through a system of
"Capitalization and Democratization". This program involves the transformation of YPFB into two
or more Sociedades Anonimas Mixtas (MECs - Mixed Economy Corporations)' by the acquisition by
YPFB 's personnel of a specific number of shares. Management control of each MEC would be
transferred to an investor or consortium of investors, which would not bid to buy existing assets, but
invest in the MECs (up to the market asset value) to acquire up to 50 percent of the shares. This
investment would be used to increase the MECs capital and expand investment in the sector. The
State would then transfer its ownership in the MECs to the Bolivian people through shares that would
be managed by a Pension Fund. Reconfirming its comnmitment to this capitalization program the
Government has already enacted the Capitalization Law and created a separate Ministry of
Capitalization (MOC) in March, 1994.
ITo avoid repetition in the explanation of this concept, in the text the term MEC will mean: the transformation of
YPFB into two or more mixed economy corporations prior to capitalization thereof by strategic investors, the
management control of said company by said investor(s), and the transfer of State shares in the company to every
Bolivian age 21 and above.

7.      The proposed technical assistance (TA) credit will assist the Government to reform the
hydrocarbon sector and capitalize the resulting MECs. It is an integral part of a lending program that
IDA has designed to support the Government's reform of key sectors which includes a policy-based
umbrella, the proposed Capitalization Program Adjustment Operation2
Project Objectives
8.      The project objectives are to assist the Government in the analysis, planning, design and
execution of (i) its reform program for the hydrocarbon sector, including the strengthening of the
institutions which will be monitoring and regulating the sector; and (ii) in the capitalization of YPFB.
The project reflects the findings of a diagnosis carried out in February/March 1993, as well as a number
of studies carried out during project preparation.
Project Description
9.      The proposed project will include three components: (i) Component 'A": Legal and
Regulatory Framework (about 6 percent of total project cost) including analytical studies and
preliminary activities for the design of the overall legal and regulatory framework for the reform of, and
fiture development in the sector; (ii) Component 'B": Capitalization of YPFB (about 43 percent of
total project cost) including pre-capitalization analytical studies and prelirninary activities and
preparation for the capitalization transaction of MECs; and (iii) Component 'C": Institutional
Strengthening (about 51 percent of total project cost) to enable the NSE to carry out the reforms and
monitor the sector by: (a) strengthening of DGH to be involved in preparatory activities leading to the
establishment, initial staffing and start up operations of an appropriate organization structure
(satisfactory to the IDA) as provided by the Hydrocarbons Law which will, inter-alia: (1) formulate
Exploration and Production (E&P) policies, (2) promote E&P activities and investment, (3) negotiate
concessions and other types of contracts with and be counterpart of investors, (4) implement a Data
Bank composed of technical information and physical samples related to and provided under, the
hydrocarbon activities currently performed by YPFB and other contractors; (5) enforce technical and
safety standards and norms applicable to the hydrocarbon operations and (6) monitor concessions,
operation contracts and ensure compliance of obligations of contractors, including compliance of
investors' investment obligations in E&P activities, but not limited to, under the capitalization process
and training of Bolivian individuals; (b) designing a unit wvithin the organizational structure referred in
(i) above that will manage the data bank referred above and determine its initial staffing; (c) designing
the organizational structure and determine its initial staffing and start up needs of a unit that will
monitor compliance with environmental regulations, norms and standards applicable to the sector,
IDA proposed lending program for the Government capitalization program includes: (a) a Capitalization Program Adjustmcnt
Credit (CPAC) for an amount of US$50 million equivalent which covers six sectors: hydrocarbons, electricity,
telecommunications, aviation, railroad, and smelter/mining; and (b) five technical assistance projects supporting the adjustment
program which are (i) the Hydrocarbons Sector Reform and Capitalization TA Project (IJS$ II million); (ii) the Power Reform
and Capitalization TA Project (USS8 million); (iii) the approved and disbursing Regulatory Reform and Capitalization TA
Project (USSI4.7 million); (iv) the Judicial and Administrative Reform TA Project (US$13 million); and (v) the Financial
Market Project TA (US$13 million). CPAC will be disbursed in three tranches, the disbursement of one of this tranche being
conditioned on specific actions to be taken with regard to the hydrocarbon sector.

including indigenous population and ecological issues, particularly in remote areas; (d) carrying out a
promotion campaign to attract private foreign investment in for exploration and production activities
in the sector; (e) designing the organizational structure and determining initial staffing and start up
needs for the HCS in SIRESE; (f) providing training to NSE personnel for the staffing of the units
described above in item (a) through (b) and (e); (g) providing administrative support to the PEU; and
(h) acquiring and utilizing for all of the above office equipment and materials, computers, software,
printers, and photo-copying and facsimile machines, and two four-wheel drive vehicles for the working
group in charge of environmental matters. A full description of the proposed project, including a
breakdown of the estimated cost of each of the three components as well as the status of government's
latest policy actions and the project's preparation are shown in the Technical Annex. The Project is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1998. The closing date is December 31, 1998.
Project Costs and Financing
10.    The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at US$13.3 million equivalent, including the
refinancing of US$2.0 million for a Project Preparation Facility3 (PPF). The proposed financing for the
project includes: (i) US$10.64 million (including the US$2.0 million PPF reimbursement) financed
under the proposed IDA credit; and (ii) the balance of US$2.66 million, financed by the Govemment
through budgetary allocations. The Canadian Intemational Development Agency (CIDA) has
indicated its interest in co-financing (up to US$2.4 million equivalent) specific sub-components related
to environment, personnel training, and Data Bank Unit design, staffing and start up. In the event
CIDA co-financing is materialized, IDA financing would be canceled from the credit by the amount
subscribed by CIDA. Furthermore, and not included in the total project cost, a Japanese Grant of Yen
71 million (US$500,000 equivalent) financed initial identification and preparatory activities in 1992 and
early 1993 under the previous government. The proposed credit will finance 100 percent of the foreign
exchange component and about 41 percent of local expenditures. This represents about 80 percent of
total project costs with the Government financing the balance of local costs and taxes of about 20
percent. Schedule A to this Memorandum and Table 1 of the Technical Annex shows the details of
project components, costs, and the financing plan.
Project Implementation
11.    The NSE in MOED and the National Secretariat of Capitalization (NSC) in MOC will be the
Executing Agencies of the credit, each one implementing the component(s) under its jurisdiction. The
former will be in charge of the Legal and Regulatory Framework, and the Institutional Strengthening
components. The latter will be in charge of the YPFB's Capitalization component. To achieve this, it
was agreed that the following units will be established: (i) a Project Executing Unit (PEU) located in
NSE, reporting to the National Secretary of Energy; and (ii) a Capitalization Unit (CAPU) located
A Project Preparation Facility of USS1.0 million was approved on July 17, 1992 by the previous Government to support the
project whose objectives changed radically after this present administration took over in August 1993. The original PPF was
amended to reflect this change. In addition, IDA approved on September 21, 1993 another PPF of USS .5 million to support
an IDA funded Natural Gas Development Project for US$35 million which was canceled in January 1995. This PPF will be
canceled and replaced by a supplemental PPF of US$ 1.0 million to further assist in project's preparation.

in, and assisted, for procurement matters, by the Procurement Unit already established in the
NSC, located in YPFB but reporting to the National Secretary of Capitalization. Both executing
units will need to maintain close coordination and cooperation to ensure a successful and timely
implementation (para. 12). In addition, CAPU will be getting from YPFB administrative and technical
support, including office space and communications facilities it needs as defined by a YPFB's Board of
Directors Resolution No 57/95 dated May 10, 1995. With regard to environmental matters,
provisions are included in the Development Credit Agreement to ensure that cooperation and close
coordination will be maintained between the National Secretariat of Natural Resources and
Environment (NSONRE), the NSE and the NSC (para. 20). The Technical Annex provides more
details about project implementation. The Project Implementation Organization Chart shown in
Figure 1, Schedule 1 (Key Project Activities and Project Timetable), and Project Performance
Indicators contained in the Technical Annex highlights the key aspects of project implementation,
while Schedule C shows the proposed project supervision plan.
12.   Broader coordination among Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Economic Development
(MOED), MOC, National Secretariat of Finance (NSC), NSE, NSONRE, and YPFB will be important
for efficient decision making and timely execution. To that end an Advisory Committee (AC) reporting
to the President of Bolivia will be established in order to ensure coordination among all parties. This
AC will be chaired by the Minister of Capitalization, and will be composed of the Minister of Economic
Development, the National Secretary of Energy, the National Secretary of Finance, the National
Secretary of Capitalization, the National Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment, and the
President of YPFB. This AC will advise and provide guidance to CAPU and NSE on the main issues
and policy aspects with regard to the reform of the sector and the capitalization of YPFB and their
interrelation, and make recommendations to the President for final decision.
Procurement and Disbursement
13.   The Technical Annex describes the procurement and disbursement arrangements for the
proposed credit. As summarized in Schedule B, procurement and disbursement would be according
to normal IDA guidelines and review procedures and disbursements would be made against 100% of
the net-of tax costs of local and foreign consultants, 100% of training expenses, 100 % of the CIF cost
of imported goods and of the ex-factory cost of local goods and 85% of the cost of locally procured
goods. In the event of CIDA co-financing, portions of the project to be co-financed would follow the
procurement guidelines and procedures of this institution and/or any trust fund agreement this
institution has with IDA. Furthermore, to facilitate project execution and disbursement, there will be
two separate special accounts, one for each unit of each beneficiary, the PEU and CAPU. These
special accounts will be opened with the Central Bank. Retroactive financing for consulting services
and related equipment procured under IDA Guidelines after September 30, 1994 (but not more than
one year before signing) is proposed up to US$1.0 million equivalent to about 10 percent of the
proposed amount of the credit.

Project Sustainability
14.   The proposed project aims to eliminate the role of the state as an investor in the productive
activities of the sector, and introduce an institutional strengthening process that will maintain itself well
beyond the period of the proposed credit. Policy measures which will ensure sustainability and which
are considered in the CPAC include: (i) the passage of the Hydrocarbons Law and corresponding
regulations implementing it, including environmental regulations specific to the sector; (ii) an
amendment to the General Tax Law which was already approved by the National Congress (NC) and
which would introduce a new corporate income tax and excise taxes on gasoline and diesel: (iii) a
Sectorial Regulatory System Law (SIRESE) which has already been approved by the NC and will help
establish clear rules for all activities which will be regulated by the enacted SIRESE Law, the future
Hydrocarbons Law and their respective regulations related to these activities; and (iv) clear YPFB
capitalization principles and regulations. The overall Government reform is viewed as an irreversible
policy decision. The sustainability of the reform and institutions themselves would depend on the
ability of the Government to hire and maintain qualified staff for the DGH, the ENTE, and the
Superintendency for Hydrocarbons (HCS) in the SIRESE, the multi-sectorial regulatory commission,
and protect the autonomy of these entities through security oftenure. To ensure this, provisions are
included in the SIRESE Law to secure financing for the HCS through a special fee to be paid by the
private oil companies, requiring supplemental provisions in the Hydrocarbons Law. Further, funds are
provided by the project to support this objective through the use of external consultants during the
initial implementation and for external and on-the-job training. While there will be no formal cross-
conditionally between CPAC and this credit, performnance indicators as shown in the Technical Annex
will be used to monitor progress of Government policy actions which are supported by CPAC.
Lessons Learned from Previous [DA Involvement
15.   Since the early 1 980s, there have been credits for IDA sector related projects in Bolivia: the
Vuelta Grande Natural Gas Recycling Project, and the Reconstruction Import Credit I and the
Reconstruction Import Credit Hl both of which included a hydrocarbons component. Bolivia also has
received important technical assistance from the ESMAP Program which financed several strategy
studies dealing with the sector and the preparation of YPFB's capitalization The main lesson learned
was the need to supervise projects very closely because of a weak procurement system and deficiencies
in project management and coordination.
16.   Similar restructuring and privatization projects financed by the Bank in other parts of the world
including Latin America provide other important lessons. For example, in Argentina, the Bank
provided technical assistance for the privatization of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) and Gas
del Estado (GdE). The main lessons leamed were: (i) the need for a clear and common vision; (ii) a
strong commitment to and consensus on the reform program by the Government to the Government
Trustee designated to privatize YPF and GdE; (iii) adherence to a firm timetable; (iv) transparency in
the process, and (v) competent and dedicated local teams supported by very reputable and qualified
intemational and local firms and individual consultants. In addition, experience learned from a recent
mission organized by the Bank to Argentina has shown the need to: (i) take extreme care in the way
YPFB is capitalized in order to avoid undesirable results such as the lack of sufficient competition



upstream and downstream; (ii) have a clear up-front definition of the new role of the state as a policy
maker and regulator; and (iii) provide sufficient technical support and training for the newly-created
institutions. Similar lessons emerged from other projects supported by the Bank in Peru and Ecuador.
17    All of these lessons have been taken into account in designing the proposed project, keeping in
mind the constraints which are specific to Bolivia and the specific characteristics of the capitalization
scheme. The project concept was jointly developed by IDA and the Bolivian authorities after a careful
analysis of the legal and regulatory framework and issues.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
18.   The proposed project is consistent with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy
discussed by the Board on February 8, 1994, as well as the Government's policy agenda, which aims to
phase out State participation in productive activities. This project would provide a unique and catalytic
function through its support of reforms of the policy environment and the linkage between these
reforms and the institutional-strengthening measures to implement them. Consequently, this project
would provide direct assistance for the sector, and would support the establishment of a new legal and
regulatory framework to attract private investment and foster competition, capitalize YPFB, and
strengthen the role of the State as a policy maker and regulator. IDA involvement in the formulation of
the new legal and regulatory framework and conceptualization of YPFB's capitalization process as
well as consultants' selection, and supervision would ensure that the objectives of the Government's
adjustment program are met. Schedule D shows statements of IDA's credits to Bolivia.
Agreed Actions
19.   During negotiations, agreements were reached on: (i) the TOR for PEU and CAPU and the
delineation of their respective responsibilities; (ii) the targets that will be used to monitor project
activities and overall performance; (iii) the establishment of an Advisory Committee to ensure
coordination among the Borrower's National Secretary of Finance, MOC, NSE, NSC, NSONRE
and YPFB; and (iv) reporting and auditing requirements for the project. In addition to financial
auditing, PEU and CAPU will prepare separate full progress reports and submit them to IDA every six
month within the fourth week following the end of each semester. These reports will detail all project
and related activities, report on the progress in relation to agreed schedules and project milestones, and
identify any problems which may have been encountered and which could adversely affect the overall
impact of the project.
Environmental Aspects
20.   The project has been classified as environmental category B. Although the TA project has no
direct environmental impact, the diagnostic study of YPFB's operations and physical facilities has
identified a number of environmental issues which will be investigated further. Two comprehensive
environmental audits of all YPFB's physical facilities and activities, as well as related ecological and
social issues related to indigenous people will serve as the basis for distributing stock liabilities between
the Government and the strategic investors. They will also assist in the development of operational



- 8 -
guidelines and environmental regulations to be enforced by the MOSDE. New strategic investors in
MECs as well as all oil and gas companies will be subject to new environmental laws (which have been
already enacted), regulations, norms and standards which are under preparation. The Technical Annex
and its Attachment 1 provides more details about these aspects.
Program Objective Category
21.    Several existing and forthcoming IDA projects and operations are focused on addressing health
and educational issues in Bolivia. While the proposed project does not target poverty alleviation
initially, the proposed reform measures for the sector, and capitalization of YPFB should increasingly
release financial resources which can then be redirected to providing some essential social and
infrastructure investments. In addition, the transfer of assets to all Bolivian adults (in the form of
shares managed by a pension fund as part of the capitalization program) would assist in more equitable
distribution of wealth.
Project Benefits
22.   The economic benefits of the legal, regulatory and structural reform of the sector, as well as the
capitalization program are likely to be substantial. Increased Government revenues and foreign
exchange earnings are expected from significant inflows of private capital resulting in an increase of
the hydrocarbon reserve base, production and exports, as well as efficiency. Moreover, the
introduction of a new tax regime for upstream and downstream operations, which will restore market
price transparency and stimulate competition will eliminate economic distortions and government's
implicit subsidies. The institutional component will strengthen NSE. Finally, the distribution of shares
resulting from YPFB's capitalization may help expand and strengthen the pension fund and create a
capital market.
Project Risks
23.   The main risks associated with the project concern possible delays in project implementation
due to weak organization and/or poor coordination. The setting up of an AC and the technical
assistance provided under this project should Minimize this risk. Another risk is a lack of adequate
skilled staff within the working groups in the NSE and CAPU. To address this issue, specialized
consultants will be assigned specific tasks while long term consultants will be assigned to the PEU and
CAPU to assist, in situ, in the process. A final risk concerns the possible delay in presenting to the
National Congress a new Hydrocarbons Law, and its approval of a law. However, taking into account
the track record of the various laws already enacted by the National Congress (Capitalization Law,
SIRESE Law and Electricity Law) which are all satisfactory to IDA, this is a remote risk to consider.
Even so, a public information campaign has been launched, and will be used to inform the public of the
Governrment reform program and distribution of shares scheme. Furthermore, prior review and
approval of Terms of Reference will assist the Government to pursue the implementation of the project
on the basis of clear agreements with IDA and will limit the risk of financing activities which are not in
the direction supported by IDA.
