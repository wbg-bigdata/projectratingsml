INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SCALE ENTERPRISE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the United Republic of Cameroon for the equivalent of US$ 3.0
million, on standard IDA terms, for relending to the Banque Camerounaise
de Developpement (BMD), to help finance a project for small- and medium-
scale enterprises. Government will relend IDA funds to BCD at 5 percent
per annum; the repayment period will include a three-year grace period
and will be on a fifteen-year schedule, which could be revised from time
to time to conform to the aggregate of sub-loan repayments to BCD. The
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of France would participate
in the financing of the investment component of the project with a loan to
BCD equivalent to US$ 3.0 million for 15 years, including 3 years of grace,
wnth interest at 5 percent per annum. UNDP has agreed to make a grant of
US$ 1.2 million for technical assistance, in addition to continuing its
support (estimated at US$ 0.8 million) of the Centre National d'Assistance
aux Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (CAPME), and the Government of Cameroon
will also provide US$ 0.8 million for technical assistance.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report "The Recent Economic Development of Cameroon"
(No. 72-247) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 27,
1972. A basic economic mission visited the country in February 1975,
coinciding with the preparation of Cameroon's Fourth Development Plan
(FY77-81). Its preliminary conclusions are reflected in the following
analysis.
Economic Potential
3.        Cameroon's natural resources are varied, although not abun-
dant. Soils and climatic conditions permit cultivation of a wider range
of crops than is commonly found in Central Africa. These crops include
oil palm and rubber in the south, cocoa and coffee in the central region,
and rice, groundnuts, cotton, sorghum and millet in the north. The forest
areas of the southeast contain large untapped timber resources, and the
north holds promising potential for livestock development.



-2-
4.        While the main opportunities for development lie in the expan-
sion of agricultural production, Cameroon has potential for expanding
production of import substitutes needed for a growing domestic market, as
also for the processing for export of alumina and agricultural and forestry
products. A bauxite project is in the early stages of preparation, while
offshore oil and gas prospecting has so far yielded only modest results.
Commerce, transportation and transit services are also important
economic activities: Cameroon is a relatively large country with its main
economic centers separated by vast underpopulated areas, and the country
serves as a main export route for landlocked Chad. As a result, large
investments in port and inland transport infrastructure are prerequisites
to promoting agriculture, forestry and industry, and strengthening Cameroonts
role as a regional trade center.
Past Performance
6.        During the first decade of independence (1960-1970) the Govern-
ment's primary objective was to unify the nation and to ease serious internal
political and social tensions. Although the need to devote substantial amounts
of scarce resources to this end may have handicapped economic development, GDP
at constant prices grew at a satisfactory rate of over 6 percent a year.   Cash
crop production rose steadily due to good export prices and favorable weather
conditions, and manufacturing production increased as a result of the liberal
investment climate that attracted substantial foreign private capital.
7.        During the 1960s total gross investment averaged about uS$ 200 million
annually (in constant 197)4 dollars), i.e. lh percent of GDP.  Public investment
accounted for about 57 percent of total investment with the largest part devoted
to the transportation network, the most immediate development constraint; while
substantial effort was also directed at expanding education and diversifying
agriculture. Significant increases in fiscal revenues, combined with stringent
expenditure controls, produced sizeable budget surpluses that made it possible
to finance a large part (up to 40 percent) of public investments out of local
revenues as well as to accumulate reserves.  However, this policy also imposed
excessive restraint on much needed current expenditures in such areas as road
maintenance, public health and education.
8.        In the early 1970s, economic growth slowed down to less than 3 percent
p.a. or little more than population growth.   This was caused by (i) low export
prices for cocoa and coffee during 1971-72 and a drought in the north, and (ii)
a decline in private investment triggered by the relative stagnation of the
agricultural sector, in addition to the completion of the most obvious import
substitution projects during the preceding decade.
9.        The Government reacted to these developments by stepping up public
investment, which increased in volume by 50 percent to reach annual averages
of about US$ 180 million, in constant 1974 dollars, during the Third Develop-
ment Plan (FY72-76). This resulted in a substantial drawdown. of Treasury
reserves and a major increase in foreign borrowing. Fortunately, the avail-
ability of well-prepared high priority projects enabled Cameroon to obtain
most of the increased inflow of foreign capital from public aid donors on
concessionary terms. For this reason, as well as the country's low foreign



debt before the 1970s, Cameroon's external debt service has remained modest
(about 6 percent of export earnings in 1974).
10.       Although low economic growth over the last four years has signi-
ficantly reduced import demand, exports maintained a remarkable growth and
profited from higher prices in 1974. Therefore, the balance of payments was
never under excessive pressure and the large inflow of foreign capital
remained sufficient to cover the current account deficit. On the import
side, tle share of refined oil products out of total imports increased from
5 percent in 1973 to 9 percent in 1974. Increases in the price of imported
food was compenseted by a reduction in the volume of food imports.   The terms
of trade are now deteriorating and foreign exchange reserves seem to have
diminished rapidly during the first half of FY75, announcing an era of more
severe balance of payments and public finance problems.
Prospects and Development Strategy
11.       As a result of the projected deterioration in Cameroon's terms
of trade, exports will play a less dynamic role in economic expansion,
while domestic demand is still too smal' to take up the slack. Therefore,
overall growth in the next decade might run well below the rates achieved
during the 1960s, in spite of Government's efforts to maintain a high
volume of public investment and to develop the country's considerable
opportunities for diversification, particularly within the rural sector.
12.       Steady economic growth will depend largely on the extent to
which the Government comes to grips with several structural problems:
(i) rural production (except forestry) suffers from a lack of financial
and technical assistance particularly for small farmers, who produce more
than 90 percent of the country's agricultural output; (ii) despite
heavy investment in recent years, the basic transport infrastructure is
still insufficient; the Douala port and the Douala-Yaounde corridor
require increases in capacity, and the road system in general needs better
maintenance as well as adaptation to traffic growth especially for the
development of new agricultural and forestry zones; (iii) the education
system still is not responding adequately to the countryts changing needs;
and (iv) serious economic imbalances persist among regions, between the
towns and countryside, and between modern and traditional sectors.
13.       To meet these challenges, the Government must strengthen its
ability to choose, prepare and implement projects, particularly in the
rural sector. Some progress is being made in this direction. Special
planning units are gradually being established within the technical
ministries. A para-public consulting firm - SEDA - was created under
the Planning Ministry to accelerate project preparation. Commercially
oriented public corporations are also serving to strengthen the project
implementation capacity of the public sector. Nevertheless, further
improvenents are needed, particularly in the management of public finance,
and in strengthening and coordinating rural development institutions.



IL.       Conpleting the overall transport infrastructure provram already
underway will absorb a high proportion of future public investment.
If the Government succeeds in its present efforts to accelerate prepara-
tion and implementation of projecGs in the other sectors, particularly
for rural development, future total public investment is likely to exceed
US$ 300 million anuually (in constant 1974 dollars) during the Fourth
Development Plan (FY77-81). Budgetary revenues already reach 20 percent
of GDP and cannot be expected to increase much faster than the economy
as a whole, while surpluses of the stabilization funds are likely to
stagnate or even decline, considering the depressed price outlook for
most export crops. On the other hand, current expenditures will have
to be stepped up in line with recently increased public investments in
transport, education and health, and public debt service charges will
grow rapidly. Furthermore, savings of public enterprises are expected
to decline as debt service will absorb a higher share of their operating
surpluses. As a consequence, in the next five years, public savings
after debt seIvice will probably not exceed 25-30 percent of public
investment, as compared with about 40 percent over the past few years.
Hence, Cameroon will have to rely on external financing for the bulk of
its public investment. Increasing reliance on foreign borrowing during
a period of relatively slow economic growth and poorer terms of trade,
will require careful foreign debt management.   Assuming, however, that
at least 50 percent of foreign public capital inflow will be on conces-
sionary terms, the foreign debt service ratio could be maintained below
12 percent by 1980.
15.       Camerooh's ability to make effective use of external resources
and the Government's dedication to development are reasons for increased
external support. With rising debt service absorbing an increasing share
of gross public savings, Cameroon can make only a modest contribution
to the financing of future public investment. To avoid further rapid
buildup of debt service, lenders, including the Bank Group, should provide
a large part of their assistance on concessionary terms. They should also be
prepared to finance a high proportion of project costs including, when
necessary, a part of local costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
16.       The Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now amount to about
US$ 180 million and, including the recent US$ 16 million IDA credit for
rubber, cover fourteen projects: six in agriculture, five in transportation,
two in education and one in public utilities.   Transportation represents the
largest share (50 percent) of our past commitments, followed by agriculture
(36 percent).  A-nmex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits as of April 30, 1975 and includes notes on ongoing projects.   Although
delays and setbacks have been occasionally encountered in the execution of pro-
jects, the Government has consistently shown willingness to collahorate with
the Bank rroup for the determination and application of satisfactory solutions.



- 5 -
17.       For tne future, the Bank Group 's strategy is to support the
Government in its efforts to equip the country with infrastructure, to
create productive employment in rural and urban areas, to stimulate invest-
ment by local entrepreneurs, and to increase the efficiencyr of Cameroon's
institutions.
18.       Given sharp traffic increases and the backlog of required invest-
ments, massive injections of capital will still be necessary in the years
ahead, particularly for the expansion of the port of Douala and improvement
of the Douala - Yaounde transport corridor. A second Douala port project
will be appraised in mid-1975 and presented to the Executive Directors in
FY76. Future highway investments will mainly be for maintenance and feeder
roads to provide links to local markets and facilitate exploitation of
Cameroon's forests, a major area for future development.
19.       In agriculture, we have been able to help the Government further
diversify agricultural production by financing its oil palm and rubber
plantations in the east and west, and rice irrigation and livestock in
the north. The cocoa project, approved in September 1974, will modernize
cocoa growing by smallholders and raise rural productivity in an area south
and west of the capital. The rubber project, approved in June 1975 will
help develop the southwest coastal region. Identification work for a rural
development project in a populated but poor region in the north is underway.
Thus, Bank Group lending to agriculture supports the Governnent's efforts
to modernize and to correct economic imbalances through the development
of a hitherto lagging sector. Tn other sectors, in addition to the first
small- and medium-scale enterprises (SME) project presented in this report,
we are appraising a third education project with special emphasis on rural
education and training.
20.       In all our projects, we will as in the past include training,
technical assistance, and other provisions necessary for strengthening
institutions and improving sector policies. In addition, through our
economic work we will continue to advise the authorities, at their request,
on development questions in general, and on matters such as economic
management, problems of urban migration and manpower development.
71.       Our lending to Cameroon has been closely coordinated with other
donors; in nine of our fourteen projects, financing arrangements have been
either joint or parallel. The CCCE and U1TTDP would join us in financing
the proposed WE project.
22.       Over the second half of the last decade disbursements of foreign
aid amounted to about US$ 40-45 million a year.   At the beginning of this
period 65 percent of aid funds consisted of grants, but the proportion of
loans has been slowly increasing as grants declined. A major part of
external assistance was provided by France and concentrated in infrastructure
and productive sectors. The aid giving agencies of the EEC (European Develop-
ment Fund and European Investment Bank) directed their lending mainly to



agriculture, with infrastructure in second place.  Bank Group disbursements
were small during this period. From 1972 to 1974 disbursements of foreign
aid increased to about US$ 60 million with one third as grants. The Bank
Group's share of these inflows amounted to about 25 percent. Public debt
outstanding and disbursed as of December 31, 1974 amounted to US$ 280
million and is projected to reach US$ 1,300 million in 1980. Public debt
service as a proportion of export earnings amounted to 6.0 percent at end
1974 and is projected to reach 12 percent in 1980. At that time disburse-
ments may be over US$ 250 million with only 15 percent in grants. At present
Bank debt outstanding and disbursed amounts to nearly 11 percent of all
public debt and 10 percent of public debt service. IDA credits outstanding
and disbursed amount. to nearly 13 percent of public debt outstanding and 0.9
percent of public debt service. Bank Group lending is expected to account
for nearly 12.5 percent of public debt service in 1980.
23.       In October 1974, Cameroon  became IFC's 100th member and, in
a first operation approved on May 22, 1975, the Corporation will invest
in the equity of Bata - a foreign owned shoe complex - and assist in the
sale of its shares to local private investors.
PART III - INDUSTRY AND SERVICES IN CAMEROON
24.       The proposed credit will be concentrated mainly on the manufacturing
sub-sector, but construction, transport and service enterprises will also be
considered for financing.  In the fiscal year 1973, these sub-sectors together
accounted for about 25 percent of GDP.
The Sub-Sectors
25.       Cameroon is the most industrialized member of the Customs and Economic
Union of Central Africa (UDEAC). The manufacturing sub-sector alone in Cameroon
contributes about 12 percent to GDP. Although statistical indicators are ina-
dequate, the growth of value added in the manufacturing sector in real terms
appears to have slowed down since 1971/72, from 12 percent in the previous five
years to about 7 percent since then.   Gross private investment has levelled off
or perhaps even declined since 1969/70.   (See para. 8 above).
26.       Production is relatively diversified by Central African standards and
consists of: aluminum using imported bauxite and low-cost energy (20 percent of
total industrial sales); processing of local raw materials, mainly cotton and
cocoa (30 percent); and substitution of imported final goods (50 percent).
27.       The sub-sector is dominated by large foreign-owned and -managed enter-
prises (about 85 percent of all firms in the modern sector in 1970), most of
which use moderrn processing methods. Industry is heavily concentrated in Douala
and to a lesser extent, in Yaounde, due mainly to the proximity of the port and
the railways.



- 7 -
28.       The construction sub-sector in Cameroon accounts for about 6 percent
of GDP and appears to have had a zero rate of growth in real terms in recent
years.  The stagnation is largely attributable to weak demand for housing in
the early 1970s as a result of slow growth of income. In addition to several
large contractors, oumerous entrepreneurs own small construction firms, but
little informa-ion is available about these.
29.       The t                       sub-sectors contributed 8.5 percent of
total GDP in 1972/73. The growth of value added in recent years has averaged
8.5 percent per annum. GTiven the multiplicity of economic centers and the
substantial distances between them, transport and services are essential
activities in Cameroon. A 1970 survey indicated that only 17 percent of these
enterprises in the modern sector were Camerooniar.-owned.
Policies and Prospects
30.       Because the incentive system established by the Government in 1960
mainly consisted of import tax exemptions on capital goods and raw materials,
capital-intensive   activities and large foreign enterprises were the main
beneficiaries. Of the total amount, of investment that qualified for special
incentives, with Government approval, only about 15 percent financed small-
and medium-scale enterprises and only a few of the industrial ventures approved
were managed by Cameroonians.
31.       The Administrationts lack of experience in industrial promotion,
and cumbersome administrative procedures, have discouraged some foreign promoters
and contributed to the decline in gross private investment since 1969/70.
Recently, the Administration has reaffirmed its attachment to a policy of
"planned liberalism", by providing "industrial zones", public equity partici-
pations and long-term loans, but these mainly continue to benefit large,
modern firms.
32.       Based on the findings of the Bank's recent missions to Cameroon, value
added in the manufacturing and construction sub-sectors are expected to grow
at an annual rate of about 8 percent, in constant prices, during the next Plan
period (FY76-FY81), provided that the projected level of gross investment is
attained.  Future growth will stem mainly from investments in processing units,
including wood, cotton, oil, cocoa and aluminum and from expansion of import
substitution activities. The transport and services sectors are expected to
grow ait the same rate as GDP, i.e. at about 4 percent to 5 percent per annum.
Small- and Medium-Scale Enterprises and Institutions
33.       Artisan and small-.scale industrial, construction and service
enterprises, which are largely Cameroonian-owned, could play a major part
in the anticipated growth of the sector.
3I.       The following definitions are considered to be representative
of small, medium and large enterprises iP Cameroon.



-8 -
Assets            IT'i-cal E-n'.lYoent
Size Scale               (CFAF rlilion)               (Nimber)
Small                      up   to  40            up    to   15
Medium                     up    to 150            up   to   50
Large                      over    150             over      50
35.       At the lower end of the scale, artisans are defined as inde-
pendent workers or small industrialists wxho manage their business and
participate in its physical work.   A 1966 census by a UNDP mission esti-
mated their number at some 20,000.   Production covers a wide variety of
final consumption and intermediate goods.   Wages are substantially above
those in the rural sector from which most manpower is drawn; artisans tend
to use more domestic inputs and more labor intensive methods than modern-
sector firms. About half of the small- and medium-scale enterprises (STAE)
are located in Douala and. about a quarter in Yaounde. Despite t.he lack
of effective investment incentives and technical assistance, small-scale
and artisan enterprises produce an estimated one ouarter of all industrial
output and generate over one half of total employment in industry. The SME
do not benefit to the same extent as large modern enterprises from tariff
and other incentives.
36.       None of the five commercial banks in Caneroon has devoted any
significant amount of its resources to assist SME. Societ4 Nationale
d'Investissement (SNI) - a fully Government-owned company created to
promote development in industry, agriculture and trade - concentrates on
larger firms and on equity capital participations. Banque CamerounaJse
de I3veloppement (BCD), a majority Government-owned development, bank,
finances industry, agriculture, trade, crafts and housing. Most indus-
trial lending has been for large-scale enterprises, but BCD is the fi-
nancial institution with the best record of assistance to smaller enter-
prises.
37.       Three agencies currently provide technical assistance to SME
in Cameroon. Two agencies, Societe d'Aide Technique et de Cooperation
(SATEC) and Association pour la Formation des Cadres de l'Industrie et
de l'Administration (AFCA), provide active operational support to two
different and distinct groups of entrepreneurs. AFCA caters essentially
to artisans and entrepreneurs who own very small enterprises, for whom
the agency provides management training courses and consulting services,
and sponsors various promotion and cooperative activities. Participants
in the courses have included plumbers, metal workers, electricians,
mechanics, tailors, masons, retailers and o-.ner/managers of small factories.
SATEC specializes in helping entrepreneurs who own somewhat larger enter-
prises, but which would still fall into the small- and medium-scale category.
SATEC assists such entrepreneurs to prepare and implement their projects.
Its assistance has covered a wide range of economic activities from
refrigeration to soap production and maize handling and from dry cleaning
to metal fabrication. The activities of SATEC and AFCA do not overlap;
both have been operating in Cameroon, with financial assistance from
France, for many years.   Their success, though limited, provides a



-9-
concrete basis for expanding technical assistance in this field. The third
agency, CAPME which started operations in 1969 is the national organization
responsible for policy formulation and coordination of all technical assistance
to SME in Cameroon. CAPME has recently begun assisting SMF. in management and
in repair and maintenance of industrial equipment.  With the assistance of
UNDP, Government intends to build up the agency and the proposed IDA project
should help to strengthen its coordinating activities.
38.       Although Cameroonian-owned enterprises account for only about a
quarter of total industrial production, this results from a relatively
low level of local participation in industrial investment rather than from
low productivity. In the past Cameroonian entrepreneurs have tended to
concentrate their investments in trade, real estate and construction, but
now have begun to develop management experience, to accumulate capital
resources and to indicate a desire to branch out into more complex ventures.
Numerous artisans have acquired know-how and wish to enlarge the scale of
their activities.  Therefore, if provided with technical assistance, credit
facilities and institutional support, acceptable sub-project sponsors would
be available under the proposed IDA credit.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Backaround and PurPose
39.       Following a Government request made sinultaneously to the Bank Group
and CCCE for financial assistance for a Government program to promote small-
and medium-scale Cameroonian enterprises, representatives of the Bank Group
and of CCCE visited Cameroon in 1974 to appraise the project. The report
"Appraisal of a Small- and Medium-Scale Enterprises Project", No. 718a-CM
dated May 15 , 1975, is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A Credit and Project Summary is in Annex III of this report. Negotiations for
a credit were held in Washington in May 1975 with a Cameroonian delegation
headed by his Excellency Mr. Frangois-Xavier Tchoungui, Ambassador of the
United Republic of Cameroon to Washington. The delegation included represen-
tatives of BCD and CAPME. CCCE, UNDP, SATEC and AFCA were also represented
at negotiations.
40.       The proposed p-lot project for small- and medium-scale enterprises
is the first of its kind to be financed by the Bank Group in Africa.
The project is mainly designed to benefit relatively small enterprises
where financial support, combined with technical assistance and training,
will significantly enhance labor productivity and industrial skills,
develop entrepreneurship and increase the present 15 percent level of local
ownership among total enterprises in the modern sector.
41.       Opportunities for successful investment are especially apparent
in the manufacturing sub-sector. However, suitable projects in the eonstruc-
tion sub-sector and in service activities, particularly transport and repair
and maintenance, will also be eligible for financing.



- lo -
L2.       Specifically the objectives of the credit are:
(a) strengthening BCD, improving its policies, and providing
funds for the establishment and expansion of privately-
owred small- and medium-scale enterprises3
(b) promoting effective and simplified guarantee and incentive
policies for SHE;
(c) expanding technical assistance facilities for SME and fostering
coordinated action under the guidance of CAPME;
(d) contributing to diversification of the location of industry;
(e) learning more for both the Bank Group and Government,about
effective policies and procedures for SME promotion and support,
and the benefits accruing therefrom.
Project Execution
43.       BCD, a majority Government institution, would be the project's focal
point for SME financing. CCCE, a minority shareholder, has previously provided
long-term financing and technical assistance to BGD. BCD, which was established
in 1960 , is a financially sound institution, with the capability to execute
the project effectively. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, BCD approved
loans and guarantees totalling CFAF 7.5 billions of which somewhat less than 20
percent was for industrial projects. The share of SME projects in these industrial
credits amounted to 25 percent of total value and 70 percent of total number.
Thus, BCD already has some experience with SME financing and would be responsible
for appraising, granting and administering sub-loans. To strengthen its industrial
appraisal capability, BCD would recruit two financial analysts/economists, an
industrial engineer, and local counterparts to form an industrial lending unit.
BCD has also adopted a revised policy statement covering general lending criteria
and financial management and to streamline procedures for credit approval.
During the project's two-year commitment period, BCD is expected to help finance
about 80 sub-projects. BCDts sub-loans would fall into two groups: (i) loans
to small enterprises where BCD's loan to the sub-borrower did not exceed CFAF
30 million - normally to firms with total assets after the project of less than
CFAF 38 million (US$ 170,000); and, (ii) loans to larger enterprises receiving
more than CFAF 30 million from BOD.
Technical Assistance
44.       Although BCD would not be restricted to financing only sub-projects
prepared with technical assistance, many medium-scale sub-projects and most small-
scale ones would require such assistance and would obtain it from the newly
strengthened SATEC, AFCA and CAPME, under the guidance and coordination of CAPME.
In addition, CAPME will formulate policy towards SHIE, and would provide essential
information and data collection services, to facilitate close monitoring of SATEC
and AFCA's work by IDA, CCCF and the Governnent.   CAPME expects to receive five

45.       SATEC's two-year program calls for the creation of about 65 new
small- and medium-scale enterprises, which is about 80 percent of the total sub-
projects proposed for financing in this project.   SATEC's past success in pro-
moting Cameroonian enterprises suggests that the agency should be able to achieve
its target. The present staff in Cameroon needs to be expanded from nine
professionals to sixteen (including the new office to be opened in the north
at Garouia) and five of the additional seven would be Cameroonians.
46.       AFCA which has been most successful in its past work with artisans,
would expand its present activities to provide continuing support to its
existing clients, and to conduct six general management courses annually.
AFCA will try to organize and help manage new artisan credit cooperatives,
will also reopen its center in Yaounde and will increase its activities
in the north through frequent visits there. The expansion in AFCA's acti-
vities related to this SME project, will require recruitment, of one additional
Cameroonian professional, bringing the total staff to four.
47.       The UNDP is carrying out a study of CAPME's current procedures and
organization. The Association will participate in discussions about implementa-
tion of the study's recommendations and about the appropriate means to continue
and improve technical assistance to SME.
48.       As part of the strategy of strengthening local technical assistance
availability, contracts between CAPME and SATEC and CAPME and AFCA, defining
their working relationships have been finalized and approved by the Association
during negotiations. Their execution and delivery are conditions of effecti-
veness.
Project Costs and Financing Arrangements
49.       Total project costs, including technical assistance, would amount
to about Us$ 13.2 million, net of taxes, excluding US$ 0.8 million which is the
estimated cost of UNDP assistance to CAPME under a separate program, currently
under study. Sub-project costs are estimated at about US$ 11.2 million, net
of taxes, with foreign exchange costs at about 55 percent of the total. IDA
financing under the project is expected to amount to about 50 percent of the
estimated foreign exchange component of all sub-projects; .but in individual
sub-projects IDA may finance a small proportion of local costs. The technical
assistance component would amount to about US$ 2.0 million comprising the
Government contribution of US$ 0.8 million and that of UNDP of US$ 1.2 million
but excluding UNDP's continuing support to CAPHE.   The UNDP funds would finance
100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of the AFCA, SATEC and BCD experts.
50.       The Association would provide a credit of US$ 3.0 million to Government
for relending to B1D. The balance of sub-project costs of US$ 8.2 million would
be covered by a CCCE loan to BCD (US$ 3.0 million), BCD medium term loans redis-
countable with the Central Bank (US$ 2.2 million) and sub-borrowers'contributions
(US$ 3.0 million). Sub-borrowers are expected to provide about 20 percent of
investment costs for 'smallert sub-projects, i.e. for which BCD's loans amount



- 12 -
to less than CFAF 30 million (about US$ 133,000) and about 30 percent for larger
ones. A breakdown of the financing plan is given in Annex III.
51.       BCD would pay an annual interest rate of 5 percent to Government for
the IDA funds and to CCCE for its loan. BCD's repayment terms to the Government
for the IDA funds would include a three-year grace period and would be on a
fifteen-year schedule, which could be revised from time to time to conform to
the aggregate of sub-loan maturities. The effective cost of funds to sub-borrowers
would be 11 percent which is slightly higher than the rate at which BCD has in
the past lent to SME and is also above the rate of inflation of about 8 percent
p.a. forecast for Cameroon. until 1981. The above 11 percent consists of a spread
of 2.75 percent for BCD with the remaining 8.25 percent as follows: 5 percent
interest, 2 percent taxes to Government and a foreign exchange/guarantee fee of
1.25 percent. On small sub-loans the fee will be paid to the Fonds d'Aide
et de Garantie des Credits aux Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (FOGAPE), which
will guarantee credits to SME. Government will bear the full foreign exchange
risk but borrowers for large sub-loans, i.e. other than SME's as defined by
Car roonian law 1J, will pay a foreign-exchange risk fee of 1.25 percent to
Government.  Repayment terms from BCD's sub-borrowers are expected to range
from 7 to 15 years, including 2 to 3 years of grace.
52.       Sub-projects receiving total financing from BCD of up to CFAF 30
million -of which normally one half would be IDA and the other half CCCE
funds - would not require prior IDA approval up to aggregate approvals of
IDA funds of US$ 1.5 million (CFAF 337 million),but would be subject to
sample ex-post review by the Association during frequent supervision missions.
CCCE would review all sub-projects. BCD would be free to seek joint financing
from IDA and CCCE or from only one of them for those sub-projects above the
free limit of CFAF 30 million.
Guarantee Fund
53.       A notable feature of the project is the establishment of FOGAPR
to guarantee credits to SE.   FOGAPE has been financed by Government with
a CFAF 125 million budgetary allocation, and, in addition, is to receive
funding from special taxes on the profits of commercial banks in Cameroon.
Under Decree No. 75/238 which establishes FOGAPE, the Government has agreed
that BCD's loans to SME would be guaranteed automatically by the fund, which
1J Small- and medium-scale enterprises are defined by Cameroonian law as firms
whose management is Cameroonian with 51 percent of capital help by nationals.
They should also meet one of the following three conditions: (i) they pay
the minimum tax ("forfait"); (ii) their short-term rediscount quota at the
Central Bank is not above CFAF 25 million, or (iii) their equity is not above
CFAF 50 million.



- 13 -
would cover up to 80 percent of any eventual loss.  The maximum ratio of gua-
rantees outstanding to the fund's resources is set by law at 7:1.
Investment Incentives
5h.       The incentives available under the SME regime such as tariff reductions
on imported capital goods are considered by entrepreneurs to be of considerable
advantage and in the past many have deferred beginning a project until the
incentives are granted. Therefore, Government will simplify and accelerate
procedures for granting investment incentives to recipients of small sub-loans
under the project.
Procurement and Disbursements
55.       Goods to be procured under the credit would involve small amounts,
and their varied nature would make them unsuitable for bulk procurement through
international competitive bidding. They would be procured through normal com-
mercial channels; essentially all the capital goods would be imported and
overseas suppliers are adequately represented in Cameroon. BCD would satisfy
itself that goods and services procured are competitive in quality and price
and meet the needs of its clients. Agreement has been reached with CCCE that
procurement for sub-projects that are jointly financed, would not be restricted
to the Franc zone, as is its normal practice.
56.       IDA financing would cover about 40 percent of the total cost of smaller
projects and about 20 percent of the total cost of larger projects where these
are co-financed with CCCE.  In the rare case of larger projects in which IDA
funds would be the only source of foreign exchange, IDA financing would cover 40
percent of the total project costs. The credit will be disbursed during an
estimated four-year period.
Benefits and Justification
57.       In a country where there seems to be a sizeable reservoir of potential
entrepreneurs, the project would initiate a process to remove all three main
bottlenecks to their emergence: technical assistance, finance and administrative
procedures. The project would expand and improve the work of existing technical
assistance'agencies (whose activities might otherwise be curtailed for lack of
funds), increase their cost-effectiveness through a greater volume and concen-
tration of operations, improve their coordination, and help them diversify
regionally. The appraisal capacity of BCD will be strengthened and the impact
of sub-projects improved through more systematic use of economic analysis. We
also expect that applications for technical assistance and financing will greatly
increase with the greater availability of financial assistance and the improvement
in Government guarantees and incentives under the SME regime.
58.       Further, this first experimental credit would associate the Bank
Group with current efforts to learn more about, to reorganize and to find
effective ways to help the SME sector. Opportunities will be created to
study and discuss industrial policies with the Government, and to prepare
future action based on an improved institutional framework, possibly involving
commercial banks among the financing agencies.

59.       The proposedr project, though modest in its scope, would help promote
new small entrepreneurs and a mnmber of larger ventures, representing total
investments of about US$ 11 million and resulting in employment involving up-
graded skills for about 1000 workers. It would foster development of a class
of Cameroonian entrepreneurs, starting a cumulative process of the greatest
importance for the private sector. The expected geographic distribution of
sub-projects would contribute to regional development and industrial decen-
tJrali 7.at Ion.
60.       The variety and uncertainty about the number of sub-loans to SME,
make  it difficult to estimate the projectts overall economic rate of return.
Approved sub-projects are expected to have a financial return in excess of 15
percent. Considering the substantial urban unemployment and the under-
exploitation of many local raw materials, economic returns on most sub-projects
would be above the financial returns.  Since much of the additional production
would replace imported goods, the project would produce relativrely significant
foreign exchange savings.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1J
Cr. No. 100, Ln. No. 490  CAMDEV ProJect; US$ 11 million Credit of March
28, 1967; CLosing Date: June 30. 1972 and
US$ 7 million Loan to CAMDEV of same date;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977 (Original
Closing Date: December 31._1974).
The original planting and replanting program of 11,500 ha of various
tree crops was reduced by 1,000 ha of tea; the revised program is substantially
complete and has been satisfactorily carried out. The management structure
was recently improved. Increases in commodity prices, coupled with effective
Government-supported economy measures, have led to a sound liquid position,
in place of previous deficits. The financial prospects are good. A period
of consolidation is now required to improve production efficiency and cost
control. For this purpose, new investment is needed in more estate roads
and additional equipment for the oil and rubber mills. Therefore, the
closing date of the loan was recently extended to 6-30-77.
Ln. No. 593 and Sp Ln. No. 886  Oil Palm Project; US$ 7.9 million Loan
to Souame of ADril 15. 1969; glosin2q Date:
December 31. 1976 and US$ 1.7 _Million
Supplemental Loan of April 9. 1973:
Closing Date: June 30. 1979.
The project is progressing satisfactorily. The establishment of
8,500 ha of oil palms will be completed in 1975 with the planting of the
final 900 ha. One of the two mills has been completed; the second is
expected to be commissioned in May 1975. In order to imaprove labor
conditions, it is proposed to expand and improve the estate housing
program. Because substantial production only starts in 1975 some short-
term borrowing may be needed to avoid delaying this program. Financial
prospects are good, however. Yields are in line with appraisal projections
and palm oil prices are higher.
1J These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, ar,d in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanceu evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

In. No. 604  Water Supoly Project; US$ g million Loan to SN_C of June 2,
1969; Closing Date: December '1, 1974 (Original Closing
Date: Ma       y_1,192.
This project was completed ahead of schedule with substantial savings
which have been approved for investment in further water distribution woris;
however, disbursements lagged due to the strong working capital position of
the Borrower and the closing date was postponed three times in order to allow
remaining funds to be disbursed. SNEC and Government (Guarantor) have accepted
the Bank's proposal for closure of the loan as of December 31, 1974 and the
Bank has cancelled the unused balance of US$ 70,000.
Cr. No. 161 First Education Project; US$ 10.5 million Credit of September
23, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, l975 (Original Closing
Date: June 30, 1974).
Construction of the project schools is about 12 months late
due to delays in selecting the consultants, reaching agreement on schedules
of accommodation, revising the bidding documents, starting construction works
for which overpriced initial bids on 16 schools had to be cancelled, and
awarding contracts. Project management has improved and progress is now
generally satisfactory. There are however some additional delays in
equipment procurement. The estimated final total project cost is within
appraisal estimates in CFA Francs, but about US$ 1.2 million equivalent was
lost due to the fluctuations in the US dollar. The technical assistance
program is 30 months behind schedule due to a slow selection process and the
closing date will need to be extended from December 31, 1975 to June 30, 1977.
Cr. No. 180, Ln. No. 663  First Highway Pro.ject; US$ 7 million Credit of March
27, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974 and'
US$ 12 million Loan of same date; (Closinp Date:
December 31, 1975; (Original Closing Date:
December 31, 1973; first postponement: December
31, 1974).
The Tiko-Victoria road was completed satisfactorily in April 1973.
The first eection of the N'Gaoundere-Garoua road was completed in Il4arch
1974. The other two sections will not be finished before June 1975, i.e.
one year behind schedule, since the contractor only recently finished
repairing damages that occured during the last rainy season, and has
completed construction of 110 km out of the total of 178 km. Cost over-
runs are estimated at US$ 5.1 million, of which 40 % is due to currency
realignment, 45 % to inflation, and 15 % to quantity increase.

Ln. No. 687  Railway ProAect; US$ 5.2 million Loan to REGIFERCAM of June 9
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975; (Original Closing Date:
June 30, 1274).
The Loan 687-CM is now fully disbursed. Project execution has been
satisfactory for track renewal work and delivery of motive power and rolling
stock. Unforeseen technical difficulties, such as extremely bad subsoil condi-
tions, made lengthy studies necessary before selecting the site and the optimum
design of a new railway bridge at Japoma, near Douala. Funds of Loan No. 687
proved to be insufficient to cover the full construction costs of a new bridge.
Supplementary financing has been provided under the Second Railway Project
(Ln. No. 1038).
Cr. No. 229 Douala Port Project; US$ 1.5 million Credit of Janu§1Z 1y,
1271- Closing Date: December 31, 197 (Original Closing Date:
June 20? 197r3) * 
The Douala Port, Project commenced in July 1972 and physical work
under the Credit was satisfactorily completed in November 1974.   Credit
covenants and undertakings given during Credit negotiations have been
reasonably fulfilled, but financial targets have not been achieved in
recent years. nemedial measures are now being urged by the Association.
Cr. No. 302  SEMRY Rice Project; US$ 3.7 million Credit of April 26. 1972;
Closinig Date: June 30,. 1976.
The project started in mid 1972 and is progressing satisfactorily.
Implementation is largely on schedule. However, the devaluation of the US
dollar and additional works have increased costs by about 36 percent.  The
Government, CCCE and FAC are financing the cost overrun.
Cr. No. 320  Second Education Project; US$ 9 million Credit of June 28.
1972; Closing Date: June 30. 1979.
Due to delays in selecting the consulting architects, the date
of effectiveness specified in the Credit Agreement, October 2, 1972, had
to be postponed to February 27, 1973. Due to difficulties in selecting
the sites for the construction of two project institutions, and the need
to revise the sketch and preliminary drawings, the design period will
be extended by about nine months, but no extension of the closing date
of June 30, 1979, is expected. The project is generally well managed,
but will face severe cost overruns due to the accelerated price increases
which have occured since 1973. Detailed proposals for refinancin- will
be worked out by the mission that appraised the Third Education Project
-in Pehruary/March 1975.

Cr. No. 429  Ln. No. 9235  Second _Hihway Project;  US$ 2L million Credit of
Septemrber 26  197; closir   De          ber '1,
1978 and lTS$ 24 million Loan of same date; Closing
Date: December 31. 1978.
Because of inflation and the price escalation clause, bids for the
construction of the three roads were 35 % higher than the appraisal estimates
and costs are continuing to climb. The Government has awarded construction
contracts for all roads at the original bid price. On the basis of new estimates
of inflation rates, the total cost of the project is now estimated at US$ 112
million with a foreign cost component of US$ 76 million. The Bank Group is
considering proposing an increase in its contribution to the financing of this
project.
Ln. No. _983  Livestock Project;  us$ 11.6 million Loan of May 14. 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Initial implementation is satisfactory except for some delays in
release of funds by the Government. Staffing of the agencies concerned is
progressing well.   In February 1975, Consultants were to be invited to submit
proposals for the design of slaughter plants. Disbursements are slow but are
expected to accelerate and conform to appraisal estimates in 1976.
Ln. No. 1038   Second Railway Project; US$ 16.0 million Loan to REGIFERCAM of
September 18  1974; ClosinL Date: December 31, 127.
Procurement of main project items is well umderway; track material is
on site for installation and rolling stock should be available by end 1975.
Proposals for the management consulting services and for the Douala-Yaoundg
transport corridor study have been invited.   Because of currency realignments
since appraisal of the project, completion depends on supplementary funds, which
the railway has requested be provided by the Government or from additional
borrowing. Due to the present world slump in the timber market and a recent subs-
tantial increase in staff costs, REGIFERCAM will have difficulty in attaining
the financial covenants included in the Loan Agreement.
Ln. No. 1039 Cocoa Project; Us$ 6.5 million Loan of September 18, 1974:
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The loan became effective on February 26, 1975. There has been good
progress in the establishment of the project's management structure as well as
in the preparation of field development, which is due to commence in May 1975,
and in the training program. The procurement of material to start the feeder
road program has been delayed because of slow progress in establishing the
organization to carry it out, but this problem has now been solved with the
signature of a satisfactory contract between the project authority and the
Pablic Roads Department.

ENTERPRISE PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:                   United Republic of Cameroon
BeneficiarZ:                Banque Camerounaise de Developpement (BCD)
Amount:                     US$ 3.0 million(equivalent)
Terms on IDA
Credit:                     Standard
Co-financin-:               CCCE would participate in the financing of the invest-
ment component of the project with a loan to BCD of
US$ 3.0 million equivalent. UNDP would finance the fo-
reign exchange costs of the technical assistance.
Relendin- Terms:            Government will relend IDA funds to BCD at 5 percent per
annum;the repayment period will include a three-year grace
period and will be on a 15 year schedule, which could be
revised from time to time to conform to the aggregate
of sub-loan repayments to BCD. The cost of CCCE funds
to BCD will be 5.0 percent and the repayment period
will be 15 years, with three of grace. The effective
cost of funds to sub-borrowers would be 11 percent p.a.
The cost to borrowers will include 2 percent for taxes,
a spread of 2.75 percent to BCD which is comparable to
its present range of spreads on term industrial loans,
and 1.25 percent to benefit FOGAPE where loans are
covered by the guarantee fund or to compensate Government
for assumption of the foreign exchange risk on other
loans. Terms are expected to be from 7 to 15 years
including 2 to 3 years of grace.
Project Description:        The proposed project consists of US$ 3.0 million to be
lent to Government for relending to BCD to finance the
establishment and expansion of privately owned small-
and medium-scale manufacturing, artisan, serv-ice, trans-
port, repair,and construction firms. The investment
component is to be jointly financed with CCCE and tech-
nical assistance will be mainly financed by UNDP. The
credit is expected to bolster BCD's role as an effective
development institution and improve technical assistance
facilities for SME. The credit will also provide a means
for the Bank Group and Government to learn more about
effective policies and procedures for SME promotion and
financing and about the benefits accruing therefrom.

through normal commercial channels; essentially all
the capital goods would be imported and overseas
suppliers are adequately represented in Cameroon.
BCD would satisfy itself that goods and services
