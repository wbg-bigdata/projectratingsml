                              SCHEDULE 2
              Description of the Project
     The objectives of the Project are: (i) to improve
the efficiency of the food marketing system in Mexico
through the adoption of modern technology and improved
marketing methods; (ii) to improve the conditions of
competition through better dissemination of information
on prices and volumes of products traded, and (iii) to
strengthen FIDEC's institutional capabilities.
     The Project consists of the following parts, subject
to such modifications thereof as the Bank and the
Borrower may agree upon from time to time to achieve such
objectives:
Part A:   Financing of Subloans
Part B:   Technical assistance, consisting of:
1.   Studies and institutional strengthening for the
purposes of: (a) establishing of a methodology for
analyzing and monitoring the food marketing sector; (b)
analyzing the distribution systems of selected products
or product groups in order to determine investment
possibilities; (c) reviewing the organizational structure
and technical expertise of FIDEC in order to improve
them; and (d) supporting the function within FIDEC's
management which will be in charge of the carrying out of
the above studies and will have a permanent advisory
role.
2.   Studies for the purposes of: (a) determining the
feasibility of introducing an auction system in several
wholesale markets and (b) reviewing the regulatory
framework applicable to food distribution in Mexico City
to determine whether it unduly creates barriers of entry
or delays the modernization of food distribution within
the area of Mexico City.
3.   Training for the technical staff related to the
Project, mainly of FIDEC, the commercial banks and the
Beneficiaries, in respect of: (a) modernization of food
marketing; (b) policies, norms and procedures of FIDEC's
operations; (c) information systems in respect of food
marketing; and (d) Subproject evaluation and supervision.
4.   Acquisition by FIDEC of computer, statistical
information and telecopier systems and documentation
concerning food marketing.
5.   Acquisition of computer and telecopier systems for
SNIM for purposes of enabling SNIM to improve the
collection and dissemination of information provided by
it.

exclusively for Eligible Expenditures in accordance with
the provisions of this Schedule.  The Borrower shall make
withdrawals from the Special Account for payments of
Eligible Expenditures on the basis of the evidence that
the Bank shall have reasonably determined, and shall
debit the Special Account with the amount in dollars so
withdrawn or with the dollar equivalent of the currency
other than dollars in which the payment was made,
determined on the basis of the rate of exchange between
the dollar and such currency in effect: (i) on the date
of each payment, if the withdrawal from the Special
Account in respect of such payment has been made within
90 days of the date of the payment, or in the case of
Subloans requiring prior approval by the Bank, on the
date of each payment if the request for such approval in
respect of such payment has been made within 90 days of
the date of the payment, provided, however, that the
withdrawal from the Special Account in respect of such
payment has been made within 30 days of the date on which
the Bank has issued its approval of each such Subloan; or
(ii) on the date each withdrawal shall have been made.
3.   After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to
it that the Special Account has been duly opened,
withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be
made as follows:
     (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or
requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation.  On
the basis of such request or requests, the bank, shall,
on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower shall have requested.
     (b)  (i)  For replenishment of the Special Account,
               the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank
               requests for deposits into the Special
               Account at such intervals as the Bank
               shall specify.
          (ii) Prior to or at the time of each such
               request, the Borrower shall furnish to
               the Bank the documents and other evidence
               required pursuant to paragraph 4 of this
               Schedule for the payment or payments in
               respect of which replenishment is
               requested.  On the basis of each such
               request, the Bank, shall, on behalf of
               the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Page  15
               Account and deposit into the Special
               Account such amount as the Borrower shall
               have requested and as shall have been
               shown by said documents and other
               evidence to have been paid out of the
               Special Account for Eligible
               Expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective Eligible Categories,
and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have
been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.   For each payment made by the Borrower out of the
Special Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the
Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such
documents and other evidence showing that such payment
was made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of
this Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make
further deposits into the Special Account:
     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined
that all further withdrawals should be made by the
Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance
with the provisions of Article V of the General
Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
     (b)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the Eligible Categories for Parts A and B of
the Project, less the amount of any outstanding special
commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to Parts A
and B of the Project, shall equal the equivalent of
$20,000,000.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
Eligible Categories for Parts A and B of the Project
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by
notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall
be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on
deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such
notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible
Expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made
for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide
such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall
so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.
     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the special Account will
not be required to cover further payments for Eligible
Expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.
Page  16
     (c)  The Borrower, upon notice to the Bank, refund
to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in
the Special Account.
     (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b), and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to

cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
