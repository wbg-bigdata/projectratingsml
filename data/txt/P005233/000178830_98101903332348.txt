APPRAISAL OF THE FIRST TELECOMMJUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.         This report covers the appraisal of a project forming part of
Iraq's Five Year Telecommunications Bcpansion Program. The cost of the
program is estimated at ID 21.9 million (US$61.4 million).  The project
identified for Bank financing is estimated to cost ID 14.2 million
(US$39.7 million) including a foreign currency cost of ID 9.8 million
(US$27.5 million). The proposed Bank loan of US$27.5 million would
cover the foreign costs.
ii.        Telecommunications facilities in Iraq are seriously deficient
due to an almost complete lack of investment in the sector for the past
ten years. There is a long waiting list of applicants for telephone con-
nections and substantial demand for long distance calls which cannot be
met. The project would meet part of the demand for local telephone con-
nections by providing the cable network and associated facilities for
about 100,000 direct exchange lines. It would establish, for the first
time in Iraq, a long distance telephone service which would be both ade-
quate and reliable, thereby alleviating congestion and delays.  A micro-
wave link 1,000 km in length connecting the main centers of economic
activity would be the central feature of this service. It would also be
used to transmit television programs, and links to six television stations
form part of the project. International telephone, telegraph and telex
services would also be improved by the installation of a satellite ground
station permitting direct access to a high capacity and quality system
in replacement of the present HJF. systems which are inadequate in quality
and capacity. The internal financial rate of return of the program is
estimated at about 14%.
iii.       All equipnent and materials to be financed by the Bank would
be procured under international competitive bidding.
iv.        The borrower of the proposed loan would be the Government and
the beneficiary will be the Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones Administra-
tion (PT&T), which is responsible for all postal and telecomumnications
services in Iraq. PT&T has employed consultants (ARAC, Cairo/UAR) to
review and recommend improvements in its administration, management organiza-
tion and financial procedures. The consultants have tentatively recommended
separate accounting systems for the postal and telecommunications ser-
vices and will study the feasibility of dividing PT&T in-to two entities.
The Government intends to use this study for consideration of the changes
that may be necessary in the organization and procedures of PT&T.



- ii~ -
v.         The operating results of PM&T's telecommunications services
based on accounts which have been notionally separated from postal ser-
vices are satisfactory. Wdhile the tariff levels are adequate some
readjustments are desirable. The Government has formed a special com-
mittee to study tariffs. This study is expected to be completed prior
to the completion of the project.
vi.        The accounts outstanding from Government and its agencies
to PT&T for its services are rather high as of March 1970. The Govern-
ment has confirmed during negotiations that arrangements have been made
to ensure the prompt payment of past and future accounts by all users
of the telecommunications services provided through PM&T.
vii.       The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$27.5
million for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5-1/2 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Iraq has requested Bank assistance in
financing a project forming part of its Five Year Telecommunications
Expansion Program,included  in the National Development Plan for the
fiscal years 1971 to 1975, to be undertaken by the Iraqi PT&T Administration.
The program is estimated to cost ID 21.9 million (US$61.h million).
1.02      The purpose of the project proposed for Bank financing is to
develop the telecommunication service during the five year period by:
(i) doubling the number of telephone connections to meet a
part of the demand for local service;
(ii)  providing modern and reliable long distance service
adequate to meet existing and future demand;
(iii)  providing additional facilities as part of the main long
distance routes to link television stations for inter-
change of programs; and
(iv)  installing a satellite ground station to provide an
adequate international telegraph, telephone and telex
service from and to Iraq.
1.03      The cost of the project is estimated at ID 14.2 million (US$39.7
million) of which the foreign currency costs of ID 9.8 million (US$27.5
nillion) is proposed for Bank financing.
1.04      It would be the first Bank-assisted telecommunications project
in Iraq, and would be carried out by the Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones
Administration (PTkT), the wholly Government-owned entity that provides
all public telecommunications and postal services in the country. PT&T
would be the beneficiary of the proposed loan; the borrower would be the
Government.
1.05      The Government enquired about the possibility of Bank financ-
ing for a microwave project in October 1969. The Bank arranged for two
preappraisal missions to Iraq.  since no studies had been made, the
Government was advised, as a first step, to prepare a project feasibility
study. Government employed engineering consultants (Microwave Services
International Inc., New JerseyA/SA) and presented the required data for
the microwave project and the sector information in early September 1970.
This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission composed of
Messrs. F. Gheith and M. Kohler who visited Iraq in October/November 1970,
and a visit in April 1971 by Messrs. M. Kohler and S. Sathar.

2. THE ECONOMY AND THE SBETOR
A. Economic Setting
2.01       Lying in the arid zone of the Middle East, Iraq covers an area
of about 435,000 kmn2 traversed by the twin river system formed by Tigris
and Eiphrates. The country's population of about 9 million is concentrated
in the habitable areas provided by this river system. The western half of
the country is largely desert. Rich oil reserves are being exploited,
mostly in the mountainous region around Kirkuk in the northeast and also
around Basrah the main port, in the southeast.
2.02       The economy is based on two major components, agriculture and
the petroleum industry. The latter is the dominant component and provides
over 50% of Government revenues and about 90% of foreign exchange earnings.
The gross national product (GNP) is estimated to be US$2.7 billion, of
which about 33% is contributed by the petroleum industry, 19% by agricul-
ture, and 9% by manufacturing industry. The 1969 per capita GNP was
about US$300.
B. The Telecommunications Sector
2.03       Law No. 81 enacted in 1963 gives PM&T responsibility for pro-
viding all public postal and telecommunications services.  PT&T is a
wholly Government-owned entity under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Communications and operates essentially as a Government department rather
than an independent agency. It is financially independent of the Govern-
ment's budget for its revenues and current expenses; but, the Ministry
of Planning provides funds for capital development and PT&T is not expected
to generate funds internally for such purposes.
2.04       PT&T is headed by a Board of Directors with the Director
General of PT&T as Chairman of the Board. The other directors are repre-
sentatives of the Ministries of Finance, Defense and Interior and of the
PI&T labor union, a legal adviser and a senior engineer, nominated by the
Council of Ministers.  (See also paragraph 5.01.)
Existing Facilities
2.05       Since World War II the sector's development has been limited,
both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the last 10 years have been a
period of virtual stagnation. Progress in the sector and the quality of
its services have been hampered mainly by inadequate budgetary allocations
and repeated changes in the leadership of PT&T. Long waiting lists for
telephone connections and abnormal delays in long distance services are
symptoms that the sector lags far behind the demand for its services.



-3-
2.06       Some principal statistics for Iraq's local telephone service
in March 1970 are given below (see Annex 1 for details). Comparative
international statistics are given in Annex 15.
Number of automatic exchanges                               19
Total capacity of automatic exchanges (lines)          77,600
Number of manual exchanges                                 271
Total capacity of manual exchanges (lines)             24,860
Number of connected direct exchange lines (DEL's)    91,246
Approximate number of telephones                       143,600
Manual exchanges of less than 100 lines capacity are in service for 16,
12 or 7 hours daily in order to achieve economy in operation. Automatic
exchanges are of the step-by-step type. About half of them are 20 to 33
years old, and the service which they give is generally unsatisfactory in
quality. The local cable networks, which are largely of the same age as
the exchanges, are in bad shape. Most of the secondary distribution is
by overhead wire which causes continual difficulties in maintenance and
the repair of faults. PM1T only recently began rehabilitating the net-
works using underground distribution with work being carried out by foreign
contractors.
2.07       The main long distance telephone service in Iraq is provided by
carrier systems on open-wire routes, which permit only limited capacity
and reliability. In an effort to provide additional circuits, PT&T has
installed carrier systems on power lines but they do not provide the proper
quality of service and are unusual for use in public service. The long
distance service is being operated entirely on a manual basis which in
turn leads to uneconomic use of available circuits. Because of the poor
service, the Government has reserved for its priority use about 30% of
the circuits further aggravating the quality of service provided to the
public.  Frequent faults on the open-wire lines and theft of wires fur-
ther contribute to the unsatisfactory quality of the long distance service.
The total number of long distance circuits is 346, of which 134 operate
over power lines.
2.08       The telegraph service in Iraq operates on point-to-point work-
ing mainly by Morse. However, PT&T has introduced manual Gentex switch-
boards at Baghdad and Basrah with which a few teleprinter machines are
associated, and this service is being extended to other regions. Telex
service is on the basis of manual operation, with about 50 subscribers
connected, essentially airlines, news agencies, banks and some embassies.
2.09       The international service is operated by high-frequency radio
and is subject to all the shortcomings of this type of operation. The
international telephone service connects Iraq with 20 other countries,
while the international telegraph service connects with 14 destinations,
out of which 10 operate with teleprinters and 4 on Morse. PI&T has in
service 13 transmitters with 17 channels for telegraph services, 5 trans-
mitters with 10 channels for telephone service, and 24 receivers for both
telegraph and telephone service.

3. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. The Program
3.01      The five year program for development of telecommunications
of Iraq aims at improving and expanding the telecommunication facilities
and meet part of the demand for telephone connections; the long distance
national and international telegraph and telephone services will be
modernized and improved to provide a high quality service.
3.02      The program provides for (a) the installation of about
100,000 lines of local exchange equipment together with the local and
junction cable network and associated facilities, (b) the installation
of long distance facilities consisting of a backbone microwave network
with multiplex and associated switching equipment for subscriber trunk
dialing, (c) installation of a satellite ground station for international
services, (d) installation of Telex and Gentex system for about 700 lines
and (e) training facilities for PT&T's technical personnel. This program
is estimated to cost about ID 21.9 million (uS$61.4 million).  Details of
the program are set out in Annex 10.
3.03      The PM&T has contracted for about 58,000 lines of local ex-
change equipment and some of the cables required as a part of the program
and employed consultants to complete the detailed engineering and prepara-
tion of bid documents for the long distance facilities including the
microwave and switching systems. About ID 0.8 million (US$2.2 million)
has been spent during 1970-71, the first year of the program.
B. The Project
3.04      The project proposed for Bank financing is a part of the
telecommunications program and consists of the following:
(a) Microwave system connecting main towns from Baghdad to Hilla,
Basrah and Amara in the South and to Mosul, Kirkuk and Erbill
in the North; the provision of multiplexing equipment for
about 1,500 channels and television program interconnections
and spurs for about six TV stations; and installation of ultra
high frequ.ency links to the important urban centers in the
North East.
(b) Long distance exchange facilities with total capacity of
about 5,000 lines permitting direct subscriber trunk dialing
between the major cities.
(c) Part of the cable network and subscriber facilities including
local and junction cables and drop wires, branch exchanges and
telephone instruments.



(d)  National and international telex and gentex services by
providing exchange facilities of approximately 700 lines.
(e) A satellite ground station including an international
switching center and associated facilities.
(f) Ehgineering consultant services required for detailed
engineering of (e) and for supervision of construction
of (a), (b) and (e) above.
For the realization of the full benefits from the project, it is essen-
tial that certain related parts in the program mainly the installation
of local exchange equipment and cable network now in progress also be
completed. Government has given assurances during negotiations that
these works will be completed in time for the effective operation of the
project. Details of the project are given in Annex 10.
C. Costs
3.05       The estimated costs of the project are about ID 14.2 million
(Us$39.7 million) and are summarized below; further details are given in
Annex 10.

D. Contingencies
3.06       The estimates for the cables for the local service are based on
recent Iraqi contracts for similar cables.  A contingency provision of 10%
in local and foreign costs has been included to accommodate design changes.
The estimates for long distance facilities are largely based on consultant's
estimates for microwave systems which on the basis of experience appear to
be on the high side; even so, they were not reduced but a contingency of
only 5% was included to accommodate minor design changes.  The estimates
for the satellite ground station are based on the recent experience of
Communication Satellite Corporation (COMSAT). These cost;s have shown a



- 6 -
tendency to decline and the estimates thus have an inbuilt contingency
provision. With respect to other items in the project, a contingency
provision of 5% each for both physical and price changes in both local
and foreign costs has been provided.
E.  Items Proposed for Bank Financing

G.  Execution of the Project
3.09       The installation and commissioning of all equipment and of the cable
network will be carried out by suppliers under the supervision of PT&T.
PT&T will use their own staff to install subscribers cables and subscriber



apparatus including branch exchanges. These arrangements are satis-
factory. The detailed engineering of the long distance facilities com-
prising the microwave system, multiplexing and switching equipment has
been completed. Installation will be supervised by the consultants,
Microwave Services International Inc. USA. PT&T also is ciscussing with
COMSAT their employment as consultants for the satellite ground station
project.
3.10       The project is scheduled to be completed by March 1976.  A
detailed schedule is shown in Annex 13.
H. Disbursement
3.11       The proposed loan would be disbursed against the CIF costs of
imported equipment and materials and the foreign exchange component of
suppliers' installation and supervision costs. The estimated schedule of
disbursements is given in Annex 11.

4. JUSTIFICATION
4.01       The developaent of telecommunications in Iraq has been vir-
tually stagnant during the past 10 years and services are now lagging
far behind demand in all the basic branches -- local, long distance,
telex and international services. This state of affairs has had adverse
effects, particularly on industry and commerce, and has hampered national
development and social progress.
4.02       The project aims at:
(a)  improving the quality of the local service and partly
satisfying the demand for subscriber connections;
(b)  satisfying in full for the first time the projected traffic
demands of existing subscribers and new connections under
the project for long distance facilities;
(c) providing TV program inter-connections; and
(d)  improving the quality and capacity of the international
telegraph, telex and telephone services to meet the
demand for these facilities.
The justification for the components of the project required to achieve
these goals are set out below.
Local Telephone Service
4.03       For a number of years, demand for telephone connections in
Iraq has not been satisfied and only a few connections have been given
to high-priority applicants. The percentage utilization of the installed
exchange capacity (exchange fill) in the main towns served by automatic
exchanges has been abnormally high, ranging from 95 to almost 100%. The
total known demand in March 1970 amounted to 127,000 lines composed of
91,000 DE's in service and 36,000 registered applications.  Assuming a
modest growth of 10% per annum, which is exceeded in most developing
countries the total known demand in 1976 would be about 226,000 lines of
which the project aims at meeting only 170,000 DEL's by that time
(Annex 10, page 1). The actual shortfall is likely to be considerably
higher since the forecast demand has not taken into account any un-
expressed demand which by experience in other countries is known to be
substantial. The size of expansion has had to be limited because of
PT&T's financial resources and execution capability.
Long Distance Service
4.04       The existing long distance service is totally unsatisfactory
for several reasons as given in paragraph 2.07. The long distance faci-
lities included in the project would establish a country-wide network



-9-
vrLu-.3n willJ link together the main canter3 of econromic activity --
c.:ricultural, industrial, commercial and petroleum. The network will
a-so form the main artery for future connections with other Middle East
countries such as Turkey and Iran.  it could be extended to the other
neighbori.ng countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Saudi Arabia
at a later date.
a¢05      ]Because of the very poor quality of service at present, the
r;urrent traffic or historical traffic growth rates do not directly
±  irn±sh a basis for forecasting the fu-ture circuit requirements.  The
consultants have examined the needs or a detailed, section-by-section
analysis based on the interdependency betweeni the exchanges and expe-
r mLce in other countries. On account. of the improved service, the
traffic increases on this basis are expected to be between 200 to 300%
soon after commissioning of the microwave systEms followedL by a growth
of 15% per annumu. These forecasts appear reasonable.
L116       The microwave system has been designed to provi.de TV bearers
for program interconnection of 6 TV stations.  The additional TV faci-
lities will be about 20% of the total cost of a microwave system for
pt'blic telecommunications only.  The inclusion of these TF services as
an integral part of the microwave systea enables these facilities to be
provided at a small cost com-parsd -ith alternative methods, and the
country- would therefore benefit accordingly.
International Service
4.07       The present international telephone and telegraph services
from Iraq by means of HF Radio are inadeculate because of the poor quality
of service inh.erent with such systems and the lack of sufficient number
of circuits.  The use of satellite communications will enable Iraq to
provide high quality international services for the first time. COMSAT
has carried out a study recently and has estimated that the telephone
service which is of very poor quality now should show an immediate increase
of about 200% and thereafter both telephone and telex traffic will increase
at 15% annually. This COMSAT study also shows that the satellite ground
station in Iraq operating through an Indian Ocean satellite is expected
to be profitable from the first year of operations in 1974.
Least-Cost Solution
4.O8       Selecting the least-cost solution for expansion of the local
exchange systems requires coordination in size and timing with the over-
all Program, using optimizing techniques developed over the years by the
major international telecommunications entities.  PT&T has handled this
problem satisfactorily on a detailed exchange-by-exchange analysis of the
e=t mated growth of demand.



- 10 -
4.09      The engineering consultants' studies have shown that, con-
sidering present needs and the projected annual growth in traffic, a
microwave scheme would be the least-cost solution for the provision of
an adequate long distance service in Iraq, as compared with the alter-
native of a coaxial cable.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
4.1o      The internal financial rate of return of the five year program
is estimated to be about 14% (see Annex 12, page 2). The rate of return
was detenmined by equalizing the present values of expenditures and incre-
mental cash flows.  Improvement and expansion of Iraq's telecommunications
will produce other benefits besides revenues; for example it will promote
business, transportation and other economic activities.
4.11      Because of the very close interrelation between the facilities
which are to be provided under the project and those which are to be pro-
vided under the program, it is impossible to identify incremental cash
flows with the project investment. Therefore, no internal financial rate
of return can be developed for the project alone. However, for the micro-
wave network, where the major components are provided under the project
and the related incremental cash flows can be estimated, the internal
financial rate of return is estimated to be about 30% (Annex 12, page 3).
A sensitivity approach was applied by varying the projected number of
telephone calls per long distance circuit, and indicated returns of 26%
and 33% respectively for the 20% lower and higher traffic projections.

5. THE BENEFICIARY
A. Organization and Management
5.01      The organizational structure of PT&T generally follows con-
ventional practices with separate functional units for postal, telephone
and telegraph operations, postal savings accounts, accounting, legal and
personnel. There have been deficiencies in the past in the management
especially on the financial side. The management has also suffered from
the organizational weaknesses in decision making with respect to procure-
ment, personnel and tariffs. Major decisionson the project, however,
have already been made and the efficiency of management is expected to
improve with the reorganization under study by consultants (paragraph
5.02). Management in the technical branches is adequate and capable of
planning and supervising project execution.  PI&Tts administrative systems
and methods require improvement and its financial area ne!eds strengthening.
B. Management Consultants
5.02      The Government has been aware of the need to remove the weak-
nesses referred to above as well as others in accounting (see paragraph
5.03 below). In order to do so PT&T has engaged Arab Research and
Administration Center (ARAC, UAR), management consultants, with terms
of reference summarized in Annex 9. The consultants will also be study-
ing as a long-term proposition, the feasibility of separa,ting tele-
communications and postal operations. The Government has confirmed during
negotiations that the consultant's recommendations will be used for consider-
ing necessary changes in the organization and procedures of PT&T.
C. Accounting and Audit
5.03       Eiile PT&TIs accounts have been kept on an accrual basis since
1963, there were for several years substantial arrears in the actual prep-
aration of the annual financial statements. With guidance from the
auditors, PT&T has recently managed to bring its records up to date, and
has produced the March 1970 statements within six months after the close
of the year. Even so the present accounting system does not provide
management with the necessary data for decision-making and control, and
no interim financial data and operating data by type of services or
revenue and expense budgets are prepared. The consultants are reviewing
this area and will make recammendations to remedy this s-ituation.
5.04      PT&TIs accounts have been reviewed periodically by the Auditor
General on behalf of the Government. In addition, as required by the
PT&T law, a systematic audit has been carried out regularly since 1963
by a local firm of independent public accountants. These auditors pre-
pare their report and accompanying financial data in Arabic. Assurances



- 12 -
were obtained during negotiations that: (1) the audit reports and
financial statements of PT&T will be submitted to the Bank in English
within six months of the close of the fiscal year, and (2) starting
April 1, 1975 the reports will cover the separate accounts of telecom-
munications operations.
D. Staff and Training
5.05      PT&T's staff totalled 10,014 on March 31, 1970.  The present
estimate of those engaged in telecommunications is 70% or about 7,000
employees but there is some uncertainty and the consultants are to
determine the exact number. although this figure includes staff for
telegraph operation, the resulting ratio of 47 persons per 1,000 tele-
phones is on the high side. Annex 15 shows comparative ratios from some
other countries.
5.06      The Government has been aware of over-staffing in its depart-
ments and public enterprises and imposed severe restrictions on new
employment several years ago. Accordingly, PT&T proposes to hire only
a minimum of staff to overcome its shortage of experienced financial
personnel and qualified technicians and engineers. For other require-
ments PT&T proposes to arrange for retraining or redeployment of staff
who will become redundant in other categories. PT&T expects to add only
about 600 employees during the construction period and to achieve a staff
ratio of 32 persons per 1,000 telephones by 1976.
5.07      PT&T's major staffing weakness is in the financial area.  Only
a few of the staff now employed in accounting are qualified to fill other
than clerical positions. To overcome this weakness, PT&T plans to hire
an adequate number of experienced accountants and to promote the more-
promising members of its present accounting staff after they have com-
pleted in-service training courses.
5.08      The training of telecommunications technical staff has been
progressing satisfactorily over the past few years. The training center
for telecommunications technicians, which began operations in 1964 with
the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) under UNDP financing,
is graduating about 100 technicians every second year. Besides full
courses for technicians, the curriculum includes brief introductory
training for new engineers and in-service training for engineering staff.
The training facilities are being extended to increase the number of sub-
jects and of trainees. A special section for in-service training for
accounting staff is planned to start early in 1972. Other subjects to be
taken up include microwave radio techniques, crossbar automatic exchanges
and telex operations. During the calendar years 1971-1975, over two
thousand trainees will attend the center for in-service technical train-
ing. For this extension of its training center PT&T has applied for
continued UNDP assistance.

6.   FINANCE
A.  Financial Arrangements
6.01      Under the Iraqi system, all developmental or expansion projects,
including the telecommunications expansion program, have to be specifi-
cally included in and financed from the National Development Plan.  Financ-
ing is provided out of Plan funds which are comprised of 50% of oil reve-
nues and a share of profits from the various departments and entities of
the Government including the PT&T as laid down in the laws appropriate to
each case.
6.02      While the pattern of financing differs from conventional prac-
tice, Government does recognize that PT&T should operate on a commercial
basis as prescribed in PT&T Law No. 81 of 1963, and should yield a reason-
able surplus which would accrue to the centralized pool of Government
resources for future expansion activities. In order to generate annual
revenues sufficient to (1) cover all expenses of telecommunication faci-
lities, including adequate maintenance, depreciation and interest charges;
(2) cover repayment of telecommunications borrowings to the extent not
covered by depreciation and (3) create a reasonable surplus to finance
future investments, the Government agreed during negotiations to take
necessary steps to ensure that a reasonable annual return on national
investment in telecommunication facilities will be obtained from April 1,
1977. A return of 10% on net fixed assets would appear reasonable.
B.   Tariffs
6.03      Annex 8 summarizes the telecommunications tariffs presently in
effect. The amounts charged to subscribers for monthly rental of con-
nections, as well as installation charges, includes an excise duty of
about 20%. These duties are special to telephone subscribers as user
charges and have been treated as part of revenues in the notional ac-
counts of PT&T in this report.
6.o4      The aggregate charges for local service are in line with charges
in neighboring countries. The telecommunications revenues during each of
the past three years have been adequate to cover telecommunications ex-
penses and to produce a return above 9%. With current tariffs the return
on total net investments would drop somewhat until the new investment be-
comes fully operational but is expected to be above 8% from 1977 onward.
6.o5      While the overall tariffs are generally satisfactory there are
some structural anomalies. The number of free calls allowed is high,
particularly to newspapers. The long distance rates especially for the
short and intennediate distances are on the low side. Also the charges
for leased circuits to Government have not been worked out on a rational



- 14 - 
basis. The Government has formed a special committee to study the tele-
communication tariffs and to recommend for Government consideration, any
adjustments which appear necessary. The study is expected to be com-
pleted prior to the completion of the construction of the project by
March 31, 1976.
C. Past Financial Performance
6.o6      PT&T has not kept separate accounts for the-postal and tele-
communications operations. Therefore financial data for telecommunica-
tions operations has been prepared on a pro-forma basis by notional
separation from PT&T's audited financial statements.
6.07      PT&T's past performance (pro-forma data for telecommunications
is shown in Annex 5 and for PT&T as a whole in Annex 2) has shown improve-
ment during the past three years due in part to the effect of excise
duties. The rates of return on average net plant in service are as
follows:
1968    1969    1970
() denotes loss
Total PMT                 (3.1)    (1.0)    3.8
Telecommunications         9.4      11.8    20.1
Though the rate of return on the telecommunications operations has been
satisfactory, traffic has not been increasing because of acute congestion,
especially in long distance. The national long distance revenues from
1968 to 1970 have declined as shown in Annex 5 due to the use of avail-
able facilities for Government priority users (paragraph 2.07).
6.o8      Annex 3 shows PT&TIs balance sheets for the past three years.
The following is a summary of the March 31, 1970, pro-forma financial
position for telecommunications:
(millions)
Dinars    US$
Assets
Fixed assets:
Net plant in service                          4.2     11.8
Work in progress                              2.9       8.1
Total fixed assets                      7.1      19.9
Current assets                                   3.9     10.9
Total assets                           11.0      30.8
Liabilities
Equity                                           8.3     23.2

Current liabilities                              1.9      5.3
Total liabilities                      11.0      30.8



- 15 -
6.09      The valuation of fixed assets is based on suppliers' invoiced
costs plus related expenses, but does not include minor elements of
PT&T's own labor costs incurred for installation of equipment. While
the book figures are acceptable and have been used in the financial
presentation of this report, PT&T should identify and determine appro-
priate values for the fixed assets when separate accounts are introduced.
6.10      However, while the general position is good, the collection of
accounts receivable is not satisfactory. The balance sheet contains
ID 1.08 million (US$3.04 million) of past due accounts equalling about
3-1/2 months of 1970 total billings. Government institutions, public
enterprises and some individuals whose accounts are to be settled by
Government, appear to be responsible for these arrears. The record of
the other subscribers is satisfactory because they are disconnected if
they fall in arrears. Consolidated information per account reconciled
with each Government institution is not available, but the Minister of
Communications has directed PT&T to submit consolidated statements of
accounts to all the institutions concerned. The Government has also
arranged with the Minister of Finance for PT&T to be paid directly from
the various annual budgets of the institutions.
D.   Financing Plan
6.11      Annex 7 shows the estimated past and forecast sources and
applications of funds for the telecommunication operations. The fund
requirements during the construction period exclusive of those estimated
to be expended during 1971 (paragraph 3.03) are summarizecd as follows:
(thousands)
Dinars    US$        %
Applications of Funds
Ecpenditures on this program             21,126   59,15:3    73.8
Expenditures on subsequent program         5,686   15,921l   19.9
Increase in working capital (net)         1,820    5,09e      6.3

Sources of Funds
Internal cash generation                 12,135   33,978    42.4
Less: Repayment to Planning Board       (   310) (  868) ( 1.1)
Profit and other distributions
to Government                  ( 5,498) (15,394) ( 19.2)
Net internal cash generation              6,327   17,716    22.1
Receipts from Planning Board             21,485   60,158    75.0
Subscribers, deposits (net)                 820    2,296      2.9
Total sources                       28,632   80,170   100.0



- 1.6 - 
While the pro-fonna net internal cash generation shows that PT&T provides
22.1% of the requirements of funds, the forecast total generation of
funds available for investment is expected to amount to 42.4%.
6.12      The estimated amount of expenditures for the subsequent program
represents downpayments on orders for equipment to be installed during
the subsequent phase of the ongoing expansion program. The planning for
the subsequent expansion will be made during the project period and
advance payments will become due when entering into contractual commit-
ments toward the end of the period.
6.13      The financial plan envisages that the -eceivables will be
reduced to an acceptable level by the collection of ID 427,000 (US$1.2
million) during 1972 from various governmental institutions as a result
of the action indicated in paragraph 6.10.
E. Future Finances
6.14      Forecast pro-forma income statements for telecommunications
for 1971-1978 and a summary of the assumptions nr uziih they are based
are shown in Annex 5. The rate of return on th,. .verage net plant in
service is expected to increase gradually, reaching 8.4% in 1977.  The
operating ratio will continue to improve reaching the level of 0.73 in
1977.
6.15      During the project period telecommunications revein,es are
expected to increase by about 100% -- from ID 3,649,000 (U. ;V10.2 million)
to ID 7,306,000 (US$20.5 million).  The number of subscribers will nearly
double during the period, and adequate long distance facilities will be
put into service for the first time. As a result of all these factors,
average telephone revenues per DEL are estimated to increase from ID 31
(US$86.80) in 1971 to ID 39 (US$109.20) in 1976.
6.16      The financial position of telecommunications, as shown in the
pro-forma forecast balance sheets in Annex 6, is expected to remain sound.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURIG NBGOTIATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  The Bank will be furnished a satisfactory certified annual
audit report of PT&T, in English, within six months of
the close of the fiscal year. Commencing no later than
April 1, 1975, these financial statements will reflect
separately the telecommunications operations. (Paragraph 5.04,)
(b) From April 1, 1977 a reasonable annual retarn on national
investments in telecommunication facilities will be obtained.
(Paragraph 6.02.)
7.02      The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$27.5
million for a tenm of 20 years, including a 5-1/2 year grace period.

ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 3 pages
Notes on the Pro-Forma
Income Statements
1.        Revenues have been forecast under the following assumptions:
Rent and local service - at the 1970 average annual revenue.s of ID 17.15
per subscriber.
National long distance service - at the 1970 level of revenues for 1971
and 1972, thereafter considering the new microwave scheme with STD
operation which will progressively come into operation; 20% beginning in
January 1, 1973, 40% by January 1, 1974, and the full scheme by July 1, 1972.
A traffic upsurge of 300%o is assumed in each section following commissioning,
thereafter a 10%1o annual growth traffic.
International long distance service - at the 1970 level of revenues for
1971 and 1972, and reflecting the satellite ground station beginning
operations on January 1, 1974. A 15% annual increase in traffic is assumed.
Leased circuits - at 60% of national long distance revenues for 1972 and
1973, subsequently at ID 2,250 per annum per circuit (based on ID 5 per
circuit/kilometer, assuming 450 km average circuit length), based on 100
circuits leased in 1974, 150 in 1975 and an increase of 25 circuits per
annum thereafter. Revenues from the lease of circuits to the television
authorities have been forecast to start accruing on October 1, 1974, on
ID 200,000 annual basis.
Installations and transfers - at ID 14.1 per average subscriber as experi-
enced in past years, for the estimated connections through November 1,1970,
thereafter ID 22 per new subscriber by considering the published increase
of the installation charges which became effective November 1, 1970.
Telex service - assumed that the service is to come into full operation
on October 1, 1973, with a 15%  annual grQwth in revenues thereafter.
Telegraph revenues - at the 1970 level of revenues, assuming that the
increase in international telegraph traffic will compensate the decrease
in national telegraph traffic.
Excise duties - have been considered to be an element of PT&T revenues
since they are specific user charges.
2.        Personnel expenses have been forecast on the basis of a 4* annual
increase in the average compensation per employee and an increase gradually
in the number of employees by about 600 during project execution as well as

Rage - of 3 pages
by the necessary personnel in respect of the satellite ground station
(including expatriates during 1974 and 1975) and 50 persons each in
1977 and 1978 for additional technical and accounting staff.
3.        The forecast of other operating expenses is based on a l0
annual increase starting from the 1970 level of expenses and adding in
those years, where necessary, the expenses of the management consultants

Notes on the Pro-Forma
Balance Sheets
1.        The value of fixed assets additions and transfer of work in
progress to plant in service in the forecast balance sheet of 1971-1976
are in harmony with the data given in the Estimated Costs Table in
Annex 10. The 1977-1978 expenditures for the subsequent program has
been estimated on the basis of i4% of the cost value of plant in service
at the previous year's end.  The 1977-1978 balances of work in progress
have been forecast at 35% of the aggregate amount of the current year's
capital expenditures and the balance of work in progress brought forward
from the prior year.
2.        The March 1977 and 1978 cash holdings have been forecast on
the basis of 2 months of the subsequent year's operating cash outflows.
3.        Beginning March 1973, subscribers' accounts receivable and
accrued income have been forecast conservatively as the aggregate sums
of 15% of the current year's rent and telegraph charges including excise
duties, 50% of the current year's long distance call charges, and 25%l of
current year's telex, leased circuit and other revenues.
4.        For inventories it has been assumed that ID 125,000 of the
cables held in stock on March 1970 will be used annually during 1971
and 1975 for the execution of the local network projects; conversely,
stores have been projected to increase by 5% of the annual capital
expenditures between 1972 and 1978.
5.        Other current assets have been forecast to increase annually
by ID 15,000, the same amount of increase as projected for other current
liabilities.
6.        The notional "initial capital", figure per April 1, 1967, has
been determined by difference of all other balance sheet items. The
amounts of capital provided per plan law in 1977 and 1978 and, included
in the balance sheet totals, have been determined on a residual basis
to balance the financing plan in these years while maintaining the cash
positions outlined under 2 above.
7.        The forecast of subscribers' deposits is based on the continued
levy of a subscriber deposit which averaged ID 8.6, in March 1970.

Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones Administration (PT&T)
Telecommunications program and project
Details of the five year teleccmmunications expansion program
of Iraq is given in sections A to E below.  The project which is a part
of the program comprises of all of the facilities included in the program
with the following exceptions:
(a)  local exchange equipment, local exchange buildings and
about 50% of the cable network which forms a part of
the facilities detailed under section A.
(b) the microwave systems to neighboring countries under
section D.
A.   Local Telephone Service
The expansion of local service is expected to achieve the
following targets:

Total capacity          88  102  102   102  117  132  150  170  191
Number of DEL's         80   90   91    95  100  115  130  150  170
Number of telephones  124  141  143   145  150  173  182  210  238
Registered waiting lists show 36,000 applications for connections, 18,000
of them in Baghdad. Because of long waiting time and scarcity of available
connections, the hidden demand is expected to be very high, and Project
will alleviate only part of the pressure, leaving substantial remedy to
subsequent stages of the ongoing expansion when demand wiLL be more
precisely established., execution capacity of PT&T improved and financial
resources adequate.
During the project period, 100,000 additional capacity lines
will be added (11,500 to replace worn-out equipment). After interna-
tional competitive bidding PT&T has contracted for 58,000 lines and is
finalizing the contract for the remaining 42,000 on the same bid. The
distribution of these additional capacities and dates of commissioning
are shown in table 1 of this Annex.
Cable networks to meet the targets for additional connections
will be taken up during the project period. Some of the cables for the
58,000 lines have already been procured, while the remainder, (in addition



ADTNEX 10
Page 2 of 5 pages
to the requirements for the 42,000 lines) will soon be procured -- all
under international competitive bidding.
Renovation of the existing distribution networks and replace-
ment of the overhead wires by secondary cables are an urgent necessity
in ordei to improve the service and overcome frequent faults and repairs.
PT&T started tihis work recently, and will continue it progressively
during the project period.
The execution of most of cable networks and the renovation
are being carried out by foreign contractors through full international
competitive bi dding.
B.   Long Distance Service
The Chart (Annex 14) and Map show the main microwave backbone
connecting the main towns from Baghdad to Basrah and Amara in the south
and to Mosul, Kirkuk and Erbill in the north. They also show the UHF
links that will cornect 16 other towns and localities to the microwave
backbone. Chart (Annex 14) also shows the number of circuits provided
under the project between zones, toll centers on the microwave route and
other to-wns that will be served by the UHF links.
nhe maicrowave system is about 1,000 km long with a capacity of
960 chalnels working on duplicated radio link and equipment (1+1).  It
passes by 12 through-repeaters, and 14 terminal stations and drop repeaters.
Long distance service has been designed to operate basically on
STD wo.k1ing and multimetering system of call charging.  However, appropri-
ate pro-isions would allow operator-to-subscriber dialing (OTD) whenever
reql:Li-ed, and full manual operations to areas with manual local exchanges.
To provide this service, the project includes the installation of 14
long distance switching exchanges, with a total of 5,000 lines capacity
and associated equipment in the local exchanges.
Multiplexing and channel requirements for this period will be
procured to cover the following purposes:
Equivalent Number of

Page 3 of 5 pages
Television Transmission
Implementation of the microwave system permits the use of its
basic installations to convey television programs between 6 TV stations
in Baghdad, Samawa, Basrah, Amara, Kirkuk and Mosul. This system will
utilize two additional bearers (1+1) on the existing system for TV.
C.   Telegraph and Telex Services
Modernization and development of the telegraph service and the
introduction of telex service under the project will require the use of
about 100 telephone channels of the microwave system for the provision
of about 600 voice-frequency telegraph channels (VFT) at the initial stage.
They will be used for telex, Gentex and future data transmission, for
which reason the VFT channels would be suitable for 50 and 100 bauds
speed -- i.e., 12 channels per system. The development of telex service
will be based initially on three telex exchanges: one in Baghdad of 500
lines capacity, one in Mosul of 100 lines and one in Basrah of 100 lines.
Telex subscribers are estimated to be 50 in 1971 and 1972, 40CI in 1973,
500 in 1974, and 600 in 1975.
D.   International Service
PT&T intends to bring about basic improvements in the interna-
tional telegraph and telephone services by installing a satellite ground
station in Iraq.  The site for the station is likely to be near Baghdad
and the station will be a standard INTELSAT-type of ground station with
a steerable 80-100 feet antenna and will be working with the Indian Ocean
satellite.  It is expected that to start with telephone and telegraph
circuits will be provided via the satellite to Bahrain, Lebanon, Pakistan,
India, France and United Kingdom and at a later date to Japan and Germany.
A microwave system will be installed to link Basrah with Kuwait. PT&T
is also considering feasibility studies for connection to neighbouring
countries viz Turkey, Jordan and Syria at the present time.
E.   Engineering Consultants Service
Microwave Services International (MSI) of New Jersey/USA as
consultants had carried out for the PT&T the detailed engineering of
the long distance facilities including microwave, multiplex and long
distance switching equipment. PT&T is retaining MSI for the supervision
of the construction as well.  PT&T is also discussing with COMSAT (Communi-
cations Satellite Corporation) to engage them for engineering and super-
vision of the ground satellite station. These services yet to be performed
by MSI and the full scope of services for the ground station are included in
the project.
F.   Costs
Details of costs of the program and project are given in the

Justification
A.   Internal Financial Rate of Return
of the Telecommunications Program
The internal financial rate of return of 14.0% determined on
page 2 of this Annex, is the discount rate which equalizes the present
values of the incremental cash flows attributable to the program and the
expenditures, both at 1972 price levels, and taking into cons:ideration
the increased revenue resulting from the increased traffic reflected in
Annex 5. The incremental cash flows were arrived at by difference from
the two streams of cash flows (net operating income before depreciation)
with and without project execution considered for the average lifetime
of the equipment to be provided by the project. The figures "'with project
execution" are those shown on the forecast statements of profit and loss
for 1972-1978 and for the subsequent three years assume a 10%, 5* and 5*
growth of revenues. Conversely, the figures "without project execution"
are the 1971 cash flow deficit since no revenue increases are assumed
to be possible from the facilities installed by March 31, 1971.
B.   Internal Financial Rate of Return of only the
Long Distance Facilities of the Project
The calculation on page 3 of this Annex equalizes the stream
of capital expenditures, together with the operating cash outlays
attributable to the long distance facilities provided by the telecom-
munications program (microwave network and spur connections), with that
of the attributable revenues, both at the 1972 price levels. The analysis
assumes an average useful lifetime of the facilities of 20 years beyond
the construction period. As indicated on page 3 of this annex, the rates
of return were calculated for three alternative assumptions f'or the long
distance telephone traffic, by upwards and downwards variation of the
projected number of telephone calls per circuit in the busy hour by 20%
from the most likely traffic assumption.
