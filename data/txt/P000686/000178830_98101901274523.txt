ETHIOPIA
BOARD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF ETHIOPIA
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Ethiopia requested IDA assistance in 1972 for the
financing of the Fifth Telecommunications Development Program (1974-1978), to
be undertaken by the Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (BTE). The pro-
ject proposed for IDA financing is the whole of this program, of which a part
is already financed under Credit 453-ET approved in November 1973.
ii.       This would be the sixth Bank Group lending for telecommunications
development in Ethiopia. The fourth project, financed under Loan 605-ET
initiated in 1969, is proceeding satisfactorily though a few items earlier
planned for completion in 1973 are now expected to be completed by mid 1975.
The start of the implementation of the Fifth project, which is the part of the
Fifth Telecommunications Development Program financed under Credit 453-ET, was
delayed due to labour disturbances in Ethiopia, but progress is now satisfactory.
iii.      The Fifth Development Program (1974-78) of BTE which is the proposed
project, aims to extend and improve service to meet anticipated demand in the
areas now being served and to extend service to some of the areas of the in-
terior of the country where telecommunications services are sparse or non-
existent. The project includes the addition of 40,000 automatic and 4,500
manual exchange lines; four new microwave systems extending good quality com-
munications to new areas of the country; and an earth satellite station which
will greatly improve international communications.
iv.       The estimated cost of the project is US$60.6 million equivalent in-
cluding a foreign exchange cost of US$38.8 million equivalent. The proposed
IDA credit of US$16 million together with Credit 453-ET for US$21.4 million
would finance the foreign exchange cost of the project except for some items
costing US$1.4 million, which BTE is financing from its own resources.
v.        The borrower would be the Government of Ethiopia, which would
relend the funds to the beneficiary, BTE, which would be responsible for
execution of the project.
vi.       All procurement under the credit would he through international
competitive bidding with the exception of the provision of extension equip-
ment for existing telephone exchanges and transmission systems. This equip-
ment, estimated at US$0.5 million (3% of the proposed credit), would be
procured from the original suppliers for reasons of compatibility and economy.



- ii -
vii.      As part of the international competitive bidding for Credit 453-ET,
options are being obtained for the purchase of equipment to be financed by the
proposed Credit, thereby permitting additions of the same types of equipment
throughout the project period and eliminating the need for a second round of
competitive bidding.
viii.     The forecasts indicate that tariff revision will be required during
the later half of the project period in order to ensure the continued satis-
factory mobilization of resources for future expansion needs. The project is
technically and financiallysound. The minimum estimate of economic return is
at least 13.5% using shadow prices reflecting a 33% premium on the foreign
exchange component.
ix.       The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$16.0 million to be
re-lent to BTE for a term of 20 years including five years grace at an interest
rate of 7-1/4%.

BOARD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF ETHIOPIA
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ethiopia requested IDA assistance in 1972 for
the financing of the Fifth Telecommunications Development Program (1974-1978),
to be undertaken by the Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (BIE). This
program was appraised in January 1973 following which Credit 453-ET covering
a first part of the program, was approved in November 1973 for an amount of
US$21.4 million. A second Credit, for USS16 million, is now proposed to cover
the balance of the foreign exchange component of the program.
1.02      Since this program of expansion was appraised in 1973 in connection
with Credit 453-ET, this report is largely an updating of the information
contained in the appraisal report for that credit (No. 163-ET, dated October
5, 1973).
1.03      Prior to Credit 453-ET (para. 1.01), the Bank Group had made four
loans for telecommunications development in Ethiopia.  The first loan, for
US$1.5 million, was made in 1951 to the Empire of Ethiopia to help finance
a project which was completed in 1956. The next three loans were made directly
to BTE. The second loan, 314-ET for US$2.9 million, was made in 1962 and
was related to a project which was completed in 1965. The third loan, 441-ET
for US$4.8 million, was made in 1965 and was related to a project completed
in 1969. The fourth loan, 605-ET for US$4.5 million with participation from
the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) who provided an equal
amount, was made in 1969 to cover part of the foreign cost of the 1968-73
expansion program. Progress oni this program has been satisfactory; however,
certain items originally scheduled for completion in 1973 have been delayed
by about one year and are now expected to be completed by mid 1975.
1.04      The Fifth Development Program (1974-78) will extend and improve
service to meet demand in areas now being served and extend services to some
areas in the interior of the country wiere telecommunications services are
sparse or nonexistent. It will also provide high quality telecommunications
to other countries through use of an earth satellite station.
1.05      Thie estimated cost of the program (which is the project) is
Eth$125.5 (US$60.6) million with a foreign exchange component of Eth$80.4
(US$38.8) million. Credit 453-ET, for an amount of US$21.4 million, finances
the foreign exchange component of a first part of the program, except for
certain facilities costing about US$1.4 million which are financed by BTE,
from its own funds. The proposed Credit, for an amount of US$16 million,
would finance the remainder of the foreign exchange component of the program.

1.06      BTE was established in 1952 in connection with the first 'ank lending
operation for telecommunication in Ethiopia. It is responsible for all public
telecommunication services in Ethiopia and would be the beneficiary of the
proposed credit. The borrower would be the Government of Ethiopia.
1.07      This report is based on information obtained from BTE and on the
findings of a mission composed of Messrs. A. Grisez and B. liolmgren who visit-
ed Ethiopia in September 1974.
2. THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
The Economy
2.01      Ethiopia, situated in the northeastern part of Africa south of tshe
Red Sea, covers an area of about 1.22 million km2, consisting of highlands
and plateau except in the easternmost part and along the Red Sea, where the
topography changes into lowlands. The two most important cities and indus-
trial centers are Addis Ababa, the capital, and Asmara, in the province of
Eritrea. The country's most important ports are Massawa and Assab, both on
the Red Sea. Agriculture is spread throughout the country except for the
less-fertile southeastern region.
2,02      Ethiopia's population is estimated at 26 million, growing at an
annual rate of 2.5%. More than 90% of this population lives in rural areas,
mainly at subsistence levels, though emigration to the cities is increasing;
the largest urban concentrations occur in Addis Ababa, the capital (about one
million inhabitants), and in Asmara (about 230,000 persons).
2.03      The Gross National Product (GNP) is approximately US$2.1 billion
(1973) with a 4% annual growth rate (1967-1973). The income per capita,
US$80, is among the lowest in the world and is increasing annually at a rate
of only about 1.5%. Agricultural production accounts for ahout 50% of the
GNP and for over 90% of export earnings.
2.04      An adequate telecommunication network is required to support the
economic development of the country. The difficult topography, the wide area
over which agriculture is distributed and the scarcitv of good all weather
roads makes telecommunications particularly important for coordinating the
movement, distribution and marketing of agricultural and other products.
Also, industry, commerce and the young tourism industry need adequate national
and international facilities.
The Telecommunication Sector
2.05      BTE is solely responsible for all public telecommunicatioas services
in Lthiopia and between Ethiopia and other countries. BTE is organized as a
Government owned commercial corporation under overall direction of the 'linistry



- 3 -
of Communications and has considerable autonomy to administer its day-to-day
operations. Details of the organization and management of BTE are set out in
paragraph 5.01.
Existing Telecommunication Facilities 1/
2.06      As of June 30, 1974, Ethiopia had about 63,700 telephone stations,
giving a telephone density of 0.25 per 100 population. Only five of the other
African countries for which statistics are available have lower telephone
densities. Comparative figures for other developing countries are given in
Annex 1.
2.07      About 40,000 Direct Exchange Lines (DEL's), or 86% of the total
number of DEL's in Ethiopia were connected to 17 automatic exchanges while
the remainder, i.e. about 6,300 DEL's or 14% of the total number of DEL's,
were connected to 285 small manual exchanges spread over the whole country
(June 1974). Basic data on BTE and information on the existing facilities
are set out in Annexes 2 and 3. The main routes of the long distance network
are shown on Map IBRD 11315.
Local Telephone Service
2.08      As of June 30, 1974, Ethiopia had 17 automatic telephone exchanges,
two of which were in Addis Ababa. Their installed capacity was 55,300 lines,
35,500 of them in Addis Ababa. Most of the equipment is of the modern cross-
bar type; it is well maintained and should provide good service for many
years.
2.09      There were, at the same date, 285 manual exchanges, with an installed
capacity of 12,515 lines, serving the small towns and rural areas. Service
is usually provided only in the daytime.
2.10      The outside plant is in reasonably good condition, particularly in
the main cities where underground pressurized cables are used. The cable
fill is high, in some areas reaching 100% and therefore needing relief.
Long Distance Service
2.11      The long distance network consists of a 960-channel microwave system
linking Addis Ababa and Asmara, a number of VHF systems and openwire lines,
which are supplemented by carrier systems on main routes. The network com-
prises 260,000 trunk-circuit kilometers (June 1974).
1/   Statistical data given in the following paragraphs relate to June 1974;
they were the most recent data available at the time of the appraisal
mission. Similar data for the beginning of the vth Development Program
(December 31, 1973) can be found in Annex 2.



- 4 -
2.12      Automatic trunk exchanges in Addis Ababa, Asmara and Dessie were
put in service in May 1973 and provide subscriber trunk dialing service (STD)
between these three cities, Massawa and Debre Zeit. Manual switchboard
positions released after the introduction of STD service between these cities
have been reassigned to other routes, thus improving significantly the quality
of service on these routes and allowing their traffic to increase substan-
tially.
Telegraph and Telex Service
2.13      Telegraph service is provided over the telephone network and HF
radio.
2.14      Telex service is provided through a 400-line automatic exchange in
Addis Ababa and from manual exchanges in Asmara, Assab and Dire Dawa. The
number of telex subscribers as of June 1974 was 271. The service offered
to the subscribers connected to the manual exchanges is poor, partly due to
congestion in the long distance telex network.
International Services
2.15      International telephone, telegraph and telex service is offered
via HF radio to 19 destinations abroad and via an open-wire line equipped
with a carrier system to Djibouti.
Ongoing Works (IVth Development Program)
2.16      Execution of BTE's Fourth Development Program (1968-73), financed
by Loan 605-ET, is completed, except for (i) three microwave systems linking
Addis Ababa with Dire Dawa/Harrar, Jimma, and Shashamane, which are expected
to be put in service by mid-1975, and (ii) a GENTEX network with terminals in
14 cities, whose commissioning is awaiting the commissioning of the above
microwave systems.
3. THE PROJECT
The Project
3.01      The project is the whole of BTE's Fifth Development Program for the
five-year period 1974-78, of which a part is already financed under Credit
453-ET. It aims essentially at (i) meeting the anticipated growth of demand
for telephone connections in areas already served, (ii) extending the tele-
phone service to about 100 localities which do not have at present any tele-
communications facilities, (iii) expanding and modernizing the long distance
network in order to meet the demand for long distance traffic, (iv) expanding
suitably the telegraph and telex networks, and (v) improving the international
services, which are at present severely congested. The project has been



-5-
largely drawn up by BTE: foreign experts have assisted in the survey of micro-
wave systems and an earth satellite station.
3.02      The project comprises the following main items:
(i)  installation of about 40,000 lines of automatic exchange
equipment, and about 4,500 lines of manual exchange equipment;
(ii)  installation of cable distribution networks and subscribers'
plant to provide about 45,000 telephone connections;
(iii) provision of four microwave links (Dessie-Assab; Asmara-
Tessenei, Shashamane-Moyale, and Addis Ababa-Ghimbi) with
a total route length of 1,500 km and various medium capacity
VHF/UHF radio links (24-120 channels) or coaxial cables with
a route length totaling 200 km; construction of 3,000 km of
small capacity VHF radio links (less than 24 channels) and
rehabilitation of 2,100 km of open-wire lines; and provision
of multiplex and carrier equipment for the above facilities
as well as for expanding the capacity of the existing ones;
(iv)  installation of 48 manual switchboard positions and
provision of about 660 lines of long distance automatic
switching equipment;
(v)  installation of an earth satellite station, with a SPADE
terminal, 1/ for international services and of an associated
international telephone transit center which will allow
semi-automatic telephone operation with most foreign
countries; and
(vi)  various extensions of the telex and telegraph networks,
including an extension of the capacity of the telex
switching equipment in Addis Ababa from 400 lines to about
700 lines. Details of the project are given in Annex 4
and in the map.
Cost of the Project
3.03      The estimated cost of the project is Eth$125.5 (US$60.6) million
equivalent. Details are given below and in the table of Annex 4:
1/   SPADE is a system of time sharing on a demand assignment basis a group
of satellite circuits between several low traffic routes. With this
system a circuit is established between two earth stations only for the
duration of the calls routed through these stations.

3.04      The cost estimates are based:
(a)  for imported equipment and associated services, on (i) prices
obtained by BTE for similar equipment (microwave links, new local
telephone exchanges etc.) during the Fourth Development Program
(1968-1973), (ii) recent firm price quotations under Credit
453-ET for several items, e.g. international telephone exchange,
extension of existing local exchanges, cables, carrier equipment
etc., and (iii) budgetary price quotations from suppliers for
new types of equipment (earth satellite station, telex switching
equipment etc.). To reflect the situation at mid-1974, these
prices have been updated by using the recent price trend
for the various types of equipment included in the project.
(b) for civil works and installation, on BTE's recent experience of
local expenditure for civil works, buildings and installation.
These cost estimates are realistic. The estimates for local costs include
custom duties on imported equipment, amounting to about Eth$12.8 million or
16% of the CIF cost of the equipment.
3.05      BET's development program will comprise installations at a great
number of locations every year. The quantity of equipment actually installed
in each specific location may deviate from present proposals since it will be
adjusted at the time of installation to take into account recent development
of demand. But, on average increases which will be needed in some locations
are likely to be compensated by reductions elsewhere. A physical contingency,
US$1.5 million, has, however, been included to cover costs of meeting higher
than anticipated traffic on the long distance service, where the forecast of
demand has been conservative, and for a change in pattern of traffic in the
Addis Ababa network which might necessitate engineering changes.



-7-
3.06      Due to the present uncertain price level of telecommunications
materials, a price contingency of about 15% has been included in the foreign
costs. The price contingency for local costs, about 17%, will cover the
likely price increases, over the project period, for civil works, buildings
and installation (including transport). The above provisions appear adequate
since most contracts for imported equipment should be awarded by the end of
1975, i.e. 1-1/2 years after the date considered for the base estimate of the
project cost, and construction of the bulk of civil works and buildings should
take place during the first half of the project period.
Items for IDA Financing
3.07      The proposed Credit for US$16 million, together with US$21.4 million
provided under Credit 453-ET (see para. 1.01), would finance the foreign ex-
change cost of the project (US$38.8 million) except for the following items
costing US$1.4 million, which BTE is financing from its own resources:
(a)  5,300 lines of local automatic exchange equipment;
(b)  about 600 lines of local manual exchange equipment
(demand for 1974); and
(c)  local network and subscribers' plant (part of demand
for 1974).
Contracts for these items have already been awarded.
Procurement
3.08      All goods financed by the proposed Credit would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's guide-
lines for procurement with the exception of some extension equipment for
existing facilities. This equipment which is estimated to cost US$0.5 million
or about 3% of the IDA Credit, will be procured through negotiation from the
original suppliers subject to reasonable prices. Negotiated procurement is
justified by the fact that the initial installations, while designed to meet
ultimate capacity requirements, provided only for initial needs and economies
will therefore result from the use of existing common equipment, power sup-
plies, rack space and other plant items. In order to achieve these economies,
it is essential that such additions be of the same type for reasons of com-
patibility.
3.09      In order to expedite the procurement process for equipment financed
by the proposed Credit and to allow BTE to standardize equipment, it was agreed
between IDA and BTE during negotiations of Credit 453-ET that bidding docu-
ments for procurement of equipment through international competitive bidding
under Credit 453-ET may cover the requirements of the whole program; BTE
would thus obtain from suppliers firm proposals for equipment financed by
Credit 453-ET and options for purchase of equipment to be financed by the
proposed Credit. 1/ This procedure, that BTE is following, eliminates the
1/   See appraisal report for Credit 453-ET, paragraph 3.13.



-8-
need for a second round of international competitive bidding for the part of
the project to be financed by the proposed credit.
3.10      In accordance with the above, BTE has proceeded with procurement for
items in Credit 453-ET providing for options for the balance of the 1974-78
program. Procurement has reached an advanced stage for a few items, e.g.
carrier equipment for open-wire lines, already ordered, and local switching
equipment, for which bids are under evaluation. Specifications for other
items included in the project have been prepared (international telephone
exchange, for which bids are being recalled, cables, microwave links) or are
under preparation (earth satellite station, UHF/VHF radio links).
3.11      Although at present there is no local production of telecommunica-
tions equipment, there is a local manufacture of electrical cables which
could be extended to telephone installation cables and drop wire. To
encourage local manufacture, a domestic preference of 15% or the custom duties,
whichever is lower, should be granted for such items, the estimated cost of
which would be less than US$200,000. This preferential treatment would be
made applicable for both Credit 453-ET and the proposed Credit in order to
maintain consistent awarding procedures for the program.
Disbursements
3.12      The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against the CIF cost
of imported equipment and the foreign cost of imported services and the ex-
factory cost of any locally awarded contract for installation cables and drop
wire (see para. 3.10). The estimated schedule of disbursement for the pro-
posed Credit is shown in Annex 5, and assumes that disbursements from this
Credit would be made only after Credit 453-ET, which is for financing a first
phase of the program, have been exhausted. BTE would be authorized after
consultation with IDA to use any balance of the proposed Credit for the pur-
chase of additional goods and services similar to those already procured
under the Credit.
Execution of the Project
3.13      Competent staff is available within BTE for the preparation of
bidding documents, bid evaluation and detailed engineering of the project
with the exception of (i) the microwave links, which have already been
surveyed by ITU and a Japanese conxulting team sponsored by the Government
of Japan, and (ii) the earth satellite station, which is being surveyed by
"Communications Satellite Corporation" (COMSAT) under a contract for consult-
ing services awarded early in 1974.
3.14      Except for the earth satellite station, which will be installed by
the selected supplier, all other equipment will be installed by BTE's own
staff under the supervision of the suppliers.
3.15      On average, procurement and, more generally, project implementation
are about six months behind the schedule which was established at the time
of the appraisal mission for Credit 453-ET (January 1973).  Completion of



-9-
the project is therefore expected to take place in mid-1979 instead of tLle
end of 1978 as initially scheduled.
4. JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The basic justification for the project is to support Ethiopia's
development objectives by providing an essential service for administration,
trade, industry and agriculture. Particularly, efficient organization of
the production, transportation, distribution and marketing of agriculture
goods, Ethiopia's main output and export, depends on the existence of a
reliable and adequately dimensioned telecommunication network. The project
is an important step toward the setting up of such a network; it will develop
the primary long distance network to meet traffic requirements between the
main economic centers and, while improving the secondary long distance net--
work serving rural areas, it will also extend it to about 100 small localities
which at present do not have access to telecommunications services.
4.02      Through the installation of an earth satellite station, the project
will improve significantly the quality of international telecommunications
services; at present, quality of these services is particularly poor and
hampers the growth of a traffic which is needed to support Ethiopia's exports.
4.03      In addition, the improvement and extension of the rural telecommuni-
cations network will provide basic infrastructure facilities which will help
agricultural and health extension services and will assist setting up of small
businesses and industries in rural areas.
Market Demand
(a) Local Telephone Service
4.04      BTE has carried out detailed studies of future demand for telephone
connections in each exchange area, using the trend method corrected, when
necessary, by appropriate judgement factors (for instance where past history
for telephone connections was not representative of demand due to inadequate
size and quality of existing facilities). In respect of the main Ethiopian
towns these results have been cross-checked through field surveys.
4.05      Using the above method, BTE has forecast a demand for telephone
connections (DEL's) of about 81,000 in 1978, i.e., a yearly increase of about
12% from 1971 the base year considered for the forecasts. The growth of
demand since 1971 to date conforms to that pattern.
4.06      Although the forecasting method used by BTE is generally valid when
applied over a period of time not exceeding 5 to 7 years, current economic
considerations suggest that in this specific case it is perhaps somewhat
optimistic. Consequently, during discussions between the appraisal mission
and BTE, it was agreed that a more conservative estimate of 76,000 DEL's
in 1978 (instead of 81,000) would be retained as the best estimate for demand.



- 10 -
lhe yearly growth rate corresponding to this revised forecast is about two
percentage points below BTE's forecast annual demand growth rate and the
expansion program will be in step with the revised forecasts. Annex 6 gives
the actual and estimated numbers of DEL's and the exchange capacity during
the period 1967-1980.  The fill of the exchanges at the end of the project
period (1978) averages about 75%, which is reasonable.
(b)  Long Distance Service
4.07      BTE's forecasts for long distance telephone traffic have been
based on the past trend corrected for the step increases likely to result from
the expected improvement in the quality of service. The rate of anticipated
growth of traffic varies widely on different links, ranging from a growth
of 5% to 25% per annum over the project period. These forecasts appear
reasonable; the step increases in traffic forecast for new STD routes are in
line with recent experience in Ethiopia following the introduction of STD
working. The planned extension of the capacity of the long distance networik
is consistent with traffic forecasts.
(c) Telegraph and Telex Service
4.08      The expansion of telegraph service is to provide access, often the
only one, to business users and for administrative and social services nurposes
in remote areas of the country.
4.09      The number of telex subscribers has increased by 14X annually during
the last five years. Since the backlog of demands has already been met,
BTE has now forecast a 12% annual growth for telex subscribers for the project
period based on demands and applications for this service, largely in Addis
Ababa. This is reasonable. Chart WB-9223 of Annex 7 gives the actual and
estimated number of telex lines during the period 1967-80.
(d) International Communications
4.10      Despite severe limitations in both the quality and the capacity
of HF radio facilities providing at present international services, the
international telephone traffic increased 24% and the telex traffic 27,
annually during 1968-1973. The commissioning of the earth satellite station
and associated switching facilities (mid-1977) will remove present congestion
on international routes, provide high quality service to most countries, and
allow the international traffic to develop freelv. Based on experience in
other countries following such improvements and on expert advice from consult-
ants, BTE hias forecast for the international telephone service a 100% traffic
increase in the first year of operation of the new facilities, 50%O in the
second year, 30% in the third year and 20% yearly thereafter.  For international
telex and telegraph traffics, which will he less sensitive to improvement of
related facilities, BTE has forecast a yearly growth rate of about 18% and
4/' respectively up to 1980. These forecasts are reasonable.



- 11 -
(e)  Least Cost Solution
4.11      The basic structure of Ethiopia's telecommunications network has
been drawn up some years ago and provides for meeting long-term forecast
demand in the most economical way. Numbering, transmission and routing plans
have been carefully considered and are appropriate for the country. The
choice of common control switching systems, made prior to 1953, is sound
when viewed against the specific configuration of the Ethiopian telephone
network, and the principal long distance routes are being established to
provide for easy and economic extension.
4.12      The physical size of the project is based on forecasts of demand for
new connections and for anticipated traffic, and is adequate; provisioning
periods for each category of facilities included in the project follow accep-
ted practices designed to minimize the present value of all costs.
4.13      The planning of the local network and location of exchanges in
Addis Ababa city area has been based on a study of demands for telephones
made block by block. The results from this study have been computed to give
the least combined cost for local network and switching equipment. In other
parts of the country additions to existing exchanges and opening of new ones
have been designed in accordance with standard plant practices to provide
for least cost.
4.14      Microwave equipment has been provided on the main routes.  Since
few roads exist and the area is generally mountainous, the use of cable
routes would be expensive and less reliable. The choice of microwaves for
these routes represents the least cost alternative.
4.15      The earth satellite station represents the best solution for provid-
ing international telephone, telegraph and telex connections to distant
destinations. Further, the installation of a SPADE terminal makes possible
at a small marginal cost direct international communications to a great number
of destinations with occasional traffic, without expensive transits via other
countries.
(f) Return on Investment
4.16      The internal rate of return on the project, defined as the discount
rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the pro-
ject with the capital and operating costs excluding taxes, is 17.4%, when
additional revenues to be raised through tariff increases (see para. 6.15)
are included in the revenue stream. With a foreign exchange component
shadow priced at a value 33% above the estimated cost, the rate of return
would be 13.5%. Sensitivity analysis reflecting a 10% increase in operat-
ing cost and a 10% decrease in revenues was made which produced a rate of
return of 14.7% (Annex 8).
4.17      Even on the basis of current tariffs, the internal rate of return
is estimated at 14.9% which, since this is higher than the present estimated
opportunity cost of capital in Ethiopia, indicates that the prices currently
paid by subscribers are, on average, greater than the long term marginal costs



- 12 -
of supply.  The proposed tariff increase therefore represents a pricin2 stra-
tegy which is aimed at recovering considerably more than long term marginal
costs from users of the telecommunications system in Ethiopia.
4.18      The foregoing rate of return estimates tend to be conservative in-
dicators of the economic merits of the project since (a) the prices charged
are a minimum measure of economic benefits to subscribers, and (b) the pro-
ject cost estimate includes the full cost of works, such as the earth satelli.e
station and the radio relay systems, which will be expanded steadily at small
marginal costs after the completion of the project to meet traffic require-
ments as they develop (while, in the calculation of the rate of return, re-
venues attributed to these works have been restricted to incremental traffic
allowed bv their initial equipment capacity).
5. THE BENEFICIARY
Grganization and Management
5.01      BTE's responsibilities and its relationship with the Government are
sec out in paragraph 2.05. The organization of BTE is shown in Annex 9. Tne
governing body is the Board of Directors, composed of five to seven members
appointed by Government. The Chairman of the Board is the Minister of Com-
-munications.  The General Manager, appointed by the Board, is responsible for
3TE's management and operations. He has the broad authority necessary to
effectively carry out his responsibilities.
O,02      BTE's organization :Ls generally satisfactory and effective.  The
responsibilities and duties of each of the three Departments - viz. Engineering,
Operations, and Finance and Supply - and, at the level below, of the various
Divisions, are adequately defined. The regional organization is also adequate;
it is based on seven regional offices, suitably located, which are responsible,
under the authority of the Operations Department, for the maintenance and
operation of the network.
5.03      At present tiie planning function is mostly handled by the EngineerinA
Department since the Planning and Programming Division, set-up for this purpose
in 1972 and directly responsible to the General Manager, has not yet been
provided with enough competent staff to carry out this function.  The current
arrangement works well and is acce-<-ible considering the present size of the
networlc and the relative scarcity of competent senior staff.
Staff and Trainip_
5.04      The management and technical staff of BTE are generally well quali-
fied anid competent. Many of them have been abroad for training and are
effective in their specialities.  BTE's staff nas for some years been composel
almost entirely of Ethiopians.
3.05      The training school, started in 1953 with the assistance of iTU,
effectivelv provides instruction for about 300 students and has a teaching.



- 13 -
staff of 14. These training arrangements are adequate. 'T'hie capacity of tne
school is being further increased to provide for future needs.
Accounting
5.06       BTE has established the position of Finance Manager reporting
directly to the General lanager in accordance with the Bank's recommendations,
and have placed the Supply Division as well as the Finance and Data Processing
Division under his direction.  A collection group has been established which
effectively administers the collection of conmmercial accounts. The internal
audit group has matured and is adequately performing its function. The
accounting staff is qualified and well trained and is performing reasonably
well.
5.07      The accounting practices are reasonably effective.  However, due
to unsatisfactory internal procedures, financial reports are issued several
months after the close of the accounting periods which limits their value to
management. The Finance Manager is aware of this situation and is reviewing
all accounting routines with a view to the gradual revision of those which
are cumbersome. Plans are also being formulated for extending the use of
the computer into other areas such as inventory control and accounts receiv-
able control.
Audit
5.08      An annual independent audit of BTE's accounts is performed by
Getachew Kassage Co., a firm of certified accountants. This arrangement is
satisfactory. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the
accounts will continue to be audited by an independent firm of auditors
acceptable to IDA, and that certified financial statements (including the
auditor's opinion) will be submitted to IDA within six months after the
close of each fiscal year.
Tariffs
5.09       BTE's tariffs have been unchanged over the last 20 years apart from
an increase of the local call charge from Eth$ 0.06 to Eth$ 0.08 in 1971.
Their level has been, on aaverage, sufficient to allow BTE to earn a satis-
factory rate of return (e.g. 11.7% in 1973). Financial projections indicate
nevertheless that tariffs will have to be increased from 1977 (paragraph
6.15). BTE has the authority to raise tariffs.
5.10      The tariff structure follows the general pattern followed of most
administrations; for telephone services it comprises an installation fee of
Eth$ 115 (US$56), paid by the subscriber prior to getting a telephone connec-
tion, a monthly rental of Eth$ 5 (US$2.4), a charge of Eth$ 0.08 (US$0.04)
for each local call in automatic networks, and varying charges for trunk and
international calls. When compared with other countries, the installation
fee is on the high side, the monthly rental is on the low side and call charges
which provide a large part of total revenues are about average. BTE's present



- 14 -
tariffs are described in Annex 10. Meanwhile, with the assistance of the
Bank Group, BTE will begin a study of the economic costs and benefits of
telecommunications services which will help the Government and BTE in mak-
ing price and investment decisions; it is envisaged that this study would
serve as a useful example to other developing countries faced with similar
decisions.
Insurance
5.11      BTE carries commercial insurance to cover property damage and
employee group insurance. The property damage insurance provides full coverage
for all risks.
6. FINANCES
6.01      BTE earned a satisfactory annual rate of return varying from 10.7%
to 12.3% during 1968-1973 and internally generated funds during this period
were sufficient after servicing all debt to provide 60% of capital invest-
ments. However, as a result of a change in BTE's tax status as of July 1973,
BTE now has to pay duties and taxes on imported equipment, as well as income
taxes. The current level of tariffs, according to the projections, will
neither provide an adequate rate of return on net plant in service through
the last half of the program period nor provide enough funds for the invest-
ment program and as a consequence, additional revenues will have to be raised.
Past Earnings
6.02       In the Joint Financing Agreement for the fourth project, BTE agreed
to earn a rate of return of not less than 9% on net fixed assets. BTE ex-
ceeded this requirement in all years.
Year            1968    1969    1970    1971    1972    1973
Rate of Return 11.0%   10.71%  11.1%   12.4%   12.3%   11.7,%
In order to take into account the 1973 change in BTE's tax status, under the
agreement for Credit 453-ET, the rate of return required was lowered to 8,
except for the construction period for which it would be 7% (this corresponds
to a pretax return of about 10 and 8.5% respectively).  This provision in the
Credit agreement 453-ET would be continued. Detailed income statements for
the years 1970-73 are included in Annex 11.
Collection Performance
6.03      There has been substantial improvement in BTE's collection practices
since the fourth project. The aged accounts receivable do not completely
reflect this improvement since they contain old weakly documented accounts
which have doubtful value. BTE is reviewing these accounts and those which



- 15 -
cannot be properly supported are written off; as a result the amounts out-
standing over 120 days decreased in 1973 from 30% to 21%. Current billings
are being collected on a timely basis or the service of the delinquent sub-
scriber is being terminated. Collection of Government accounts is now satis-
factory.
Financial Position
6.04      The financial position of BTE at December 31, 1973, is summarized
below.  A detailed statement is shown in Annex 12.

6.05      Plant additions prior to December 31, 1967 are valued at the
appraisal value at that date and all subsequent additions are valued at cost.
Accumulated depreciation is 40% of gross value. Both of these valuations
appear reasonable.
6.06      Before December 31, 1967, BTE's share capital was Eth$7.7 million.
The corporate charter restricts the aaiount of indebtedness to not more than
three times the amount of authorized and subscribed share capital. In order
to enable BTE to incur additional debt, its share capital was increased at
December 31, 1967, to Eth$20 million, by capitalizing part of the Renewals
and Expansion Reserve accumulated from retained earnings. The share capital
was similarly increased to Eth$40 million in 1974 to allow for the lending
proposed for the Fifth Development Program by capitalizing part of the Re-
newals and Expansion Reserve.

6.08      The above financing plan estimates that 40% of the requirements
will be provided from internally generated funds including a small reduction
in working capital, principally a reduction in present high cash balances.
The remaining 60% of the requirements will be provided by external finan-
cing - 6% from IBRD/SIDA Loan 605-ET, 27% from Credit 453-ET, 20% from the
proposed IDA credit, and 6% from an assumed future loan for the VIth Develop-
ment Program. A small amount (one percent of requirements) will be pro-
vided through the financing of some interest during construction under the
subsidiary loan agreement with Government, under which the proceeds of the
proposed credit will be re-lent to BTE.



- 17 -
6.09      The debt/equity ratio during the program period will increase from
29/71 at December 31, 1973, to 54/46 at December 31, 1979 as BTE has to relv
more on borrowings to finance construction with the change in its fiscal
status. This is satisfactory. Internal cash generation will cover annual
debt service at least 2.2 times during each year of the period. The debt
service covenant of Credit 453-ET requires BTE to obtain the Bank's agreement
before contracting new debt unless the debt service coverage as usually de-
fined exceeds 1.5. The new credit agreement continues this covenant.
6.10      The relending agreement for the proceeds of the proposed Credit
will be on same terms as for the relending of the proceeds under Credit 453-
ET, i.e., 7-1/4% interest, 3/4% commitment charge and 20 years repayment in-
cluding five years of grace. It will also provide for the financing of in-
terest during construction of up to Eth$1.5 million (para. 6.08). BTE
will bear the exchange rate.
6.11      The financing plan does not provide for any dividends to be paid
during the construction period. During negotiation, agreement was reached
that no dividends would be paid unless a revised financing plan indicates
that dividend payments are feasible. Furthermore, the financing plan shows
a need for temporary finance of up to Eth#5 million in the intermediate
years of the construction program. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that arrangements which would allow BTE to contract short-term
finance would be made.
Future Operating Results
6.12      Forecast Income Statements are given in Annex 11.  A summary of
the results are as follows:
1974    1975    1976    1977    1978    1979

6.13      Operating revenues during the program period are estimated to increase
at an average annual rate of 13% as a result of the expanded network, improved
long distance facilities and the provision of good communications with other
countries. At the same time operating expenses exclusive of depreciation are
projected to increase at an average rate of 13% annually.  Depreciation has
been estimated to increase to Eth$ 11.5 million in 1979 from Eth$ 4.9 million
in 1973 due to the increased value of the plant in service.
6.14      The construction program during 1974-79 will result in more than
doubling "he value of gross plant in service from Eth$ 116 million to Eth$ 262
million. The net value of plant in service (after deducting accumulated
depreciation) will increase to Eth$ 166 million from EthS 70 million. As a
result of these factors, particularly the increase in the level of expenses



- 18 -
resulting from the removal of BTE's tax exemption, the rate of return would
decline from 12.3% in 1972 to less than 6, in 1979 if tariffs were to remaini
a. the existing levels. The projections (para. 6.12 and 6.13) assume tariff
increases from 1977 (see para. 6.15 below).
o.15      The plant placed in service in this program understandably will
not be completely utilized by the end of the program period (1979) therefore
significant revenue increases can be anticipated as a result of greater
utilization during the immediate subsequent period. However, it is not
anticipated that these increases will be sufficient to provide funds to
service BTE's increased debt and to provide the necessary contribution to
the forthcoming Telecommunication Development Program VI. As under the
agreement for Credit 453-ET, BTE has agreed to maintain revenues sufficient
to produce an annual rate of return of 7% until the project is completed
at which time the requirement will be increased to 8% for that and all sub-
sequent periods. It is anticipated that this requirement will probably make
necessary a tariff increase of about 12% towards the end of the construction
period.
6.16      Performance indicators which can be used to measure future per-
f-rm,ance are shown in Annex 16.
Fi.,cal Impact
t,17      Until recently, BTE's only contribution to Government's revenues
was in the form of dividends, which over the 1968-1973 period totaled Eth$2.4
million. But at the same time, it has not required any Government funds for
its operatons or expansion programs. The forecast reflects the change in
the Government's tax policy making BTE subject to the same taxation as a
commercial operation. As a result of this change, BTE will pay over Eth$28
million to Government in the form of taxes and custom duties during the 1974-
1979 period. In addition, Government receipts will increase by an estimated
-.hS16 million derived from onlending of the IDA funds of Credit 453-ET and
the proposed IDA Credit at 7-1/4%.  As in the past, BTE will also contri-
bute funds from its operations to its investment program that during the
1974-l1?79 period is estimated to Eth$62 million.
7.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      The following- agreemernts were obtained during negotiations:
(a) BTE's accounts will continue to he audited by an independent
firm of auditors acceptable to IDA and certified financial
statements will be submitted to IDA within six months after
the close of each fiscal year (para. 5.08);
(b) BTE will obtain IDA agreement before new debt is contracted
unless the debt service coverage exceeds 1.5 (paragraph
6.09);



- 19 -
(c)  the proceeds of the Credit will be relent to BTE on the same
terms as for Credit 453-ET, i.e., 7-1/4% interest, 3/4%
commitment charge and 20 years repayment including five years
of grace. Government will finance up to Eth$1.5 million of
interest during construction (para. 6.10);
(d)  no dividend payments will be made during the construction
period unless a revised financing plan indicates that dividend
payments are feasible (para. 6.11);
(e)  Arrangements would be made to allow BTE to contract short
term finance as and when needed (para. 6.11); and
(f)  a rate of return of 7% will be maintained until the completion
of the project at which time it will be increased to 8% (para.
6.15).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit
of US$16 million.

The average exchange fill, which is 72.3%, is reasonable. The automatic
exchange equipment is the modern crossbar type, with the exception of Harrar,
Himma and 9,500 lines in the Filwoha exchange where Ericsson's 500-point
selector system is used.
1.3       The manual exchanges are mostly of the magneto type.  Exchange
capacities vary from 5 to 600 lines. Service is usually provided only during
daytime, except in a few localities where it is available day and night.

Total            285         12,515           6,272             50.1
1.4       The subscribers' distribution networks are established according to
sound engineering principles. In the large cities they make extensive use of
cross-connection cabinets and concrete ducts that are manufactured by BTE's
workshops. The fill of the cables is generally rather high. In September
1974 it was in Addis Ababa about 76 percent for the primary network and up
to 100 percent in some areas for the secondary network.
1.5       All private installations in Ethiopia are owned, installed and
maintained by BTE. As of June 30, 1974, the numbers of PABX's and PMBX's
in the country were respectively 349 and 196.
2. LONG DISTANCE SERVICE
2.1       The primary long distance network is mainly based on a 960-channel
microwave link between Addis Ababa and Asmara, inaugurated in May 1973, and
on open wire lines using copper or copperweld wires and equipped with carrier
systems. Three other 960-channel microwave links to connect the cities of
Harrar, Jimma and Shashamane to Addis Ababa are at present under construction.
They are expected to be commissioned by January 1975. The secondary long
distance network is based on open wire lines, equipped with carrier systems
and on VHF radio systems with a capacity ranging from one to five telephone
channels.
2.2       At the end of 1973, the long distance network comprised about
250,000 trunk-circuit kilometers. Subscriber trunk dialling (STD) was possible



ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 5 pages
between Addis Ababa, Asmara, Debre Zeit, Dessie and Massawa. After completion
of the three microwave links mentioned in para. 2.1 it will be extended to
Dire Dawa, Harrar, Jimma, Nazareth and Shashamane. It will then be available
between 83 percent of the Ethiopian subscribers, against 76 percent at present.
An indirect consequence of the extension of the STD service to new routes
will be to remove largely the present congestion of trunk manual switchboards
and to improve consequently the quality of service on routes still operated
manually. Although it has improved after the introduction of the STD service
on the Addis Ababa - Dessie - Asmara route (mid-1973) for the reasons just
mentioned, this quality of service is still rather poor, subscribers often
having to wait one hour or more before a long distance call can be put through.
3. TELEGRAPH AND TELEX SERVICES
3.1       Telegraph service is generally provided using the long distance
telephone network and to remote places by use of HF radio in some cases.
3.2       Telex service is provided by an automatic 400-line crossbar exchange
in Addis Ababa and by manual exchanges in Asmara, Assab and Dire Dawa. By
mid-1974, the number of subscribers connected totaled 271, of which 186 were
in Addis Ababa.
3.3       A national GENTEX network is nearing completion and will connect
the following cities:
Addis Ababa               Nazareth
Asmara                    Shashamane
Massawa                   Jimma
Makale                    Nekempte
Dessie                    Bahar Dar
Assab                     Gondar
Dire Dawa                 Harrar
All GENTEX terminals will be equipped with both Latin and Amharic type of
teleprinters.
4. INTERNATIONAL SERVICES
BTE provides international telephone, telegraph and telex services
by HF radio to the following cities:

Some of the HF channels have been equipped with LINCOMPEX.  There is a landline
route with four telephone channels to Djibouti in the French Territory of
Afars and Issas.
The international routes are heavily overloaded and the telephone
service offered is very poor. Telegraph and telex services on these routes
are nevertheless reasonably good.

Economic Analysis of the Project
Benefit Period
1.        The following internal rate of return analysis is based on a project
lifetime of 25 years, commencing in 1974. All costs and revenues used for
the calculations are in constant mid-1974 prices.
Capital Expenditure
2.        Capital expenditures are the project costs net of taxes, custom
duties, price and physical contingency allowances (the latter being for
making possible an increase in the capacity of certain facilities if demand
is higher than expected).
3.        Some of the equipment will have a shorter lifetime than the benefit
period considered and will need to be replaced. On the other hand some equip-
ment will outlast the benefit period and have a residual value. Therefore,
replacement costs and residual values are included in the construction cost
stream, based on the following lifetimes:
Type of Equipment                          Lifetime (years)
Switching Equipment                             25
Cables                                          35
Telephone and Telex Apparatus                    7
Long Distance Transmission Equipment            15
Earth Station Equipment                         15
Vehicles                                         7
Buildings                                       50
Miscellaneous                                10 to 25
Operating Costs
4.        Operating costs attributable to the project are assessed:
(a)  for wages, on the basis of (i) the additional number of staff
needed for the maintenance and operation of the project works,
(ii) qualification of this staff, higher on average than
qualification of present staff, and (iii) corresponding salaries
and fringe benefits at mid-1974 prices;



ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 3 pages
(b)  for the operating expenses, on estimated expenses, net of taxes
and custom duties, for each category of expense such as spares,
energy, transportation, etc.
Operating Revenues
5.         Operating revenues attributable to the project are assessed on the
basis of BTE's incremental operating revenues from the date when present
network capacity is fully used to the date when additional capacity installed
under the project is completely used. These dates are respectively, on
average, mid-1976 (except for some works in Addis Ababa, which will be
commissioned early 1975) and the end of 1981. After 1981, operating revenues
stay at the level reached at the end of 1981.
Rate of Return
6.         Based on the above assumptions, the streams of costs and revenues
attributable to the project are as follows (in thousands of Eth$).

7.        The internal rate of return on the project, defined as the discount
rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the
project with the capital and operating costs, is 17.4%.
8.         If the foreign exchange component of capital expenditures is shadow

ANNEX 15

ETHIOPIA
BOARD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF ETHIOPIA (BTE)
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
Income Statements
1.        Telephone Rentals.  Based on the number of telephone subcribers
projected to grow at 10 percent p.a., and an annual average per subcriber
of Eth$ 105.
2.        Telephone Call Charges.  Based on the number of telephone subcribers,
an annual calling rate of 1,925 calls per subscriber which is projected to
decline by 2 percent p.a., and the present charge of Eth$ .08 per call.
3.        Telephone Trunk Charges.  Based on following assumption:  for the
new high quality-capacity links, initial increases of revenues of about 50%
due to improved quality and steady annual increases of 14% (four percentage
points above the increases in subscribers); and for the other routes annual
increases of 8% p.a.
4.        Telephone International.  Average annual growth rate for past five
years has been 28%. Projected to increase by 20% p.a. (which would slow down
to about 15% p.a. in 1982) and due to the improved quality and availability
of service of the earth station, an additional initial increase of 75% in
1977 when it is expected to be commissioned.
5.        Telephone Installations.  Projected on the basis of the number of
subscribers to be added in each year and the past average of Eth$ 270 per
added subscriber.
6.        Telephone Other.  Represents revenues from moves and changes of
telephone equipment.
7.        Telex.  BTE's revenue forecast assumed a growth rate of 9% in the
1974-1978 period. Growth in the past five years has been around 20% and the
number of telex subscribers have been projected to increase by 12%. There-
fore, the forecast has been revised upwards and a growth of overall telex
revenues of 15% have been assumed.
8.        Telegraph.  Domestic and international revenues are expected to
remain constant.
9.        Broadcasting.  Based on the new contract and anticipated growth
of operations.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
10.       Tariff increase is the additional revenue required to earn the
minimum rate of return.
11.       Salaries.  BTE's forecast includes the salary increases granted
early in 1974, an annual overall increase of 9.3% plus estimated additional
wage requirements related to the microwave and earth satellite installations
resulting in a compounded growth rate of about 11% p.a. during the construc-
tion period.  To provide for possible additional increases in the future,
a 12% compounded annual growth rate has been applied. The policy of the Board
is to limit the increases in the number of staff to 3% p.a. (this has been the
case in the past).
12.       Other Expenses.  Includes provisions for: (i) additional facilities
such as the microwave and earth satellite station: (ii) the removal of
BTE's tax exempt status; and (iii) increased fuel costs. Overall annual
increases of 16% is expected compared to 5.7% during the 1968-1973 period.
13.       Depreciation.  Projected on the basis of a composite rate of 4.5%
on average gross plant in service.
14.       Profit Tax.  Projected on the basis of an average rate of 36% on
net income.
Balance Sheets
15.       Plant in Operation.  Based on estimates of the value of the plant
to be commissioned in each year.
16.       Work in Progress.  Balance of construction expenditures and work
in progress at the beginning of the year less plant commissioned (see paras.
14 and 18).
17.       Cash and Banks.  This item has been notionally separated into the
balances required for operations (operational requirements) and balances not
immediately required for operations (temporary surplus). Operational require-
ments have been projected as 25% of expenses for salaries and other.
18.       Accounts Receivables.  Projected as 16% of revenues (58% days) which
is slightly less than in the past duie to improvements in collection perform-
ance and write-off of uncollectable accounts.
19.       Inventories.  The increases reflect the additional stores required
as a result of expanded operations. BTE's actual financial statements for
future years will probably show higher values as part of work in progress
actually at least partly will be accounted for as inventories.
20.       Overdrafts.  This represents short-term cash requirements projected
to be needed to cover peaks in the construction program.

Funds Flow Statement
21.       Internal Sources - Other.  This represents adjustments made to
prior years results.
22.       Working Capital Requirements.  Includes net changes of current
assets and liabilities except for cash and banks for which only operational
requirements are included. Cash balances in excess of or below the opera-
tional requirements are shown as surplus or deficit of funds at the end of
the statement.
