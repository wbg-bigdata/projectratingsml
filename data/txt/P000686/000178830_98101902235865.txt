iNTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO ETHIOPIA FOR A
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Ethiopia for the equivalent of US$16.0 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a telecommunications project. The proceeds
of the credit would be relent to the Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia
for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Events in Ethiopia during the past year have been dominated by the
political revolution which began in late February 1974. Widespread political
and economic discontent, inflamed by the Government's slow response to the
famine in the drought areas of Wollo and Tigre provinces, and to other press-
ing economic and social needs, gave rise to demonstrations in the streets of
Addis Ababa. Riots over the cost of living, strikes by teachers, taxi drivers
and others, and pay mutinies by the armed forces, led to a general military
revolt that precipitated the resignation of the cabinet on February 27. From
February to September a new cabinet, appointed by the Emperor and apparently
acceptable to the armed forces, administered the country, but power gravitated
increasingly to the military.
3.        The first actions of the new cabinet were to grant pay increases
to the armed forces, police, teachers and civil servants, and to promise
political and social reforms, including a new constitution and a free press.
In spite of these moves, political and economic unrest, as well as criticism
of the regime, continued through the spring. In late April, at the demand
of the armed forces, the Emperor agreed to the arrest of some 20 former
ministers and certain military officers on charges of corruption. From June
through September the armed forces ordered further arrests of some 200 con-
servative leaders, including senators, provincial governors and members of
the Emperor's Crown Council. Additionally, they moved to take over or
dissolve the institutions used by the Emperor to rule the country. Finally
in September the armed forces arrested the Emperor, suspended the constitution
and Parliament, and proclaimed rule by a Provisional Military Administrative
Council (PMAC) pending the election of a new parliament and the approval of
a new constitution. General Aman Michael Andom, the Defense Minister, was
appointed head of the Provisional Government. The former Prime Minister
was appointed Minister of Information and other cabinet ministers, government
officials and civil servants were requested to continue in their posts.



- 2 -
4.        On November 23, the revolution, which until then had been almost
completely bloodless, took a violent turn. In an apparent confrontation
over control of the revolution, the PMAC attempted to arrest General Aman,
who was killed in an ensuing gun battle. Following the death of General Aman,
the Provisional Government, apparently fearing a counter-revolutionary coup,
carried out summary executions of 59 political prisoners, including two former
prime ministers, other former ministers, provincial governors, senior army
officers and aristocrats. The killing of Aman and the executions sent shock
waves through Ethiopia and the international community. In recognition of
the adverse reaction at home and abroad, the Government declared that all
prisoners still being held would be given a fair trial. Recently, however,
the press has reported that persons caught organizing armed opposition to
Government reform measures have been executed.
5.        On December 20 the PMAC declared that Ethiopia would become a
socialist state. This was followed on January 1, 1975, by a decree nation-
alizing the financial sector (banks, insurance companies and savings asso-
ciations). In early February some 100 medium- and large-scale manufacturing
and distributing firms owned by Ethiopians and foreigners were nationalized;
seventy-t'wo were taken over entirely, and the Government acquired a majority
ownership in twenty-nine others.   The Government declared its intention to
pay full compensation.
6.        In early February, fighting broke out between the armed forces and
the Eritrean Liberation Front. Most of the fighting has been concentrated
in and around the principal city of Asmara, which is still held by the
Government. At this time fighting apparently continues, but since no inter-
national press coverage is permitted, little is known about the situation.
7.        On March 4, 1975 the PMAC issued the long-awaited land reform
proclamation which nationalized all land and restricted individual holdings
to a maximum of 10 hectares. This brought to an end the old feudal structure
oF land ownership under which about 90 percent of the rural population were
engaged in agriculture as tenants. In preparation for this step, the Govern-
ment had replaced the old provincial and district governors with carefully
chosen administrators who were given training and orientation in land reform
and other rural development measures. In addition, about 30,000 students were
sent to the rural areas for the purpose of explaining to the peasant farmers
the implications and beneflts of land reform while participating in a work
campaign for rural development. There have been, not unexpectedly, some
reports of resistance and opposition to the land reform measures, but it
appears the measures have received general acceptance by the vast majority
of the Ethiopian population. Another development in early March was a change
in the civilian cabinet which brought in a number of well trained technocrats
who had in their previous positions demonstrated considerable ability and
achievement.
8.        Throughout this period of upheaval, the civilian cabinet and the
Ethiopian bureaucracy have continued to function reasonably well. The Govern-
ment's takeover of banks and industries has led to a diversion of some scarce,



-3-
trained manpower from Government ministries to the management of the national-
ized enterprises. In addition, the Government has transferred a large number
of officials from the ministries and other government agencies to local govern-
ment institutions as a part of a government program to decentralize functions
to the subprovincial and district levels. The effect of these transfers on the
efficiency of operation of the ministries and agencies of the central govern-
ment is not immediately clear but some loss of efficiency is likely.
9.        In this changing atmosphere, Bank Group operations for the most part
have proceeded satisfactorily. Appraisals and supervisions are continuing to
proceed normally, and an economic updating mission visited the country in March.
Regarding existing projects, the execution of two projects (Humera Agricultural
Development, IDA Credit 188-ET, and the Lower Adiabo, IDA Credit 516-ET) have
been adversely affected due to their proximity to Eritrea. Other projects
have not been seriously affected by recent developments, and decisions have
continued to be made and normal work has continued. The Government has
indicated to us that, despite its preoccupation with political events, it is
desirous of pursuing an accelerated program of economic development, with
emphasis on the lower-income groups.
10.       A report, "Recent Economic Performance and Future Prospects in
Ethiopia," Report No. 9a-ET (R73-162) was circulated on June 15, 1973. An
economic updating mission was carried out in March of this year. Annex I
contains country data.
11.       Ethiopia, with an annual per capita income of only US$80 in 1972,
is classified by the UN as one of the 25 least developed countries of the
world. The population is predominantly rural and depends on agriculture for
its livelihood. In recent years the agricultural sector has contributed
50 to 60 percent of GDP and over 90 percent of export earnings. The leading
exports are coffee, hides and skins, pulses and oilseeds. Manufacturing,
including handicrafts and small-scale industries, contributes only 10 percent
of GDP, and the output of the mininR sector is negligible.
12.       An estimated 85 to 90 percent of the people are subsistence farmers
living in isolated rural villages. Although some large commercial farms did
exist, most farming units were small. A recent survey in one province showed
that 92 percent of the cultivated holdings were less than one hectare. Agri-
cultural productivity is, in general, very low. Methods of cultivation used
by most farmers have changed little over many centuries; the soils in many
highland areas are seriously depleted from prolonged overgrazing and over-
cropping, and the prevailing systems of land tenure generally did not provide
adequate incentives for investments which would raise farmers' productivity.
The development of agriculture is also inhibited by the lack of transportation.
There are few secondary and tertiary roads, and perhaps three-fourths of
Ethiopia's farms are more than one-half day's walking distance from a road.
This means transport costs are often too high to make it profitable for
subsistence farmers to expand production for the market. As a consequence,



- 4 -
there has been little or no improvement in rural living standards in recent
years. Difficult though the development of agriculture may be, the lack of
other resources means progress in developing the Ethiopian economy rests
almost entirely on developing agriculture.
13.       The land reform proclamation mentioned in paragraph 7 has major
implications for the development of agriculture and the rural economy. As
noted, all rural land has been nationalized. Farm families are to be given
user-rights on land up to a maximum of 10 hectares. Subject to this ceiling,
sufficient land for maintenance of family will be allotted to cultivators;
previous landowners will also be eligible for such allocation. All land must
be cultivated by family labor; land cannot be sold or transferred, but children
would have the same user-rights in the land as their parents. In communal and
nomadic areas peasants and pastoralists will have rights to use of the land
for cultivation and grazing; they will be encouraged to form peasant associa-
tions, to organize cooperative farms and otherwise cooperate in the use of
grazing and water rights. In settled areas, peasants' associations will be
formed around 800-hectare blocks of land. These associations will distribute
the land to the cultivators, establish judicial committees to hear land dis-
putes arising within the area, establish credit and marketing cooperatives,
anc assist in building schools, clinics and the like. Peasants' associations
will also be established at the awraja (sub-province) and woreda (district)
lcvels; they will appoint judicial committees which will adjudicate land
di.sputes brought to them directly or on appeal from lower levels. Civil
courts will have no jurisdiction on matters relating to rural land. The
Government will have responsibility for settling peasants and establishing
cottage industries to accommodate those who cannot be allotted sufficient
land.
14.       The ultimate disposition of large-scale farms is not entirely clear.
The proclamation provides that large-scale farms shall be owned and run bv
the State or by cooperatives or distributed to tillers for individual use.
'he Government is now assigning managers to some of these farms, which will
be operated as state farms under the supervision of the Ministry of National
Resource Development. The Government will pay appropriate compensation
for nmvable property and permanent works on all nationalized land, but no
compensation will be paid for land.
15.       iTn tile short run, the land reform measures may result In some dis-
ruption In agricultural production because of problems relating to making
credit, work animals, Implements, fertilizer, seeds and pesticides available.
These requirements are being met in some parts of the country under the
Minimum Package Program and a few comprehensive agricultural development
projects like the Wolamo Agricultural Development Project and the Chilalo
Agricultural Development Project. However, in large parts of the country,
these requirements have traditionally been met by landlords, and such arrange-
ments have been disrupted. The proposed peasants' associations are intended
to form the nuclei of cooperative societies for channeling required inputs



-5-
and possibly also for storage and marketing. However, a large force of
trained extension workers will be required, along with credit and storage
facilities and timely supply of inputs, to keep planting and production
going. An effective nationwide organization to plan, program and provide a
wide variety of services to the rural areas has to be built up. In the long
run, the distribution of land to the cultivator should lead to increased
incentives, efficiency and better morale for the peasant farmer and ulti-
mately to a better life in the rural areas.
16.       The Ethiopian population of approximately 27 million (mid-1974
estimate) is heavily concentrated in the youngest age groups, with 45 percent
under the age of 15. As a result of this age distribution, the proportion
of the population which is economically active is relatively low and the
dependency ratio is correspondingly high. Average life expectancy at birth
is only 39. The urban population presently comprises less than 10 percent
of the total, but it is growing at an estimated rate of 6.5 percent per annum.
At this rate the urban population will rise from 2.3 million in 1970 to almost
6 million by 1985. While there are no comprehensive data on employment and
unemployment, it is evident that opportunities in the towns have not kept
pace with the supply of workers with the result that urban unemployment is
growing. There is also significant underemployment in both the rural and
urban areas. Fragmentary evidence suggests that maldistribution of income
has increased in recent years.   Although data on wages are scanty, they
suggest that the income of agricultural laborers and unskilled workers in
general have been virtually stagnant at a low level. The slow growth of
agriculture where the majority of the people are engaged, the unchanging
rural wage, and apparently rising urban unemployment, are indications of a
worsening of income distribution.
17.       While enrollment in primary schools has risen at an average rate of
11 percent per annum over the last 15 years, only about 20 percent of primary
school-age children (ages 7-12) were enrolled in 1973-74. Only about 6 percent
of the secondary-school-age population attends school, and the adult literacy
rate is estimated to be only 7 percent. Inequality of educational opportuni-
ties between rural and urban areas remains a serious problem, and achieve-
ments in the special adult literacy program lag substantially behind targets.
Thus, despite creditable efforts on the part of the Government, overall edu-
cational attainment remains low in comparison with the rest of Africa and the
developing world in general.
18.       Ethiopia's First and Second Development Plans gave priority to the
development of infrastructure and to the establishment of manufacturing
industries (mainly government-financed) based on import substitution. The
Third Plan (FY69-74) emphasized more balanced development of agriculture and
industry, and the new Government is expected to give increased attention to
agriculture, rural education, rural health and water supplies, and to other
activities such as rural roads which directly support agricultural develop-
ment. During the past two decades, the Government has made efforts to
accelerate the pace of development by controlling expenditures on defense,



-6-
increasing expenditures on education, introducing some new taxes (including
an agricultural income tax), and improving the effectiveness of the public
service. However, these efforts have been only a beginning, and progress to
date has generally fallen short of objectives. There are severe institutional
shortcomings in Ethiopia; institutions are changing slowly, and the modest
pace of institutional improvement has inhibited economic growth. Additional
constraining factors in the past have been inadequate levels of domestic
savings and low absorptive capacity.
19.       During the period 1961-1968, the GDP grew at an average rate of
4.7 percent per year in real terms. However, during the first five years of
the Third Plan (FY69-73), the average rate of growth was only 3.9 percent,
well below the Plan target of 6 percent. With population expanding at an
estimated 2.4 percent per year, growth in per capita incomes has been low,
varying from about 2.5 percent per year in the early 1960's to 1.5 percent
or less in recent years (as compared to the Third Plan target of 3.5 percent).
20.       One cause of slow growth in GDP during the first four years of the
Third Plan period was the slow expansion of exports. During 1968-71 export
earnings increased by only 5.6 percent per year compared with the Plan target
of 8 percent, and export volume grew at a disappointing rate of only 2.5 percent.
In 1972-74, however, the situation has been much improved due both to higher
prices for Ethiopia's traditional exports of coffee, hides and skins, oilseeds
and pulses, and to increases in the volume of exports (except coffee). Total
commodity exports increased from US$125 million in 1971 to US$167 million in
1972, US$240 million in 1973 and to US$305 million (estimated) in 1974, while
imports rose much more slowly, from US$188 million in 1971 to US$268 million
(estimated) in 1974. Largely as a result of these trade surpluses, net foreign
exchange reserves increased from US$51 million at the end of 1971 to US$300
million at the end of 1974.
21.       The medium-range balance of payments forecast for Ethiopia was
favorable until the recent increases in petroleum prices and the attendant
rises in the costs of fertilizers, chemicals, and other intermediate goods.
While it now appears that Ethiopia will be able to meet the added cost of
petroleum imports in the short run, despite an increase from about US$16-20
million in 1971 and 1972 to US$40 million in 1973 and to an estimated US$60
or US$70 million in 1974, in the longer run the terms of trade are likely to
turn sharply against her. The Bank's latest commodity price forecasts indicate
that Ethiopia's terms of trade index will decline from a base of 100 in 1974
to 80 in 1980. This substantial deterioration in the terms of trade, other
things equal, could produce a reversal of recent current account surpluses.
22.       Another cause of the disappointing growth of the Ethiopian economy
in recent years has been the failure to reach investment targeta for both
the public and private sectors. The gross investment rate increased steadily
from 12 percent in 1961 to 14.4 percent in 1967, but since then has fallen
back to an average of 12 percent in 1970-72. Similarly, the share of domestic



-7-
savings in GDP increased from 11 percent in 1961 to 12.5 percent in 1968, but
has fallen below 12 percent in more recent years. Central Government capital
expenditures averaged only Eth$109 million a year over the six years of the
Third Plan (FY69-74) as compared with an initial plan objective of Eth$190
million per year. Despite this shortfall, however, the Government was able,
during the Plan period, to raise the level of investment spending from Eth$65
million in FY69 to Eth$130 million in FY73.
23.       Because of the low domestic savings capacity, the Government depends
heavily upon foreign borrowing to finance the public investment program.
Foreign loans and credits accounted for 33 percent of public capital expendi-
tures in FY69-74. However, annual gross public capital inflows have been only
about US$1.32 per capita over the past five years. Very few developing
countries receive so little aid on a per capita basis. Unlike many other
African countries which were formerly dependent, Ethiopia has no traditional
source of technical and financial help. For this reason, a relatively high
level of assistance from the Bank Group is justified. The Bank/IDA share of
public capital inflows has increased from about 25 percent in 1962-65 to
35 percent in 1966-69 and to approximately 40 percent in 1970-73. In addi-
tion, to assist Ethiopia in obtaining additional external assistance, the
Bank has sponsored a Consultative Group of aid donors. The second meeting
of this Group, under the Bank's chairmanship, was held in July 1973.
24.       It must be recognized that Ethiopia has faced, and still faces,
serious constraints in manpower, resources and institutions. In certain
areas, such as education, foreign trade, tax collections and overall public
investment, significant progress has been made. Viable institutions have
been built up in the highways sector, power and telecommunications, and both
intensive and extensive agricultural development programs have been launched
successfully. A basis exists upon which the new Government can build an
accelerated development effort, with emphasis on the rural areas. If such a
program is undertaken, a substantially increased volume of foreign assistance
will be needed. Because of Ethiopia's poverty, it is desirable that future
inflows should be provided to the greatest extent possible on concessionary
terms. Furthermore, it is appropriate that external donors should finance a
large proportion of the costs of projects, including local costs.
25.       Finally, a serious drought during 1972 and 1973 culminated in
famine conditions in large areas of Wollo and Tigre provinces in 1973 and
early 1974. It has not been possible to quantify accurately the economic
impact or the loss of life, but the effects have been unquestionably grave.
While rainfall during 1974 was adequate throughout most of the original
drought regions, it will require perhaps as long as three to five years for
agricultural production to return to pre-drought levels. The Bank Group is
assisting in the drought rehabilitation program through a US$10 million IDA
credit which was approved in June 1974.



-8-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ETHIOPIA
26.       From '950 to the present, Bank Group lending in Ethiopia has totalled
US$298 million, conprised of eighteen IDA credits totalling US$189 million and
twelve Bank loans totalling US$109 million. Additionally, the IFC has made
five commitments in Ethiopia totalling US$15.7 million. One-half of the amount
of lending (US$145 million) was committed in the last three years. In addition
to the substantial increase in the size of its operations in the last three
years, the Bank Group has softened its terms to Ethiopia; all but US$10.8
million of FY72's US$49.5 million program and all of FY73's US$53 million and
FY74's US$43.4 million programs were IDA credits.
27.       Until the late 1960's, our help concentrated on assisting the
construction of trunk roads, power and telecommunication facilities.   In the
late 1960's, our program shifted in emphasis to agriculture and education,
and in the past five years we have made ten credits for agricultural develop-
ment totalling US$82.3 million and two credits for education totalling US$19.5
million. In addition, in 1972 we made a US$17 million credit for transporta-
t.'on with emphasis on the construction of agricultural roads. This program
reflects t'.e increased opportunity for agricultural lending brought about by
improved sectoral knowledge, and the heavier emphasis on agriculture and edu-
cation in the Government's priorities. This shift has been greatly assisted
by the Bank's Regional Mission in Eastern Africa (RMEA), which has played a
maj.r role in project identification and preparation in the agricultural
sector.
28.       Implementation of Bank Group-financed projects is generally satis-
factory.  Using the rate of credit disbursements as a measure of implementa-
tIon, the pattern of disbursement in Ethiopia falls within the norm of the
Bank Group as a whole. Implementation problems are generally concerned with
delays in effectiveness and in initiation of project works rather than with
problems of a technical nature. Delays in effectiveness have in the past
'ceen largely caused b-y delays in parliamentary ratification, while delays in
implenmentation have been related to slowness in initiating and completing
start-up activities, such as the appointments of consultants and project staff
and the issuance of invitations to bid.  Generally, however, once project
staffs are mobilized and initial activities are underway, implementation
is good. We are faced Iowever withi substantial cost overruns on three Bank
Group-financed projects, the Amibara Irrigation Project (Credit No. 418-EM),
the Addis Ababa Water and Sewage ?rolect (Loan No. 318-E , and the Fifth
Highway Project, (Credit No. 332-Eri,  Additionally it appears that price
escalations will necessitate cutbacks and restructuring of other projects.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC
investments as of February 28, 1975 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
29.       In addition to its lending program, the Bank is pursuing a number
of activities to support the Government's development strategy. As already
mentioned, a mission visited Ethiopia to make a comprehensive study of the



-9-
agricultural sector. The Bank is executing agency for the UNDP project to
help the Government in improving its planning, and the Bank has supplied
advisors in project identification and preparation to the Planning Coimmission
and the Ministry of Agriculture.
30.       Lending to Ethiopia increased during FY72-74, and further expansion
of the lending program is planned for the future if reasonable stability pre-
vails.  Since the economy is essentially agricultural, and because agriculture
offers the greatest opportunities for development and for improving income
distribution and employment, the main thrust of our lending program will be
in that sector. A second sector of priority is the education sector where
the Government is planning major investments to make education more relevant
to development and more equitably available. Given the inadequate infra-
structure of the country, and the low level of foreign and domestic capital
available for investment, we shall also continue to provide some assistance
to the development of other sectors, and to investment in the infrastructure
which is necessary to support development.   In order to relieve the constraint
caused by Ethiopia's limited capacity to prepare and implement projects,
especially in education and agriculture, we intend to continue providing
technical assistance in project preparation, and to help strengthen through
technical assistance the administrative capacity in the beneficiary institu-
tions so that they will be able to utilize larger flows of assistance. In
our lending for infrastructure, we plan to continue lending to such institu-
tions as the Ethiopian Highway Authority (EHA), the Board of Telecommunications
of Ethiopia (BTE), and the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA).
These are institutions with which the Bank has worked for some years and which
now have substantial capacity for channeling resources into development programs.
31.       An IDA credit of US$32 million for a sixth highway project has been
submitted to you for your consideration on April 29, 1975. We plan to present
for your consideration in the next 18 months, a fourth education project, and
four, or five, agricultural projects. Several of the projects will be follow-
up projects and others will be breaking new ground. Included in the first
category will be the Third Livestock Project, and a follow-up credit for the
Coffee Processing Project. Included in the second category are proposals for
a grain storage and marketing project, and an agricultural settlement project.
Because of institutional and policy changes in Ethiopia, some restructuring
of these projects has been necessary. Thus, completion of appraisals and
negotiations of some of these projects could be delayed somewhat. Before
presenting each of the above projects we shall take a careful look at the
prospects for implementation and the availability of local resources necessary
for implementation.
32.       During 1970-73, the Bank and IDA contributed 40.5 percent of gross
inflows of official loans. This share is expected to increase substantially
during the next few years as amounts disbursed under Bank loans and IDA
credits rise. As of December 31, 1974, the Bank/IDA share of total public
debt disbursed and outstanding was 40.8 percent and the Bank/IDA share of
total public debt service was 27.8 percent. Because of the relatively low



- 10 -
levels2 f assistance expected from bilateral donors, Bank Group debt out-
staidit-g as a Tuercent of outstanding external public debt is expected to rise
to 55-60 percent by 1980, and debt service payments to the Bank Group will
incre6,se to ap;proximately 40 percent of total public debt service by the
same year.  `swever, the IBRD share of external public debt-outstanding and
disbursed will fall from 25 to 15 percent over this period. The debt service
ratio in 1973 was less than 8 percent and is likely to remain below 10 percent
in the 1980i'.
FART III - TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN ETHIOPIA
33.       Ethiopia is a large country with rugged topography, and a large
populatioT.. Presently Ethiopia has a telephone density of 0.25 per 100
population; only five of the other 38 African countries for which statistics
are available have lower densities. Given the large distances involved and
the sparse road network, economic integration and improvement in administra-
tion are dependent to a large degree on expansion of telecommunications.
The difficult topography, the wide area over which agriculture is distributed
and the scarcity of good all-weather roads make telecommunications particularly
important for coordinating the movement, distribution and marketing of agri-
cultural products. Also manufacturing, industry, tourism and commerce are
making increasing demands on national and international telecommunications
facilities.
34.       The Eoard of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (BTE), which would be
the beneficiary of the proposed credit, was established in 1952. It is
solely responsible for all public telecommunications services in Ethiopia
and between Ethiopia and other countries. BTE is organized as a Government-
owned commercial corporation under the overall direction of the Ministry of
Cormunications and has considerable autonomy to administer its day-to-day
operations   WThile there is a need for further improvement, all services --
urban, inter-urban, and international -- have grown and improved signifi-
cantly since BTE's establishment. The expansion and improvement have been
assisted by external loans and technical assistance.
Local Telephone Service
35.       As of mid-1974, Ethiopia had 17 automatic telephone exchanges,
two of which were in Addis Ababa. The installed capacity was 55,300 lines,
35,500 of them in Addis Ababa. Most of the equipment is modern, well
maintained and should provide good service for many years. In addition,
there are 285 manual exchanges, with an installed capacity of 12,515 lines,
serving small towms and rural areas; service is usually provided only in the
daytime. The increase in telephones installed in these small exchanges over
the pe-;iod 1968-73 averaged about 13 percent per annum. Based on past growth



trends and detailed development studies of subscriber demand in each exchange
area, BTE has forecast an average rate of growth during the project period of
about 11 percent which is reasonable.
Long Distance Service
36.       The long distance network consists of a 960 channel microwave system
linking Addis Ababa and Asmara, a number of VHF systems and open-wire lines,
which are supplemented by carrier systems on main routes. The network com-
prises 260,000 trunk-circuit kilometers.
37.       The microwave system, Addis Ababa to Asmara, provides good service
between the two largest cities in the country. Three other microwave systems
will be put in service by mid-1975 and will improve service between Addis
Ababa and Dire Dawa/Harrar, Jima and Shashamane. The four microwave systems
are all part of BTE's Fourth Development Program (1968-1973) financed by a
previous Bank loan.
38.       Three automatic trunk exchanges were put in service in May 1973.
Along with the microwave systems, they make possible subscriber trunk dial-
ing (STD) between the most important cities in Ethiopia. These works would
also facilitate provision of good quality long distance service to new areas.
39.       BTE has proposed an increase in the number of long distance circuits
based on traffic projections on each route, taking into consideration all the
circuits which would be available on completion of microwave communication
systems provided in the Fourth Development Program. The additional circuits
would remove congestion on various routes, reduce delays in obtaining service
and generally improve service and meet the growth of demand.
Telegraph and Telex Service
40.       Telegraph service is provided over the telephone network and high
frequency radio. Installation of a public telegraph system with terminals
in 14 cities is almost completed. The telegraph service provides access,
often the only one, to remote areas of the country.
41.       Telex service is offered from one automatic exchange in Addis
Ababa and from manual exchanges in Asmara, Assab and Dire Dawa. The number
of telex subscribers at mid-1974 was 271. The service offered to the sub-
scribers connected to the manual exchanges is rather poor. The number of
telex subscribers lhas increased by 14 percent annually during the last five
years. Since the backlog of demands has already been met, BTE has now fore-
cast a 12 percent annual growth for telex subscribers for the project period
based on demands and applications for this service largely in Addis Ababa.
International Services
42.       International telephone, telegraph and telex service is offered
via high frequency (HF) radio to 19 destinations abroad and via an open-
wire line equipped with a carrier system to Djibouti. The existing plant



- 12 -
has not been able to meet the demand. This has resulted in long waiting
periods, sometimes more than 24 hours, and a generally poor quality of ser-
vlce. Despite these limitations, international telephone traffic increased
24 percent and telex traffic 27 percent annually, during 1968-73.
Bank Group Assistance to the Sector
43.       Starting in 1951, the Bank Group has made four loans and one credit,
totalling US$35.1 million, for telecommunications development in Ethiopia.
The projects financed by the first three loans (42-ET, 314-ET and 441-ET)
have been completed. The fourth loan (605-ET) for $4.5 million with partici-
pation from the Swedish Iinternational Development Authority (SIDA) which
provided an equal amount, was made in 1969 to cover part of the foreign cost
of the 1968-73 expansion program (Fourth Development Program). Progress on
this project has been satisfactory; however, certain items originally scheduled
for completion in 1973 were delayed by about one year. The credit (453-ET)
for US$21.4 million and covering the first phase of the foreign exchange
requirements of BTE's Fifth Development Program (1974-78) was made in Januarv
1974; after some six months of initial delays, project implementation is
p-rogressing satisfactorily.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
The Project
44.       A report entitled "Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia, Apprais-
al of a Telecommunications Project" (Report No. 717-ET) is being circulated
separately.  A Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
45.       The project proposed for IDA financing is BTE's Fifth Development
Program (1974-1978), except for a small part which will be completed in mid-
1979 becatuse of some initial delays. This project was first appraised in
january 1973 to determine the feasibility of an IDA credit to finance the
foreign exchange component. Due to the shortage of IDA funds in FY74, it
was decided that the project would be financed through two credits. The
first credit (453-ET) for an amount of US$21.4 million, covering part of the
project, was approved by the Board in November 1973.   The same project was
reappraised in September 1974 in order to update the information collected
and confirm the conclusions reached during the previous appraisal. On the
basis of the second appraisal, and after careful assessment of recent political
and economic developments in Ethiopia, we are satisfied that the project is
still of high priority and is economically, technically and financially Justi-
fied in the changed circumstances. Thus, a credit of US$16 million is now
proposed to finance the remaining foreign exchange requirements of the project,
except US$1.4 million in respect of equipment which has already been contracted
and financed by BTE.  Negotiations for this second credit were held in
Washington from March 31 through April 3, 1975. The Ethiopian Delegation
was led by Ato Legesse Tickeher, Economic and Financial Counsellor of the



- 13 -
Ethiopian Embassy in Washington, D.C. and Ato Girmaw Ingidayehu, Acting
General Manager of the Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia.
46.       The project is designed to meet the growth of demand in the areas now
being served and to extend service to some of the areas of the interior where
telecommunications services are sparse or non-existent. The project consists
of:
(i) installation of about 40,000 lines of automatic exchange
equipment, and about 4,500 lines of manual exchange equipment;
(ii) installation of cable distribution networks and subscribers'
plant to provide about 45,000 telephone connections;
(iii) provision of four microwave links (Dessie-Assab,Asmara-
Tessenei, Shashamane-Moyale, and Addis Ababa-Chimbi) with a
total route length of 1,500 km and various medium capacity
VHF/UHF radio links or coaxial cables with a route length
totaling 200 km; construction of 3,000 km of small capacity
VHF radio links and rehabilitation of 2,100 km of open-wire
lines; and provision of multiplex and carrier equipment for
the above facilities as well as for expanding the capacity of
the existing ones;
(iv)  installation of 48 manual switchboard positions and provision
of about 660 lines of long distance automatic switching
equipment;
(v)  installation of an earth satellite station for international
services and of an associated international telephone transit
center which will allow semi-automatic telephone operation
with most foreign countries; and
(vi) various extensions of the telex and telegraph networks,
including an extension of the capacity of the telex switching
equipment in Addis Ababa from 400 lines to about 700 lines.
47.       The estimated cost of the project has increased since it was last
appraised in 1973 to US$60.6 million equivalent, of which US$38.8 million
equivalent (64 percent) is the foreign exchange component -- the estimated
cost at the time of appraisal in 1973 was US$55 million equivalent, of which
US$35 million equivalent was the foreign exchange component. This increase
of roughly 10 percent is due mainly to (i) an increase in the provision for
price contingencies, taking into account present worldwide inflation, and
(ii) a provision of US$0.7 million equivalent to finance additional facili-
ties required for the telex service.

Total Sources                 125.5    60.6   100
49.       BTE's overall financing plan for 1974-1979, during which the project
would be implemented,requires US$78.2 million in capital investments of which
US$4.9 million corresponds to the remaining portion of the Fourth Telecom-
munication Project, US$60.5 million to the Fifth Telecommunication Project
(excluding US$0.1 million expended in late 1973), and US$12.8 million for
investment beyond the Fifth Telecommunication Project.  Of this total require-
ment, about 40 percent will be financed from BTE's net internal cash genera-
tion, including a small reduction in working capital. The remaining 60 percent
of the requirement will be financed by borrowings which would include proceeds
of IBRD/SIDA Loan 605-ET (Fourth Telecommunication Project), Credit 453-ET
(Fifth Telecommunication Project - First Tranche) and the proposed credit.
50.       BTE's overall financing plan does not provide for any dividends
to be paid during the construction period. During negotiations, agreement
was reached that no dividends would be pai d unless a revised financing plan
indicates that dividend payments are feasible. (This will be included in
the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and BTE, the conclusion
of which is a condition of effectiveness in accordance with Section 5.01(b)
the Credit Agreement.) Furthermore, the financing plan shows a need for
temporary finance in the intermediate years of the construction program.
During negotiations, we obtained assurances that BTE would obtain short-term
debt as and when needed (Project Agreement, Section 4.05).
51.       The relending terms for the proceeds of the proposed credit would
be the same as for credit 453-ET, i.e. 20 years, including a 5-year grace
period, with an interest rate of 7-1/4 percent, and deferment of interest
receipts of up to Eth.$1.5 million during construction of the project. BTE
will bear the exchange risk. (These arrangements will be included in the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and BTE, the conclusion of
whicih is a condition of effectiveness in accordance with Section 5.01(b) of
the Credit Agreement.)

Earnings and Tariffs
52.       Tariffs are on average comparable to those of most developing
countries. The annual revenue per telephone connection is US$227, which is
significantly higher than that of most European countries despite a con-
siderably lower income in Ethiopia as compared with Europe, and the fact
that long distance service now in the early stages of development has not
yet made a full contribution to revenue. The most recent t4riff revision
took place in 1971 when local call charges were increased by 33 percent.
53.       The level of tariffs in the period of 1968 to 1973 allowed BTE
to earn a rate of return (the ratio of net operating income to the value of
net plant in service) varying from 10.7 percent to 12.3 percent annually;
this exceeded the 9 percent rate of return covenanted under the Bank loan for
the Fourth Telecommunication Project (1968-1973). Internally generated funds
during this period were sufficient after servicing of debt to provide about
60 percent of the funds required for investment. Commencing in calendar year
1973, however, the Government withdrew BTE's tax exemptions and BTE must now
pay income, excise and property taxes. These taxes will halve a substantial
impact on BTE's earnings. Despite the fact that operating revenues during
the project period are estimated to increase at an average annual rate of
13 percent, the rate of return will decline from 11.7 percent in 1973 to less
than 6 percent in 1979, and net earnings at current levels of tariffs while
adequate to finance BTE's contribution to the Fifth Development Program, will
not be sufficient to finance a reasonable proportion of subsequent development
expansion.
54.       During negotiations for Credit 453-ET, therefore, agreement was
reached that BTE will take such actions as necessary to achieve an annual
rate of return of 7 percent now and of 8 percent by the time the project is
completed, and to maintain it at that level thereafter. We have agreed to
include a similar provision in the Project Agreement for the proposed Credit
(Section 4.04). While there will be some opportunities once the project is
completed to achieve more economical operations through increasing system
utilization, it is expected that achievement of this rate of return will
require a tariff increase of about 12 percent by the end of the project period.
Meanwhile, with the assistance of the Bank Group, BTE will begin a study of
the economic costs and benefits of telecommunications services, particularly
for rural areas, which will help the Government and BTE in making price and
investment decisions. This study will also examine the potential contribution
of telecommunications to government revenues. It is envisaged that this study
would serve as a useful example to other developing countries faced with
similar decisions.
Fiscal Impact
55.        As a result of the change of its tax liabilities, BTE will pay
taxes and duties to the Government in the amqount of Eth.$28 million during
the period the project is being implemented (1974-79). Profit taxes alone
will equal about Eth.$3.3 million per year in 1979, In addition. BTE will
pay Eth.$16 million of interest to the Government over the project period



- 16 -
on the onlending of the two IDA credits for the project. BTE will not have
recourse to the Government's budget for financing expansion and will be
servicing all of its debts from its own revenues. Thus the above payments
are net contributions from BTE to the Government for use in other sectors.
Collection Performance
*56.       There nas been substantial improvement in BTE's collection practices
since the Fourth Telecommunications Project. Current billings are being
collected on time or the service of the delinquent subscriber is being
terminated, thus limiting the amount of uncollectable accounts. The collec-
tion of government accounts is now satisfactory.
Financial Position
57.       Before December 31, 1967, BTE's share capital was Eth.$7.7 mil-
lion. The corporate charter restricts the amount of indebtedness to not
more than three times the amount of authorized and subscribed share capital.
In order to enable BTE to incur additional debt, its share capital was
increased on December 31, 1967, to Eth.$20 million by capitalizing part of
the Renewals and Expansion Reserve accumulated from retained earnings. The
share capital was similarly increased to Eth.$40 million in 1974 to allow for
the lending proposed for the Fifth Development Program by capitalizing part
of the Renewals and Expansion Reserve.
58.       The debt/equity ratio during the project period will vary from
29/71 at December 31, 1973 to 54/46 at December 31, 1979. This is satis-
factory. Internal cash generation will cover annual debt service at least
2.2 times during each year of the period. The debt service covenant of
Credit 453-ET requires BTE to obtain the Bank's agreement before contract-
ing new debt unless the debt service coverage as usually defined exceeds
1.5. We have agreed to include a similar provision in the project agreement
for the proposed credit (Section 4.03).
Organization and Management
59.       BTE's organization is generally satisfactory and effective.    At
present, however, the planning function is mostly handled by the Engineering
Department since the Planning and Programming Division, set up for this
purpose in 1972 and directly responsible to the General Manager, has not yet
been provided with enough competent staff to carry out this function. The
current arrangement works well and is acceptable considering the present size
of the network and the relative scarcity of competent staff.    The management
and technical staff of BTE are generally well qualified and competent. With
only one exception, the utility is entirely staffed by Ethiopians and many
of them have visited abroad for training.
Implementation
60.       Competent staff is available within BTE for the preparation of
bidding documents, bid evaluations and detailed engineering of the project



- 17 -
with the exception of the earth satellite station, for which assistance by
a consultant has already been contracted. Except for the earth satellite
station, which will be installed by the selected supplier, all other equipment
sill be installed by BTE's own staff under supervision of suppliers. Due to
current unrest there is some uncertainty about implementation of a few works
in northern Ethiopia which is about 5 percent of the totalf project (approxi-
mately US$3.5 million in project cost of which US$2.5 million would be covered
by the proposed credit). If these works for any reason were delayed abnor-
mally BTE would, in consultation with IDA, redirect the equipment and materials
for use elsewhere in Ethiopia which would involve minimal cost and effort.
Procurement
61.       All goods financed by the proposed credit would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's Guidelines
for Procurement, with the exception of extension equipment for existing
facilities. These latter items, which are estimated to cost US$0.5 million
.or about 3 percent of the IDA credit, will be procured through negotiation
from the original suppliers.
62.       In order to expedite procurement of equlpment financed by the pro-
posed credit and to allow BTE to standardize equipment, it was agreed between
IDA and BTE during negotiations of Credit 453-ET that bidding documents for
procurement of equipment through international competitive bidding under
Credit 453-ET would cover the requirements of the whole project; BTE would
thus obtain from suppliers firm proposals for equipment financed by Credit
453-ET and options for purchase of equipment to be financed by the proposed
credit. This procedure eliminates the need for a second round of international
competitive bidding for part of the project to be financed by the proposed
credit.
63.       Although at present there is no local production of telecommunications
equipment, there is local manufacture of electrical cables which easily could
be extended to telephone installation cables and dropwire.     Provision   is there-
fore made for financing of the ex-factory cost of such equipment if a local manu-
facturer is awarded a contract (see Schedule 1, para. 1(1) of the proposed Credit).
In order to be consistent in this approach for the Fifth Telecommunications Project
as a whole,-Credit 453-ET is being amended to permit financing of locally manu-
factured equipment (see Schedule 1, para. 5 of the proposed Credit Agreement).
To encourage local manufacture, a domestic preference of 15 percent or the customs
duties, whichever is lower, would be granted for such items, the estimated cost of
which would be less than US$200,000. Mloreover, the above-mentioned preferential
treatment of local manufacturers will also be made applicable for Credit 453-ET
in order to maintain consistent awarding procedures under the project (See
Schedule 1, para. B.1 of proposed Project Agreement).
Disbursement
64.       Credit proceeds will be disbursed against the CIF costs of imported
equipment and the foreign cost of imported services, or the ex-factory cost
of any locally awarded contract for locally manufactured goods.

Return on Investment and Economic Rate of Return
65.       The internal rate of return on the project is estimated at 17.4
percent.  Sensitivity analyses reflecting a 10 percent increase in operating
costs and a 10 percent decrease in revenues were made which produced a rate of
return of 14.7 percent. Although this rate of return is not in itself a
complete test of the economic merit of the project, it does provide a guide
as to the justification for the investment as indicated by subscribers'
willingness to pay for the services provided.
66.       The economic rate of return on the proposed project is undoubt-
edly higher than the foregoing rate suggests, since the prices charged for
telecommunications services are not considered an adequate measure of the
full benefits to the subscribers themselves. Moreover, the costs include
the full cost of extending service to new areas even though the full bene-
fits will be obtained only in the future as additional lines are connected
in these areas. Examples of benefits which are not fully quantified include
the availability of marketing information in rural areas which allows farmers
or marketing agents to transport products when they are informed that prices
are satisfactory.
67.       The project would assist in the economic development of the provinces
Tlhrough improved long distance services and extension of services to about
'00 rural areas which have no telephones now.   The project provides for new
microwave links, and additions to the microwave network in the Fourth Tele-
communications Project which will give reliable communications between the
provinces and the capital.   The installation of the earth satellite station
would provide economical, 24-hour high quality, reliable international tele-
co:mmunications to existing and new destinations in other countries and would
help in the promotion of exports and tourism.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
68.       The drafts of a Development Credit Agreement between the Government
of E.hiopia and the Association and of a Project Agreement between the Asso-
ciation and the Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (BTE), the Report ot
the Cormnittee provided for under Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of
Agreement, and the text ef: a draft Resoltition approving- the proposed credit
are being distributed to the E.:-ecutive Directors separately.  The draft Agree-
ments conform to the normal pattc:rn for credits for projects of this type.
69.       Conclusion of a satisfactory Sulbsidiary Loan Agreement between the
Government and BTE, which would include the onlending terms and conditions
as in paragraphs 50 and 51 above, would be a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed credit.
70.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION - ETHIOPIA 1/
Ln No. 523      Fourth Highway Project; US$13.5 million Loan and US$7.7
million Credit of January 15, 1968; Original Closing Date:
December 31, 1973, postponed to June 30, 1974, and sub-
sequently to June 30, 1975.
The project was late in starting because initial bids were high
requiring changes in specifications and new bid invitations. Subsequent
progress has, however, been good. Of the three civil works contracts, all
have been completed -- one a year ahead of schedule and another about fifteen
months ahead of schedule: the third contract was substantially completed at
the end of 1973, about three months behind schedule, but some repair work and
clean up operations extended into the second quarter of 1974. The closing
date was postponed to June 30, 1975 to allow for settlement of contractor's
claims.
Ln No. 596     Power II, Finchaa Hydroelectric Project; US$23.1 million
Loan of May 9, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1973,
postponed to June 30, 1974 and was subsequently postponed
to December 31, 1974, and then to June 30, 1975.
The Project has been completed; apart from some minor outstanding
works, all three generating units are now available for commercial opera-
tions. An analysis of overall Project costs, taking into consideration the
various currency realignments during the course of construction, shows that
costs were by about 7% over the original estimate, which is moderate in the
inflationary conditions which have prevailed during the construction period.
The increased costs are confined entirely to local costs. The original Loan
Closing Date of December 31, 1973 was postponed to June 30, 1974 so that
payment of retention monies could be withheld pending completion of all
outstanding items. The closing date was postponed to June 30, 1975 to allow
payment for some minor corrective civil works and replacement of the electric
standby generator.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln No. 605     Telecormmunications IV Project; US$4.5 million Loan of
June 3, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1973, postponed
to December 31, 1974, and subsequently to December 31, 1975.
SIDA is providing joint financing of $4.5 million equivalent to
finance part of the foreign exchange cost. Overall progress has been
reasonably on target. However, installation of three microwave routes
will not be accomplished until mid-1975. The delays were mainly due to
difficulty in obtainirg suitable consultants to work on the survey of these
routes and labor strikes in supplier's country.
Cr No. 1969    Wolamo Agriculture Development Project; US$3.5 million
Credit of November 16, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Overall progress is good and in advance of the appraisal schedule.
Participation of farmers in the program to increase productivity through
the provision of extension services, inputs and credit is in advance of
expectations as is participation in the soil conservation program. Construc-
tion of feeder roads is behind schedule and will reach only 50 percent of
target because of a financial shortfall. Land settlement will achieve only
about 90 percent of the project target because of unavailability of suitable
land. With respect to the livestock component, the vaccination campaign
is proceeding well.
Cr No. 188     Ilumera Agriculture Project; US$3.1 million Credit of
May 28, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973, postponed to
December 31, 1974, and then to December 31, 1975.
The project is progressing well, but is behind appraisal completion
schedule by about one year, due mainly to delays in procurement of heavy road
construction equipment and delays in installation of the Humera water system,
which had to be undertaken by force account construction due to non-avail-
ability of contractors. Construction of facilities on the project farm is
satisfactory. Consultant's study on the second phase project was submitted
to the Government in February 1974.   Only about $200,000 remain undisbursed.
The project is located near the Eritrean border and the current unrest and
fighting in Eritrea has adversely affected the movement of surplus agricul-
tural produce to Eritrean ports.
Cr No. 243      Education II Project; US$9.5 million Credit of Ma   6, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Physical implementation of the project is about one year behind
the appraisal report estimate due mainly to problems in the initial stages
with procurement of bulk order construction materials and delays in site
acquisition and surveys. The delay was reflected in slow credit disbursement
initially. Disbursement is now increasing and further delays are not anti-
cipated.

The Academy of Pedagogy and its primary teacher training institute
have been completed. Nine other project institutions are also near completion;
the remaining are scheduled for completion by end-1975. Construction and
phased deliveries of furniture and equipment are progressing well, and
completion is scheduled for mid-1976.
Implementation of the technical assistance component of the project
is progressing and external fellowship students have taken up studies. At
the request of the Government, the manpower study by an ILO team has been
extended by 3 man-years to a total of 7-1/2 man-years.
Latest cost estimates show that Government will be called upon to
increase its project budget by about US$1.2 million to complete the project.
This increase is due to cost increases and currency realignments. However,
some or most of this increase may be offset by anticipated bilateral project
support.
Cr No. 269     Addis Ababa Dairy Development Project; US$4.4 million
Credit of August 30, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The credit was slow in becoming effective because of recruitment
problems. This project has serious liquidity problems caused by (a) a
narrowing margin between purchase price and sales price of dairy products;
(b) accumulated expenditures over revenues on DDA operated ranches and
farms; (c) over-extension of administrative and technical services all of
which caused the project to incur an operating loss through 1974 of Eth$2.2
million. A large part of this loss can be attributed to the fact that the
Dairy Processing Plant was expected to support the cost of technical assist-
ance and extension services to dairy farmers, a cost which should appro-
priately be borne by the Government budget. Cost increases are also a
problem and will cause some cut back of the project. In spite of this
adverse situation, we believe the project remains basically sound. We have
suggested to the Government a program to restructure the project and put
the dairy plant on a more profitable basis. The Ministry of Agriculture
has accepted our proposal in principle and will present it to the Council
of Ministers.
Cr No. 290     Coffee Processing Project; US$6.3 million Credit of
March 20, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Due to delays in obtaining parliamentary approval and recruiting
key staff, the credit was not declared effective until December 15, 1972.
Further, project implementation has been slow. However, project management
and planning have been good; procurement of road construction and coffee
processing equipment is now well underway, and project implementation is
gaining momentum.

Ln No. 818     Addis Ababa Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$10.8 million
Loan of May 1, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Project implementation is running eight to twelve months behind
the appraisal schedule. When the loan was signed total project costs were
estimated at about US$13 million. Based on recent tenders for a number of
contracts, cost estimates have increased to about US$21 million. We are
awaiting AWASA and Government's proposals to meet the cost over-runs. The
alternative of reducing the scope of the project is being considered. This
solution would, however, have its drawbacks since delay of installation of
part of the works would result in more difficult and costly installation
later on. Recently, the African Development Bank indicated willingness to
consider assisting the Government in financing cost overruns.
Cr No. 304     Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank Project;
US$11.0 million Credit of May 10, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
The credit became effective on October 25, 1972. The funds original-
ly allocated to the industrial portion of the credit have been fully committed
and $1.4 million have been reallocated to the industrial portion from the
agricultural portion which has proceeded more slowly. The report on the agri-
cultural credit study has been completed and is under review.
Cr No. 332      Fifth Highway Project:  US$17.0 million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The credit did not become effective until July 24, 1973 due to
delays in Parliamentary ratification and in the submission to the Association
of the required legal opinions. Delays occurred in receipt of bids because
of extension of the bidding period to allow for sharp price increases conse-
quent to the oil crisis and for Ethiopian taxes and duties imposed at that
time on construction equipment and materials. Four of the six road contracts
are underway and the remaining two have been retendered. For one road, an
Ethiopian contractor submitted the lowest bid, contingent on receiving an
equipment loan. No bid was received for the other road which is now proposed
for construction by force account. Two roads are proposed for inclusion in
the Sixth Highway Project due to cost overruns on all six roads under this
project. Cost increases of about 80% over appraisal estimates are due to
increased cost of fuel, equipment, materials, and freight.
Cr No. 365     Second Livestock Project; US$5.0 million Credit of
April 2, 1973; Closing Date: July 15, 1977.
The credit became effective on August 24, 1973. However, the
construction program has not started and is now one year behind schedule.
A horehole drilling contract has been signed and bids are being evaluated
for the construction of markets, stockroute facilities, slaughter houses and
hi-e sheds.  A review of project costs indicates a 39% cost escalation since
appraisal which will result in the credit being fully disbursed by December
1976 with about half of the development program still to be completed.



ANNEX I I
Page 7
In addition, escalating operating cost estimates coupled with
decreased revenue forecasts indicate possible future cashflow problems and
Project management have been requested to prepare financial and economic
data for review bv RMEA supervision staff. Depending upon the outcome of
this review, consideration will be given to advancing the preparation of
the Phase II Project to 1977 in order to assist in financing the cost overrun
for completing project works. Accounting consultants have started designing
and implementing a new accounting system for the Livestock and Meat Board
(the implementing agency).
Cr No. 416     Agricultural Minimum Package Project; US$21.0 million Credit
of July 5, 1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
The credit became effective on April 15, 1974. Project implementa-
tion has gone well, and has exceeded targets for establishment of minimum
package areas. Participation of tenant farmers has however been lower than
anticipated and is being studied. The increased price of fertilizer poses a
serious threat to the program.   For this year, the Government has obtained
bilateral financing which will assist in the procurement of fertilizer and
make possible a subsidy in the fertilizer price to the small farmers.
Cr No. 417     Third Education Project; US$10.0 million Credit of
July 5, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This credit was declared effective on August 30, 1974, fourteen
months after signing of the Credit Agreement. This long delay was mainly
due to delays in Parliamentary ratification of the credit in the context of
political and students/teachers' agitation over the Education Sector Review's
proposals for educational reform. Even though this was an interim project
and was not related to implementation of the reforms, the Parliament went
through prolonged examination and discussions before ratifying the Credit.
Drafting and signing of an agreement between the Government and the Ethiopian
Orthodox Church were also delayed, but were completed soon after Parlia-
mentarv ratJfication.
The contract between the University and consulting architects and
engineers selected for professional services for the University project com-
ponents is being drafted. Work at technical levels relating to surveys,
design briefs, bidding documents, furniture and equipment lists for the
project is proceeding well. It is expected that project implementation will
prugriss more rapidly now that the credit has been declared effective. The
project unit will be expanded by appointment of additional staff, some of
whom will be financed under the credit.

Cr No. 418     Amibara Irrigation Project:   US$17.0 million Credit of
July 5, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1979.
The credit became effective on August 30, 1974, fourteen months
after signing of the Credit Agreement. The delay in Parliamentary ratifica-
tion of the credit was the main delay, and was caused by disputes relating
to claims on Government land and disagreement in Parliament over the land
allocation pattern proposed in the project and over measures for dealing
with Afar nomads in the project area. Meanwhile project consultants have
estimated a three-to-four times increase in project costs, and questions
have been raised whether the project is still financially feasible and
economically viable. Consultants have prepared alternative proposals, and
an IDA reappraisal mission visited Ethiopia in February 1975 to examine
whether a viable project can be designed and agreed with the Government.
The mission's report is under preparation.
Cr No. 453     Telecommunications V Project (First Tranche); US$21.4 million
Credit of January 17, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, -1979.
This credit became effective on August 23, 1974. The project is
a-,proximately six months behind schedule due to initial delays resulting
fromi labor disturbances in Ethiopia, but progress is now satisfactory.
Cr No. 485     Drought Areas Rehabilitation Project; US$10 million Credit of
June 26, 1974: Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
The project was declared effective on November 7, 1974. Sub-project
preparation is proceeding well.
Cr No. 486     Second Wolamo Agricultural Development Project; US$12 million
Credit of June 26, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The credit is not yet effective; the terminal date for effectiveness
has been postponed from September 24, 1974 to March 31, 1975, and then to
May 15, 1975 due to delays in ratification of Credit Agreement and issuance of
leases to farmers settled under the First Wolamo Project and conclusion of a
subsidiary agreement. The Credit has now been ratified, and leases have been
issued to a majority of the farners.   The subsidiary agreement between the
agricultural and Industrial Development Bank and the Wolamo Farmers' Cooperative
Union is expected to be signed shortly. We are awaiting submission of documents
for the fulfillment of conditions of effectiveness and neceesary legal opinion.
Cr No. 516     Lower Adiabo Development Project; US$9.5 million Credit of
October 18, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
This Credit became effective on February 5, 1975. Work on the
project and transportation into the project area have reportedly been dis-
rupted by the unrest in nearby Eritrea.

Procurement
Arrangements:         All goods financed by the proposed credit would be
procured through international competitive bidding
with the exception of some extension equipment for
existing facilities. This equipment which is
estimated to cost US$0.5 million or about 3% of the
IDA credit, will be procured through negotiation
from the original suppliers.
In order to expedite procurement of equipment
financed by the proposed credit and to allow BTE
to standardize equipment, it was agreed between
IDA and BTE during negotiations of credit 453-ET
that bidding documents for procurement of equipment
through international competitive bidding under
credit 453-ET would cover the requirements of the
whole program; BTE would thus obtain from suppliers
firm proposals for equipment financed by credit
453-ET and options for purchase of equipment to
be financed by the proposed credit. This procedure
eliminates the need for a second round of inter-
national competitive bidding for the part of the
project to be financed by the proposed credit.
Although at present there is no local production
of telecommunications equipment, there is local
manufacture of electrical cables which easily
could be extended to telephone installation
cables and dropwire. Provision is therefore
made for financing of the ex-factory cost of
such equipment if a local manufacturer is awarded
a contract (see Schedule 1, paral(1) of the
proposed Credit). In order to be consistent
in this approach for the Fifth-Telecommunications
Project as a whole, Credit 453-ET is being amended
to permit financing of locally manufactured equip-
ment (see Schedule 1, paragraph 5 of the proposed
Credit Agreement).   To encourage local manufacture,



ANNEX III

a domestic preference of 15% of the customs duties,
whichever is lower, would be granted-for such items,
the estimated cost of which would be less than
US$200,000. Moreover, the abovementioned pre-
ferential treatment of local manufacturers will.
also be made applicable for Credit 453-ET in order
to maintain consistent awarding procedures under
the project (see Schedule 1 para Bo1 of proposed
Project Agreement).
