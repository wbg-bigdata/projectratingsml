F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The DPC, approved on March 4, 2010 aimed to underpin the Government's program, as
articulated in the Strategic Action Plan, to bring about economic recovery while
protecting the vulnerable. The Strategic Action Plan aims to redefine the role of the state
in the economy to achieve upper-middle income status, ensure more equitable access to
services and opportunities, improve service delivery, facilitate economic diversification,
and support better environmental practices to sustain growth and adapt to global climate
change. More specifically, the DPC operation supported reform efforts to address
structural problems which constrained fiscal adjustment (in the areas of public financial
                                                ii
management and public enterprises) and to develop the social protection system so it
would be able to protect the vulnerable.

1.       Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

The Maldives Development Policy Credit (DPC) was designed in 2009, in the context of
enormous challenges but also enormous opportunity. The global economic and financial
crisis had hit the Maldivian economy hard, turning a long-standing fiscal problem into a fiscal
and balance of payments crisis. But, it was also a time of enormous opportunity because the new,
reform-minded government of President Nasheed had recently taken office following the first
multi-party democratic elections in the country’s history. By the time the DPC Project Appraisal
Document was completed, in February 2010, there were already signs that the economy was
recovering.

The adoption of a new constitution in August 2008, paved the way for the country’s first
ever multi-party Presidential and Parliamentary elections. The hotly contested Presidential
election in October 2008 saw the long standing President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom replaced by
Mohammed Nasheed of the Maldives Democratic Party (MDP) in the second round run off.
Nasheed was elected on a program of smaller government and stronger service delivery. The
MDP’sStrategic Action Plan aimed to ensure that government expenditures would be based on
sustainable revenues, and included fiscal consolidation, privatization and public private
partnership (PPP) initiatives.

The new government of President Nasheed inherited long-standing fiscal and external
problems. Government spending had increased in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, and
in the run up to the elections. A large part of the increase in expenditures was the public sector
wage bill, with both the number of public sector employees and their wages increased.1 Fiscal
imbalances were reflected in external imbalances. Imports reached over 90 percent of GDP in
2008 due to accelerating government expenditure, strong demand for resort-related construction
materials and increases in food and fuel prices. As a result, the Current Account Deficit reached
53 percent of GDP in 2008, despite robust growth in tourism – the Maldives’ main industry.

In addition to the macroeconomic problems, there were underlying structural problems –
notably in public financial management and in public enterprises – that made it difficult for
the Government to manage its fiscal affairs. In terms of public financial management, the
problems were three-fold: (i) the budget planning process did not include the multi-year
framework needed for fiscal sustainability; (ii) the in-year financial management system did not
provide the Ministry of Finance the information needed to correct problems as they arose; and
(iii) the public debt portfolio was both risky and high cost. In terms of public enterprises,
contingent liabilities were accumulating due to government guarantees, and reform of the public
enterprise system was constrained by the lack of an institutional framework. Moreover, the
country’s safety net system was poorly targeted and inefficient.

The global financial and economic situation turned the Maldives’ chronic problems into a
crisis, exposing the unsustainable level of fiscal expenditures. The Government’s revenue
base was narrow and volatile, driven mainly by the fortunes of the tourism sector and consisting
largely of tourism receipts, resort lease rentals and import duties. The global economic crisis


1
 Government spending increased from 36 percent of GDP in 2004 to 63 percent in 2008. The total pay package for
public sector employees increased by over 150 percent during this same period and by 2008 the public sector
employees were nearly one-third of the labor force.

                                                        1
resulted in a 9 percent contraction in tourist arrivals and a 23 percent reduction in tourism
revenues during the first nine months of 2009. And, as international markets slowed, the
Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) drew down foreign exchange reserves to cover the current
account deficit.2

The new government of President Nasheed developed its Strategic Action Plan to address
the macroeconomic imbalances and underlying structural problems and protect the poor
during the recovery period. To address the macroeconomic imbalances the government
implemented fiscal austerity measures, including a 15 percent cut in public sector salaries. These
measures were supported by IMF Stand-By Arrangement and Exogenous Shocks Facility
approved in December 2009. To give it the tools needed to responsibly manage its fiscal
obligations, the Government proposed reforms to public financial management systems and
development of mechanisms to address public enterprise issues. Furthermore, aware that the
fiscal austerity measures would result in price increases, the Government also proposed
improvements to the targeting and efficiency of the safety net system in order to cushion the
impact on the vulnerable.

By early 2010, when the DPC Project Appraisal Document was finalized, there were already
initial signs of an economic recovery and evidence that the Government’s fiscal austerity
measures were putting the fiscal deficit on a sustainable path. In addition to the improved
expenditure situation, revenues had picked up in the last quarter of 2009 thanks to increased
tourist arrivals and import duty receipts.

The international community came together to provide budget support and technical advice
to allow the nascent democratic government of President Nasheed the ability to make the
needed changes while protecting the country’s vulnerable. In addition to the IMF program
referred to above, the Asian Development Bank provided an Economic Recovery Program for
USD 35 million, also in December of 2009. Based on our respective mandates, the IMF program
(USD 92.5 million) focused on supporting the aspects of the government’s reform program
related to short-term macroeconomic imbalances,3 while the smaller World Bank program (USD
8.5 million) focused on supporting the aspects of the government’s reform program related to the
structural problems that constrained fiscal adjustment and protection of the vulnerable during the
recovery.

The use of Development Policy Credits was anticipated in the World Bank Country
Assistance Strategy for FY08-12, approved by the Executive Directors in January 2008. The
specific program supported by this DPC is part of Pillar 1: Economic and fiscal governance as
well as Pillar 2: Human development and social protection. 4 The DPC was the first of a two-
operation programmatic series and was processed under the IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast-
Track Facility. The operation also benefitted from an additional SDR 1 million allocation from
IDA’s Crisis Response Window.

The risks involved were assessed jointly by the IMF and World Bank teams and were
articulated in the Project Appraisal Document. These risks included: (i) vulnerability to
external shocks, in particular the possibility of a slow global economic recovery (which could
result in low tourism-related revenue and inadequate access to international financial markets) or

  The IMF approved a 36-month combined Stand-By Arrangement and External Shocks Facility on December 4, 2009.
The program centered on a strong fiscal adjustment to put public finances back on a sustainable medium-term path,
complemented by monetary tightening and measures to strengthen the banking sector.

high commodity prices; (ii) limited technical capacity in government; (iii) political risks
associated with the Maldives’ lack of experience with democracy and the fact that party which
holds the executive does not have a majority in parliament; 5 and (iv) delays in implementation of
the required fiscal adjustment, e.g. due to resistance from civil servants or the broader public.

Despite the risks, the IMF and World Bank proceeded with their respective programs due
to the urgent needs facing the country. The IMF and World Bank teams assessed the
government’s program and determined that, if implemented as planned, it would place the fiscal
deficit on a sustainable path, while protecting the vulnerable during the recovery period.

1.2      Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The DPC, approved on March 4, 2010 aimed to underpin the Government’s program, as
articulated in the Strategic Action Plan, to bring about economic recovery while protecting the
vulnerable. The Strategic Action Plan aims to redefine the role of the state in the economy to
achieve upper-middle income status, ensure more equitable access to services and opportunities,
improve service delivery, facilitate economic diversification, and support better environmental
practices to sustain growth and adapt to global climate change. More specifically, the DPC
operation supported reform efforts to address structural problems which constrained fiscal
adjustment (in the areas of public financial management and public enterprises) and to develop
the social protection system so it would be able to protect the vulnerable.

Public Financial Management Objectives. In the area of Public Financial Management, the
Program Development Objectives was to enhance the Government’s ability to plan and deliver
credible and sustainable budgets through development of tools for expenditure and revenue
projections, budget presentation, in-year reporting and debt management.

Public Enterprise Reform Objectives. In the area of Public Enterprise Reform, the Program
Development Objective was to improve the effectiveness and transparency of public enterprise
oversight and to establish mechanisms for publically beneficial Public Private Partnerships.

Social Protection Objectives. In the area of Social Protection, the Program Development
Objective was to support the Government’s efforts to cushion the impact of rising prices on the
vulnerable and to unify and improve the safety net programs.

Key Outcome Indicators. The Key Outcome Indicators identified in the Project Appraisal
Document are:
   • An economic growth rate of 3 percent in 2010 and 5 percent in 2011
   • Key elements of the Strategic Action Plan have been costed
   • Greater transparency in the presentation of the Government’s annual Budget, and

 Following the Presidential elections in October 2008, Parliamentary elections were held in May 2009. In the
Parliamentary elections, the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (DRP) of former president Gayoom, in coalition with the
People’s Alliance (PA) emerged as the single largest block, holding 35 seats. President Nasheed’s Maldivian
Democratic Party (MDP) obtained only 28 seats in the 77-seat parliament.

1.4       Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The Development Policy Credit sought to address two overarching problems. There were
structural problems (in public financial management and public enterprise reform) that
constrained the new Government’s ability to make fiscal adjustments. And there was no
safety net system that could be used to cushion the impact of fiscal adjustment on the
vulnerable. The World Bank’s Development Policy Credit was designed around those
parts of the Government’s Strategic Action Plan which were specifically intended to
address these overarching problems. In particular:

Public Financial Management. In the area of public financial management, the
Government lacked the tools it needed to plan and deliver credible and sustainable
budgets. Specific problems existed in five areas: accuracy of budget projections, clarity
of budget presentation, cost and riskiness of public debt, sufficiency of in-year reporting
to allow prompt rectification of problems, and inadequate budget oversight.
    • To improve accuracy of budget projections, the DPC supported a committee that
        would make use of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as a policy
        instrument, development of the Public Sector Investment Program, and costing of
        the Strategic Action Plan.
    • To improve clarity and transparency of budget presentation, the DPC supported
        use of standard Government Financial Statistics budget presentation, and
        inclusion of the 3-year MTEF.
    • To reduce the cost and riskiness of public debt, the DPC supported diagnostic
        analysis of debt management, development of a debt management strategy,
        establishment of a committee to manage the debt, reduced reliance on the
        Maldives Monetary Authority for public debt, and use of auctioned T-bills and T-
        bonds.


                                                4
      •   To improve in-year budget reporting, the DPC supported implementation of the
          Public Accounting System, preparation of monthly revenue forecasts,
          development of an up-to date database of public employee compensation, and
          improvement of cash management.
      •   To improve budget oversight, the DPC supported the preparation and publication
          of audited government financial statements, and improved public sector
          accounting.

Public Enterprise Reform. The Government of President Nasheed sought to change the
role of the state in the economy. Two objectives are particularly relevant to the DPC.
Specifically, the Government sought to improve regulation and reduce financial
dependence of public enterprises; and sought to develop a framework through which
Government could contract with the private sector for provision of services.
    • To improve regulation and reduce financial dependence of public enterprises, the
        DPC supported establishment of autonomous regulatory authorities for key
        utilities, preparation of guidelines for Government issued guarantees, and
        increased transparency and restraint in issuance of guarantees.
    • To develop a framework through which Government could contract with the
        private sector for provision of services, the DPC supported preparation of a
        framework for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), preparation of terms of
        reference for the committee which manages PPPs, and establishment of a
        technical unit which could analyze PPP proposals.

Social Protection. In the area of Social Protection, there was no safety net system that
could be used to cushion the impact of fiscal adjustment on the vulnerable. Although
several safety net programs existed, they were small and fragmented. As part of the
reform program, utility tariffs were increased and the Government initiated a temporary
subsidy system, while simultaneously developing a unified and improved social
protection system.
    • To provide a temporary mechanism to protect the vulnerable, the DPC supported
        development of a targeting mechanism for utility subsidies, and an assessment of
        the targeting and fiscal performance of the temporary mechanism.
    • To develop a unified and improved social protection system, the DPC supported
        development of a common database of beneficiaries of existing social protection
        systems, and the development and approval of a unified, well-targeted and fiscally
        sustainable social protection system.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Program Performance

Program Actions. In addition to the four prior actions (which were achieved before project
signing) two other actions (out of total of twenty-three) were achieved before the programmatic
series lapsed:
    • The preparation of a comprehensive diagnostic of debt management operations was
         achieved in October 2009.
    • A debt management committee with representation from the MoFT, the MMA and
         National Planning was established in January 2011. Three meetings were held during
         February and March 2011, though no meetings have been held since then.
Some progress was made on four other actions before the programmatic series lapsed:
    • The Macroeconomic Coordinating Committee was reestablished. However, it was not
         reestablished until after the 2010 budget was presented. And, although regular
         (quarterly) meetings were held in 2010, only one meeting was held in 2011. A new
         committee was established in 2012. No timetable of meetings or outputs has been made
         available to the Bank team.
    • A unit (called the Office for Programs and Projects) was established in March 2010 that
         provides appraisal and implementation monitoring for public investment projects. The
         unit was initially within the MoFT , then moved to the Ministry of Housing. The planned
         Interministerial Committee has not been established.
    • A medium-term debt management strategy document was prepared in 2011. It was
         approved by Cabinet in June 2012 (after the programmatic series lapsed). It has not yet
         been published on the MOFT website.
    • Revised Public Finance regulations (including procurement) were issued in early 2011.
         An assessment of whether or not the regulations adhere to internationally accepted public
         sector accounting standards has not yet been made because the regulations are not yet
         available in English.

Because none of the eight triggers for DPC2 were achieved within the twenty-four month
timeframe, the programmatic series is considered lapsed.

Table 1 provides details about the status of the program actions. The program actions are taken
directly from the Project Appraisal Document’s Policy Matrix. The actions in italics were the
prior actions for DPC1. Triggers for DPC2 are indicated in brackets. All other actions are part of
the program but were identified neither as prior actions for DPC1 nor as triggers for DPC2.

Results Indicators. Two Results Indicators (out of eight) were achieved before the project series
lapsed:
    • Starting from 2009, Government access to the ways and means account at Maldives
         Monetary Authority was limited to use as an overdraft facility not to exceed 100 million
         Ruffia at the end of each month and which must be brought to zero by the end of each
         year. Total credit from Maldives Monetary Authority to the Government has declined
         from 52% of government’s domestic debt in 2008, 43% in 2009, 27% in 2010, 29%
         (estimated) in 2011, and 33% (estimated) in 2012.
    • Domestic debt in the form of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds make up a growing share
         of the government total public debt portfolio. As of the end of 2011, Treasury bills and
         Treasury bonds comprised 54 percent of the central government’s total public debt
         portfolio.
In addition, progress has been made on one other Results Indicator:
    • Treasury bill auctions started in 2009. In 2012 there were 62 Treasury bill auctions with
         31,511 million Ruffia accepted.

Table 2 provides details about the status of the results indicators. The results indicators are taken

Outcome Indicators. Two of the four Outcome Indicators have been achieved. Specifically:
   • GDP growth was over 7 percent in 2010 and 2011, exceeding the outcome indicator
       target of 3 percent for 2010 and 5 percent for 2011.
   • Coverage of the social safety net system has increased dramatically, primarily as a result
       of the introduction of new, very generous programs. Currently, 66% of the population
       receive benefits from the new health insurance scheme and over 70% of the population
       receive benefits from the electricity subsidy scheme. 6
There has been some progress on one of the Outcome Indicators:
    • Presentation of the budget has improved in that it is now available in a 3-year rolling
        framework and in GFS format. There has been no progress, however, on the quality of
        the information in the budget or its usefulness for policy making.

2.2      Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Assessment of Project Design and Soundness of Background Analysis.

Several aspects of the DPC’s design were helpful in implementation. Fist, the fact that the
operation was organized around areas and actions that were part of the Government’s own
program, gave the operation the maximum chance for success. Second, close coordination with
the IMF and ADB ensured complementarity in our operations and allowed the institutions to
collaborate closely during implementation – both in terms of supervision of the operations and
coordination on technical assistance. Third, the design and implementation benefitted from
fitting in well with other parts of the World Bank program. Availability of recent, high quality
analytical work in all three areas was a key factor in the operation’s design. 7 Technical assistance
during DPC implementation was provided through AAA activities and through the Pension and
Social Protection Administration Project, as well as through the ongoing economic dialogue
activity.

On the other hand, and in retrospect, the operation’s design was overly complex and ambitious
for the very limited political and technical capacity of the new and inexperienced Government.
Given the Government’s focus on urgent macroeconomic issues, little attention remained to deal


7
 In particular, the public financial management area was informed by the Bank-Fund PEFA, the Debt management
Performance Assessment and recent technical assistance in the area of public service reform. The public enterprise area
was informed by diagnosis of the public private partnership arrangements. The social protection area built on a World
Bank report Social Protection in the Maldives: Options for Reforming Pensions and Safety Nets. In addition, the
macroeconomic analysis was based on analytical work done in preparation for the World Bank Group/ Government
Country Assistance Strategy Retreat (held in September 2009), the Bank’s periodic macroeconomic monitoring reports
and IMF analysis during the course of joint missions and preparation for their Stand-By Arrangement.
                                                          12
with the structural and social protection issues of the DPC. Furthermore, the Public Accounting
System was more sophisticated to implement than could be handled given the limited technical
capacity available.8

The monitoring and evaluation plan was generally appropriate. However, several of the Outcome
Indicators were problematic. In particular (i) economic growth is too far removed from the DPC
program to be a useful indicator, and (ii) coverage of the safety net is not a good measure of the
appropriateness of the safety net system and may contradict the objective of developing a social
protection system which is efficient and fiscally sustainable.

The Project Appraisal Document accurately assessed the risks, and attempted to mitigate the risks
in several ways. The overall risks were mitigated by dividing the program (and disbursements)
into two DPCs, rather than including the entire program under a single DPC. The external shocks
were mitigated by the IMF and ADB programs which included revenue enhancement measures.
Risks associated with limited capacity were mitigated through project design. Furthermore, the
risks were to be monitored during implementation by participating in the IMF’s quarterly review
missions. Despite these efforts, the bulk of the risk could not be mitigated.

Assessment of Risks and Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

Commitment to the program had been expressed at the highest levels during design of the DPC.
The development objectives, results indicators and planned actions were all part of the
Government’s own reform program. Several meetings were held during preparation in which
President Nasheed himself expressed his commitment. The key interlocutors for the DPC reform
program were the State Minister of Finance and the Deputy Minister of Finance.

By mid-2010, however, several of the risks identified in the Project Appraisal Document
materialized. 9 Most importantly, the Government lacked the political capacity to convince key
stakeholders of the need for reform actions. As a result, the Government’s overall reform
program went off track. This is clearly seen in terms of the macroeconomic program, and
resulted in the IMF program stalling after the First Review in mid-2010. On the expenditure side,
the public sector wage cuts announced by the President in October 2009, were reversed by the
independent Civil Service Commission and Parliament in January 2010. 10 In fact, several new
programs have been introduced in the past two years that have considerably increased
expenditures. These include the Decentralization Bill of July 2010 (expanding the wage bill to
cover the additional layer of government) and the Health Insurance Bill (which introduced an
extremely generous package of health care to the population). On the revenue side, there have
been some successes. The Government and Parliament were able to agree on introduction of a
General Sales Tax, a Tourism GST, and a Business Profits Tax. However, Government and
Parliament have not been able to agree on the Personal Income Tax. The conflict between the

  The Public Accounting System may also be more sophisticated than required for the needs of a country the size of the
Maldives.
9
  In addition to the political and capacity risks discussed above, the external risks identified in the Project Appraisal
Document also materialized in terms of a slow global recovery and high commodity prices. Tourism rebound in 2010
and the resorts successfully diversified to include the Chinese market. Later, however, arrivals fell from both the
European segment and the Chinese segment. High oil prices have continued throughout the period, with a negative
impact on both the Current Account Deficit and the Fiscal Deficit (due to Government subsidies of energy products).
The Current Account Deficit was 19.7% in 2011 and 28.6% in 2012. After declining from 43.1% of GDP in 2009 to
39.6% in 2010, expenditure to GDP went back above 42% in 2011 and 2012.
10
   The Nasheed Government continued to pay the lower salaries throughout 2010. The Supreme Court was asked to
determine if it owed staff arrears for that year. The case was still not resolved when Nasheed left office in February
2012. The transitional Government withdrew the Supreme Court case, with the implication that the Government will
pay the 2010 arrears.
                                                           13
Government and Parliament ultimately led major Cabinet change in July 2011 and the President’s
resignation under pressure in February 2012. The transitional Government under Mohammed
Waheed has not made a formal statement outlining its policy priorities and the changes have led
to a further loss of accumulated expertise.

Although the macroeconomic conflicts were not directly tied to the DPC program, they became
the focus of the Government’s efforts and soured the relationship with parliament such that the
DPC actions were also impacted. Moreover, the Minister of Finance changed three times during
the two years following project signing. Two examples are worth highlighting. First,
implementation of the Public Accounting System was compromised by the high turnover in
technical staff. (The skills acquired during training for the system was highly sought after by the
private sector. As a result, many of the staff quit soon after receiving training.) Second, Ministry
of Finance staff were unable to update the public sector employee database due to lack of
cooperation from the various public agencies. (The largest agency, the Civil Service Commission,
was in a law suit with the Government over the wage reduction.)

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The Project Appraisal Document set out qualitative and quantitative benchmarks and targets for
2010 and 2011, which were to be monitored quarterly in close collaboration with the IMF. For
the most part, these indicators were found to be highly relevant to the team during supervision.
Because most of the indicators related to Government actions, they were easy to verify. In the
area of public enterprise reform, however, the indicator related to government issued guarantees
has been difficult to monitor because the information is not recorded in an accessible fashion.

Eight supervision missions were conducted during the 24 months following project signing. The
team also participated in IMF missions, which allowed data cross-checking.

2.4     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

The programmatic series is off track and the second DPC is not expected to happen. However,
the World Bank continues to provide technical assistance (as part of its AAA work program) in
the areas of revenue forecasting and social protection. An IDF grant to support the Audit General
has been approved and will begin implementation soon. The World Bank is planning an
operation to support development of the public financial management system, including support
for the full implementation of the Public Accounting System.

management system remains weak and unable to support the Government manage its fiscal
affairs. In particular, budget preparation does not include accurate information on future
revenues, program costs, debt service or contingent liabilities; in-year reporting is insufficient to
allow problems to be corrected in a timely fashion; and public debt portfolio remains risky and
high cost. The social protection system remains poorly targeted, inefficient and ad hoc, and
therefore unable to protect the vulnerable in a sustainable manner. The oversight of Public
Enterprises remains ineffective and non-transparent and the mechanisms for Public Private
Partnerships have not yet been established. It should be noted, however, that the new
Government has not yet articulated its view on Public Private Partnerships.

The original DPC design remains largely relevant as well. The actions identified in the Project
Appraisal Document (including both DPC1 and DPC2), would still be considered necessary to
achievement of the Program Development Objectives. However, even where actions were
achieved, they were not sufficient to have the expected impact on the Results Indicators, Outcome
Indicators or PDOs. (See section 3.2, below). Furthermore, as mentioned above, the specific
design of the Public Accounting System may be overly complex for the capacity or needs of the
Maldives.

3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives

As described in section 2.1, the prior actions for DPC1 were achieved and there was some follow
up on several those actions, which can allow for their future use in policy making in the future.
Two additional actions were achieved and progress was made on four others before the
programmatic series lapsed. However, even where actions were completed, lack of follow up has
meant that the actions have not had the expected impact on Project Development Objectives
(PDOs). For example, related to the PDO of improving the accuracy of budgets and budget
implementation:
    • Although 3 year projections are included in budget presentation, these projections are not
       made on the basis of credible analysis and are, therefore of limited use to policy makers;
    • Although phase 2 of the Public Accounting System was implemented, many essential
       modules have not been implemented. As a result, the system cannot be used to compare
       actuals to budget amounts;
    • Although revenue forecasts are made on a monthly basis, the methodology for the
       forecasts has not been assessed.
    • Although a database of civil servants was prepared, it has not been kept up to date, and is
       therefore of limited use.
    • Although the preparation of a comprehensive diagnosis of debt management operations
       was achieved, it has not been of limited use.

Two of the Results Indicators were achieved and progress was made on one other before the
programmatic series lapsed.

Two of the Outcome Indicators were achieved before the programmatic series lapsed.
Specifically, GDP growth rates have exceeded the target rates for 2010 and 2011; and coverage of
the safety net system has increased dramatically. The achievement of GDP growth rate targets is
welcome, although it has only very tenuous links to the DPC program. In retrospect, “increased
                                                 15
coverage of the safety net system? was a poor choice of Outcome Indicator. Increased coverage
was achieved, but at a very high fiscal cost, which significantly detracted from the DPC’s
Program Development Objective of sustainable budgeting.

3.3     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The DPC was appropriately designed to address the structural problems constraining fiscal
adjustment and to protect the vulnerable during the recovery period. These same problems still
exist and are still relevant today.

The DPC’s objectives were not met, however, because several of the risks identified in the
Project Appraisal Document materialized. Most importantly, the Government lacked the political
capacity to convince stakeholders of the need for reforms and the technical capacity to follow
through on the program’s actions.


3.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Although capacity building was not among the objectives of the DPC, several important training
activities were initiated during implementation in order to address constraints that emerged. In
particular, training activities have been conducted on tourism revenue forecasting and safety net
targeting methods.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

The risks identified at the time of appraisal remain the key risks to the Program Development
Objectives going forward. In particular, achievement of the PDOs would require political and
technical capacity within Government. Both of these are limited and likely to remain limited in
the future. In terms of political capacity, no new actions are likely to be taken by the transitional
government, and are therefore likely to be delayed until after the parliamentary elections in 2014.

As described in previous sections, implementation of prior actions continue in several areas (i.e.
presentation of the budget, use of the PAS and revenue forecasting). It is likely that these will
continue and can be built upon in the future. In the case of the civil servant database, although it
was set up, it has not been updated and would need to be completely started from scratch. In the
area of social protection, efforts (identified as part of DPC2) to develop the targeting mechanism
and prepare the database of beneficiaries are ongoing. Slow but steady progress is likely to
continue in the future.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is assessed as marginally satisfactory. There were
several very positive aspects of project design and appraisal. In particular:
    • The Bank team provided timely response to the urgent need of the newly elected
        Government. Total time for project design and appraisal was only 2 months.
    • Despite the short time for design and appraisal, the process was rigorous. The process
        included three joint missions with the IMF team and thorough use of the available
        analytical products, as well as following the normal internal Bank processes. (The DPC
        was processed under the IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast Track Facility.)
    • The DPC design was based on the Government’s own reform program. It was designed
        to complement the already ongoing IMF and ADB programs, with a focus on the areas of
        Bank comparative advantage – structural reforms (in the areas of public financial
        management and public enterprises) and protection of the vulnerable.
    • The Project Appraisal Document realistically assessed the risks to the operation.

In retrospect, a few aspects of project design and appraisal could have been done better. In
particular:
    • The program of reforms was overly ambitious and complex, given the limited political
        capacity (that is, the need for senior leaders to focus on other priorities) and the limited
        technical capacity.
    • Insufficient attention was paid to risk mitigation. For example, it would have been useful
        for the Project Appraisal Document to identify specific means for building or retaining
        capacity.
    • As explained in section 2.2, some of the Key Outcome Indicators were poorly defined
        and had limited linkages to the policy actions supported by the DPC.
.
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

A total of eight supervision missions were conducted during the time of the first tranche
disbursement and the project closure – spanning 24 months. 11 The Bank team had a harmonious
and cordial relationship with the government both at policy level and at the technical level, which
made possible regular exchange of information, especially on monitorable indicators.

In addition to monitoring the Government’s progress on the program actions, supervision
missions were used to identify technical assistance needs which were either handled by the
project team (as in the case of tourism revenue projections) or through separately arranged
training activities (as in the case of safety net targeting methods).




11
 Supervision missions were held May 3-7, 2010; July 27-30, 2010; November 22-25, 2010; February 20-22, 2011,
March 19-22, 2011; May 1-5, 2011; June 18-21, 2011; and September 19-22, 2011.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

A satisfactory rating is justified on the basis of the text in parts (a) and (b) above.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Government commitment to the DPC-supported reforms was initially strong and at the level of
the President. Promptly upon taking office, the President and Cabinet developed an overall
reform program to address the urgent macroeconomic imbalances (supported by the IMF
program) as well as the underlying structural problems (in public financial management and
public enterprises) and to protect the vulnerable during the economic recovery.

However, as described in section 2.2 above, the Government lacked both political and technical
capacity to implement the overall reform program. In terms of fiscal austerity measures, the
Government was unable to convince Parliament to support key proposals. Although the conflicts
with Parliament were not directly tied to the DPC program, they became the focus of Government
efforts, absorbing what little capacity existed. Further, during the DPC implementation period,
staffing changes at both political and technical levels, reduced accumulated knowledge and
expertise on DPC-supported reforms.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Implementing agency was the Ministry of Finance and is discussed in (a) above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

A marginally unsatisfactory rating is justified on the basis of the text in part (a) above.

6.        Lessons Learned

Constraints to political capacity can derail even a non-controversial program of reforms. In the
case of the Maldives, the nascent democracy and inexperienced government had limited political
capacity to convince stakeholders (i.e. Parliament) of the need for difficult reforms. In such cases,
limiting the scope of reforms to only the most urgent and essential may be necessary. Even
where (as in the case of the DPC) the program’s reforms are not politically contentious, the senior
government leaders may have little time to motivate and guide technical staff.

Constraints to technical capacity need to be realistically assessed and addressed. It may be useful
to explicitly build technical assistance into the program. In the case of the DPC, technical
assistance needs were identified during supervision and generally met, though sometimes with a
lag as funding needed to be identified. Explicitly including technical assistance may be useful to
ensure resources are readily available when needed.

It should also be noted that, even if sufficient resources are devoted to technical assistance,
absorptive capacity may be a constraint. In the case of the DPC, frequent changes in staffing (at
all levels) meant that capacity was not retained even where training was provided. In future
operations in similar contexts, it might be helpful to include components that directly address
underlying problems behind retaining qualified staff 12 or to anticipate the need to provide
multiple rounds of training whenever new staff come on board.

The sustainability of outcomes depends largely on further support for reforms. The fact that the
civil service database was set up, but it has not been updated since and doing so would require
starting from scratch, is a good example of how without continuous support for these reforms the
sustainability of the outcomes could be compromised.




12
  In the case of the Maldives, the staff retention issue was tied to poorly managed voluntary retirement program as well
as to the broader civil service compensation program.

Annex 2: Economic Context

The global financial crisis in 2008 exposed the macroeconomic vulnerabilities of the
Maldivian economy. While GDP grew by 12.2 percent in 2008, it declined by 3.6 percent in
2009 (Table-1). 13 General level of inflation has been high leading up to the operation with the
Maldives suffering from global food price hike that preceded the economic crisis. Average CPI
inflation reached 12 percent in 2008 14 before receding thereafter in face of the global crisis.
Maldives has seen its fiscal position deteriorate significantly. Government spending increased in
the immediate aftermath of the 2004 Asian Tsunami, rising further thereafter on areas unrelated
to the Tsunami. The public sector wage bill was a primary source of the increase in recurrent
expenditures, as both the number of public sector employees and their wages increased. The
public sector workforce swelled to nearly one-third of the labor force between 2004 and 2008,
with wages increasing by over 150 percent during this period. The global financial crisis exposed
the unsustainable level of fiscal expenditures. Tourism-related revenues declined with the global
crisis and the fiscal deficit jumped from around 11.2 percent of GDP (including grants) in 2008 to
20.5 percent in 2009.

     These figures are based on the new national accounts series. Maldives rebased its national accounts
     series to reflect the most recent developments in the economy. The new series based on the 2003 prices
     replaced the previous series of 1995 prices. The new series captures the key structural changes in the
     Maldivian economy. For example, new resorts opened recently are mostly targeted at the higher end of
     the market and as such the tourism sector was not adequately represented in the 1995 series. In both
     the series, the contribution of tourism to GDP remains almost same in the year 2003 and by 2010 the
     variation is almost 7 percentage points. The higher contribution to GDP from tourism in the 2003
     results in a higher GDP growth as well.
14
     From around 7 percent in 2007.
                                                                   22
External imbalances mirrored fiscal imbalances. Given the island’s heavy import dependence,
large fiscal deficits quickly translated into balance of payments difficulties, which were
exacerbated by a decline in tourism as global conditions weakened. Accelerating government
expenditure since 2004 played a role in driving up imports to over 87 percent of GDP in 2008.
The multi-year boom in food and fuel prices and strong demand for resort-related construction
materials prior to the onset of the global crisis also contributed to the exceptional import growth
at the time. The pace of import growth far outstripped the robust growth in export of services
(especially tourism) prior to the crisis. Large and growing current account deficit resulted,
reaching 32.4 percent of GDP in 2008. As the currency peg was maintained, reserves at the
Maldives Monetary Authority fell sharply. With the sharp decline in commodity prices in the
first half of 2009 and extensive foreign exchange rationing, pressures on the import bill eased and
the deficit fell to 11.1 percent of GDP in 2009.

Financing the external current account deficit became increasingly difficult. Deficits were
mainly financed through private capital inflows, foreign borrowing by commercial banks and
official financing (multilateral and bilateral) until mid-2008. But since then, private capital
inflows slowed and foreign banks cut credit facilities to domestic branches during the financial
crisis. The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) relied on drawing down foreign exchange
reserves to cover the balance. Gross official reserves were bolstered in mid-March, 2009 with the
disbursement of US$50 million of a US$l00 million loan from the Indian Government. However,
reserves quickly fell back from a peak of US$267 million. Gross reserves fluctuated below 3
months of imports throughout 2009.

Low and declining foreign exchange reserves risked undermining the exchange rate peg.
The rufiyaa had been pegged to the US dollar at a rate of MVR12.8 since 2001. The low reserve
cover meant that the MMA was rationing foreign exchange in the economy. The real effective
exchange rate appreciated 12 percent since mid-2008, but remained below levels reached in 2005.
The depreciation of the US dollar against major international currencies was also helping to
contain real exchange rate appreciation pressures.

Macroeconomic imbalances and the global crisis also stressed the banking system.
Expansionary fiscal policy and high budget deficits led to dramatic public sector credit expansion
in 2008 and the first half of 2009. In the absence of an effective non-bank sector, much of the
domestic financing requirement fell on the banking sector. This public sector credit expansion
was crowding out private sector credit and putting the banks' balance sheets at risk. Foreign
exchange rationing was also exposing banks to dollar liquidity shocks. These stresses were
compounded by the bank's high exposure to tourism, the concentration of loans to a few
borrowers, and limited financing options (e.g., lines of credit, parent financing) since the onset of
the global financial crisis. Consequently, the risk of growing non-performing loans was rising.
The state-owned Bank of Maldives (BML), which accounted for about 40 percent of commercial
bank assets, saw its non-performing-loans ratio increase significantly in 2008. More broadly, the
net foreign asset position of the banking sector had been negative since July 2008, leaving the
banks susceptible to a possible depreciation of the rufiyaa.

The Government of Maldives put together a comprehensive adjustment program in 2009 to
address severe fiscal and external imbalances. This was necessitated as the earlier attempts by
the government to muddle through the crisis fell with the non-materialization of the planned
privatization of the Male International Airport. The budget for 2009 anticipated a very ambitious
US$ 234Mn from the privatization of the airport which was a major means of financing the
deficit for the year 15 . However, with no takers coming forward to take over the airport, the


15
     The privatization proceeds were expected to finance nearly ½ of the total deficit in 2009.
                                                     23
government had no option but to pursue some serious fiscal reforms. A Fund-supported plan,
approved in December 2009, centered on a strong fiscal adjustment to put public finances back on
a sustainable medium-term path, complemented by monetary tightening and measures to
strengthen the banking sector. The authorities took significant initial adjustment measures in the
second half of 2009, including cuts in central government nominal wages by 10-20 percent (see
Box 1, page 13); an increase in electricity tariffs by 40-60 percent 16; reduction in public sector
work force 17 – through a combination of transferring some to corporatized entities 18 and direct
redundancies, the cessation of deficit monetization; and an active monetary policy tightening. The
government was also making headway in introducing an ad-valorem tax on tourism and a broad
based business profits tax 19 (BPT) to augment and strengthen revenues.




16
     Up until that time, electricity tariffs have not been revised since 2004 –despite a significant escalation
     in generation costs – with Maldives almost exclusively dependent on thermal power.

     Which at the time numbered close to 35,000 and a wage bill amounting to nearly 18.7 percent of GDP
18
     Whose staff were outside of the public sector pay-roll

     Till the introduction of the BPT, the only form of Corporate Taxation in the Maldives was the Bank
     Profits Tax – which was paid only by the banks.
                                                      24
Annex 3: World Bank CAS, Other Donor Programs and overarching
Government Program

The World Bank and its private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation jointly prepared
the Maldives Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to support the government’s Strategic Action
Plan (SAP) primarily through policy lending, advisory services, and IFC investments for the
duration of the CAS period. In its SAP, the government identified five priority areas:

    •   Macroeconomic Reform - to bring about macro/fiscal stability and support private
        sector-led economic growth. It entailed reducing the role of the state in the economy - a
        core component of the SAP - and facilitating conditions for growth in tourism and
        fisheries;
    •   Public-sector reform - a key pillar of the structural adjustment program. The public
        sector was being streamlined to make it more efficient and effective in the delivery of
        quality government services;
    •   Good governance - entailed strengthening democratic institutions and processes as a
        priority to ensure that the new democracy is entrenched;
    •   Social development – focuses on developing the human resources of Maldives in order
        to effectively deliver on all social development pledges, and
    •   Climate change and adaptation - an existential threat to the Maldives. The government
        proposed a series of mitigation and adaptation measures that required substantial funding.

The bank operation supported the Government’s efforts to bring about economic recovery
and stability, while protecting the vulnerable. At the same time, it supported the Government
in achieving its development objectives set out in the Strategic Action Plan (SAP). The SAP
redefined the role of the state in the economy to achieve upper-middle income status, ensure more
equitable access to services and opportunities, improve service delivery, facilitate economic
diversification, and support better environmental practices to sustain growth and adapt to global
climate change. Much of the plan was to be implemented through the private sector where
possible or public-private partnerships (PPPs) with the aim to minimizing fiscal impact given the
weak fiscal position. The operation was also consistent with the Maldives Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) FY2008- 12 designed to support government efforts to better manage the
economy and public finances. The CAS called for a possible Development Policy Credit in
FY2010.

At the time of approval, both the IMF and the ADB were moving forward with policy loan
operations aimed at addressing macro-fiscal imbalances in light of the 2008 global financial
crisis. The IMF’s Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) blend
arrangement was approved in December 2009 and supported fiscal measures to restore the
sustainability of the country’s external position. The ESF covered two years of assistance of
amount SDR 8.2 million and the SBA -- a 3-year arrangement of amount SDR 49.2 million. The
IMF justified its involvement on the basis that with the global crisis and ensuing decline in
tourism, investments and other capital flows, Maldives encountered a serious fiscal and BoP
crisis. Thus the Fund program advocated strong fiscal adjustment to contain aggregate demand
and put public finances back on a sustainable medium-term path (complemented by monetary
tightening and measures to strengthen the banking sector). Also approved in December 2009, the
ADB’s Economic Recovery Program (ERP) which aimed to support short term fiscal measures to
curtail expenditures and diversify the revenue base. With a loan and technical assistance package
totaling $39.5 million, the focus was greater on the revenue side, but also looked into
privatization of state-owned enterprises, internal audit and debt management issues. The total
financing from the IMF, World Bank, and ADB was projected at US$81 million for 2009–10.

                                               25
Multilateral financing seemed critical at the time to support adjustment efforts and to meet the
residual balance of payments needs.

These operations, as well as the Bank’s Development Policy Credit, all shared the
underlying objective of bringing public finances on a sustainable path over the medium
term -- but subject to high risk. While the policy actions were complementary across all three
programs, they all identified the possibility of delaying the implementation of the fiscal
adjustment measures a high source of risk. In the IMF’s program document this high risk was
attributed to: “Resistance from civil servants or the broader public, and political opposition
[that] could undermine the very large budget correction as well as the tax reforms that are key to
the program’s success. This risk is heightened by the government’s lack of parliamentary
majority.? Further, in the ADB ERP program document, implementing fiscal measures was
considered under high risk due to: “…the political front, [where] there have been difficulties in
obtaining agreement on policy reforms, particularly on fiscal management and, specifically,
expenditure cutbacks.? In particular, the ADB identified as a Major risk? the: “Inability of the
Government to deepen civil service reforms (to trim the wage bill).?

Annex 4: Performance of the Government’s Overall Macroeconomic Reform
Program

The economy rebounded strongly in 2010, driven by recovery in tourism, but slowed again
subsequently. According to the Government’s revised numbers, real GDP growth is estimated to
have been 7.1 percent in 2010. With recovery in the global economy, tourism picked up which
fueled a strong recovery in economic activity. Growth in 2011 fell slightly – but to a still robust 7
percent, resulting from sustained tourism sector growth. With the growing significance of tourist
arrivals from China, Maldives tourism experienced fewer seasonal fluctuations as Chinese
arrivals began filling the gap left during the European summer season20. However, with the onset
of the most recent global slowdown in wake of the European debt crisis, arrivals from both
segments slowed down in 2012. The political crisis in February and the resulting unrest also had
an impact on tourism particularly in wake of the adverse travel advisories. This was particularly
evident in the Chinese segment 21. Consequently the economy slowed to an estimated 3.5 percent
growth. While overall tourism disappointed, construction, fishing, and fisheries related
manufacturing performed well.

Inflation has remained high since 2009. Driven by international commodity prices as well as
local fish prices, inflation increased from 4.5 percent (period average) to 6.2 percent in 2010 and
jumped to 11.3 percent in 2012. Inflation was elevated on account of not just high commodity
prices but also currency devaluation and tax increases. Maldives’ currency peg has historically
kept it from significant inflation problems. The April 2011 devaluation was passed through to
domestic prices almost fully. While the devaluation effect was no longer in play in 2012, the
introduction of the general goods and services tax in October 2011 and a rate increase in January
2012, together with high commodity prices, kept headline inflation high. As these one-off effects
disappear, inflation is expected to stabilize.

Although reserves held up better than expected, external imbalances remained. The
economic recovery and higher commodity prices pushed up imports, offsetting the tourism
rebound. After declining to 9.7 percent of GDP in 2010, the current account deficit increased to
19.7 percent in 2011 and further to an estimated 28.6 percent in 2012. The large current account
deficit appears to reflect loose fiscal policy more than exogenously overheated private sector.
Government spending has direct import content, but the indirect channels such as consumption of
imports by public servants or reduction in private sector’s capacity to consume and import due to
higher taxes seem to be more important. There is little evidence that the private sector has been
overheating.

The MMA continued to ration the supply of foreign exchange to banks, while fully meeting
the demand from the central government and some SOEs. The overall BOP deficit exceeded
$260 million in 2012, but reserves fell by much less as the parallel market met some dollar
demand at a modest premium of around 10 percent. A 20 percent devaluation in April 2011,
accompanied by monetary tightening, helped stave off problems but did not provide a lasting
solution. An anticipated $25 million budget support from India was never received and the State
Bank of India did not roll over its $50 million government bond that fell due in December, 2012.



20
     The European segment – taken as one block is still the largest source market for Maldives Tourism
     accounting for just over 52 percent of arrivals. Arrivals from China account to about 25 percent of total
     – being the largest single source market.
21
     In 2012, the growth in the European segment was a negative 3.7 percent (compared to a growth of 6.4
     percent in 2011. In comparison, arrivals from China slowed to 15.6 percent growth compared to 67
     percent growth recorded in 2011.
                                                     27
The real effective exchange rate has continued to move with the US dollar, and has appreciated
since mid-2008.

Progress on tax reforms was laudable. There were a number of tax reforms introduced by the
then government. On the taxation side, the government introduced: (i) GST on tourism (TGST)
(ii) a Business Profits Tax (BPT) (iii) a general GST (GGST). On non-tax, the key measure was
the replacement of the existing resort lease system with the land rent. All of the measures
however, were delayed in varying degrees -- with the longest delay encountered on account of the
BPT. The TGST was passed by the Majlis in August 2010 and made law in September. It came
into effect in January, 2011. The second amendment to the Tourism Act which changed the resort
rent system was also passed in August 2010. The BPT was finally passed in December 2010
(after a delay of almost a year), but came into effect only in July 2011. The GGST law was
passed in August 2011 and was implemented quickly from October 2011. The only tax law yet to
be ratified is the income tax law which has been languishing in the Majlis now close to 2 years.

                   Box 1: GoM – Wage and Salaries Reduction – October 2009

      The wage cuts came into effect from October 2009. Initially, all categories of the public sector
      which in the case of Maldives comprises of the Civil Service (the largest component); the
      political appointees; the staff of the independent commissions and the armed forces were forced
      into taking salary cuts ranging from 10-20 percent.

      However, at the passage of the 2010 budget the Majlis restored salaries of the independent
      commissions (from January 2010) which the government had to adhere. Then independently, the
      Civil Services Commission (CSC) of Maldives also determined (in December 2009) that all Civil
      Services salaries should be reversed starting January 2010 based on apparent agreement they
      struck with Finance Ministry earlier that if projected revenues exceed Rfy 7 billion then salaries
      will have to be restored. However, in the budget for 2010, the Ministry did in fact show revenues
      in excess of Rfy 7 billion. The Ministry then argued that the agreement stipulated “when revenue
      exceeded 7 billion? implying when its actually met and that salaries cannot be revised based on
      budget expectations. The CSC took the government to court on this and in mid-2010 the Civil
      court of Maldives ruled in favor of the CSC. The government then appealed the verdict to the
      Supreme Court and this case dragged on.

      In the meantime, for the entirety of 2010 the government paid lower salary scales to the public
      sector (except the independent commissions). At the time of the 2011 budget, the government
      was firmly above the Rfy 7 billion revenue levels which compelled them to revert salaries back to
      the original (precut) scales from 2011. This was done for the entire (remaining) public sector.
      However, one outstanding issue remained--the salary arrears for 2010. The Supreme Court was
      yet to take a decision on the status of 2010 salaries. Then in February 2012 the government
      changed. The new government which came to power withdrew the Supreme Court case,
      effectively bringing upon itself to pay the salary arrears. They agreed with the CSC to pay this off
      in stages from July 2012 to June 2013. The amounts involved are Rfy 446 million.




However, despite the revenue efforts there had been significant fiscal slippages and slow
consolidation. The authorities presented the FY2010-12 budget in late December, projecting a
fiscal deficit of 17.8 percent of GDP in 2010, 4.1 percent in 2011 and a near-balanced budget in
2012. The fiscal deficit is estimated to have fallen to 15.6 percent of GDP in 2010, from 20.5




                                                   28
percent in 2009 22. However, the IMF program was delayed for almost a year because expenditure
restraint had been less than programmed and the outlook for fiscal consolidation remained weak
after the delivery of the 2011 budget. Fiscal deficit narrowed further to 11.3 percent of GDP in
2011. A much improved revenue turnout largely supported by the new tax measures helped the
fiscal position. However, overall fiscal policy has continued to remain loose. The 2012 deficit is
likely to have exceeded the 9 percent of GDP budget target, to reach around 13.5 percent of GDP
in cash terms. It could be higher if unpaid bills are accounted for 23. The financing climate has
been tight, with weak Treasury bills subscriptions and the government accumulating arrears (3
percent of GDP 24). The 2013 budget adopts important adjustment measures, including increasing
TGST by 12 percent 25, broadening GGST base slightly16, and increasing the airport departure
charge. However, while the budget shows a decline in deficit, it is most likely to stay flat or even
rise if arrears clearance is accounted for.

Austerity in public expenditures could not be sustained. After declining from 43.1 percent of
GDP in 2009 to 39.6 percent in 2010, the expenditure to GDP ratio increased back to 42.3 percent
of GDP in 2011 and remained at this level in 2012. The salary cuts were almost immediately
reversed by the country’s civil services commission starting from 2010. Other slippages occurred
as well, such as delays in the implementation of key tax reforms and lack of progress on public
employment restructuring. Total recurrent expenditure recorded a 20.7 percent growth in 2011.
The full restoration of public sector salaries (to its pre-crisis levels in November 2009) increased
the total remuneration bill by 8.8 percent. The net effect of a much publicized Voluntary
Retirement Scheme (VRS) announced in mid-2011was minimal and overall cost savings from the
scheme amounted to less than 1 percent of GDP (see Box-2 for more details). The scheme
induced the exit of around 1,300 public sector staff with the concurrent abolishing of the posts.
However, around 300 posts remained un-abolished given the nature of the job. Fresh recruitments
were made for these posts. Government interest bill increased by 7.9 percent – on back of rising
treasury yield -- while total capital expenditure rose 46.7 percent in 2011 with the commissioning
of a number of land reclamation and housing projects.

There was no net fiscal savings from public sector restructuring. Wage cuts evoked stiff
resistance from vested interests. The wage cuts came into effect from October 2009. Initially, all
categories of the public sector which in the case of Maldives comprises of the Civil Service (the
largest component); the political appointees; largest component); the staff of the independent
commissions; and the armed forces were forced into taking salary cuts ranging from 10-20
percent. Wages were restored to their September 2009 levels from January 2011. The political
economy behind this reversal is detailed in Box-1. The new Decentralization and Disability Bills
lead to considerable spending increases. The Decentralization Bill passed by the House in July
2010 resulted in an additional layer of government, incurring additional expenditure. The law
established about 800 new island and atoll councilors with administrative and executive
responsibilities forming part of the broader public service. Earlier, it was estimated that the new
structure will cost the government an additional Rfy 173 million in expenditure. However, this
figure is likely to have been higher. The cost of the disability act was around 0.7 percent of GDP.
There were other policy developments, including health insurance and electricity subsidies that
had negative effects on fiscal adjustment. These developments essentially were driven by the will


22
     Difficulties in producing reliable expenditure and revenue data in the Ministry of Treasury and Finance
     (MoTF) suggest that this figure may be an underestimate of the real outcome.
23
     Significant cost overruns in the newly introduced Aasandha scheme and the electricity subsidies
     largely financed through the build-up of arrears in face of a serious cash flow shortage underlined the
     fiscal situation in 2012.
24
     Which is a conservative estimate.
25
     See discussion in the following paragraph.
                                                    29
of the Majlis. In late 2010, the Majlis also passed an amendment to the Public Finance Act,
mandating the government to seek its concurrence in all financial transactions of the government
– in government borrowings, sale of assets and other financing means. 26 This had the effect of
effectively crippling the government in its funding activities. In each of these events, bitter
political rivalry underlined the passage of bills.

Rightsizing the public sector proved to be very difficult. At the time of the DPC the
government was contemplating two actions in relation to right sizing the public sector: (i)
transferring some public servants to the newly formed corporatized entities (with expectations
that these entities will be able to fund salaries from their own income) and (ii) outright
redundancies which were not well thought through. While the transfer of employees to
corporatized entities did make some progress, the planned (direct) redundancies did not
materialize to any significant extent. On the former, even though associated public sector workers
were transferred to the corporatized entities, they remained indirectly within the payroll of the
government (through budgetary transfers) as these entities (who remained as government owned
entities) did not generate sufficient revenues from their activities. A broad based voluntary
retirement scheme (VRS) for the public sector in 2011 cost the government roughly Rfy 250
million but resulted in insubstantial cost reduction subsequently. The reason for this was that for
some of the redundancies, the government had to hire back (for example teachers) for service
delivery considerations making the redundancy rather irrelevant. Also while people left the public
sector through VRS they entered back through increased recruitment to local government bodies.
The overall cost savings from the scheme was less than 1 percent of GDP. The scheme also
resulted in some good public servants (in effect irreplaceable) leaving the public sector making
use of the generous package. This undermined the quality of the public service in the country (see
Box 2).

                         Box 2. Voluntary Retirement Scheme of GoM Mid 2011

     The Government of Maldives (GoM) introduced a voluntary retirement scheme for
     Government staff in mid-2011. The VRS offered the following four options for staff in
     government service to leave the service:
     • Option 1: Leave the service without any cash benefits.

     •     Option 2: Leave the service with a lump sum payment of Rfs 150,000.

     • Option 3: Leave the service with a lump sum payment of Rfs 150,000, and priority for
     the Government implemented SME loan scheme. This was only open to staff between ages
     18-50 years who meet the criterion for getting the SME loan.

     • Option 4: Leave the service with a lump sum payment of Rfs 200,000, and a priority for
     selection in Government scholarship programs. This was only open to staffs between 18 and
     40 years, who meet the criterion for getting the scholarship to study.

     There are two important features of the scheme. (i) Once a staff accepts the VRS package,
     he/she is not allowed to enter Government service (including public enterprises) for three
     years. (ii) Once a staff leaves Government service, his position is abolished. This is sought
     to be achieved by requiring the Permanent Secretary to reorganize the work of the vacated
     post within the functional area.

     The majority of applicants for the VRS scheme opted for option 4 exhausting the funds quite
     rapidly. Further despite provision (ii) above, in some of the posts vacated the government had to
     recruit back on service delivery considerations.




Lack of political plurality undermined the timing of fiscal adjustment. On the taxation front,
it was clear that there will be strong resistance to increased taxes given the considerable influence
wielded by the resort owners and the corporate sector on the country’s Majlis. Further, the public
sector downsizing and wage reductions were politically unpalatable. Soon after the
implementation of salary reductions, its sustainability came under increased pressure (Box 1).
However, notwithstanding the pressure the government at the time remained steadfastly
committed to the implementation of the reforms agenda. The relevant tax bills for the
introduction of new taxes were developed fairly quickly and presented to the Majlis at the earliest
opportunity. The government fought hard the CSC determination in late 2009 to reverse public
sector wage reduction – appealing against the decision first to the High Court of Maldives and
then to the Supreme Court. All these actions demonstrated a strong will on part of the government
to adhere to fiscal discipline and bring about stabilization of the untenable fiscal situation. Such
circumstances led to the disbursement of budget support facilities from both the ADB and the
WB – with the IMF program providing an overall framework for macro fiscal adjustment going
into the medium term.

From mid-2010, after the first programmatic disbursement from the Bank 27 several of the
risk factors began to materialize together with increased signs of government wilting under
pressure. On revenue measures, and as expected, there were delays in passing the relevant
legislation. However, much of the anticipated revenue measures ended up being passed by the

         As well as the ADB who disbursed its first tranche a few months after the bank in June.

House eventually. The Tourism GST 28 was passed by the House in August 2010, and the tax
came into effect in January 2011. The BPT was passed in December 2010 and was made effective
from July 2011. The government also brought in a General GST – introducing a core form of
taxation on the domestic sector for the very first time. Legislation in this regard was prepared
fairly quickly -- during 2Q/3Q 2010 and passed by the House in December 2010. All these
measures resulted in establishing a very strong tax backbone in the country. The passage of the
taxation bills was done in a backdrop of government being able to muster sufficient support in the
Majlis with the help of some cross-overs as well as garnering support from some independent
MP’s.

The Fund recommended expediting completion of the PEFA assessment recommendations,
including on budget execution and expenditure control and managing fiscal risks; migrating
foreign-financed expenditure data to the public accounts system; improving budget preparation
and planning (including cost benefit analyses for domestically-financed capital expenditures);
moving to medium-term budgeting; and adopting a fiscal responsibility framework, in line with
the recommendations of FAD TA. In addition, the Fund recommended generating monthly fiscal
outturn reports and creating a policy unit at the Ministry of Finance and Treasury charged with
monitoring fiscal developments and analyzing the impact of alternative fiscal policies. The timing
and magnitude of structural fiscal reforms were affected by political realities, including the local
government elections in February 2011 and the government’s lack of an outright parliamentary
majority.

Continued policy slippages and the lack of timely monitoring and reporting of fiscal data
hindered fiscal adjustment efforts. The basic problem was in relation to implementation of the
PAS. What has been achieved thus far under the PAS is a mere automation of a manual process
with no accompanying business process re-organization or re-engineering. In effect the system
has become messier than before; now for example a spending unit cannot figure out what their
cumulative expenditure is relative to the budget with the result that these spending units can keep
passing expenditures without knowing the cumulative. These only get caught in much delayed
internal audit process. To circumvent the issue most spending agencies maintain parallel EXCEL
sheets to track the cumulative. The situation is also partly responsible for the buildup of huge
arrears payments in the system (estimated at anywhere between 3-6 percent of GDP). The reason
is spending agencies approve payments and send to treasury for payments but treasury not having
cash to pay.

Borrower’s Statement

The program was designed at a time when the country was facing severe macroeconomic
imbalances and close collaboration and efforts by the Bank and the government team
resulted in readiness of the project towards appraisal in December 2009, followed
immediately by negotiations.

The program had set out ambitious targets for reforms leading to economic recovery,
despite the risks identified by both the Bank and the IMF. The program was well
designed with clear objectives, appropriately targeted towards addressing the constraints
facing the government. Though the key outputs were not fully achieved, the operation
had led to reform and improvements in areas including budget presentation, cash and debt
management practices. Dialogue continued with concerned departments of the Bank with
frequent missions focusing on technical assistance, capacity building programs and
studies/consultations. Bank’s continued presence had helped keep the momentum which
could otherwise have lapsed easily given challenging political and economic situation.

Lack of close coordination among the ministry’s divisions is seen as a failure on the part
of the Borrower. Efforts have however been made by the staff to overcome weaknesses
with the support of the Bank teams and missions. High staff turnover and the
replacement of almost all key political heads in the Ministry affected the performance of
the Borrower.

The Public Financial Reforms and social protection reforms are being continued with
assistance of the World Bank without being deviated significantly from the original
envisaged plans. A comprehensive plan to address the organisational challenges facing
MoFT is being developed with assistance from multilateral aid agencies.
