                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The COOPERAR II project would support the efforts of the Government of Paraiba to reduce the incidence of rural poverty by: (a) improving access to small-scale
                         socioeconomic infrastructure and services; (b) raising incomes and capital assets through investments in productive activities and facilitating linkages between small
                         producers and national and international markets; and (c) strengthening the capacity of Municipal Councils (MC) and Community Associations (CA) to raise funding and
                         harmonize policies and institutional arrangements for delivery of public investments intended to benefit the rural poor. COOPERAR II is a Repeater ooperation, using the
                         highly participatory, community-driven development approach which was piloted and proven successful under the recently-completed COOPERAR I project.

                         To date, the project has financed a total of 400 matching grants requested by rural community associations, which in turn will use these funds for small-scale local infrastructure to
                         benefit approximately 24,000 families in the project area. By end-February 2013, the project is expected to finance an estimated 500 such matching grants (20% of which would be
                         for income-generating opportunities).
