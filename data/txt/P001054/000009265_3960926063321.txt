MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 15.1 MILLION (US$19.7 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A HEALTH SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Guinea
for SDR 15.1 million (US$19.7 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and would help finance a
health services development project.
.
2.        Background.  Easily treatable or preventable diseases, combined
with malnutrition, poor sanitation, and ltnsafe water, contribute to the poor
health status in Guinea. Infant and child mortality rates at 174 per 1000
and 44 per 1000, respectively, are very high. Maternal mortality is also
high: nearly 800 out of 100,000 pregnancies result in the death of the
mother. Life expectancy at birth is only 38 years. With a total fertility
rate of 6.0 and a crude birth rate of 47 per thousand, fertility is high,
comparable to the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the annual rate
of population growth is moderate at 2.4 percent, it will accelerate in the
future with expected mortality declines and will pose a serious threat to
socio-economic development.
3.        The performance of the Guinean health system has been constrained
by a lack of financial resources, weak planning and management, inadequately
trained personnel, and the absence- of an adequate drug program. As a
consequence, facilities and equipment have deteriorated, drugs are scarce,
the quality of health services is limited, and the population lacks
confidence in the system.
4.        The Government has begun to implement a health care policy that
emphasizes health promotion, disease prevention, and the provision of basic
health care services to mother' and children and to the rural population.
In line with this policy, the Government has recently taken a number of
steps to address major sectoral constraints. To improve sector efficiency,
it merged the former Ministries of Health and Social Affairs into the
present Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MSAS). It has also started
to decentralize management and decision-making responsibilities to the
regional and prefectoral levels. It has undertaken an inventory of
personnel to evaluate skills, assess training needs and improve the
allocation of staff resources. It is making efforts to mobilize additional
financial resources by improving cost recovery at the hospital level and
introducing cost recovery in health centers. It is introducing family
planning services in secondary towns and rural areas. Finally, it is
encouraging the establishment of private medical practice and private
pharmacies.

5.        Project ObJectives.  The proposed project is an integral part of
the Government's new health care program. It will help to: (a) develop
planning and management capabilities within the MSAS and introduce policy
and administrative reforms to improve the quality and efficiency of basic
health services, including family planning; (b) improve basic health care
and strengthen financial and operational management of health services in
the region of Middle Guinea; and (c) develop, introduce and evaluate cost
recovery mechanisms.
6.        Project Description.  The project includes a health sector
management component at the national level and a regional health services
component for Middle Guinea. At the national level, the project will
improve the capacity of MSAS in planning, management, and staff training.
It will also strengthen central level MSAS capability in the key technical
areas of maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition, and health
education. At the regional level, the project will improve the quality of
priority health services in five prefectures in tie region of Middle Guinea
by: (a) strengthening the management of regional health services; (b)
strengthening basic health services in 5 prefectoral hospitals, 5 urban
health centers, and 12 rural health centers with particular emphasis on
improving the delivery of priority services in maternal and child health and
family planning, nutrition, and health education, inr luding support for a
small number of innovative community health activities; and (c) improving
and expanding cost recovery, including improved mechanisms for financial
management and control. To accomplish these tasks, the project will provide
technical assistance, training, equipment, materials, drugs, civil works,
and finance incremental non-salary operating costs on a declining basis.
7.        Project Cost and Financing Plan.  The project would be carried out
over five years. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$22.5
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$11.8 million
(52%). IDA would finance US$19.7 million equivalent, the Government of
Guinea US$2.0 million equivalent and the beneficiaries US$0.8 million
equivalent. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, a disbursement plan end an
estimated schedule of disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events is shown in Schedule C. Two maps are also
attached, along with the Staff Appraisal Report No. 6679, dated May 22,
1987.
8.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project supports the
Association's efforts to help Guinea improve the efficiency of existing
infrastructure and mobilizing additional domestic resources. It will also
raise the quality of Guinea's human resources, which is essential to
improving Guinea's long-term development prospects. While donor support in
the sector has increased in recent years, it has often been uncoordinated,
narrowly focussed on projects, and oriented toward low priority investments.
IDA assistance is expected to improve overall management of the sector and
aid coordination, and to focus investments on the highest priority policy
reforms and service improvements.

9.        Agreed Actions.  Prior to effectiveness, Government would: (a)
staff the newly reorganized units within MSAS that are being strengthened
under the project with personnel that is essential to project start-up; (b)
develop and put in place simple financial management and control systems for
the hospitals and health centers to be renovated under the project to permit
proper management of financial resources and submit to IDA the arret6 signed
by the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Minister of Health and Social
Affairs authorizing the retention and management by those health facilities
of resources collected through cost recovery; (c) open a local project
account and deposit an initial amount of GNF 86 million (US$210,000
equivalent) into it; and (d) establish a suitable project accounting system.
During the execution of the project, the Government would: (a) review
annually with IDA, each year by September 30, its three-year rolling sector
investment program, with special attention to new projects, recurrent costs
and the allocation of the recurrent budget, and organize annually, by
November 30 at the latest, a meeting of all aid donors participating in the
health sector; (b) submit to IDA by March 31, 1988, a national drug policy
and a plan of action for its execution, and then review annually the
appropriateness of the policy and progress in its implementation; (c) open
and maintain an account for deposit of cost recovery proceeds to be used for
the purchase of essential drugs and for the progressive financing of non-
salary operating costs; (d) submit to IDA each year by September 30 an
annual plan for deployment and in-service training for MSAS medical and non-
medical personnel, and an annual evaluation of cost recovery experiences and
proposals for further implementation of cost recovery practices; (e) begin
to implement cost recovery in project-assisted facilities as soon as they
receive their initial stock of drugs; and (f) submit to IDA by June 30, 1988
an action plan for the extension of cost recovery to other health facilities
in Middle Guinea. Disbursement of funds for innovative activities being
assisted under the project would be conditional upon IDA approval of an
annual plan for those a'.tivities. Disbursement of funds for drugs will be
conditional upon the opening of an account for deposit of cost recovery
proceeds.
10.       Justification and Benefits.  The project will help the Government
to establish a permanent capability for improved health sector planning,
policy implementation, and coordination of external assistance. The project
will also improve the quality and coverage of basic health services in the
region of Middle Guinea for about 1.3 million people. The establishment of
regular programe of in-service training and supervision of medical and
paramedical personnel will upgrade the skills of personnel and improve the
overall quality of services. Strengthening of maternal and child health,
nutrition, and health education and promoting and extending family planning
services should reduce morbidity and mortality among women and children. If
successful, the project would provide a model for improved delivery of
primary health care, including family planning, and the mobilization of
additional financial resources through cost recovery.

11.       Disks.  Because the reorganization of the MSAS is only at an early
stage, there are risks of delays in project implementation. However, the
timely completion of project preparation and the creation of the Technical
Coordinating Committee (CTC) within MSAS to oversee project implementation
and sector reforms have demonstrated Government's commitment to the project
and the competence of thp project management unit, which coordinated project
preparation. Technical assistance, training, and the decentralization of
sector management would further minimize the risk of delays. Another risk
is that the cost recovery program might depress demand for services. To
minimize this risk, reasonable targets for cost recovery have been set and
these would be reviewed annually. The mechanisms for financial management
and control of revenues collected from user charges would be amended in the
light of experience before extending cost recovery nationwide. Moreover,
cost recovery would initially be limited to curative services, for which the
population has already demonstrated its willingness to pay. The project
will also strengthen the management and control of financial resources in
each facility thereby ensuring a continuous monitoring of cost recovery
prior to its extension nationwide.
2.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
