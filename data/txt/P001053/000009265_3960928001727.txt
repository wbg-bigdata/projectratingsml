MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A FORESTRY AND FISHERIES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to the
Republic of Guinea for US$8.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and
would assist in financing a project to strengthen national forestry and fisheries
services.
2.    Background.  Although once densely forested, Guinea has today a forestry
cover of only 4Z of its area.   Less than 2Z has commercial value although
adequate wood stocks remain in degraded forest, bush and mangroves. Forestry
accounts for about 7Z of GDP. Demand for wood is strong and concentrated in
the coastal zone as is the demand for farm land. As a result, there is heavy
localized environmental deterioration, particularly in major watersheds. Guinea
is also well endowed with marine fisheries resources, but the sector contributes
only IU to Guinea's GNP, provides annually about 7 kg of fish per capita and
generates little budgetary support.   Because of inadequate management of
fisheries licensing, remaining stocks are being rapidly depleted.
3.    Guinean authorities have begun to recognize that the natural resource base
of the country is being over-exploited. It has, for example, launched an intense
program to develop an Environmental Action Plan in which several donors,
including IDA, are actively participating.   While adequate strategies and
corrective action plans are being prepared, Guinean institutions are far from
adequate to execute them. Institutional development has thus been given high
priority, along with urgent actions to introduce rational resource management
practices.
4.    Proiect Obiective.   The project's  objective  is to establish  sound
institutions for managing forestry and fisheries, as well as to launch priority
operations. In the case of forestry, the project would strengthen the National
Forestry Department within the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources and
several regional forest departments so that they progressively become more
effective and begin needed forestry management work. In the case of fisheries,
the project would reinforce the State Secretariat for Fisheries in the
monitoring, control and surveillance of fishing fleets, to increase the sector's
economic contribution and to preserve fish stocks.
5.    Project Description.  The project's forestry components would (a) improve
the mobility, funding, training, and technical capacity of the national and
several subordinate prefecture-level forestry departments; (b) prepare and



execute programs for protecting and managing about 300,000 hectares of forest
reserves in ecologically sensitive areas, which would be supported with a pilot
operation to establish and record farmers' land rights around the areas to be
protected; and (c) provide support to upgrade the skills of about 80 forest
engineers.   Its fisheries component would (a) improve the operations of the
State Secretariat for Fisheries through specialized Assistance and material
support in investment planning, fisheries licensing, revenue collection, and
fisheries research; and (b) launch an operation to monitor and control fishing
in the Exclusive Economic Zone, conforming to the Fisheries Code.
6.    The project would be executed over a four-year period.   The forestry
components would be managed by the National Forestry Department, headquartered
in Conakry, which would rehabilitate the Forestry Center at Seredou, in the
forest zone, tn supervise forestry work. Training would-be conducted in the
existing Forestry Faculty located at Faranah. The fisheries components would
be executed by the State Secretariat for Fisheries, Conakry, with research
conducted through the existing Fisheries Research Center at Boussoura.
7.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.   IDA's participation in the project is
consistent with its concern for promoting action to protect the environment and
for ensuring sound management of renewable natural resources.   It is also
consistent with the policy of strengthening public institutions when in the
public interest, improving fiscal performance, and mobilizing donor assistance.
8.    Agreed Actions.  The project's objectives and design have been agreed, and
no unusual project conditionality is being recommended.   The standard legal
conditions of credit effectiveness would apply. For the forestry activities,
disbursement would be conditional upon (a) all conditions of cross-effectiveness
being met; (b) signature of technical assistance contracts; (c) modification of
a number of legal texts covering the project's executing agencies; and (d) a
Project Account being opened and an initial deposit of US$136,000 equivalent
made by the Government.   For the land rights pilot operation, disbursements
would be conditional upon the opening by the Government of a Project Account and
an initial deposit of US$17,000 equivalent. For the fisheries component,
disbursement would be conditional upon (a) all conditions of cross-effectiveness
being met; (b) approval by the Government of a new Fisheries Code; (c) adoption
of a satisfactory fishing plan which would specify the level of fishing to be
authorized and the regulations governing licencing; (d) adopticn of a revised
structure for the State Secretariat for Fisheries; (e) conclusion of subsidiary
agreements for the provision of sea transport and air services necessary for the
surveillance of the Exclusive Economic Zone; and (f) a Project Account being
opened, and an initial deposit of US$211,000 equivalent made by the Government.
9.    Benefits and Risks.   Tangible benefits within the project period are
expected in terms of (a) increased wood and fish supplies for local consumption
and, eventually, exports; and (b) increased state revenues and improved levels
of land use security. In the loager term, the project would assist Guinea to
apply more coherent environmental policies and programs through improved
institutions. There do not appear to be major technical risks to the project.
Risks are greatest in the area of stabilizing land use around the managed natural



- 3 -
forests and a pilot approach is being adopted. The risk also exists that staff
may not perform as expected, which demands additional training and improved
personnel management.   A number of vested interests remain in the present
fisheries management system, which may interfere with the project's operations.
However, the new legal framework, ir vell applied, will help manage this risk.
Nonetheless, the situation will require close supervision.
10.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
