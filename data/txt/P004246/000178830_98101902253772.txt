FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO MALAYSIA
FOR THE KUALA LUMPUR SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Malaysia for the equivalent of USS21.5 million to help finanee a sewerage
project for the City of Kuala Lumpur. The loan will have a term of 21 years,
including a grace period of 6 years, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
The proceeds of the loan will be relent to the City of Kuala Lumpur on the
same termso
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report (No. 653-MA) was circulated to the
Executive Directors in March 1975.  The population of Malaysia in 1974
was about 12 million, growing at a rate of 2.7 percent per annum. Detailed
country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        With a per capita GNP of US$490 (1973), Malaysia is one of the
most prosperous developing countries in Southeast Asia.   The economy has
maintained fairly high rates of real growth, with the GNP growing at an
average of about 6 percent a year during the last decade.   However, GNP
real growth was only abotit 1 percent in 1975 as a result of the world
depression and falling commodity prices.   Because of changes in the terms
of trade, real national Lncome growth slowed down even more or became nega-
tive in 1975 after having achieved 6 percent in 1974 and an exceptionally
high rate of 17 percent :Ln 1973. The balance of payments still showed a
surplus in 1975, with the value of both exports and imports at a lower level.
Malaysia's external reserves were about US$1.49 billion at the end of
September 1975, which equals about five months of net imports at present
levels.
4.        Rubber continues to be the main pillar of the Malaysian economy,
contributing almost 30 percent of export earnings and about 15 percent of GDP,
but continuous progress Ls being made in reducing the dependence on rubber
exports through diversifLcation of exports to timber, tin, palm oil and
petroleum products.  In 1973 Malaysia's production of crude petroleum was
about 90,000 barrels per day. In a few years, production is expected to
increase about four-fold.  In 1973 Malaysia became a net exporter of petroleum
products and, as productlon increases, petroleum will soon become an important
foreign exchange earner. Substantial reserves of natural gas are also avail-
able and by the early 19130's Malaysia is expected to start exporting significant
quantities of liquefied natural gas, further strengthening the country's
balance of payments position.
5.        Malaysia's conservative fiscal and monetary management has consid-
erably enhanced the country's financial standing. Public sector revenues
have been growing rapidly, mainly as a result of vigorous taxation efforts,
and the ratio of total government revenue to GNP is now about 24 percent.
Conservative financial policies are also reflected in the relatively low
level of external public debt and the very low ratio of debt service pay-
ments to exports.

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



- 2 -
6.        Recently, inflation has been a concern. After a decade of remark-
able price stability (with consumer prices rising on an average of only 1 per-
cent per annum), domestic prices began to show a noticeable upward trend in
1973. Average consumer prices in 1972 were 3.2 percent higher than in 1971
but they increased 10.5 percent in 1973. In 1974 prices rose another 18
percent, but price rises slowed down in 1975 to about 6 percent. Price pres-
sures have been the result principally of movements in world prices. How-
ever, Malaysia has not been adversely affected by the higher price of petro-
leum. On the contrary, Malaysia should benefit from it in the long term.
7.        During the last several years, the Government's long-term planning
has concentrated on reducing the economic disparity between the Malays, who
account for a little over half the population, and non-Malays of whom about
70 percent are Chinese. Over the next 20 years the Government aims to eradi-
cate poverty and to restructure society so that the present identification of
race with economic activity will be eliminated. The basic outlines of the
New Economic Policy, announced in June 1971, allow for continued growth for
each of the principal ethnic groups while enlarging economic opportunities
for Malays.
8.        Both the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75) and the Third Malaysia
Plan (1976-80), which is expected to be reviewed by Parliament in April 1976,
follow closely New Economic Policy objectives and indicate the Government's
determination to step up the development effort in the public sector. During
the Second Malaysia Plan, total public sector development expenditures amounted
to about US$3.9 billion of which 50 percent was financed by net domestic
borrowing and 16 percent by net foreign borrowing. The balance was financed
largely by public savings. The Bank has provided about 32 percent of foreign
project loan commitments; loans from the Asian Development Bank and bilateral
aid, mainly from the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth countries, the Federal
Republic of Germany and Japan, provided the rest. For the next five years
disbursements of over US$1.5 billion of medium- and long-term loans from
abroad are likely to be required to permit the level of public investment planned.
9.        To support this inflow, new foreign loan commitments of approxi-
mately US$2.7 billion will be required over the five year period. Project
loans from multilateral sources, IBRD and ADB, are not expected to decrease;
bilateral assistance from sources such as Japan and market borrowing are
likely to be higher. The Government has also made initial contacts with a
number of OPEC member countries and the first aid commitments have already
been obtained.
10.       Malaysia's development program will continue to require resources
in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for financing
the import component of foreign financed development projects. The Bank
plans, therefore, to cover a portion of local costs in agriculture and in
other sectors where the foreign exchange component of projects is small.



11.       Debt service obligations at present are about 2.5 percent of
exports of goods and norn-factor services and are estimated to rise to over
5 percent during the late 1970s. This level is still well within Malaysia's
debt servicing capacity. The Bank's share in Malaysia's debt service pay-
ments is 22 percent and is expected to be about 23 percent by the end of
1978.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
12.       The Bank has made 30 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and urban transport. Although
in a few cases disbursements were slow, the execution of these projects
has generally been satisfactory. As of December 31, 1975, the loans to
Malaysia held by the Ban,k amounted to US$557.0 million. In addition, the
Bank made a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board, Singapore (Loan
405-MA), guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johore River Project. The
amount held by the Bank under that loan as of December 31, 1975 was US$4.6
million. Eleven loans are fully disbursed. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IFC investments, and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.
13.       Bank assistance to Malaysia is in line with the country's New
Economic Policy, which aims at eliminating imbalances in income distribu-
tion. The Bank will therefore continue to support Malaysia's agricultural
programs, including land development and settlement, and improvement of
production and employment in existing low income farming areas, which are
effective means to reduce unemployment and income imbalances. The Bank
will continue also to assist in the financing of infrastructure development,
including urban development and housing for the urban poor. The Bank has
helped the Government to prepare projects either in the course of its lend-
ing operations or through its sector work. The Bank has also helped to
strengthen public agencies responsible for carrying out important parts of
Malaysia's investment program. The Bank will continue this-policy, which
will be reflected in the loans to be presented to the Executive Directors
in the next year or so. These loans would be for projects involving agri-
cultural extension, irrigation and rural development, including assistance
to rubber smallholders and new land settlement, development finance companies,
education, highway transport and other infrastructure development.
14.       At present the Bank is also assisting in the preparation of the
Third Malaysia Plan (1976-80), both in the preparation of sector programs
and in the review of overall economic objectives and policies.
15.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made five
investments totalling US$8.69 million (Annex II). The total commitments
under those investments held by IFC as of December 31, 1975, amounted to
US$1.8 million. IFC is at present considering an investment in a textile
project.



PART III - MALAYSIA'S WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
16.       Over 50 percent of the population of Malaysia is served with piped
water supply. In West Malaysia and in Sabah State, water systems generally
provide service on a regional basis rather than to just a single community.
These systems, which serve almost all urban areas and adjacent towns and
villages, have enabled rural communities to benefit from water systems they
otherwise would be unable to support. Metered deliveries generally are pro-
vided to individual dwelling units, and public standposts represent a rela-
tively small proportion of the total number of connections. In Sarawak State,
where some 80 percent of the population live in small communities with poor
communications, water supply systems serve individual communities.
17.       The revised Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75) included M$334 million
for water supply projects to meet the growing demands of principal urban
areas, to provide water to settlers under its land settlement schemes, and
to serve a larger portion of the population. Financing for water supply
projects has come from Federal Government loans and budgetary allocations
and, for the more developed areas, from state and local sources. Interna-
tional financing has been used only for large-scale projects: two Bank
loans for the Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Projects (Loans 561-MA and 908-MA)
and four Asian Development Bank loans for urbar water supply projects in
both Peninsular and East Malaysia.
18.       Few satisfactory sewer systems exist in Malaysia.   According to
the 1970 Census, only 20.6 percent of the population was provided with flush
systems discharging either to communal or municipal sewers or, alternatively,
to individual disposal systems. Remaining population was served by bucket
(night soil) collection, pit latrines or open drains. In the urban areas only
the cities of Kuala Lumpur and Georgetown (Penang State) have sewers; a total
of 350,000 people, or 9 percent of the 1970 urban population (3.7 million)
benefited from this service. The Second Malaysia Plan allocated M$23 million
to sewer systems, or only 7 percent of the water supply allocation. Waste-
water flows have increased with the increase in piped water supply systems
but facilities for collection, treatment and safe disposal have not kept pace.
Because of this lag, a team of experts under the IBRD/World Health Organi-
zation Cooperative Program will survey the country in early 1976 with the
objective of identifying constraints and promoting development in the
urban waste water subsector.
19.       Many of Malaysia's principal streams are polluted, although condi-
tions are mitigated by frequent and substantial rainfall. Domestic wastes
represent only part of the problem; land development, industry and mining
operations are also major contributors to water pollution. At present,
water pollution cortrol is handled on an ad hoc basis with solutions attempted
only after a problem has arisen and been recognized as a nuisance or hazard.
Long range planning and policies in this field have not been formulated,
though the Environmental Quality Act of 1974 is an important first step.
That Act provides general powers to control pollution of Malaysia's land, air



and water resources. The urban waste water survey, referred to above, would
also examine environmental, technical, institutional and financial problems
associated with liquid waste.
20.       The concept of beneficiaries paying for water service through an
adequate tariff is well established in Malaysia, and water tariffs generally
are sufficient to meet operating costs and debt service and yield a small
surplus. Billing and collection procedures are generally good. Expenditures
for sewerage service are met principally from general tax assessments of
local governments.
Sector Organization
21.       Water supply is the responsibility of the individual state govern-
ments and is usually handled by the public works departments (PWD) of the
state. The Water Supply Branch of the Federal PWD provides technical advice
and support to the statesi on a limited scale. The Rural Environmental Sani-
tation Program of the Federal Government advises on water supply and waste
disposal in rmral areas and is managed by the Environmental Health Engineer-
ing Unit (EHE) of the Ministry of Health.
22.       There are two principal organizations at the national level respon-
sible for environmental sanitation and water pollution control. The Depart-
ment of the Environment (DOE) of the Ministry of Local Government and Environ-
ment administers and enforces the Environmental Quality Act of 1974 and helps
local agencies in sewerage, drainage, solid waste management and housing
development. The EHE Un:Lt of the Ministry of Health is responsible for
identifying urban sewerage, drainage and solid waste disposal needs, monitor-
ing environmental quality, and providing technical support to DOE and state
water pollution control boards. EHE prompted formulation of the Environmental
Quality Act and promoted studies for sewerage in Kuala Lumpur and eight other
urban areas.
23.       Water supply to Kuala Lumpur is provided by the Water Division of
Selangor State, the State which encircles the city. The water system serves
about 1,000,000 persons in the Federal Territory and adjacent State areas
through 100,000 connections, all of which are metered. Bank loans 561-MA
(1968) and 908-MA (1973) are helping finance the expansion of this system
and it is expected that when the second project is complete the system will
serve some 1.5 million persons. The performance of the Water Division in
operations and in project implementation has been good. The State, through
its Development Corporation, Public Works Department and local town boards,
also administers some-rudimentary wastewater systems.   But the major sewer
system in the region serves and is owned by the City of Kuala Lumpur.
24.       The City's sanitary sewerage system dates back to 1953 and provides
service to approximately 200,000 persons or 25 percent of the population. It
serves the central city and two smaller outlying areas. Facilities consist
of about 80 miles of sewers, a raw sewerage lift station, three treatment
plants and gravity outfalls to the Klang river system. In addition, the



City provides service to about 5,000 persons in low income areas adjacent
to the Federal Territory through small communal facilities. The Engineering
Department of the City has been responsible for these works and has operated
and maintained the system well. However, due to staff shortages it must rely
upon engineering consultants to plan, design and supervise the construction
of major projects. Because of limited revenues and inadequate capital funding,
the City has not expanded its sewerage system to match the rate of urban
development.
25.       In 1975 the consulting association of D. Balfour & Sons (UK) and
Malaysian International Consultants, completed a Sewerage Master Plan
financed by the UK that identifies a staged program of sewerage development
through the year 2005 to meet the needs of Kuala Lumpur and environs. The
study area included the Federal Territory plus substantial adjacent portions
of Selangor State (see map 11643). The Master Plan recognized that a single
sewerage authority ultimately should have jurisdiction over the study area.
Because of possible administrative and political difficulties, it was
decided that the City and the various State agencies should continue to
provide sewerage service within their respective boundaries, though a
regional sewerage authority remains an objective.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The project is the first stage of a long-range sewerage development
plan for Kuala Lumpur and environs. It would be carried out by a newly
created Sewerage Department (SD) of the City. Construction is scheduled for
the period 1976-80.
Project Descr rition
27.       In addition to expanding facilities in the existing sewerage zone,
the project would provide service to three newly created zones. Physical
work consists of:
(i) about 52 miles of lateral sewers varying in size from 9
to 15 inches;
(ii) about 16 miles of trunk sewers ranging in size from 15
to 60 inches;
(iii) improvements to an existing sewage treatment plant;
(iv) construction of four new pumping stations; and
(v) construction of three new sewage treatment facilities.
The treatment units, consisting of sewage lagoons, can be readily and inex-
pensively upgraded to handle future increases in biologic and hydraulic load-
ing resulting from population and industrial growth. An additional 15 miles



of lateral sewers would be added to the City's system by land developers but
these are not included in the project.
Implementation
28.       As mentioned in paragraph 24, the Engineering Department of the
City of Kuala Lumpur has been responsible for the sewerage system. In addition,
there is the Urban Services Department of the City administration, which has
and will continue to have the responsibility of collecting night soil. While
the Engineering Department has had considerable experience over the past 20
years in operating a sewerage system, its goal of extending the service to
the entire City has bee3n constrained. There have been shortages of funds for
extension of the system, as well as problems of staffing, primarily because
of shortages of engineers and technicians. The sewerage system of Kuala
Lumpur has now expanded to such an extent that the establishment of a
separate department is well justified. The Department will be responsible,
inter alia, for the implementation of the proposed project.
29.       SD will assu1ne responsibility for all aspects of sewerage design,
construction and operation within the Federal Territory. Its principal
responsibilities will be (a) participation in the planning of urban develop-
ment as related to sewerage facilities; (b) development of sewerage projects
for financing and construction; (c) design of sewerage systems by departmental
staff or consultants; (d) construction of sewerage systems by force account
or contract; (e) operation and maintenance of the sewerage systems; and (f)
the administration of matters relating to effluent disposal, including the
control of industrial wastewaters, the servicing of septic tanks and the dis-
posal of night soil.
30.       SD will be under the general direction of the Mayor, who will be
assisted by the City's Director General and the Chief Engineer of SD in
formulating the general policies for development and operation of SD. The
Mayor has appointed the Chief Engineer who, as the head of SD, will be res-
ponsible for formulation and implementation of policies and for day-to-day
control of operations. SD will be restricted to sewerage, but will do a small
amount of drainage work until a separate drainage unit is established, in
about two years. SD's staffing plan is satisfactory. SD will formulate and
initiate a training program for staff not later than January 1, 1977 (Section
3.05 (a) of the draft Project Agreement).
31.       It is anticipated that up to 600 families would have to be
resettled from lands required for severage purposes under the Master Plan.
Provision has been made under the proposed Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Trans-
port Project to provide financial and technical assistance to develop sites
and services, and housing, for displaced families. The City will relocate
persons occupying land, either as squatters or owners, in a socially accept-
able manner and in adetquate time to avoid delays in project implementation
(Section 2.08 of the draft Project Agreement).



-8-
Project Costs and Financing
32.       Total cost of the project is estimated at about US$60.5 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of about US$11.8 million
equivalent, less than 20Z of total cost. The estimated costs include a
physical contingency of 10 percent on all items, excluding land, and price
contingencies ranging between 14 percent in 1976 and 10 percent in 1980 for
civil works and between 10 percent in 1976 and 7 percent in 1980 for equip-
ment.
33.       The proposed loan of US$21.5 million accounts for about 36 percent
of the total project cost. It would finance the total estimated foreign
exchange cost of US$11.8 million and US$9.7 million of local cost. Bank
financing of some local cost is justified in Malaysia, as noted in paragraph
10. The balance of project costs would be covered through loans from the
Government (repayable in 36 years, including 6 years of grace, with interest
at 6 percent) and from SD's cash generation.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       All construction and supply contracts will be awarded after inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Local
contractors are expected to win all construction contracts, and local manu-
facturers are expected to furnish most, if not all, of the sewer pipes required
in the project. Major mechanical and electrical equipment required for the
pumping station and the treatment plant are not manufactured locally and will
be procured from abroad. Local manufacturers would be allowed a 15 percent
margin of preference or the customs duty, whichever is less.
35.       Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made against 42
percent of project expenditures, excluding land. If there are any cost
savings, the unused balance would be disbursed against continued expansion
of the sewerage system in the Federal Territory, subject, however, to ade-
quate justification. Since some expenditures for consultants' services are
likely to occur before the proposed loan is signed, retroactive financing
for these services of up to about US$30,000 is proposed.
Accounting
36.       Accounts for sewerage services have not been thus far separated from
the City's general accounts and, like other Government accounts, they have
been kept on a cash receipts and disbursements basis. This system does not
provide adequate information for determining the costs of the services or
for financial evaluation and control of the operations. Agreement was
therefore reached that SD will operate as a self-accounting department with
a commercial accounting system and with a separate bank account into which
its revenues will be deposited and from which its expenditures will be paid.
This will permit the preparation of separate financial statements for SD
and will provide the basis for effective evaluation and sound financial
planning and management (Section 3.01 of the draft Project Agreement).



-9-
Billing and Collection
37.       Sewerage servi.ces have so far been solely dependent on allocations
from the City's area tax assessments. Therefore, there has been no separate
billing system for these services. However, the Government has now decided
that the City should raise a substantial part of its expenditures for sewer-
age through fees to be collected as a surcharge on water bills. The billing
and collection services will be provided by the Water Division (WD) of the
State of Selangor for a fee (Section 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
WD has an effective billing and collection system for water supply, and its
delinquent accounts are insignificant.
Financial Position
38.       The City will introduce sewage fees and allocate to SD a portion
of the Federal TerritoryP area tax, which together will provide net internal
cash generation sufficient to cover annual debt service at least 1.2 times,
and by 1979 will produce a reasonable annual return on the value of net
fixed assets in service. Government and the City will complete a study, in
consultation with the Bank, before the end of 1978 to determine the appro-
priate rate of return and any further revision of sewage fees or the area
tax allocation required to achieve it. The annual rate of return should, in
any event, be not less than 7 percent. The initial area tax assessment will
average at least two percent of annual value, and the initial sewerage
charges will average at least M$0.60 per 1,000 Ig of water consumed (Section
4.04 of the draft Project Agreement). The tax assessment and sewerage
charges have accrued to the benefit of SD from January 1, 1976.
Environmental Aspects
39.       By extending sewerage service to populations now relying upon night
soil collection and sullage drains, the project will reduce health hazards
and improve the urban environment. The project will also help keep organic
pollution of the Klang River and its tributaries from exceeding present levels
despite steadily increasing quantities of domestic and industrial wastes.
Although downstream use of the Klang as a water source is limited, the pro-
ject would reduce downstream water treatment problems and costs and would
improve the overall aesthetics of the river and the recipient environment.
To help ensure the compatibility of construction programs and the uniformity
of pollution abatement measures, an intra-governmental coordinating committee
comprising sewerage and pollution control agencies has been established
(Section 4.03 of the draft Loan Agreement).
40.       Pollution by industry, land development and mining operations, both
within and outside the Federal Territory, is a continuing problem in the
Klang Valley. Present pollution control laws are adequate but their enforce-
ment needs to be strengthened. In order to promote equitable and economic
use of the project facilities and the surface waters which will receive the
treated wastes, the Government will prepare by July 1, 1977, a program



- 10 -
for the enforcement of pollution control legislation as they relate to the
quality of surface and ground waters in the Klang Valley (Section 4.02 of
the draft Loan Agreement).
Future Development
41.       A program that would provide for continued expansion of sewerage
systems within the Federal Territory and also provide for the extension of
public sewers to adjacent developed areas of Selangor State has been identi-
fied by the consultants as part of the sewerage Master Plan for Kuala Lumpur
and environs. Construction of Stage 2 facilities is planned for the period
1981-85 and later improvements for the period 1986-2005.
42.       Although investments in excess of M$200 million are proposed by
various Governmental agencies in the near term for sewerage, drainage, roads
and transport in the Kuala Lumpur area, spatial development planning is in-
complete and zoning regulations are only partly enforced. The Government
has initiated a review of the planning issues in Kuala Lumpur with the
assistance of a consultant, financed by UNDP. A program to continue this
work and to prepare development plans for the Federal Territory was adopted
(Section 4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement). It includes the following main
steps:
(a) The Government will, together with the City G nvermseut, by
July 1, 1976 establish an inter-governmental task force to
carry out development policy analysis, broad spatial plan-
ning, capital programming and project reviews in the Federal
Territory. The task force will be provided with the neces-
sary technical staff, and with technical assistance, which
the Government is expected to obtain through M1DP;
(b) The Government will by September 1, 1976, in consultation
with the Bank, prepare a detailed two-year work program
for the task force, including terms of reference for the
technical assistance;
(c)  The Government will prepare recommendations on an insti-
tutional framework and processes suitable over the longer
term for the continuation of the task force's work and
for decision-making. One proposal which will be further
investigated is to transform the task force into a per-
manent technical unit attached to the Land Executive
Committee and to expand the powers of the Committee to
include policy making, broad spatial planning, capital
programming and project sanctioning; and
(d) The task force, or the long-term institutional framework
referred to in (c), will by January 1, 1978 prepare a
ten-year spatial development plan and a five-year capital
budget for the Federal Territory.

In implementing the above program, particular attention will be paid to the
need to integrate the work with that of a strengthened City administration.
There would, however, be a shift away from the present emphasis on static
and restrictive land use planning, or zoning, towards a more comprehensive
and continuous planning process that would focus on development policies,
socio-economic objectives, and resource constraints. The development plans
would be closely linked to the national five-year plans, and the first
development plan would be prepared in time for the Government's Mid-term
Review of The Third Malaysia Plan, in mid-1978.
Justification
43.       The population of Kuala Lumpur, currently 780,000, is growing at a
rate of 3.7 percent annually compared with the national growth rate of 2.7
percent. The average monthly household income was about US$395 in 1975,
about 20 percent above the average urban income and about 90 percent above
the national average.
44.       Water consumiption and liquid waste production are increasing at
about double the population rate. Water production capacity for the Kuala
Lumpur region is being enlarged under two Bank-financed water supply projects
(referred to earlier) to meet water supply needs through 1981. However,
the volume of liquid waste in the areas to be served under the project has
reached levels which are clearly beyond the handling capacity of rudimentary
septic tank or night tioil systems.
45.       The project is a logical continuation of the sewerage construction
program undertaken by the City and financed by Government since 1953. As a
result of the project,, the population provided with sewerage service would
double from about 200,000 in 1975 to 400,000 in 1981 and the percentage
of the whole population of the Federal Territory receiving sewerage service
would increase from the present 25 percent to about 45 percent in 1981. The
project represents the least cost piped sewage collection and disposal
system for the areas i:o be served, and would (i) maximize the use of the
existing sewerage sysl:em; (ii) reduce dependency upon night soil collection
and septic tanks in developed areas; (iii) eliminate the need for owner
constructed septic tauks and other disposal methods in areas presently under
development; and (iv) help stabilize the level of pollution in receiving
water-courses through simple, effective sewage treatment processes.
46.       Measurable benefits of sewerage projects are difficult to quantify
because the supporting assumptions are necessarily speculative, hence the
justification for this project is essentially qualitative. Nevertheless,
it is known that the project will effect cost savings in terms of (i) reduced
expenditures for construction and maintenance of septic tanks and for night
soil collection; and (ii) reduced medical costs and reduced loss of income
due to sickness related to poor sanitary facilities. Furthermore, the impact
on aesthetics and consumer convenience is far superior to the alternative
of septic tanks. Benefits will also arise from the development of a satis-
factory institution to operate the facilities provided by the project and
to carry out its objectives.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 672     Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$13.0
Million Loan of May 20, 1970; Effective Date: August 20
1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
Loan No. 885     Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;
US25.O Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Effective Date:
June 22, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The projects, and a first project already completed, consist
of the clearing of forest, the planting of 62,000 acres of oil palms and
35,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of 10,000 families in the Jengka
Triangle (State of Pahang).  The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA),
responsible for the execution of the project, operates efficiently, keeping
high standards of planting and maintenance. Under Jengka II village develop-
ment community facilities and housing is proceeding satisfactorily although
slightly behind appraisal schedule. 2,718 housing units have been comp'leted
(target 2,965). 2,036 are now occupied by settlers and 20,360 acres have
been allocated to settlers. Completion of Scheme 9 mill has been delayed
because of prolonged tender procedures and delays in delivery of equipment.
The mill is now expected to become operational in early 1976. Resultant
insufficient mill capacity has caused temporary harvest cut-backs and
reduced earnings to settlers. FELDA is diverting ffb wherever alternative
capacity is available. Under Jengka III feeling and clearing has been
completed and planting is progressing satisfactorily. Infrastructure and
village development are behind schedule and settler intake will also be
delayed. Standards of agricultural development are satisfactory, except for
clearing and planting problems encountered in scheme 17 and drainage problems
in scheme 23. FELDA is preparing revised cost estimates for both projects,
taking into account recent fluctuations in the rate of exchange.
Loan No. 967     Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million
Loan of February 27, 1974; Effective Date: May 16,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of the planting of
65,000 acres of oil palm, and settlement of 4,400 families in the State of
Johore. The agricultural development progresses satisfactorily in line with
appraisal estimates. In order to speed up settler intake, construction of
access roads and village road networks will be done under contract. Game
damage in the planted areas, mainly by elephants and wild boar, is increasing,
and measures to reduce further damage are being considered. FELDA is preparing
revised cost estimates, taking into account recent fluctuations in the rate
of exchange.

Loan No. l144    Keratong Land Settlement Project; US$36.0 Million
Loan of October 3, 1974; Effective Date:  January 9,
197T; Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of the planting of
55,000 acres of oil palm, the settlement of 3,400 families, the construction
of two palm oil mills and the establishment of two urban settlements. Agri-
cultural development is progressing satisfactorily.. However, the Pahang
Tenggara Development Authority still is understaffed, resulting in implementa-
tion delays of the settlements. FELDA has requested construction of three
palm oil mills with smaller capacities instead of two larger mills as
envisaged in the appraisal report. The feasibility of this proposal is
currently under consideration.
Loan No. 973     Western Johore Agricultural Development Project;
USW2.O Million Loan of April 5. 1974: Effective Date:
August 14, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project includes main and feeder drains, coastal embankments
and tidal gates to improve drainage in an area of 134,000 ha (330,000 a2C)
in southwest Peninsular Malaysia, as well as an integrated agricultural
development program with changes in cropping patterns to improve farm
incomes, intercropping, opening up of 24,000 ha of new land, Farmers'
Development Centers and improvements in research, extension and crop
processing. A Project Division has been set up to direct and coordinate
the various agencies involved in project execution, to monitor and
evaluate project progress and to prepare a feasibility study for a second
stage project. Because of the need to re-evaluate some of the design
criteria and delays in survey contracts, and also because of delays in
appointing engineering staff, construction is about one and a half years
behind schedule.
Loan No. 700     Fifth Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
Jul   1 . 1970; Effective Date: September 29, 1970;
Closing Date: January 31, 1977
The project (the third stage extension of Port Dickson Thermal
Power Station consisting of 3 x 120 MW units) was about 60 percent complete
at the end of December 1975. The Government of Malaysia allowed the National
Electricity Board to a]oply the fuel surcharge to commercial and industrial
consumers from March 15, 1975. &nergy sales increased by 11.3 percent in
FY74. Rate of return was 10.2 percent and self-financing of construction
was 70 percent. NEB's sound financial position was maintained in FY74. A
rate of return of 8.3 poercent is anticipated for FY75. Rates of return greater
than 8 percent (8.2 - 13.6 percent) are predicted for FY76 through FY80.

Loan No. 1031    Sixth Power Project; US$45.0 Million Loan of
July 25, 1974; Effective Date: October 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project consists of transmission lines required for the
Temengor hydroelectric power station. So far implementation is on
schedule.
Loan No. 753     Second Telecommunications Project; US$18.7 Million
Loan of June 21, 1971; Effective Date: August 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
After initial delays in procurement, obtaining sites and erecting
buildings, the Teleemmunications Department of Malaysia (TDB) has made good
progress in carrying out the project. The original project targets for
December 31, 1975, in respect of expansion of the local telephone, telex and
long-distance services were generally met with two exceptions, first, the
number of additional connections will only reach the target of 80,000 lines
in April, 1976, or a delay of four months and secondly, due to delays in
site acquisition and buildings, two of the microwave routes will be completed
only in mid-1977. An extension of the Closing Date will therefore be
required. The reorganization of TDM has been completed and is operating
satisfactorily. TDM's financial results for the 1971-73 period are very
satisfactory with rates of return of about 16 percent as compared with the
appraisal estimates of about 10 percent and the loan covenant of 8 percent.
The operating ratio has been good, between 60-64 percent, and TDM's self-
financing has been high.
Loan No. 908     Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project consists of the expansion of facilities to provide piped
water supply to parts of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley. The facilities will
include an earth dam on the Langat River to form a resevoir to regulate the
river flow. khen field surveys were made for the detailed design, the
consultant found that the 175 feet height of the dam originally planned had
to be raised by 9 feet. The completion of the dam, but not the other
components of the project, is expected to be delayed by about one year to
late 1978. The project cost is presently estimated at about 45 percent more
than the appraisal estimate due to the increased cost of the dam and
adoption of a higher allowance for inflation. No difficulties are foreseen
in raising the additional funds required.
Loan No. 774     Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Effective Date: August 24, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976
Except for a new headquarters building in Kota Kinabalu and the
port administration building at Sandakan, all civil works were expected to



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 8
be completed by end 1975. Total cost of the project will be about US$38.0
million, compared to the) appraisal estimate of US$22.1 million. SPA's
financial position is satisfactory and tariff increases have been proposed;
the management of the Authority and operational procedures in the ports
are satisfactory. Studies of proposed additional port works at Tawau and
Sapangar Bay are expected to be available for review in June 1976.
Loan No. 799     Railwar Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of February 11,
1972; iffective Date: April 17, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
Initial delays in procurement have been overcome. The overall cost
of revised investment p:Lan (1971-1975) (about M$93.0 million) is less than
the forecast of M$128.0 million due to deletion and deferment of two items.
With the delay in procurement, work on track renewal, worhshops and rolling
stock will be carried over into the first year of the next five year plan.
Mahagement lacks effectLveness largely due to many vacancies in key technical
posts and to imminent retirement of several senior officers. Operations have
not improved to the extent forecast at appraisal. Passenger traffic continues
to rise faster than anticipated. Freight traffic remains relatively stagnant,
but considerable improvement is expected next year, due largely to increased
cement traffic. With increasing costs, there were operating losses in 1973,
1974 and 1975. Even if the MR's request for a 10 percent raise in passanger
fares is granted prompt'Ly, there will be further losses in 1976. New invest-
ment proposed by the MR for the Third Five Year Plan (1976-1980), to be
reviewed by Parliament in April 1976, totals M$393.0 million; adoption of such
a plan will depend on t'he Government's decision on the future status of the
railway, particularly in view of the rapid expansion of highways and highway
transport. To assist in making a decision on the future of the Railway, and
on further investment needed, the Government has decided to update the General
Transport Survey of 1969.
Loan No. 851     Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$16.0 Million
Loan of July 20, 1972; Effective Date: September 20,
1972: Closing Date: April 30. 1977
The project is designed to improve the transport facilities between
Kuala Lumpur and the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. It consists of improve-
ment of about 6 miles of Federal Route 2, including detailed engineering,
widening of the road, construction of interchanges and cycle tracks, and
relocation of services. Civil works are 4-6 months behind schedule, due to
shortcomings in the contractor's project-management and due to difficulties
in obtaining steel and cement. But the major problems have now been over-
come. The project also includes a transport study for metropolitan Kuala
Lumpur, a national road. maintenance study and detailed engineering of about
137 miles of Federal Route 1; all these studies have been completed.

Loan No. 931     Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of
August 22, 1973; Effective Date: October 25, 1973;
Closing Date: August 31, 1977
Construction delays were encountered due to weak management of
some contractors, late delivery of construction equipment, late acquisi-
tion of land and approval by the Government of import licenses and work
permits for the contractors' expatriate staff. However, measures have been
taken to overcome most of these deficiencies, and work, including supervision
by consultants, is proceeding satisfactorily, except for one road section
for which contractor management has to be strengthened. Due to the late
start of the fifth and last road section, project completion may be delayed
by up to 20 months. Construction costs have escalated sharply and it is
likely that they will exceed original estimates (including contingencies) by
almost US$17.0 million, or over 50 percent. Urban studies as well as high-
way feasibility and detailed engineering studies financed under the loan
have been completed.
Loan No. 599     Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of May 23, 1969;
Effective Date: September 16, 1969; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976
Construction has been completed at 20 of 21 project institutions,
and the quality of the completed buildings is satisfactory. Project imple-
mentation is about two and one-half years behind schedule because an alter-
nate site had to be selected for one agricultural school. This school is
now expected to be completed in late 1976. A further extension of the
Closing Date by six months to December 31, 1976, is therefore necessary.
Deliveries of furniture and equipment to the project schools are near
completion expect for one agricultural school. All the 20 project schools are
now in operation and are functioning satisfactorily. Although no final
evaluation has yet been made, the schools appear to have achieved low drop-
out rates and high pass rates. The estimated financing under the loan is
expected to be about US$1.7 million lower than originally estimated.
US$700,000 of this amount has been transferred to the second education
project, and proposals have been requested from the Government on use of the
remaining surplus funds.
Loan No. 810     Second Education Project: US$15.5   Million Loan of
April 5, 1972; Effective Date:  July 7, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31. 1977
Project implementation has improved and is now about ten months
behind schedule mainly due to delays in the appointment of consultant archi-
techts for the Penang University, late approval of the campus plan by the
University and slowness of the Public Works Department in preparation of
documents. Of eight secondary vocational and technical schools, seven are
under construction. Tender has been opened for all the facilities of the
University and the recommended awards are acceptable. Contracts have been
awarded for one-third of the facilities and construction is scheduled to be

completed by mid-1977. Total project cost remains to be about 40 percent
above the original estimate. Progress on equipment procurement is sat-
isfactory. Disbursements have slightly improved.
Loan No. 974     Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of
April l, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, l97k;
Closin  Date:  December 31, 1980
Project implementation is about three months behind schedule due
to delays in selection of sites for the Teachei Training Colleges (TTCs) but
all sites have now been acquired, Tenders have been opened for seven of the
thirteen project institutions and all sketch plans have been approved. Con-
struction for seven schools should start in early 1976. Progress on civil
works is satisfactory. Equipment procurement for Kuantan Polytechnic is
slightly behind schedule, but master lists should be ready before March 1976.
Estimated total project cost remains the same as the appraisal estimate.
Disbursement is about one year behind schedule partly due to delays in
equipment procurement but should improve in 1976 when civil works construc-
tion starts. The Project Unit is functioning satisfactorily.
Loan No. 880     Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of
February 9. 1973; Effective Date: June 21, 1973;
Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The progress on the civil works component has been very good in
1975. Four buildings were completed and 129 were under construction. The
Senior Research Advisor has joined the National Family Planning Ebard (NFPB).
NFPB is taking action to set up a computerized management information system.
The program performance improved in 1975 with the number of new acceptors
being higher than in any of the previous five years. The Prime Minister
urged NFPB to intensify its efforts, particularly in urban squatter areas.
