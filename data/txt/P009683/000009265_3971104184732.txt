Sector Impact Evaluation
Attached is an impact evaluation report on the five dairy projects in India named above. The first
credit, for the state of Karnataka, was approved in FY74 for US$30 million; two further state projects
followed in FY75 for US$27.7 and US$16.4 million. The first national credit was approved in FY78 for
US$150 million, followed by a second national project in FY88, supported by a credit of SDR 121.2
million (US$150 million, equivalent) and a loan for US$200 million. The evaluation is based upon three
visits to India and field work in five Indian states by Operations Evaluation Department (OED) staff, two
participatory surveys and a study of the protection of the Indian dairy industry, an examination of Bank
files and documents, discussions with the responsible Bank staff, government representatives, academics,
and the staff of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) in India. A draft of the study was
discussed at a two-day workshop at the Institute for Rural Management, Anand, Gujarat state in March
1997. The generous assistance of the Swiss Development Corporation in financing the workshop is
gratefully acknowledged.
Operation Flood is an Indian program to foster farmer-controlled cooperatives capable of paying
an attractive price for very small deliveries (1 to 2 liters) of milk. It owes its genesis to a visit in 1964 by
the then Prime Minister of India, Lal Bahadur Shastri, to Anand in Gujarat state. He was so impressed
with the operation of the cooperative Anand Milk Union Limited (AMUL) that he decided to support
replication of the AMUL model nationwide. This expansion (Operation Flood I) was supported directly
by the World Food Program and indirectly by the three Bank-funded state projects.
A subsequent visit to Anand by the Bank's then President, Mr. McNamara, resulted in an offer to
support a further expansion of the program (Operation Flood II) with IDA funding through the National
Dairy Project. This expansion was also supported by extensive food aid from the European Community
(EC). National Dairy II, again with support from parallel EC food aid, funded a third phase (Operation
Flood III).
Inauguration of Operation Flood was accompanied by an extraordinary jump in the growth rate
of total Indian dairy production from 0.7 percent cumulative to 4.7 percent. This is a growth rate for the
dairy industry quite comparable with the growth for wheat and rice production under the Green
Revolution. Technological change underlying this growth rate included increased by-products from the
Green Revolution crops and a switch to crossbred cows based on semen from European dairy breeds. It



2
also reflected government withdrawal from direct collection and processing of milk and assurance that
food aid would not be used to depress dairy prices. Operation Flood only procures about 6.3 percent of
national production so that it is the policy changes which applied to the whole industry, as well as rising
incomes and demand for milk and the technological changes mentioned above which explain the faster
growth rate.
The higher growth rate in production underpinned an increase in milk consumption from 107 to
193 grams/head/day between 1970 and 1994. Operation Flood itself occupied a leadership position
within the industry. By 1996, Operation Flood was procuring milk from 6.3 million farmers organized
into 53,000 farmer-controlled village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies, processing it through 170 Milk
Producers Unions grouped into 22 State Dairy Federations and supplying over 100 urban centers through
a national milk grid.
Although itself a narrowly focused marketing intervention (with some support for farm-level
production), Operation Flood had wide ranging beneficial impacts on milk consumption, farm incomes,
employment generation, education, and women. It was an innovative intervention in that it threw the
Bank's support behind a policy change which was already under way and to an existing Indian
organization, the NDDB. This contrasts with many Bank projects, particularly in Africa, which call for
the creation of an institution which is also expected to get the project up and running.
The major difficulty encountered by Operation Flood has been the reluctance of state
govermnents to cede full control of the industry to the farmer cooperatives. State governments, which in
some cases own the processing plants used by the cooperatives, interfere by setting producer or
consumer prices, making key managerial appointments, and mandating continued overmanning of dairy
plants. Progress has been made in reducing this interference, which varies greatly from state to state, but
it is a continuing problem. Bank plans for dairy development in India no longer include special
assistance to NDDB and Operation Flood.

Preface
Operation Flood, which was supported by the five projects now evaluated, is a huge
undertaking. In 1996, it involved 9.3 million farmer-members supplying an average of 10,900
metric tons of milk per day through 55,042 functional village cooperative societies to 170 milk
producers unions (MPUs) who sold it as liquid milk and processed products. This vast
organization grew out of a single small cooperative society in the state of Gujarat established in
1946. This growth has been supported by US$0.69 billion (1996 dollars, 43 percent of project
cost), disbursed by the Bank and, and US$1.1 billion (1996 dollars) of food aid from the World
Food Program and the European Community. Even so, Operation Flood represents only 6.3
percent of total milk production and 22 percent of marketed milk in India. Total milk production
has also grown rapidly since the inception of Operation Flood.
In India's dairy industry, the Bank has followed a simple, consistent, and transparent
development strategy: to support the expansion of dairy production by small producers through a
successful indigenous development program. This program, despite substantial government
assistance, enabling legislation, and government control of some apex organizations, is now
dominated by fanner-controlled village-level dairy cooperative societies (DCSs) and some
regional MPUs.
An initial IDA credit of US$30.0 million was approved in March 1974, and two further
IDA credits of US$27.7 and US$16.4 million were approved in December 1974, all supporting
projects in various states. A fourth IDA credit of US$150.0 million approved in June 1978
supported a first national project, and a further IDA credit of SDR 121.2 million and loan of
US$200.0 million approved in December 1987 supported a second national project.
The first four projects were audited by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in
1987, and studies were sponsored by the Bank, the Danish International Development Agency
(DANIDA), and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on the impact of the
Bank-supported projects in Karnataka (Alderman 1987) and Madhya Pradesh (Mergos and Slade
1987). The final project, which closed on April 30, 1996, was audited in November 1996.
This report is based on the above-mentioned audits and studies, the associated Project
Completion Reports and Implementation Completion Reports, exarnination of other Bank
documents, and interviews with Bank staff. OED Missions also visited India in January and
November 1996. As part of the study, a participatory farmer survey was undertaken in
Karnataka, and a resurvey of villages, originally studied in 1983, was organized in Madhya
Pradesh. A study of the level of protection of the Indian dairy industry was also undertaken. A
workshop at the Institute of Rural Management, Anand, Gujarat state, with 43 Indian participants
was held to discuss a draft of this report in March 1997. The generous assistance of the Swiss
Development Corporation in financing this workshop is gratefully acknowledged.
The valuable assistance provided to OED staff in the preparation of this report by the
government of India and the state governments of Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar, and the
Punjab is gratefully acknowledged. The hospitality and generous commitment of time by the
staff of Operation Flood, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), and other participants

in the Indian dairy industry too numerous to mention also contributed greatly to the success of
the evaluation.
A draft version of this impact evaluation report was sent to the government of India, the
govermments of Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar, and the Punjab, and the NDDB for

Executive Summary
Operation Flood is not an all purpose poverty removal program. It cannot be, because it focuses
clearly on a single productive activity, dairying, while the ranks of the rural poor include many
different categories of the disenfranchised: the old, the infirn, the tribals, the landless, the small
farners, the artisans and so forth. (Simnilarly, OF) is not an all purpose development program,
aimed at removing economic and social inequalities existing in rural India for centuries at one
stroke.
Dr. V. Kurien (quoted in Doornbos and Nair 1990)
1.    The first of the five Indian dairy projects included in this study was approved by the
Board in March 1974. At that time India was following a self-reliant macroeconomic
development policy with heavy emphasis on import substitution (a policy which remained
essentially unchanged until 1991). In the dairy sector, a policy decision had been made to utilize
farmer-controlled cooperatives to develop the dairy industry and to make the import substitution
as efficient as possible. The government also decided to withdraw from its own direct efforts to
develop the dairy industry (indirect efforts via extension, research, artificial breeding, etc.,
continued). Dairy commodity food aid was to be sold at commercial prices with the proceeds
earmarked for support of this Operation Flood.
2.     The inauguration of Operation Flood corresponded to a turnaround in per capita incomes
which had been falling to a period of sustained, if modest, growth. Rising per capita incomes,
together with rising population and a high income elasticity of demand for milk, resulted in a
rapid growth in the demand for milk (technically, a rapid shift in the demand function for milk).
In the absence of supply side adjustment, this would have led to a rapid escalation in the price of
milk or the need for extensive imports. In fact, the shift in the supply function from the policy
changes introduced with Operation Flood resulted in an even larger shift in the supply (function)
and declining real prices.
3.     Operation Flood itself is an Indian program to foster a farmer-controlled cooperative
dairy industry capable of paying an attractive price for very small deliveries (1 or 2 liters) of
milk. The program owes its genesis to a visit in October 1964 by the then-Prime Minister, Lal
Bahadur Shastri, to Anand in Gujarat state. The Prime Minister was so impressed with the
operations of the cooperative Anand Milk Union Limited (AMUL), and so disenchanted with the
performance of various state-sponsored schemes to promote the dairy industry, that he asked Dr.
V. Kurien, the Managing Director of AMUL, to replicate the AMUL model throughout India.
The result was Operation Flood I (OFI), a program supported directly by the World Food
Program (WFP) and indirectly by three IDA-funded projects in the states of Karnataka (Cr. 482),
Rajasthan (Cr. 521), and Madhya Pradesh (Cr. 522).
4.    A subsequent visit to Anand in 1978 by the Bank's then-President, Mr. McNamara,
resulted in an offer to support an extension of the program with further IDA funding. At the same
time, the European Community (EC) decided to use a major portion of its dairy surplus to
support Operation Flood directly rather than indirectly through the WFP. The result was
Operation Flood II (OFII), funded by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) of India, a
parastatal; the Bank (through the National Dairy Project (NDP), Cr. 824); and the EC through
food aid. The earlier Bank-supported state projects continued as an integral part of OFII. On



2
completion of OFHI, the project involved 22 state cooperative federations working through 164
milk producers unions (MPUs). Subsequently, Operation Flood III (OFIII), supported by the
Second National Dairy project (Cr. 1859/Ln. 2893), was designed to increase the number and
coverage of MPUs and DCSs with the policy objective of ensuring full farmer control at the
village, union, and federation levels. Farmer control was to include the right to set producer and
consumer prices, hire and fire staff, and go bankrupt.
5.    Very substantial financial assistance has been provided to NDDB and Operation Flood
through food aid provided on concessional terms but sold by Operation Flood at market prices.
This has been used to establish processing infrastructure (including a 30 percent grant element
offered by NDDB in connection with loans for processing plants and equipment), for
developmental expenditures, and to provide public goods (and some social expenditures).
Though larger than normally offered in the private sector, this financial assistance does not differ
in principle from the tax holidays and infrastructural investments typically offered to private
companies in developed and developing countries to influence their locational decisions.
Operation Flood itself has studiously avoided subsidizing recurrent costs in order not to
undermine the independence of the cooperatives. However, where states have retained some
control over their cooperatives, quite extensive subsidies (or reimbursements) have been
provided by state govermnents for losses incurred. IDA funds were on-lent by the central
government to the NDDB at an interest rate of 7.5 percent and from the NDDB to the MPUs at
10 percent (approximate commercial terms). Inflation has substantially eased the burden of these
loans.
6.    From Independence until about 1971, dairy production grew at about 0.7 percent a year.
Since then, it has grown at more than 4.7 percent a year. As shown in Figures 6.1 and 6.2, there
is a clear break in the trend line for dairy production. Continuing the earlier rate of growth would
have resulted in the production of only 24.2 million metric tons of milk in 1995, compared with
the estimated actual production at the higher growth rate of 66.3 million metric tons. This is an
increase in the production of dairying as a whole. Operation Flood too has grown fast: from
1970-71 to 1985-86, procurement rose from 0.14 to 2.96 million tons per year. Since 1985, its
procurement has increased at about 4.3 percent per year compounded. Nevertheless, Operation
Flood still procures only about 6.3 percent of total milk production, or about 22 percent of
marketed milk. Some of the expansion of Operation Flood does not represent new milk
production but rather a switch from the home manufacture of ghee and other products or from
milk previously sold to informal milk buyers (dudhiyas). Total production has increased much
faster than can be explained by the additional production generated and procured by Operation
Flood (Figure 7.1).
7.    The overall expansion of the dairy industry from the early 1970s has been comparable to
the more widely recognized Green Revolution crops of wheat and rice. Two key policy changes
which accompanied the decision to provide direct financial assistance to the cooperatives to
develop the dairy industry were a cessation of direct efforts by the public sector to promote dairy
production and the decision to sell dairy food aid at commercial prices within India. Both of
these changes reduced the price risks for farmers, small-scale traders (dudhiyas), and private
processors. Crossbreeding of local cows with specialized dairy breeds provided the technology
for rapid increases in milk production, and Operation Flood provided the example of large-scale
modem milk processing fed by a well-organized milkshed procuring milk from a large number
of producers in very small amounts. As shown in Figure 7.1, the actual volume of milk handled
by Operation Flood remains a small fraction of the increased supply. It is thus not possible to



3
attribute increased production simply to the dairy processing, marketing infrastructure, and
technical support provided by Operation Flood directly (important though these contributions
have been). Rather, one has to look to the changed dairy policy environment which accompanied
the decision supporting Operation Flood. This was not "policy based lending" in the sense of an
operation rich in policy conditionality. But, it was an operation where the Bank saw an ongoing
policy that it felt was promising and could usefully be supported. The Bank saw the policy as
promising both because of its likely production impact, but more importantly because of its
capacity to reach the poor.
8.    Without the policy change, there would have been no Operation Flood; and without the
attractive alternative of an expansion of the cooperative sector, it is highly unlikely that the
public sector would have ceased its efforts to promote production while holding down prices. On
the issue of the independence and farmer control of cooperatives (a key objective of Operation
Flood and the Bank), progress has been mixed (Table 6.11). Under India's constitution,
agriculture is a state responsibility. This explains the differences in the treatment of dairy
cooperatives among states.
9.    A byproduct impact of Operation Flood and accompanying dairy expansion has been the
establishment of an indigenous dairy equipment manufacturing industry (only 7 percent of dairy
equipment is now imported) and an impressive body of indigenous expertise that includes animal
nutrition, animal health, artificial insemination (Al), management information systems (MIS),
dairy engineering, food technology, and the like. The Bank's insistence on International
Competitive Bidding means that, as far as Operation Flood goes, India's dairy manufacturing
industry has been established in competition with international suppliers. However, supplies of
Indian equipment to non-Flood dairy processors may have benefited from the artificial stimulus
of "self-reliance" which ruled in many industries prior to 1991 and raised the cost of those
processors. This indigenous infrastructure explains in large part why milk processing and
marketing costs of Operation Flood have not exploded in the face of having to procure and
account for minute quantities of milk.
10.   Operation Flood recognized that farmers' profits can be increased by lowering their costs
(that is, increasing their efficiency) just as well as by raising producer prices and that access to
lower-cost producers enhanced Operation Flood's competitive position. Accordingly, Operation
Flood supplied Al services (including crossbreeding), vaccination and veterinary services, cattle
feed, improved forage seeds, and training in the urea treatment of dry forage, milk testing,
recording, and accounting. For Al, milk-testing, and village society secretarial services,
Operation Flood trained villagers to a high degree of competence and thus controlled costs. It
capitalized on rural India's ample supply of very low-cost labor. In addition, Operation Flood
provided access for its villages to poverty-oriented programs such as credit (and subsidies) to
purchase cattle, subsidized biogas construction, and improved water supply.
11.   Unusually, the project is a single-commodity "integrated development project." There
was an obvious production impact (40 million tons more of milk were produced in 1995 than
would have been produced if the pre-1971 growth rate had continued) of the policy changes
associated with Operation Flood. It is also a nutrition project. Under the new policy, per capita
milk consumption has risen from 107 grams/head/day in 1970 to 193 grams/head/day in 1994.
Operation Flood has also had clear benefits for the poor and women. For those landless people
who own or have been able to purchase a milch animal (a cow or buffalo), it has been a boon. Of
course, those who are both cowless and landless have only been slightly affected by some of the



4
social programs supported by the village dairy cooperative societies (DCSs) out of their profits
and by the increased prosperity of the village economies. Operation Flood, in collaboration with
NGOs, has established 6,000 women's dairy cooperative societies (WDCSs) and higher incomes
for some women. Indirectly, it has expanded the number of children attending school because of
the high income elasticity of demand for education in Indian villages. This is a project that has
produced diverse "results on the ground." The multidimensional benefits from this single-
commodity production and marketing project raise a question as to the relative efficacy of
production projects that aim to remove or reduce poverty directly by raising incomes compared
with health, nutrition, and education projects designed to remove or reduce poverty indirectly, or
compared with more complex area development projects.
12.   Project sustainability is a complex issue. The first point is that where states continue to
interfere with pricing decisions or make key appointments, MPUs and state federations can be
expected to make losses; however, state governments can be expected to reimburse (or
"subsidize") them for their losses. Thus, ironically, it may be the state-controlled, often loss-
making, MPUs which are the most "sustainable." Their future is not in doubt since they are not
allowed to go bankrupt. It is the full Anand-pattern, independent cooperatives which have the
right to go bankrupt and are thus fully at risk. Although the cooperative sector as a whole makes
a profit, Tables 4.4 and 4.5 show that there are substantial arrears (27 percent) in the payments
due to NDDB from MPUs and state federations under the Bank projects and that some 46 MPUs
and state federations made losses in 1994-95. However, over the last two years, 27 previously
loss-making MPUs have been restored to profitability. NDDB's equity is sufficient to repay all
loans even if there were no further repayments from the states. Thus, even though some MPUs
may eventually go bankrupt (through mismanagement or overinvestment), this does not threaten
the sustainability of the cooperative sector as a whole, even in the face of substantial state
assistance to the corporate sector which is not currently available to cooperatives. Operation
Flood continues to expand and consolidate the cooperative sector.
13.   Viewed as lending to sustain and help implement a new policy, Bank investments need
to account for only 0.6 percent of the observed acceleration in the growth of dairy production to
yield an estimated economic rate of return (ERR) of 10 percent. If 2 percent of the observed
increase was due to the policy change, then this would return 10 percent on the entire Operation
Flood investment by the WFP, EC, government of India, and the Bank.
14.   It has already been remarked that Operation Flood is an Indian program; the basic
institutional structure was put in place during the first phase, when the Bank was supporting
parallel dairy development in three states. Thus, when the program was massively expanded
under Operation Flood II, there was an already existing indigenous institution ready to
implement the project. Bank institutional support thus involved genuine institution building, as
different from the institution creation which is characteristic of many Bank projects. The great
difficulty of simultaneous institution creation and project implementation has been widely
demonstrated in Bank projects, particularly in Africa.
15.   Total project cost was US$1.6 billion-US$0.9 billion as grant and US$0.7 as loan
(1996 dollars). These resources were channeled predominantly through NDDB. Most of the
money was passed on to MPUs for construction of milk processing plants with a 30 percent grant
element. It also paid for development of the national milk grid, establishment of DCSs, and some
of the costs of the development of NDDB's support capacity. Currently, NDDB receives no
operational subsidies.



5
16.   Initially, the dairy industry was highly protected (Table 4.6) and until 1984-85, skim
milk powder (SMP) received more protection than butter-oil (ghee). Subsequently, SMP
protection has fallen relative to ghee, to the point that though ghee is still substantially protected,
SMP is essentially unprotected. This reflects in large measure the rise in world prices for SMP
relative to ghee, a change that is not yet fully reflected in the Indian market. For recombined
milk, the protection is about 18 percent. Effective protection coefficients range from 0.88 for
SMP on an import basis to 2.34 for ghee on an export basis. Since SMP and ghee are joint
products, the effective protection for milk, about 18 percent, provides the best overall measure of
current protection. As the industry has grown, the level of protection has fallen significantly as
world prices have risen in response to reduced export subsidies in the European Union and
United States. Under its New Economic Policy and its adherence to the World Trade
Organization, India is removing all quantitative controls on imports on dairy products. In 1993-
94, record procurement by Operation Flood led to record production of milk powder and ghee.
This led to depressed prices in India (as low as Rs 36,500 or US$1,160 a ton for SMP, versus
US$1,569 on the world market), and most MPUs recorded large losses, the majority of which
they subsequently made up. It is probably fair to say that the Indian dairy industry is at least as
competitive as the North American and European industries.
17.   The perishability of milk (it will spoil if not cooled within four hours of milking) and the
impossibility for consumers of knowing whether a given sample of milk is a health hazard
dictates a public interest in milk marketing. It is a simple matter to adulterate milk by adding
water (and thus perhaps fecal matter and associated health hazards); by correcting for spoilage
by the addition of caustic soda; by replacing easily cleaned stainless steel equipment with plastic
and mild steel; or indeed by bypassing the cow entirely, relying on a mixture of vegetable oil,
soap, and urea to produce "artificial milk." Since these devices can be used to reduce both
marketing margins and milk quality, there is a Gresham's Law of Dairying that states "poor milk
drives out good." To rely on the beneficial results of unregulated competition in such
circumstances is not in the public interest.
18.   India does not yet have the capacity, despite ample and appropriate regulations, to ensure
that milk is not contaminated. Small traders, in a field interview, listed bribes to the health
inspector to avoid having their milk tested as a routine cost of doing business. When detected by
corporate milk processors, poor quality milk simply commands a lower price: it is not usually
rejected. Thus, for all practical purposes, the Indian milk market is very largely unregulated.
Effective regulation is a major public health need. Without effective public health controls, there
is an evident tendency for ethical processors (those who observe the law) to be driven out of
business by unscrupulous processors.
19.   In the villages, there are many milk producers and few buyers. This is inherent in the
very small volumes of milk produced by any one farmer. Without an adjacent urban center to
ensure that depressed prices are countered by the entry of new buyers or a cooperative society
that ensures a benchmark milk price, the market structure involves many weak sellers with only
a few discretionary buyers. Farmers are the weak sellers, since their cows produce highly
perishable milk twice a day. An individual trader can easily choose not to buy on a particular
day. This situation is a recipe for market failure. Traders, in maximizing their own profits, can be
expected to act oligopolistically. They will maximize their short-term profits, even as they drive
the suppliers down their long-run supply curves and thus jeopardize long-term profits. At a
distance from urban centers and in the absence of a cooperative, there is no reason to expect milk



6
traders to act competitively. Policies predicated on competitive behavior are thus unlikely to
yield expected benefits.
20.   The Anand principles call for a three-tier system of cooperatives owned and controlled
by farmers, with professional management. They are to be free of government or political
interference and to have the right to set purchase and selling prices, to hire and fire staff, and go
bankrupt. A major rationale of the Bank-supported Second National Dairy project (NDPII) was
the conversion of cooperatives to the Anand pattern. All states that benefited under this follow-
on project signed undertakings to convert their cooperatives to the Anand pattern. Actual
compliance has been mixed, with many states still appointing civil servants as managing
directors of the federations or even MPUs and government nomination of at least some of the
directors to the federations and unions. By and large, farmers control the village DCSs.
Factionalism can be a problem but is not often serious. Even so, arbitrary and unhelpful rulings
by the local representative of the Registrar of Cooperatives occur. At the MPU and federation
level, the effects of government appointments are reflected in poor pricing decisions that
sometimes lead to losses. Thus, there are MPUs (notably, but not exclusively, in Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh) that are experiencing financial difficulty. This is recognized as a problem by
NDDB, and strong remedial steps are being taken, including the closing of three MPUs that have
no prospect of becoming profitable again. These problems are not inherent in the cooperative
structure but rather reflect the failure of the projects to achieve the full Anand structure for
cooperatives in the states concerned. These problems are exacerbated by the requirement that
cooperatives register under an archaic and paternalistic Cooperatives Act.
21.   The Bank's recent Livestock Sector Review for India concludes that Bank policy should
be to level the playing field between cooperatives and private companies in India's dairy sector.
The Bank report takes this to include eliminating all state intervention in cooperatives, repealing
the Milk and Milk Products Order (MMPO), establishing a mechanism to monitor the milk
market to ensure fair competition, and strengthening public monitoring and enforcement of
hygiene standards. This omits reference to the need to remove tax concessions and other
incentives provided to private investors.
22.   Both "ensuring fair competition" and "enforcing hygiene standards" are easier said than
done. Effective mechanisms for achieving these desirable objectives would very largely remove
the need for the MMPO. Private companies and full Anand-pattern cooperatives can be expected
to behave quite differently in a monopsony situation with cooperatives treating farmers (their
owners) more generously than private companies would. Thus, some (slight) tilt toward
cooperatives may be the best operational policy recommendation for encouraging (if not
ensuring) fair competition. For those who see no difference in the treatment of producers by
cooperatives and corporations, the recommendation of any tilt towards cooperatives will appear
unjustified.
23.   The problem of ineffective enforcement of hygiene standards is serious. The legislative
and administrative basis for enforcing hygiene standards is already in place. The problem is the
lack of enforcement of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act of 1954. Pending proper
enforcement of the act, retention of the MMPO provides another avenue for enforcing hygiene
standards. Unfortunately, it is not clear that the MMPO is being implemented any more
conscientiously than the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.



7
24.   Similarly, pending the removal of incentives for companies to invest in dairy plants, the
MMPO provides a slight restraint on the waste of public resources from the overexpansion of
private sector processing capacity, which absorbs large amounts of public direct investment and
tax concessions. In the Punjab alone, under these incentive programs, corporations have installed
or applied to install an extra 3.8 million liters/day of capacity to cope with an expected
production increase of 0.56 million liters/day. Up to half of this excess investment will be
provided from state funds.
Recommendations
25.   The policy recommendations that follow from the analysis in this impact study differ
slightly in content, and certainly in sequencing, from current Bank proposals:
* Elimination of all state intervention in Operation Flood cooperatives. Where this
involves the transfer of state-owned assets to the cooperatives, the cooperatives
could issue bonds to the state to be retired over a suitable period of time.
* Elimination of all government incentives for investment in the dairy industry. In the
absence of such a change, and as a distinct second best solution, any incentives
should be equally applicable to cooperative or corporate investments.
* A renewed effort to enforce the provisions of the Prevention of Food Adulteration
Act of 1954. This should include inspection and approval of quality control/milk
testing procedures of processors, inspection of processing facilities, and testing
dudhiya milk supplies for adulteration. This would require increased state
expenditures. However, the sums involved are dwarfed by the savings which would
follow from the withdrawal of government incentives. The livestock sector review
suggests that states could experiment with paying private sector organizations to
carry out the inspection and enforcement function.
26.   Pending successful implementation of the above three conditions, repeal of the MMIPO
would be premature. This is an issue of sequencing of reforms. The MMPO provides a weak
bulwark against overinvestment, substandard equipment, and unhygienic operating conditions.
27.   Continued support for the Indian dairy industry can be justified by the intention to bring
about the policies recommended in para. 25 and perhaps afterward, depending on whether a tilt
towards cooperatives is felt to be appropriate.
28.   At the very least, there should be no further lending to the dairy sector in states which
have not yet adopted the full Anand pattern for Operation Flood cooperatives or do not treat
these cooperatives equally with private corporations.
Lessons                                 1
29.   As has been hinted at earlier, the very success of the expansion of the Indian dairy
industry poses in a stark fashion the question of attribution. To what extent was this a reaction to
increased demand, itself a function of rising incomes and population increase? To what extent
can it be attributed to technology, such as increased straw from the Green Revolution and the
adoption of crossbred cattle? What part did the removal of the risk of price declines based on



8
massive imports of milk products affect the willingness of farmers and private processors to
invest? What part was played by Operation Flood's demonstration to other investors of the
potential viability of well-organized and modem processing of milk collected from a large
number of small producers? What role did individual and prescient personalities play? (Neither
the visit of the prime minister of India nor the visit of the president of the Bank was an entirely
unorchestrated event.)
30.   Despite these attribution problems, a first lesson stands out:
Lesson 1: A well conceived investment project in support of an already adopted
and appropriate policy change can be associated with results out of all proportion to the
investment involved. This occurs in part because it solves the "ownership" problem, in
part because it avoids having to create an institution at the same time that the new
institution is being expected to implement the project, and in part perhaps for a number
of reasons not yet well understood.
This lesson intentionally finesses the exact extent of causation involved.
31.   A second lesson concerns the multidimensional impact of the project:
Lesson 2: By raising incomes, an apparently simple single-commodity project
can have multiple beneficial effects, including nutrition, education (especially of girls),
and job-creation.
This poses a question as to the relative efficiency of production projects that aim to reduce
poverty directly, as compared to health, nutrition, and education projects designed to remove
poverty indirectly or area development projects designed to intervene in many ways
simultaneously.
32.    Though not explicitly a "targeted" project, nevertheless 60 percent of the beneficiaries
were marginal or small farmers and landless.
Lesson 3: By focusing a project on a predominant activity of the poor, "self-
selection" is likely to result in a major portion of the beneficiaries being poor.
This provides an alternative to "targeted" projects for reaching the poor.

1.  Introduction
Design Features of Bank Dairy Projects
1.1    Bank dairy projects have adopted two distinct strategies (Table 1.1). The first focuses on
remedying a production shortage by providing new and genetically superior purebred dairy
stock, often imported. The second (the Operation Flood model) involves provision of a reliable
marketfor existingproducers. There is overlap in these designs in that both provide for milk
processing. The first model includes milk collection, but primarily from its "own" farmers, and
the second model includes access to inputs, veterinary services, and crossbred cattle. Despite this
overlap, the models are clearly distinct.

1.2    Only in the case of Turkey was the production strategy unambiguously successful (with
a reestimated economic rate of return (ERR) of 19 percent). The Zambian project is of particular
interest, since it was designed as a "production" project but implemented as a "marketing"
project. The project was appraised on the assumption that crossbred cattle could be freely
imported from Zimbabwe. However, the 1980-81 drought led to a ban on cattle exports from
Zimbabwe, and transport costs made it uneconomic to purchase cattle from further afield. This
led to a redesign and sharp contraction of the milk production component. Nevertheless, milk
collections exceeded the original projections, about half of them from existing small producers.
At audit, the five projects that are the subject of this impact evaluation were considered
satisfactory. Howc ver, before it is concluded that "marketing is the way to go," it should be
noted that an attempt to redesign the first Sri Lankan dairy project from a production project
(which was proving unsatisfactory) to a cooperative marketing (Anand-type) project was not
successful, and the dairy component of the Pakistan Livestock project (Ln. 1366), which was
modeled on Operation Flood, was also judged unsatisfactory.

Project Context
1.3    The first of the five Indian dairy projects included in this study was approved by the
Board in March 1974. At that time, India was following a self-reliant macroeconomic
development policy with heavy emphasis on import substitution (a policy which remained
essentially unchanged until 1991). In the dairy sector, a policy decision had been made to utilize
farmer-controlled cooperatives to develop the dairy industry and to make the import substitution
as efficient as possible. The government also decided to withdraw from its own direct efforts to
develop the dairy industry (indirect efforts via extension, research, artificial breeding, etc.,
continued). Dairy commodity food aid was to be sold at commercial prices with the proceeds
earmarked for support of this Operation Flood.
1.4    The inauguration of Operation Flood corresponded to a turnaround in per capita
incomes, which had been falling, to a period of sustained, if modest, growth. Rising per capita
incomes, together with rising population and a high income elasticity of demand for milk,
resulted in a rapid growth in the demand for milk (technically, a rapid shift in the demand
function for milk). In the absence of supply-side adjustment, this would have led to a rapid
escalation in the price of milk or the need for extensive imports. In fact, the shift in the supply
function from the policy changes introduced with Operation Flood resulted in an even larger
shift in the supply (function) and declining real prices towards international prices, thus reducing
the implicit taxation of consumers.
1.5    Operation Flood is an Indian program to foster a farmer-controlled cooperative dairy
industry capable of paying an attractive price for very small quantities (1 or 2 liters) of milk
without operational subsidies. Operation Flood was developed in the context of less successful
policies which have been summarized:
In 1959, the government of India set up the Delhi Milk Scheme, starting a new pattern for dairy
development. This pattern was based on the government milk plants collecting milk at its chilling
centers through traditional middlemen, pasteurizing it and marketing it in glass bottles through
specially set up milk booths all over the city. This pattern was followed until the 1960s in almost
100 cities of the country where similar "Milk Schemes" were set up under state development
programs. During this period, the government also started Intensive Cattle Development Projects
(ICDPs) which focused on providing artificial insemination and veterinary services to the milk
producers. Such programs were further supported with credit to the farmers through Small Farmer
Development Agencies (SFDAs).
The government milk schemes ran into serious problems. When a milk scheme was started, it paid
a reasonable price to the farmer, charged its overheads to the consumers and the consumer was
provided with good quality milk at reasonable prices. However, during the summer months, when
supplies dwindle and prices go up, the milk schemes were unable to raise the producer prices and
their supplies dwindled. The milk schemes then resorted to the import of milk powder to augment
their meager supplies. Since the imported powder was rather cheap, the milk schemes were able to
maintain low prices in the cities. This removed the incentive of the urban markets for rurally-
produced milk, and India's milk production remained stagnant, and its dependency on imports
gradually increased.
1. More accurately "stagnation."

Providing credit for the purchase of milch2 animals also did not work as it did not contribute to
bringing in any additional milch animals to the production system and was merely a transfer of
resources-many times only on paper. This, however, brought a bad name to the dairy
cooperative movement in many parts of the country as the loans were provided through
cooperatives who were supposed to recover the loans through milk money. Many of those who
took loans did not bring their milk to the cooperatives and instead sold it directly to the traditional
traders. Large amount of loans had, therefore, to be written off. The mid-60s was a trying period
in the history of the Indian dairying as the dairy development schemes of the government did not
seem to work, milk supply in the cities had to be rationed, imports of as much as 60,000 tons per
years had to be resorted to, to feed the milk supply schemes which were handling less than I
million liters of milk per day. Above all, the dumping of cheap imported milk powder was
working against the interest of the indigenous milk producers (Aneja 1994, pp. 13 and 14).
In October 1964, on the occasion of the inauguration of AMUL's cattle feed plant, the then Prime
Minister of India, Lal Bahadur Shastri, spent the night as the guest of a village milk cooperative
society near Anand. Impressed by the socioeconomic changes brought about by the milk
cooperatives, he expressed the desire for a national-level organization to replicate Anand Model
dairy cooperatives throughout the country... .Thus, in 1965, NDDB (the National Dairy
Development Board) was registered (Banerjee 1994, p. 11).
1.6    Ten years of staff work from the Delhi office culminated in a visit to Anand in 1978 by
the Bank's then-President, Robert McNamara (Box 1.1). This visit resulted in an offer to support
an extension of the program with funding from the International Development Association
(IDA). At the same time, the European Community (EC) decided to use a significant portion of
its dairy surplus to support Operation Flood directly, rather than indirectly through the WFP. The
result was Operation Flood II (OFII) funded by the NDDB, the government of India, the World
Bank (through National Dairy I, Cr. 824), the EC (through food aid), and the farmer-owners of
the village dairy cooperative societies (DCSs). The earlier Bank-supported state projects
continued to be supported, but as an integral part of OFII.
1.7    The National Dairy project (NDP, or OFII) significantly exceeded the target number of
milk producers unions (MPUs) to be formed (125 new MPUs versus a target of 50) and DCSs
(29,400 new DCSs versus a target of 20,000). Despite the more rapid growth rate, the DCSs
formed conformed to the Anand pattern of farmer control. The same could not be said for the
federations and MPUs. Though the details varied from state to state, farmer control was diluted
or usurped by appointment of civil servants and politicians and NDDB or federation cadres to
serve on the boards of the federation and MPUs. Most MPUs had elected farmer representation,
and in many, farmer representatives were in the majority, but the Anand principles of farmer
control, including the right to set prices, hire and fire, and go bankrupt, had been undermined.4
2. That is, a cow or buffalo.
3. Among the key principles of the Anand model were village dairy cooperative societies (DCSs) organized into milk
producers unions (MPUs) at the district/regional level, which in turn were members of a statewide dairy cooperative
federation. This three-tier structure, which was farmer-owned and employed professional managers, formed a single-
purpose dairy cooperative that provided a guaranteed market for milk (paid for in cash at approximately weekly
intervals) and provided help with modern inputs such as artificial insemination (Al), veterinary services, and
concentrates. Farmer ownership meant that these cooperatives, like other private sector organizations, could go
bankrupt, since there were no state guarantees.
4. This failure to get adoption of the full Anand principles underlies much of the academic literature critical of
Operation Flood.

Box 1.1: Early Bank Interest in Operation Flood
"Amul's milk collection system is efficient and businesslike. Villagers line up twice a day at
village collection centers where they receive a uniform price. The contribution of each farmer is tested for
fat content on the spot. Quality tests are also conducted upon arrival at the factory. Cash payment for the
morning milk is paid in the evening and payment for the evening milk is paid the following mornmg.
Several private trucking frms (selected by competitive tender) carry the milk from the village to Anand.
Collection and delivery follow a rigorous schedule. Bulk transport of pasteurized milk from Bombay, a 270
milk haul, is done by refrigerated rail car" (memorandum to files, October 17, 1968).
"When we last talked of the possible staff contribution of the Agricultural Division to the Fourth
Plan Review... .I suggested that livestock development with special emphasis on 'dairy' might be one of
the subsectors deserving additional study by the Bank... .Besides reviewing research results and
Government and cooperative dairy schemes and plans, a dairy man would need to look into the activities of
private firms such as Hindustan Lever, Nestle, Polsons and Glaxo, also active in the dairy field" (letter,
October 18, 1968).
"Anand is, statistically, all that was reported and Kurien said at Reading. What you have to
experience to believe is the enthusiasm of a highly skilled team of technologists and marketeers working in
an atmosphere that is modem and delightful. K takes a great interest in the architecture of his factories and
the 'surrounds' are like a Garden City.
". . the future lies with the hybrid cow-in the beginning a first cross of European milk breed
(mainly Jersey) on the native cow which in one generation will double production and about halve costs of
production. It's the most exciting cattle development prospect in the world at the present time. It has
possible repercussions beyond India along the lines, for Southeast Asia, I discussed with you... .last year.
"... In my view the prospect is the animal equivalent of the rice and wheat story with the
possibility of even greater initial gains and impact upon costs of production which, with the buffalo, can
only remain high" (letter, March 3, 1969).
"One key organizational issue concerns the relationship between state livestock departments
(largely veterinary-oriented) and the National Dairy Development Board ....The technical side (of any
project proposal) will also call for detailed review so as to bring a rational nutritional and breeding policy
to bear on any project put to the Bank for support. Dairy Engineering, on the other hand, is a field in which
India has built up considerable expertise. The bottlenecks mostly on the farm" (memorandum, January 13,
1970).
"I have now been to Anand.... I do not think we have a project here in the near future but I would
consider it a possibility for FYI 974. In the mean time I think it will be worthwhile to take more than a
passing interest in the way Operation Flood develops. . ." (letter, June 14, 1971).
1.8    This set the stage for the second National Dairy project (NDPII) or Operation Flood III
(OFIII), where the first nominated project objective was:
(a) Adjustment in cooperative institutional structures towards characteristics of the OF model
(elected boards for DCSs, MPUs or Federations, model bylaws insuring democratic and
accountable operations, professional management answerable to the cooperative boards,
management and ownership by the cooperatives of dairy infrastructure, autonomy for each
cooperative in pricing, marketing, appointment of key personnel, and employment of labor).
(SAR, National Dairy II, p. 12)



13
1.9    This project also involved major investments in dairy processes and transport equipment,
help in the formation of additional MPUs (in the event unused) and DCSs, staff training, and
improved dairy technology, but the key project objective was to restore the full Anand pattern of
farmer control, which had been eroded under the "too-fast" growth that had occurred under the
NDP.
1.10   As an aside, it may be noted that the NDP could have followed either of two growth
strategies. A slow growth strategy would have extended the project only to those states willing to
adopt the full Anand model as a precondition for Bank-supported investments. The alternative
fast growth strategy involved setting up federations and MPUs even in states that were not
willing to relinquish all control to boards elected by farmers. The expectation in this latter case
was that Operation Flood could "work from within" and persuade state politicians of the value of
full farmer control and the Anand principles. In the event, the fast growth strategy was adopted;
and even with hindsight, it is not possible to fault this decision. It was the hope of correcting the
deviations from Anand principles that had occurred during the implementation of the NDP that
provided the rationale for the NDPII.
1.11   The NDDB, does not fit easily into any of the pigeonholes that constitute the Bank's
normal institutional paradigm. Described by Liana Gertsch (1990) as "corporatism," the NDDB
can perhaps best be described in the Bank lexicon as "a parastatal operating in the producer's
interests," almost paradoxical in Bank experience. Formally a parastatal (with all its board
members appointed by the government), it has "sworn an affidavit before the Bombay High
Court that it is not a government agency .... Perhaps a better indication that it leaned more
towards the private sector is that in order to gain access to funds generated by the sale of
commodities, it had to create a wholly public institution (the Indian Dairy Corporation (IDC))
with legal right to engage in commercial activity on behalf of government" (Gertsch 1990). In
practice, the NDDB established its financial independence (and hence managerial autonomy)
through the sale of concessionally-priced dairy imports. Not beholden to the government for
funding, the NDDB acts as the technocratic (and policy) apex organization for the dairy
cooperative movement.5
Literature Review
1.12   There has been a flood of literature on Operation Flood and the dairy sector in India
(Alderman, Mergos, and Slade 1987). An important and critical strand of this literature has been
generated by the Indo-Dutch Program on Alternatives in Development, sponsored by Dutch Aid.
The work of these Indo-Dutch authors is summarized in two books that, while critical of
Operation Flood, offer few alternative policy prescriptions (Doornbos and Nair 1990; Doornbos
and others 1990). Recently, the Bank has also criticized the cooperative sector (World Bank
Reports 1996). Ranged on the other side are indigenous authors such as Somjee and Somjee
(1989), Mascarenhas (1993, 1988), and T. Shah (1991).
1.13   Topics discussed at length in the literature are:
* Production Impact. It is generally agreed that the rate of growth in Indian milk
production has increased significantly during the lifetime of Operation Flood (Fulton
5. It has also taken on, or been assigned, a number of other cooperative tasks not directly related to dairying.



14
and Bhargava 1994; Kumar and Singh 1993). But even this has been challenged
(Mishra and Shanna 1990). However, the critics emphasize, quite correctly, that this
increase in milk production should not be attributed exclusively to Operation Flood
(Doombos and others 1990; Nair 1985; Aneja 1994).
*  Socioeconomic Impact. The apologists emphasize that some landless, tribal, and
marginal farmers have benefited (nearly 60 percent of milk producers are landless or
marginal farmers) (Fulton and Bhargava 1994). The critics argue that much of the
increased milk income went to large farmers and that many landless and otherwise
disadvantaged were unable to benefit from Operation Flood.6
*  Women. Apologists point to the efforts made to include women in DCSs, even to the
point of establishing women-only DCSs. Critics emphasize the number of mixed
(that is, male-dominated) DCSs. Somewhat confused messages emerge from the
debate, since there is no consensus as to whether more or less work for women is to
be welcomed. Certainly some critics cite the withdrawal of women from the
domestic manufacture of ghee in order to sell whole milk as a loss for the
"subordinate gender" (George 1991).
*  Implementation. Critics have pointed to a contradiction between the development of
the initial Anand village cooperatives, which were formed by farmers on their own
initiative, and Operation Flood, which is seen as a "top-dowvn" program dedicated to
persuading villagers to form DCSs. These critics also doubt the realism of
attempting to replicate the Anand pattern nationwide, given the diversity of states in
India (Joshi 1990; Shekhawat 1990). Apologists acknowledge that progress toward
the Anand pattern differs markedly among states and cite various modifications to
the structure of DCSs and the services provided to show that Operation Flood has
been implemented adaptively. Also, though "spearhead" teams attempt to interest
villages in the formation of DCSs, the final decision rests with the villages, not the
spearhead team.>
*  Sustainability. Critics concerned about the level of assistance provided to Operation
Flood in the period of its most rapid expansion doubted whether it would be able to
survive without such assistance (Doornbos and others 1990). Other writers have
pointed to the rapid decline and phasing out of this assistance as evidence that this
problem has not eventuated (Chaterjee and Acharaya 1992).
1.14   Total project cost was US$1.6 billion-US$0.9 billion as grant and US$0.7 as loan
(1996 dollars). These resources were channeled predominantly through NDDB. Most of the
money was passed on to MPUs for construction of milk processing plants with a 30 percent grant
element. It also paid for development of the national milk grid, establishment of DCSs, and some
of the costs of the development of NDDB's support capacity. Currently, NDDB receives no
6. A number of schemes have tried to give the poor access to Operation Flood by providing milch animals (often on
credit). In fact, the more binding constraint for the landless is often a lack of free or cheap fodder, a problem that
cannot be remedied by a single capital injection.
7. More precisely, both the village and the MPU have a veto. Both must agree on the desirability of a DCS, since the
MPU will collect milk only from a DCS with sufficient volume (or the promise of sufficient volume) to cover the
variable costs of milk collection.

operational subsidies. Even though Operation Flood handles only 6.3 percent of Indian milk
production, it is a huge undertaking. Operation Flood operates in 22 states, but the bulk of its
procurement (46 percent) is obtained from two states-Gujarat and Maharashtra (Table 4.2). In
1996, it had 9.3 million members and NDDB estimates 6.3 million "pouring" members,8 who
supply 10,900 metric tons of milk per day through 55,042 village-level DCSs to 170 MPUs for
processing and sale. Some of the expansion of Operation Flood does not represent new milk
production but rather a switch from home manufacture of ghee and other products or from milk
previously sold to informal milk buyers (dudhiyas). Fortunately, there is a rich Indian literature
on Operation Flood. This has been examined, together with Bank internal reports and files. The
evaluator visited a total of 40 villages in five states to discuss with farmer members and
managing committees their experience of Operation Flood. This included women-only DCSs,
DCSs which were thriving, DCSs which had closed and reopened, and even a DCS which had
closed and stayed closed. Discussions were held with academics, formal sector milk processors,
and the small-scale, informal dudhiya milk collectors who provide keen competition for the
cooperatives in peri-urban areas. A two-day workshop was held at the Institute of Rural
Management at Anand, Gujarat state, in March 1997 to discuss the draft report with academics
and managers in the dairy industry.9 The project's impact on the intended beneficiaries was
studied more formally through participatory evaluations in nine villages in Karnataka and a
repeat survey in Madhya Pradesh to capitalize on "semi-baseline" data available from 1983.
1.15   The evaluation intended to focus on five questions:
-  What have other commentators, both national and foreign, said about the program?
In responding to this question, the evaluation has been fortunate in having only to
extend a literature review published in 1987 (Alderman, Mergos, and Slade 1987;
Kumar 1997) (paras. 1.12-1.13).
*  How has the expansion of Operation Flood compared with the growth of the rest of
the Indian dairy industry? Did the rate of growth of the dairy industry change
perceptibly with the introduction of Operation Flood? What role, if any, can be
attributed to the Bank's assistance in the growth of Operation Flood? (paras. 6.3-
6.11 and Figure 7.1).
*  How competitive is the Indian dairy industry? Is this a case where an "infant
industry" that initially had to be supported with grant and concessional funds has
finally reached the point where support is no longer required? If not, how significant
is the support required? (paras. 4.32-4.34).
* What was the impact on the poor? (paras. 1.16, 5.9, and 6.34-6.35).
8. Originally, there was only one member per family, and only families supplying (or "pouring") milk could be
members. Thus, members and "pouring members" were synonymous. Over time, in part to give greater access to
women, some DCSs have come to allow two members per family, some members who have ceased to pour have been
allowed to retain their membership, and members in DCSs which have closed have not been removed from the books.
NDDB estimates that about 68 percent of members (that is, 6.3 million people) supply milk to a DCS at some time
during the year.
9. This workshop was dominated by representatives of the cooperative sector. However, the list of invitees included
donor organizations, the private sector, and government policymakers. Representation was diverse enough to
encompass a wide range of views on the industry and the draft report. The assistance of the Swiss Development
Corporation in providing funds for this workshop is gratefully acknowledged.



16
Can the impact be improved? (paras. 7.27-7.34).
In the event, as described in Chapter 6, a wide range of other unforeseen benefits were associated
with Operation Flood. These included impact on each of the Bank's four overarching objectives
of poverty alleviation, women in development, governance, and the environment. Findings with
respect to these four objectives are summarized in the next sections.
1.16   Poverty. Operation Flood was not designed as a production or poverty project. However,
by virtue of providing a market to very small milk producers, the majority of its beneficiaries
were marginal or small farmers and landless. This did not exclude the "better off' (many of
whom are poor in any absolute sense), but it did include a majority of poor beneficiaries (albeit
poor who happen to have, or are able to obtain, at least one milch animal). As the 1987
Performance Audit Report (PAR) said:
Not only are the level and nature of the benefits flowing to members of the established DCSs
impressive overall, but the extent to which such benefits are reaching the extremely poor and
needy (destitute, widows, landless and near-landless) in certain 'spearhead' villages is unusually
noteworthy; and also indicative of the AMUL (Anand Milk Union Ltd.) model's potential to
benefit a target group which is widely espoused by all donors, including especially the Bank, but
which has proved elusive to reach in practice (para. 2.4).
Operation Flood turned out to be a major income- (paras. 6.34-6.35) and employment- (6.47)
generating project.
1.17    Women. "Women's issues" are touched on in the above quotation by the mention of
"widows." However, neither the Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs) nor the PAR make explicit
mention of women. Anecdotal evidence suggests that not only widows but also wives have
benefited disproportionately from Operation Flood. Not only do women often look after the dairy
animal(s), but also the sums of money received are typically used for running the household
(cattle feed, food, clothes, and educational requirements) (paras. 5.7, 6.34, 6.38, and 6.42).
Operation Flood has cooperated with NGOs, notably the Self-employed Women's Association
(SEWA) and Bhagavatula Charitable Trust (BCT), to establish, in some cases with Ford
Foundation support, 6,000 women-only dairy cooperative societies. These are generally thought
to operate more smoothly than the male-dominated DCSs.10
10. A much less sanguine view has been expressed in the Bank's study of gender in India (World Bank 1991):
4.15    All the constraints to women's access to public programs and commercial transactions with the
'outside' which have been outlined earlier are operative in the dairy sector. The common pattern is for women to
handle most of the production aspects and for the men to assume the cooperative membership and control the cash
income. There are a number of problems associated with this traditional 'inside/outside' division of labor. Some
affect the overall efficiency of dairy production, others affect the welfare returns to the family and to the woman
producer herself. Women, for example, do not usually gain access to training in modern livestock management
and dairying techniques which is available to men through the co-op structure. Instead, they must learn second-
hand through the men or continue with traditional practices, both of which lower their efficiency and reduce
returns to investments in training. Non-member producers also miss the chance to be trained in the responsibilities
and rights associated with cooperative membership and to benefit from the exposure provided by Farmers
Induction Training and other member activities.
4.16    For women from poor households the greatest disadvantage is, however, that they have no control over
dairy income which is collected by the male household member. In cases where the women used to deal with
traditional milk traders who came to the household compound, they lose what small degree of economic
autonomy they had when marketing arrangements are formalized through the cooperative structure. The fact that

1.18   Privatization and Governance. The projects were not consciously designed to be
innovative with respect to privatization and governance. Nevertheless, their emphasis on village-
level DCSs and farmer control of MPUs and state cooperative dairy federations meant that they
broke new ground in supporting membership-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) (in
this case cooperatives) (World Bank Reports 1996), development, and project administration.
Because DCSs are, in principle at least, open to all, they represent a major addition to village
social capital." The difficulty in getting true independence for the cooperative movement is one
of the themes/issues explored in this evaluation (paras. 4.17-4.21).
1.19    Both cooperatives and companies can exist in either the public or private sector. Public
sector companies are generally referred to as parastatals. Private sector cooperatives are referred
to in India as farmer-controlled or (full) Anand-pattern cooperatives. In most states the dairy
cooperatives are to some degree mixed, with the state imposing decisions on pricing or staffing,
often with some state ownership of productive assets. It is thus a false dichotomy to talk of
public sector cooperatives versus private sector companies.
1.20   As between private sector cooperatives and companies, there is no difference in the
managerial objectives; in both cases, management aims to maximize the return to the owners.
The difference is in the owners. In a private company, the owners are the suppliers of capital,
while in a producer cooperative the owners are the input suppliers (milk suppliers in the case of
Operation Flood). This has important behavioral implications with respect to the exercise of
monopsony power. A private single buyer will seek to minimize procurement price, since this
will maximize the return to the owners. Cooperatives have no such incentive to lower prices
excessively, since any profit from a lower price will only need to be returned to the producers,
who are the owners.
1.21    In the villages, there are many milk producers and few buyers. (This is inherent in the
very small volumes of milk produced by any one farner.) Without an adjacent urban center to
ensure that depressed prices are countered by the entry of new buyers or a cooperative society
that ensures a benchmark milk price, the market structure involves many weak sellers with only
milk payments to cooperative members in many villages are, for efficiency reasons, now made less frequently
and, hence, in larger sums, has apparently increased the likelihood that at least some of the money is diverted by
the men before essential household expenses are met. In short, for non-member women producers, Operation
Flood has too often meant more dairy work but no increase, and sometimes even a decrease, in their access to
dairy income.

Since India is a big and diverse country, both views may be right. The evaluation met many women in the field who
had been greatly advantaged by Operation Flood.
11. An internal memorandum of November 14, 1996, states:
The Bank's Social Development Task Force has described social capital as follows: Social capital is not just the
sum of institutions which underpin society, it is also the glue that holds them together. It is the shared values and
rules for social conduct expressed in personal relationships, trusts, and a common sense of 'civic' responsibility
that makes society more than a collection of individuals. Without a degree of common identification with forms
of governance, cultural norms, and social rules, it is impossible to imagine a functioning society.
The promotion of DCSs, which are male-dominated, is viewed by some as a missed opportunity. They argue that given
the dominant role of women in dairy production, the DCSs (and extension services) should have been designed to give
women a dominant role. Where they have emerged, WDCSs have vitally changed the role of women within the village
and thus added significantly to social capital.

a few discretionary buyers. Farmers are the weak sellers, since their cows produce highly
perishable milk twice a day.12 An individual trader can easily choose not to buy on a particular
day. This situation is a recipe for market failure. Traders, in maximizing their own profits, can be
expected to act oligopolistically. They will maximize their short-term profits, even as they drive
the suppliers down their long-run supply functions and jeopardize long-term profits. Absent a
cooperative and at a distance from urban centers, there is no reason to expect milk traders to act
competitively. Policies predicated on competitive behavior are thus unlikely to yield expected
benefits.
1.22    The Environment. Dairy plant effluent, if not treated, has a high biological oxygen
demand and can be a serious pollutant of surface water and aquifers. Effluent treatment plants
were an integral part of Bank-financed processing plants. However, the high cost of operating
these plants tempted some MPUs to bypass or underutilize their plants. This was identified as a
problem in project supervision in the early- and mid-project stages. Current operation is believed
to be satisfactory, but because of high cost, proper effluent treatment needs to be monitored from
an independent authority.
Report Structure
1.23   The next chapter reviews project design, and the third chapter discusses the impact of the
first four projects. Chapter 4 describes developments under the most recently completed project.
Chapter 5 reports the major findings from participatory village studies commissioned in
Kamataka and Madhya Pradesh. The sixth and longest chapter focuses on current impact. A
seventh and final chapter contains findings and recommendations.
12. Milk can be processed into ghee (butter oil), chenna (homemade cottage cheese), or mithaz (traditional sweets). All
of these byproducts are highly fuel- and labor- (women's labor) intensive. These technical possibilities do not
substantially strengthen the farmers' bargaining position.

2.    Project Design
Karnataka
2.1    The first of the three state projects was in Karnataka, where dairying was already fairly
advanced. There were 400 existing dairy cooperatives at the village level, the Bangalore Dairy
Milk Producers Cooperative Society Union (serving Bangalore), and many multipurpose
cooperative societies. A key thrust of the project was to incorporate the existing dairy
cooperatives into an Anand-type three-tier cooperative structure. The project also planned to
open about 500 dairy "wings" within the multipurpose cooperatives, which would be converted
to single-purpose Anand-type cooperatives when volume and experience justified it. New DCSs
were to be established in villages without cooperatives to bring the total number of project-
sponsored DCSs to 1,800. The DCSs would be organized into four MPUs, which would own the
Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDDC). The DCSs were projected to serve a total
of 450,000 farm families. Production would be stimulated by an artificial insemination (AI)
program of crossbreeding native village cattle with high-producing exotic breeds, help with
fodder production, veterinary services supported by two regional diagnostic laboratories,
consultant services to assist the KDDC with demonstration farms, applied research trials on
pastures, and milk marketing studies. Hardware was to include the renovation of two processing
plants, the construction of two new processing plants and four cattle feed mills, and the
establishment of milk collection routes and centers. Provision was also made for the importation
of 500 in-calf heifers to stock three KDDC farms to produce purebred exotic breeding stock.
2.2    The KDDC was set up as a parastatal. (The central government was to contribute Rs 2.5
million and the state government Rs 0.8 million of equity plus Rs 3.2 million of working capital
to be shared, in unspecified proportions, between the governments.) As part of this transaction,
the state government was to transfer its dairy plants and other assets to KDDC. The governments
undertook to gradually sell their equity to the MPUs at cost, starting in the sixth project year,
with the expectation that by the tenth year the MPUs would be majority shareholders in KDDC.
In the event, the governments did not sell their equity to the MPUs. Under NDP, the name of
KDDC was changed to the Karnataka Milk Federation, but its parastatal structure remained
unchanged. In Karnataka, significant progress has been made towards professionalizing the
management of the dairy industry, but ownership of state dairy plants has still not been legally
transferred to the federation. Thus, the state still has residual powers flowing from its initial
investment in KDDC and its failure to transfer title as expected. With hindsight and recognition
of the debilitating effects of government interference in management, it would probably have
been better to insist on a fully cooperative structure from the start. Similar design difficulties
have affected the other two state projects.
2.3    The project was to be guided by the NDDB, which would provide "spearhead" teams to
assist with the establishment of both MPUs and the village-level DCSs that would supply them.
DCS membership was to be limited to cattle owners, 10 percent of whom were expected to be
landless.13 A further 50 percent were to be marginal farmers with less than 2 ha. of land.
13. In later years the prestige of DCS membership, and the desire to allow both husband and wife to belong, has led to
a breakdown of this criterion in some DCSs. A survey in Karnataka (Sampark 1997) found, in addition to double



20
2.4    A very rapid expansion of milk production was projected, mainly based on the
replacement of local dairy and buffalo breeds with crossbred dairy cows. The semen used in the
Al program was to come mainly from Jerseys and Fresians. As a result of this breed change,
which would be supported by readily available veterinary services and improved concentrate
supply, milk production in a typical DCS was expected to rise from 60,000 liters/year (1/year) to
290,000 1/year in the fifth year of the project.
2.5   The bulk of International Development Association (IDA) funds (US$26.4 million) were
to be channeled through the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC), a parastatal bank, to the
KDDC and MPUs. Loans for dairy plant construction were to be supported by a 20 percent
equity participation from the central and state governments in order to retain a 4:1 debt-to-equity
ratio in the MPU. This financing arrangement applied also to the two other state projects. Parallel
arrangements were made for local banks to provide credit for the purchase of cattle and feed. The
ARC would stand ready to refinance these loans, giving the banks a 2 percent margin under their
lending rate.
2.6   The major foreign exchange costs of the project were the expansion of the Bangalore and
Mysore milk processing plants, the construction of new processing plants at Hassan and Tumkur
and four new feed mills, and investments in KDDC farms and technical services.
Rajasthan
2.7   The Rajasthan credit was for US$27.7 million. Rajasthan had a government milk scheme
that subsidized urban milk prices but had failed to stimulate the emergence of a cooperative
sector. This failure was recognized in 1972, and the Rajasthan Animal Husbandry Department
commenced the organization of dairy cooperative societies based on the Anand pattern. At
appraisal, there were some 100 such societies organized into two unions, which were to form
part of the project.
2.8   The project called for the creation of a new apex organization, the Rajasthan Dairy
Development Corporation (RDDC), to foster the development of five MPUs, which would
process and market milk from a total of 1,800 DCSs. In turn, the DCSs would collect milk from
a total of 240,000 families, most having less than 2 ha. of land or being entirely landless.
2.9   Provision was also made for the importation of 100 exotic in-calf heifers and 33 bulls,
dairy plants and feed mills for the MPUs, a regional diagnostic laboratory and production of
vaccines, consulting services, and a training center for each MPU. There was no provision for
direct farm-level credit, since the ARC already operated a credit scheme for wells and minor
irrigation.
2.10   The NDDB was again to be relied upon to provide key staff and spearhead teams to help
establish the MPUs and DCSs. All procurement of Bank-funded items would be by the RDDC;
and Bank funds would flow to the MPUs and RDDC through the government of India and ARC.
(husband and wife) membership, members who did not supply milk to the DCS and some who did not even have milch
animals.



21
Madhya Pradesh
2.11   The Madhya Pradesh credit was for US$16.4 million. The dairy industry, as well as the
cooperative movement, was underdeveloped in Madhya Pradesh. Started in 1960 to supply the
government of Madhya Pradesh's milk plants, the cooperative movement suffered from low
official milk prices, and at appraisal only 100 dairy cooperative societies were active.
2.12   At project inception, the government milk scheme was in disarray. It provided about 10
percent of urban demand at Rs 1.70 per liter (compared with Rs 1.50-2.50 per liter in the private
market). Producer prices were not competitive. The government-operated milk plants had a
capacity of 20,000 liters/day (I/day) in Bhopal and Indore, and 2,000 I/day in Ratlam, Ujjain, and
Hoshangabad. The project called for a complete revamping of supply with the construction of
three 100,000 I/day plants, each capable of expansion to 200,000 I/day. These plants would each
be the center of three MPUs under the auspices of a new umbrella organization, the Madhya
Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation (MPDDC). Each MPU would have 400 newly-formed
DCSs with memberships of about 130 farm families (predominantly small farmers and the
landless) for a project total of 160,000 families. Equipment for the milk-processing plants and
associated feed mills would take about 80 percent of the foreign exchange costs of the project.
2.13   Other important project components were the importation of 100 exotic cattle for
crossbreeding, the provision of consulting services, and the construction of a training center for
each MPU. The NDDB was to be contracted to supply at least some of the consulting services
and spearhead teams to facilitate the establishment of the MPUs and to take the lead in the
formation of village-level DCSs. In accord with the Anand principles, the DCSs, MPUs, and
MPDDC would be farmer-controlled. Initial working and start-up capital, to be provided by the
governments of India and Madhya Pradesh, would be repaid out of profits, so that eventually
both ownership and control would be in the hands of farmers. The MPUs and MPDDC would
employ professional managers and technicians, again in accord with the Anand principles; they
would also be free to set retail and farm-gate milk prices.
2.14   Funds would flow from the Bank to the government of India, which would channel
US$2.75 million to the state government for training and extension services and the balance
through the ARC to participating local banks and hence to the MPDDC and MPUs. The MPDDC
was to be the sole procurement agent for all items financed by the Bank.
The National Dairy Project
2.15   This fourth dairy project was an integral part of OFII, which was to be jointly funded by
the Bank (US$150 million from the IDA), the EC (US$ 100 million in the form of food aid), and
the government of India (Rs 94 million, or US$10.9 million as a grant, and a further Rs 670
14
million ($77.7 million) as a loan); farmers were to contribute Rs 48 million (US$5.6 million).
This relatively large project followed a visit in 1978 by then-President of the Bank (Mr.
McNamara) to Anand and his offer to Dr. Kurien to provide major funding for a successor
project to OFI.
14. In the event, the government of India's projected contribution was not needed. (Annex B, Tables B7 and B8 show
projected, SAR, estimated, and actual financing.)



22
2.16    Conceptually, the NDP was a follow-on project aiming to extend the Anand model to
additional states, bring the three states assisted earlier by the Bank frilly into the Operation Flood
system, and provide further resources for expansion of those states that had benefited from OFI
and the earlier state projects. An important design difference was that the specific investments to
be made in OFII were not spelled out in the SAR, nor indeed were they appraised by the Bank.
Rather, a line of credit was to be provided to the IDC for on-lending to state dairy cooperative
federations and MPUs.15 The NDDB was expected to appraise investment proposals on behalf of
the IDC; if satisfactory, they would be funded. The first five appraisals were to be vetted and
approved by the Bank, but subsequent appraisals would merely be sent to the Bank for
information.
2.17    As part of a process of bringing the state projects into line with the Anand model, the
state dairy development corporations were to be wound up and replaced with state cooperative
milk producers federations, to be owned in due course by the MPUs, which were to be owned in
due course by their supplying DCSs.
2.18    Though the intention of the project was clearly to replace state-owned apex
organizations with state cooperative federations owned by their constituent MPUs, and though
the SAR (Schedule A) included a model agreement between IDC and a state government to
introduce the three-tier Anand model, adoption and implementation of these model agreements
were not included in project conditionality. The consequence, at project completion, of this
apparent oversight was well described in the PCR (Box 3.1) and unfortunately continues to
plague Operation Flood. Progress is being made in the assertion of farmer control, but state
domination of the apex "cooperatives" is still widespread.
2.19    The Anand model clearly started from the ground up. Though attempting to emulate this
model, Operation Flood and the Bank projects were "top down," at least to the extent that target
rates of growth were set in the Bank projects. In the event, the apex federations and MPUs were
less independent of government than the Anand model stipulates. This is not to say that DCSs
were ever organized without proper grassroots support. The spearhead teams served to mobilize
farmer support, not to substitute for it. Some villages rejected the organizing efforts of the
spearhead teams. This mobilization effort was the key to the rapid growth in number of DCSs.
But there was a certain tension implicit in setting targets for how many villages would
voluntarily decide to form a DCS. 6
15. By the time the NDP was appraised, the earlier projects had found that channeling funds from the ARC through
participating banks to the MPUs was too cumbersome and had replaced the procedure with direct lending from the Indian
Dairy Corporation (IDC) to the MPUs (with loans guaranteed by both the federations and the state governments).
Originally, the IDC and NDDB were set up as twin institutions with a common chairman and board of directors. The
IDC was responsible for the financing of cooperative dairy processing plants and acted as project unit for
implementation, including letting tenders and bid evaluation. NDDB was a purely technical organization responsible
for plant design, consultancy services, staffing of "spearhead" teams, and research. Under NDPII, the IDC was folded
into NDDB with the objective of reducing overheads and streamlining project implementation.
16. Thus one investigator reported: "In the Bhopal region . .. the village farmers have had almost no hand in the
planning or implementation of the new dairy scheme. Inquiries in three (sampled) DCS villages ... established that the
DCSs were organized as follows: some officials from Bhopal came to each village, offering to show a film about the
benefits of cooperative dairying and then urged village leaders to sign up members of a DCS. The selection of which
villages to include in this process, and when to approach them, was made entirely in the dairy offices in Bhopal.
Moreover, the Bhopal Dairy Union (not to mention the Madhya Pradesh Cooperative Dairy Federation) was not
formed by a process of unifying leaders and initiatives from among the village DCSs. Instead, it worked the other way



23
The Second National Dairy Project
2.20   The managements of Operation Flood and the Bank were acutely aware that the rapid
expansion achieved under the NDP had, to a significant extent, sacrificed at the federation and
MPU level the Anand principles of farmer control (Box 3.1). The follow-on project, NDPII, was
proposed to restore the Anand principles, serve additional DCSs, and allow for further expansion
of milk processing capacity.
2.21    External assistance of US$5 10 million was to be provided (US$360 million from the
Bank and US$150 million in the form of food aid from the EC). Domestic resources equivalent
to US$164 million were to be provided by NDDB. Hardware of one sort or another to facilitate
milk collection, transportation, testing, processing, and retailing dominated project costs (70
percent). Another 24 percent of project cost was for the development of DCSs and productivity
enhancements at the farm and village level. Institutional strengthening was to take 6 percent. The
bulk of these funds were to flow through the NDDB to MPUs and federations, but this would be
subject to tight conditions on progress toward adopting the full Anand principles, thus remedying
the defect of the previous project design noted in para. 2.18. The first condition agreed was:
Operation Flood (OF) model criteria to be adopted by a cooperative, or to be in meaningful
progress towards adoption, as a condition of NDDB funding under the project:
(i)  Adoption by Federations, MPUs, and DCSs of the Operation Flood cooperative
model bylaws to ensure democratic and accountable operations;
(ii) Elected boards of producer members for DCSs, MPUs, and Federations;
(iii) Autonomy for the Federations and MPUs in the appointment of professional
management, employment of staff, pricing, and marketing;
(iv) Ownership and management of plants (dairies, chilling centers, feed plants, etc.) by
the MPUs, or in areas where the plant serves a central purpose (city dairy or central
feed plant) by the Federations; and
(v) Proper internal control procedures and accounting and auditing of the Federation,
MPUs, and DCSs involved, including a system whereby this information is
regularly reviewed by the respective Boards and General Body Meetings (World
Bank Reports 1987a, p. 35).
2.22   As the PAR observed: "With hindsight, the project design was unrealistic .... It is now
evident that the amount of money provided could not be productively invested in states willing to
implement the Anand principles in full" (Memo to Executive Directors). Entrenched political
and bureaucratic interests were extremely reluctant to relinquish their influence over the
industry. In practice, in order to achieve target levels of disbursement, it has proved necessary to
waive, in most cases, the conditions in para. 2.21.
around: the DCSs were formed at the behest of the Union and the Federation. Consequently, in the Union's annual
reports, members of the Board of Directors, consisting of representatives from the component DCSs, are not even
mentioned by name. They are probably irrelevant to the decision making process within the Union ..... (Attwood
1985).



24
Changed Paradigm
2.23   With the preparation of the Bank's Livestock Sector Review in 1996, the Bank's
paradigm for the development of the Indian dairy industry changed. Whereas the SAR for the
NDPII reported that the Indian dairy industry was competitive (para. 4.23) and provided
resources to be on-lent to the cooperative sector, the sector review reported that the industry was
not competitive and recommended that funding of loans to Operation Flood be phased out
(World Bank Reports 1996, para. 6.10). In large measure, this change seems to have been
triggered by a belief that the private sector might be more efficient than the cooperative sector
and a serious misreading of the cost of Operation Flood. The Livestock Review (World Bank
Reports 1996, Table 4.2) estimated this cost as US$4.26 billion in 1990 dollars (US$5.06 billion
in 1996 dollars) versus a reestimate by this study of US$2.98 billion in 1996 dollars (Annex B,
Tables B3 and B 15).17 Whatever the reason, the Bank ceased to believe in the project design to
the point that, in recommending that the Bank reverse itself on an extension of the project, an
internal memorandum (October 4, 1995) could say: "However, the key argument [for no
extension of the project beyond December 1995] is the project design is not consistent with the
present GOI [Government of India] and Bank strategy of leveling the playing field for
agroindustrial development between cooperative and private entrepreneurs, thus putting the
project at odds with the recommendations of our macroeconomic work as well as the recent
livestock sector review."
17. The impact estimate includes an allowance for state government assistance and central government assistance to
the dairy industry as a whole. If these factors are subtracted, then the impact estimate (for costs included in the
Livestock Review) is US$1.87 billion (1996 dollars) versus US$5.06 billion.

3.   Impact of the First Four Projects at Completion
3.1    The project completion reports (PCR), implementation completion report (ICR), and
PARs are silent as to any benefits to the beneficiaries under these four projects. Rather, they
report on progress in establishing DCSs, expanding milk procurement, installing milk processing
and feed production capacity, introducing crossbred cattle, and the like. As to how and whom
these changes benefited, there is little to be gleaned in the reports themselves. However, two
joint studies between the Bank and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(Alderman, Mergos, and Slade 1987; Alderman 1987) and a study sponsored by the NDDB
(Singh and Acharya 1986) undertaken about the time of project completion throw some light on
the projects' immediate impact.
Targets
3.2    After some delay, the four projects came close to their intended targets in terms of DCSs
and MPUs formed (Table 3.1), dairy processing and feed plants constructed, and Al. However,
with respect to milk procurement and importation of dairy stock, they fell far short.

Organization
3.3    The three state projects provided for parastatal dairy development corporations to be
created as apex organizations. The boards of directors were to be a mix of farmer-elected, ex
officio, and government-appointed members, and the same pattern applied to MPUs. OFII
provided for the apex organizations to be reconstituted as cooperative milk federations.
However, this turned out to be simply a change in corporate name. The constitution of the boards
of directors and the operating style were unaffected by the change. This was a problem at
completion and continues to be a problem to this day (paras. 4.17-4.21).
3.4    The transfer or lease by states of government-owned milk plants and farms to the new
dairy development corporations was to be a condition of project funding at the state level (World
Bank Reports 1978, Schedule A, p. 1). This condition was waived, however, and had not been
implemented at project completion, nor has it been finalized to this day. Ironically, ten years
after project closing, and despite a further follow-on project focused exactly on this issue (para.
2.20), not all the agreed conditions for lending to the states have been met, although there has
been significant movement. Great progress was made in creating a cadre of dairy professionals



26
and organizing them into spearhead teams to mobilize milk producers and to run the resulting
MPUs and the support services of the NDDB.
Box 3.1: Establishment of the Anand-Pattern Structure
A three tier Anand-pattem structure has generally been established throughout India. As
established, however, this structure needs to be further rationalized in a number of directions if the
objectives of establishing an Anand-pattem structure owned and controlled by the farmers are to be
achieved. In Gujarat, the federation was essentially established as a result of the felt need of the individual
union to establish a common brand name and a common marketing platform for unions and to enable
unions to coordinate various activities. In most other states, however, the federation was established as an
instrument for implementing Operation Flood II in order to establish unions and DCSs in an effort to create
a farner-owned and -controlled organization. In many states, particularly the earlier IDA-aided projects in
the states of Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh, existing governnent dairy development
corporations were converted into federations.
Whereas the unions in Gujarat were essentially strong, viable, and owned and controlled by
farmers through elected boards, the federations and unions formed in many parts of India were established
with government-nominated boards and controlled by government. In many cases, competent professionals
employed by the federations ensured that they were building a system which would ultimately lead to the
emergence of an Anand-pattern structure. In certain cases, however, the systems developed were
essentially aimed at providing benefits to the consumer, sacrificing the milk producer. In many cases, the
feeder balancing dairies at the union level have remained the property of the federation and not of the
union, resulting in a strong federation and a weak union with the farmer losing control of the system.
Nowhere, except in Gujarat, Kerala, and Pondicherry, is the federation actually controlled by an elected
board.
During the initial years as Operation Flood was being introduced, it was necessary to establish an
organization (i.e., federation) responsible for implementing the program in the states. As milk collection
and sale have expanded and DCS and unions have been established, it is now necessary to effectively
transfer ownership control and effective power to the elected boards at the union level. In an effort to
strengthen unions, Operation Flood III now aims at transferring feeder dairies and balancing plants to the
concerned unions and ensuring the establishment of elected boards at the union and federation level. Initial
difficulties are expected as bureaucratic structures already established at the federation level may impede
the transfer of power to the unions and their elected leadership.

Impact
3.5    The NDDB-sponsored management information system (MIS) provides comprehensive
feedback to all levels of Operation Flood on the business and procurement aspects of the
program. No such comprehensive monitoring system is in place to measure other dimensions of
the projects' impacts on the intended beneficiaries. This being the case, even well-designed, but
geographically constrained, statistical samples are nevertheless in the nature of "anecdotal"
information, given the huge size, vast spread (and hence diverse climatic and social conditions)
of Operation Flood as a whole.



27
Milk Production
Karnataka
3.6    A Bank-sponsored study of the impact at completion of the Bank's project in Karnataka
compared conditions in Operation Flood villages with those in non-Operation Flood villages
(Alderman 1987). The study involved 42 villages with cooperatives and 20 without, divided
equally into two climatic zones. Thirteen households were interviewed in each village in five
successive rounds of interviews. This study showed that milk production per family was from
one and a half times to twice as high in Operation Flood as in non-Operation Flood villages
(Table 3.2). The higher production in Operation Flood villages was due primarily to herd
composition, not numbers of animals and not yield per animal. Operation Flood villages had a
higher proportion of buffalo and crossbred milch animals and fewer local cows. A multiple
regression that controlled for (among other things) literacy, household size, farm size, and
l/household/day estimated 2.56 more I/household/day from Operation Flood villages than non-
Operation Flood villages (Alderman 1987, p. 18). A multiple regression analysis showed that the
nominal price of milk was 3.2 percent higher in Operation Flood villages; deflated by a village
cereal price index, it was 1.9 percent higher (Alderman 1987, Table 9 and p. 29). This raises
some questions: is the elasticity of supply very high? or does the introduction of Operation Flood
shift the supply function? or were DCSs established mainly in villages with high levels of dairy
activity? Perhaps some of all three, but probably more of the latter.

Madhya Pradesh
3.7    By contrast, a Bank-sponsored study in Madhya Pradesh found no such increase 8 in
milk production, as summarized in Table 3.3. Indeed, in rabi DCS villages averaged 14 percent
less milk production (a "decrease") than non-DCS villages. This is confirmed by Mergos and
Slade (1987, Table 6.1) who reported an average milk production of 2.91 liters per day in DCS
villages against 2.83 liters per day in non-Operation Flood villages. However, after controlling
for area of land, percent irrigated, number of milk animals, value of milk animals, and several
inputs, Mergos and Slade (1987, Table 6.3) found a 13.4 percent higher production in DCS
villages.
18. Strictly, not "increase" but "difference between Operation Flood and non-Operation Flood villages." There is no
"before project" baseline data, so that relative changes cannot be measured. We cannot tell whether the difference is due to
Operation Flood or to a sampling error. This applies equally to the Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh studies; the "increase"
reported in Karnataka could reflect sampling error.

3.8    Another concern is the distributive effect of Operation Flood. Some inconclusive results
from the Madhya Pradesh sample are reported in Table 3.4. The rows of Table 3.4 refer to the
season and whether milk was sold to a DCS or other buyer (usually a dudhiya). The DCS column
refers to whether there was a DCS in the village. These results are difficult to interpret.
Presumably, the difference for landless and large farmers supplying the DCS are due to large
farmers providing higher-testing milk, since the DCSs use a test-based formula to determine
payout. There is no reason to suppose that this quality differential also characterizes milk
supplied to non-DCS purchasers, whether in a DCS or non-DCS village. Indeed, as Singh and
Acharya (1986) note:
One must note here that the formal price figures, taken as such without other considerations in a
non-DCS context, are deceptive in the sense that they are purely nominal, The private vendors
invariably cheat the producers not only in the measurement of milk but also in the determination
of unit price level, which is supposed to be based on 'Mawa' (total solids) content (93-94).19

Milk Consumption
Karnataka
3.9    The study of project impact in Karnataka addressed the crucial issue of the impact of
Operation Flood on milk consumption (Alderman 1987). Multiple regression analysis was used
19. This quote is, of course, merely an assertion, though a very widely believed one (para. 4.11). Jaipur dairy now provides
a service by which consumers who suspect water has been added can have milk samples checked (Table 4.3). Though not a
random sample, this service has clearly demonstrated that some vendors certainly sell watered milk.



29
to explain the budget shares of milk, ghee, and other dairy products in the consumption of
Operation Flood and non-Operation Flood villages. A key conclusion was that "the average
budget share of milk was 9 percent higher in the control (that is, non-Operation Flood) villages
than in the cooperative (Operation Flood) villages, given equal income and production"
(Alderman 1987). Unfortunately, this is difficult to interpret since production (and incomes)
were higher in Operation Flood villages. Taken at face value, the above quote would seem to
support the substantial (but not well documented) literature that claims Operation Flood has led
to the sale of milk which producers used to consume themselves. However, the raw consumption
data in Table 3.5 are more reassuring. They suggest a slightly higher average consumption in
Operation Flood than in non-Operation Flood villages, despite the fact that a much lower
proportion of milk is being retained in Operation Flood villages because milk production there is
substantially higher. But the real issue, as Alderman (1987) notes, is the net effect on nutritional
status. A rise in the price of any (noninferior) good should lead to lower consumption of the good
and higher consumption of substitutes. In the study sample, it would appear that the income
effect just about compensated for the substitution effect, leaving total consumption of milk per
household substantially unaffected.

Madhya Pradesh
3.10   Levels of milk consumption in the Madhya Pradesh study have already been reported in
Table 3.3. Even though milk consumption was 5 percent less in DCS villages in kharif than in
non-DCS villages, overall one would have to conclude, as for Karnataka, that on the basis of
these samples, there was little reason to be concerned about a wholesale diversion of milkfrom
consumption to the market. Rather, the concern in Madhya Pradesh should be that dairy income
in DCS villages may not have increased significantly. Multiplying average price by average
output gives a 6.25 percent higher dairy income in non-DCS villages.
Importance of Milk Income
Karnataka
3.11   The ratio of the value of milk production to total expenditures in the Karnataka sample is
given in Table 3.6 for a range of farm sizes. All landholder classes had higher ratios of milk sales
to total expenditure in Operation Flood villages. In both Operation Flood and non-Operation
Flood villages, the larger farmers got a larger proportion of their income from milk sales than
smaller farmers. However, the spread was less in Operation Flood villages (6.8 percent instead of
8.4 percent).

Madhya Pradesh
3.12    The Madhya Pradesh sample confirms this relationship. As shown in Table 3.7, the ratio
of milk sales to other income is higher in Operation Flood villages for all classes except the
landless, and slightly higher on average. When dairy income is regressed on other income and a
dummy variable for a DCS village, the presence of the DCS is estimated to raise dairy income by
Rs 527. The t-statistic of 1.43 is significant at the 10 percent level. On the basis of these two
studies, one could say that with the important exception of the landless in Madhya Pradesh,
Operation Flood appears to have raised the proportion of income gained from dairying.
However, the increase has been quite modest.

Profitability of Dairying
3.13    Only the Madhya Pradesh study addressed profitability (Singh and Acharya 1986). This
study provides impressive evidence of the profitability of dairying. After all costs have been
accounted for, the profit percentages are as given in Table 3.8. The gross margins reported are so
high that they raise some question as to whether all variable costs have indeed been taken into
account.20 Only in the case of the landless in rabi is it reported that milk production fails to cover
"variable costs" (which include the opportunity cost of all nonpurchased inputs and services used
in milk production), and then the loss is only 5 percent, suggesting that even in this case it may be
a useful way of using spare labor, albeit at a slight discount.
20. "The variable cost includes the actual cost of all purchased inputs and services such as fodder, concentrate feed, animal
health care, breeding, hired labor, etc. and the opportunity cost of all non-purchased inputs and services used in milk
production" (Singh and Acharya 1986, p. 94).

Benefits
3.14   Only the Madhya Pradesh study asked directly about benefits (Singh and Acharya
1986). The reaction was remarkably positive, as shown in Table 3.9. This table provides
evidence of substitution of grains for milk and milk products in consumption (more than would
seem reasonable on the basis of the village comparisons discussed earlier). Remarkably, the
second and third biggest increases are attributed to increased education of girls and boys,
respectively. If this claimed increase is indeed causal, this would be a major positive impact of
Operation Flood.

3.15   The reported increase in indebtedness is ambiguous. If it represents increased credit-
worthiness that has been utilized profitably, then it should be counted as a benefit. If it has been

used unwisely, or is simply indebtedness without augmented creditworthiness, then it should be
counted as a cost.
3.16   The companion study (Mergos and Slade 1987), for which results are given in Table
3.10, was less specific about the nature of benefits received from the cooperative system. Of
those with an opinion, 86 percent believed that the operation of the DCSs was good or
satisfactory. The primary reason for membership in the DCSs was to sell milk and take advantage
of the year-end bonus. Despite this focus on milk price and collection, over 70 percent of those with
an opinion thought that the DCSs provided additional benefits. Perhaps the best testimony to the
good reputation of the DCSs is that 63 percent of those interviewed in the non-DCS villages said
that they would join a DCS if it was formed in the village.

and had started to grow significantly faster. At the same time, the rationing of milk in the major
cities had been dropped, and the formal sector market for milk had also been put onto a new fast-
growth path. Literally millions of small farmers were being drawn into the cooperative system,
and vast new programs in veterinary services, Al, improved animal nutrition, crossbreeding, and
vaccination were being introduced. Yet the three village-level studies for which results are
readily available show relatively little difference between Operation Flood and non-Operation
Flood villages. Certainly the studies do not show the degree of difference one would expect if
these village-level differences were to be used to explain the national-level phenomena observed.
The easiest escape from this apparent paradox is the likelihood that dairying was growing
vigorously in both Operation Flood and non-Operation Flood villages. At the same time, demand
was growing vigorously due to rising per capita incomes, population growth, and the high
income elasticity of milk (1.1 urban, 1.6 rural). That this increase in demand did not result in



33
21
rapidly escalating real prices or heavy imports of milk solids  is best explained by the removal
(or at the very least the relaxation) of the dead hand of the public sector from dairy development
(a removal that was part and parcel of Operation Flood, the program being supported by the
Bank projects) and the continuation of the import-substitution strategy which provided high
protection levels to dairying and thus an incentive for domestic production to grow.
21. A reviewer has emphasized the "self-reliant" development model being followed at the time (para. 1.3). As shown
in Table 4.6, effective protection was very high so that, in the absence of these macroeconomic policies, it is likely that
imports would have been substantial.

4. Developments Under National Dairy II
Expansion and Nonfunctional Cooperatives
4.1    The NDP, which supported OFII, was followed by the NDPII, which supported OFIII.
OFII had supported the establishment of 25 apex organizations, 125 new MPUs, and over 32,000
additional DCSs.22 OFIII, the follow-on project, was intended to support the establishment of
only 20 new MPUs, but 27,000 new DCSs. 3 Thus, while OFII was primarily an expansion
project, it has been followed by a period of active consolidation, as shown in Table 4.1.

and coops which may pour at other times of year.
b. DCSs that "poured in June."
Source: NDDB (Anand) and study data.
4.2    The NDP closed in November 1985, when about 42,000 DCSs had been organized and
36,000 were functional in 164 MPUs. OFIII has seen a further 30,000 DCSs organized
(functional DCSs have risen by 19,000) in 170 MPUs. (MPUs peaked at 173 in 1988-89). There
are no separate statistics either on DCSs formally wound-up by the state Registrar of
Cooperatives, DCSs waiting to be wound up, and DCSs that did not supply in June but are active
at other times of the year. This means that the "disbanded" figures in Table 4.1 are something of
an overestimate. To further complicate matters, there are examples where mixed (that is, male-
dominated) DCSs were disbanded in a village, only to be replaced by a women's dairy
cooperative society (WDCS) and even cases where a mixed DCS and WDCS coexist in the same
(large) village.
4.3    The bottom line is that Operation Flood has continued to expand. There are now 21,000
more active DCSs "pouring in June" than there were at the completion of OFII. Average
procurement has also risen, but less quickly. Average daily milk procurement per functional
DCS has fallen from 220 I/day to 194 1/day, and average daily milk procurement per member has

36
dropped from 2.1 I/day to 1.5 I/day.24 Like DCSs themselves, some of the 9.3 million farmer
members of DCSs have become "nonfunctional" either because the DCS is nonfunctional or
because they have ceased to "pour" to the DCS. Allowing for nonfunctional DCSs and multiple
memberships, NDDB estimates that there are about 6.3 million "pouring members" who supply
milk to a DCS at some time during the year (Annex B, Table B 16).
4.4    The reasons why a quarter of the DCSs are classified as "nonfunctional" are not well
documented. Many will simply be "in recess" in June with milk being poured at different times
of year. Others have been officially disbanded by the Registrar of Cooperatives, and others are
awaiting this action. Five major causes seem to explain the closure of DCSs:
*Active price competition, especially in peri-urban villages. With only a small
distance to transport milk  and negative milk processing costs, small traders can
offer prices higher than the cooperative. As urban areas expand, the area served by
small traders expands. To the extent that farmers get more for their milk than they
would from the cooperative, this expansion is to be welcomed. The question as to
whether the consumer is better served by informal traders is an open one, since there
is evidence that watering of milk is widespread (Table 4.3).
*  Changed needs of milk producers. Where villages become more decentralized, the
single DCS pouring site may cease to properly meet farmers' needs. Itinerant buyers
who will come to the farm might then provide a service the DCS does not match. (In
some large villages, DCSs have established one or more satellite pouring points to
reduce waiting lines and travel times.)
*   Village politics. Though the Anand principles call for the DCSs to be open to all
without discrimination, this may not be honored, leading to tensions within the
village that can eventually undermine the DCS.
*  Dishonesty. Despite a sophisticated system of checks and balances and "double-
entry" checks on physical quantities and payments, embezzlement does occur, often
followed by the collapse of the DCS.
*  Higher income. In a Madhya Pradesh study (Hiremath, Singh, and Mergos 1997),
several DCSs were found to have closed due to the introduction of soybeans. These
provide a higher income than dairying but fewer byproducts for cattle feed than the
cotton and groundnuts they replace (para. 5.11).
4.5    If the volume of milk supplied by a DCS falls, for whatever reason, below an economic
level, then the MPU will cease collecting. A DCS may thus become "nonfunctional" not because
of explicit dissension or a wish of the membership to disband, but because the volume of milk
supplied falls to a level that makes collection uneconomic.
24. Calculated from NDDB data. This is an ambiguous statistic, since farmers who have joined a DCS are often
reluctant to drop their membership even if they cease to own a milch animal. Some DCSs allow two members per
family, and some even allow membership from families who do not own a milch animal. There are no national
statistics on pouring members in earlier years. Case studies provide examples of villages where only half the
memnbership actually pours (Sampark 1997).
25. With many buyers (since it is a short distance to town) as well as many sellers, there is a better chance of a truly
competitive market for milk than in remote villages where market failures are to be expected in the absence of a DCS.



37
4.6    With almost a quarter of DCSs that have been formed nonfunctional in June, this is a
serious problem for Operation Flood. MPU staff were well informed about the range of
circumstances that can lead to the collapse of a DCS, but the causes of collapse are not routinely
documented. Under OFIII, the NDDB initiated a Cooperative Development Program to help deal
with this problem. This is a multidimensional program aimed at in-service training of all
participants in the cooperative system from farmers to boards of directors and professional staff,
with particular emphasis on women. The training includes village-level discussions of
cooperative principles and rights and responsibilities, facilitated discussions among management
committees of neighboring DCS on problems and procedures, visits by DCS chairmen (and
chairwomen) to Anand to see the support infrastructure that has been built up and to be further
indoctrinated in their rights and responsibilities, and technical training for secretaries on AI and
accounting procedures. In principle, this program funded all the expenses for one five-member
team in each MPU and the nonsalary expenses of another team. The program is active in 89
MPUs, some of which have financed a total of five teams. The impact of this educational
program has been twofold: first, a greater sense of belonging and ownership of DCSs by their
26
members, and second, better performance, particularly at the DCS level.  The result has been an
increase in milk poured in villages under the program compared with other villages. Since higher
procurement helps spread overhead costs, this increased milk production suggests that the
program has a one- to two-year payback period. While the Cooperative Development Program is
intended to be preventative, the Technology Mission for Dairy Development (iointly funded by
the central government, state governments, and NDDB) has been active in reviving
nonfunctional DCSs.
4.7    It is Operation Flood policy not to receive milk from small traders or dudhiyas. This is
very largely driven by quality concerns (i) that the milk may have been watered and (ii) that
elapsed time since milking may have allowed souring to commence. In addition, cooperative
ideology puts a high value on a direct link to the producer. This said, it may be noted that where
a dudhiya is collecting from producers not otherwise served by the DCS (say from a village
several miles distant) or by direct pick-up from farmers, there might be a case for collaboration.
This would be true especially if the cans supplied by the dudhiya were kept separate and
individually tested on receipt at the factory or cooling center.
4.8    As reported in the ICR and Table 4.2, the investments under NDPII turned out to be
fairly evenly distributed with the exception of Gujarat, which received 40 percent of funds
released by NDDB. However, because of the high level of milk procurement in Gujarat, the
investment per kilogram of milk procured turns out to be only 36 percent above the average for
the project as a whole. More extreme is the underinvestment in Maharashtra, which received
only 24 percent of the average investment per kilogram procured. That the investment in Gujarat
was not excessive relative to milk procurement is suggested by the ICR (para. 18) when it
observes, "The data on rated capacities and actual utilization in the Operation Flood dairies
26. Though not by any means widespread, abuses that have been identified and corrected as farmers have better
understood the system and their rights include (i) the failure to actually test milk (that is, an arbitrary assignment of fat
content by the DCS Secretary); (ii) acceptance of milk from a milk trader; (iii) misconduct by the Managing Committee or
Chairman, who has been forced to resign; and (iv) refusal of membership on the basis of caste or "politics." By contrast, a
DCS chairman who had been on the Cooperative Development program, responding to a question posed during a group
interview, said spontaneously: "The village cooperative has to follow the Anand principles. Firstly, just as we treat all mnilk
the same in the society, we should treat all people the same. Secondly, there should be no politics within the society. The
society should be like a Hindu Temple. You take your shoes off before entering and no politics within the Temple."



38
showed considerable inter-and intra-state variation. Gujarat and Maharashtra do better than
most." It appears that on efficiency grounds Gujarat was not overbuilt. However, the high
proportion of milk production procured by the cooperative system in Gujarat relative to other
states means that investment per kilogram of production (not procurement) was four times as
high in Gujarat as in almost any other state. Similarly, the investment per member was higher in
Gujarat than elsewhere.

4.9     The history of milk procurement by Operation Flood is summarized in Figure 4.1. There
was an initial period (1970-1980) of rapid growth (15.2 percent per annum) from a small base
under OFI. Five years (1980-1985) of extraordinary growth of 22.5 percent per annum followed
under OFII, and subsequently more modest growth of about 4.2 percent per annum (from a much
larger base) under OFIII. Under OFII, procurement by Operation Flood has grown slightly less
fast than production. Two factors may help explain this. In the early period, there was an 18-
month to two-year hiatus in implementation due to the reorganization of NDDB and delays in
state governments' willingness to adopt the Anand principles. In the later years, competition
from the private sector has slowed deliveries to the cooperative sector.
4.10    Retail Sales. Retail sales by Operation Flood have risen from an average of 1.0 million
I/day in 1970 to 5.0 million I/day in 1985-1986 to 9.40 million I/day now.
4.11    Quality and Competition. Competition both for milk procurement and sales is lively.
There is no restriction on informal traders purchasing milk, and the demise of some DCSs
testifies to the vigor of this competition. Tales of "unfair competition" from these traders
abound, including tying suppliers by either a loan from traders to farmer or paying 30 or 60 days
in arrears so that if suppliers leave, they will lose one or two months of milk income. Failure to
test milk, falsification of test results, refusal to take milk (or setting a giveaway price) during the
flush season, and long measures are repeatedly mentioned. Urban milk demand is met by
cooperatives (60 percent), informal urban producers (30 percent), and informal milk traders and
new private suppliers (25 percent). Estimated market shares add to over 100 percent, reflecting
different market shares between markets.

4.12    There is also frequent reference to the watering of milk by informal traders and by
farmers. Some farmers interviewed mentioned the ability to add water to the milk as one of the
advantages of selling to informal traders. Data on the watering of milk are difficult to obtain. An
exception is in Jaipur, where for a number of years Jaipur Dairy has had a free service that tests
milk for added water at consumers' request. (Actually the test is for solid-non-fat (SNF), and it is
assumed that any SNF level below 8.5 percent is due to the addition of water.) This is a "self-
selected sample," and as such is representative of milk that consumers suspect may have been
watered (not the informal milk supply as a whole). The relevant data is given in Table 4.3. With
low overheads and a rather simple approach to milk processing, informal traders provide
vigorous competition.

4.13    Private companies do not generally procure their nmilk directly from farmers. Rather they
buy from contractors at the factory. Contractors usually employ informal traders to buy from
farmers, thus perpetuating the unfair trading practices referred to in para. 4.11. By using
contractors, private companies minimize costs but have no control over quality between the farm
gate and the receiving platformn (Box 4.1). This extreme example should not be taken as typical;
rather, it warns of the existence of a problem.
4.14   Problems with effluent treatment have already been alluded to in para. 1.22, and a review
of Bank supervision reports shows intermittent concern with nonfunctioning control equipment,
and poor maintenance in some factories, at some points in time. NDDB itself operates a Quality
Assurance Group which is designed to help MPUs remedy weaknesses in equipment or standard
procedures. This is a continuing challenge, even as factories are being prepared for certification
by the International Standards Organization for export quality production.
4.15    Increasingly, both the corporate and cooperative sectors have been plagued by
contractors and transporters adding "artificial milk" to their deliveries (Box 4.2). Since this
"milk" satisfies the normal butterfat and SNF tests, improved testing procedures are needed for
bulk milk delivered to the factory. Although these comments are not based on extensive
empirical investigation, they were not seriously challenged by leading Indian dairy academics
and others when presented at a Workshop on a draft of the study held in Anand, Gujarat state, in
March 1997. Since we want to know village-level impact, it is inherent that evidence has to be
drawn from disparate studies, and comprehensive evidence is unlikely to become available.27
27. A reviewer has put this caution more strongly: "The data on private sector quality is weak. Data from one state-
Punjab (with one table, Table 4.3, subject to self-selection problems)-and one visit to a single milk plant (Box 4. 1)
are insufficient to draw general conclusions about the whole industry and country. Assertions of knowledgeable
observers are not a good substitute. Several references are made throughout the text about unfair trade practice by the
private sector (paras. 4.11, 6.33, etc.). However, no evidence is provided: Instead, this is based solely on references to
'tales,' conclusions made by observers (parms. 3.8, 4.4, 4.11, 5.13, etc.), and Box 4.2 on artificial milk. With thin

Box 4.1: Milk Assembly at Its Worst
The following account of a private sector milk assembly center is not intended to reflect the
hygiene standards of the subsector as a whole, but it does suggest that enforcement of the Adulteration of
Food Act of 1961 is a major challenge, at least in the Punjab (Table 6.10 shows that 16 percent of milk
samples drawn and tested by the Punjab Ministry of Health in 1994 were judged to be adulterated and 24
percent in 1995.)
The center was used to transfer milk from cans to bulk storage in order to cool it, correct for
excess acidity, and transfer it to a small bulk tanker for transport to a manufacturing plant. The building
used was a forrner ice plant that opened directly onto a main road, with the exception of a dirt parking area
100 feet wide. The building had a high roof and a row of windows high up, but these were so dirty that the
building appeared quite dark inside. The darkness was accentuated by dirty dark walls and an apparently
dirt floor, which may have overlain a concrete floor at some depth.
Milk delivered in cans was first poured into large (6 feet in diameter) steel (not stainless steel)
drums. There was an open 100 kg. sack of caustic soda on the floor, which was evidently used to correct
the pH of any milk that had got too acidic or sour. After this adulteration (if needed) of the milk, the liquid
was pumped through plastic piping (again no stainless steel, no cleaning in place) to rectangular steel
containers. These looked to be holdovers from the ice plant, since many were severely rusted and stained;
some were rusted right through at the top. These containers, at 4 feet high, would have been extremely
difficult to clean, and there was no evidence that this was even attempted. The milk was cooled in these
rusted steel containers until a small tanker truck was available, at which stage it was pumped into the tanker
for onward transport to a noncooperative processing plant. New mild steel containers were in the process of
construction.
Apart from the electric motor, pump and plastic piping, it was a Dickensian scene.

4.16    Working Capital. 1993-94 was a trying year for Operation Flood. High procurement
levels coincided with low world prices for dairy products. This led to depressed prices in India
(as low as Rs 36,50028 or US$1,160 a ton for SMP versus US$1,569 on the world market) and
precluded export except at a substantial loss. Many MPUs ran out of working capital as
inventories of dairy products (which could only be disposed of at depressed prices) locked up
working capital. Many unions fell behind in making payments to farmers and had to declare
"milk holidays" on which they would not receive milk (see also para. 4.24). NDDB provided
substantial interest-free loans to help with this crisis. This facility was withdrawn when the crisis
abated, and NDDB found that some MPUs were using the credit facility to avoid painful, but
needed, decisions. Some of these loans are yet to be repaid.
evidence, one cannot generalize as to the extent of unfair trade practices in the whole dairy industry and country." For
readers unfamiliar with the Indian dairy market, the text has cited enough examples to alert them that quality and
competition can be problems in India. Those familiar with the industry will be able to make their own judgments.
28. Gulati and Bhide (1997) report SMP quotations in 1993-94 ranging from Rs 36,500 per ton to an inferred price of
Rs 71,400 per ton (Annex Table 5.1). This latter estimate involves assuming 920 grams per liter of milk versus the
more usually accepted estimate of 1,020 grams per liter. Correcting for this error, the high price drops to Rs 64,600 per
ton. In any case, the high price is an inferred price, from consumer milk prices, which may not have adjusted
downwards fully to reflect the lower cost of raw materials. The average price used for estimation of protection

been reduced by about a third.

Box 4.2: Artificial Milk
Problems with the supply of artificial milk have been reported in both the corporate and
cooperative sectors. An article in the New Delhi Statesman (July 8, 1995) reported on the seizure from a
contractor of "artificial milk" and goes on to explain that "the ingredients used in the manufacture of
synthetic milk are caustic soda, water, refined oil, common salt, sugar and urea." This artificial milk was
destined for delivery to a large corporate processor.a
Similarly, an article in the Asian Age (March 12, 1997) says:
Delhites Panic Over Synthetic Milk .. . The large-scale supply of synthetic milk in Delhi and
adjoining districts in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh has become the cause of serious concern for consumers in
the region.
Spurred to action by a deluge of complaints, the Food and Research Analysis Centre (FRAC), a
voluntary organization, collected samples of milk from various outlets in and around New Delhi last year. Of
the 33 milk samples collected by FRAC, almost 60 percent of the samples were found to stray from specified
standards laid down by the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.
"The samples were not adulterated but merely sub-standard," says Mr. S.P. Virmani, founder-
president of FRAC, admitting however that some samples .. . had been found to contain synthetic
adulterants ...
In January this year the Gurgaon administration busted a large milk adulteration racket that
involved supplies from the Rajasthan Government Milk Cooperation Saras.
According to the Gurgaon police, at least three quintals of milk were siphoned off from the tankers
every day, and replaced with adulterated supplies. Saras (an MPU) tankers from Bhilwara, Ajmer, Jogpur,
and other areas of Rajasthan would collect at a destination in Binaulla village in Gurgaon district, where the
fraud was perpetrated.
Local administration sources reveal that a large number of private as well as government were
involved in the racket.
a. In a letter to the editor (August 4, 1995), the Manager of Corporate Communications understandably took exception to
the article, mentioning "25 different tests and analysis .... These checks rule out any possibility of adulteration of liquid
milk going undetected." The letter stopped short of denying that the culprit was a supplier to the company or that the
material had been seized. It seems unlikely that the contractor was caught by officials on his very first use of the recipe.
4.17    Cooperative Structure. A continuing problem for Operation Flood is the rejection by
politicians and bureaucrats of the full Anand principles of farmer control. Even in Gujarat, where
the existing system is farmer-controlled at all three levels, politicians continue to harass the
cooperative system in the hope of forcing it to accept government assistance and hence political
appointees on boards of directors. This is a continuing war of attrition, with the public sector
giving ground reluctantly to increased control by the NDDB and farmers when the cost of
supporting governmental-dominated cooperatives becomes too high, only to attempt to regain
control once financial equilibrium is restored.
4.18    The issues of government interventions, cost control, and subsidies are confusingly
intertwined. The question then arises as to when a payment by government to cover excess
operating costs by the cooperative system is a subsidy. A clear distinction needs to be made
between a government subsidy to an Anand-pattern cooperative in which all tiers are farmer-
owned and -controlled and payments to cooperative with "mixed ownership and control."
Typically, mixed-control cooperatives have higher costs or lower revenues owing to government
interventions, including the inability to dispense with redundant staff or inappropriate
appointments, inadequate salaries to retain key staff, and prices that are fixed too high for



43
farmers or too low for consumers. There is a more subtle and corrosive effect of (state)
government intervention. If management knows that at the end of the day the government will
bail out the organization, the incentive to efficient management is fundamentally undermined.
(This is the key reason that insistence on the independence and the Anand principles is so
important.) Nothing focuses the mind of a manager or a board director like the prospect of the
organization going bankrupt. A clear conceptual distinction needs to be made between payments
needed to compensate for governmental managerial interventions and a genuine subsidy to an
Anand-pattern cooperative that has full discretion to manage its affairs. Operation Flood officials
were adamant that no subsidies, in this narrower sense, had been received by (fully) Anand-
pattern cooperatives. There may have been a subsidy element in the first two phases of Operation
Flood, but in OFIII (and NDPII) all funding was provided by loans from the Bank, profits on
concessional dairy imports, and the NDDB. There was no contribution from the central
government and hence no subsidy from the central government directly to Operation Flood.
Both the central and state governments provide support to the dairy industry generally (including
Operation Flood areas), such as veterinary and extension services and Al.
4.19    Much of the reluctance of state governments to relinquish their influence over
cooperatives is because some of the physical plants used still belong to the state and loans to the
dairy sector are guaranteed by the state (as required by the Bank). State intervention is then
rationalized as a legitimate concern to assure the value of the state's assets, even when the net
result of an intervention is to reduce system efficiency, raise cooperative costs, and hence
undermine the value of the state's assets.
4.20   The continued appointment of civil servants as managing directors of milk federations
and MPUs is one symptom of the above conflict.30 Only in Gujarat, Kamataka, and Rajasthan
has it been possible to appoint dairying professionals to managing directorships.
4.21    Even in Karnataka and Rajasthan, the professional managers are not direct employees of
the MPU but are seconded to the MPU from a cadre of professionals employed by the milk
federation or NDDB. The result is that appointments tend to be for a few years without the
expectation of having to make a career in the service of the MPU. In Bihar the Anand principles
have been accepted to the point that professional staff are employed directly by the MPUs.
4.22    Cooperatives have to operate in accordance with the cooperatives act of the relevant
state. In almost all cases, these acts are antiquated holdovers from pre-Independence days with a
markedly paternalistic bent. The result is a bias that allows the registrars of cooperatives much
more leeway in cooperative affairs than is open to the registrars of companies. In addition, the
29. Doornbos and others (1990) identified both input and investment subsidization and expressed the fear that NDDB
would be unsustainable if these subsidies ceased. A close reading of this data shows that the input subsidy (farmers
being paid more for their milk than was recovered from consumer) is better described as a consumer subsidy and that
this was financed by profits from concessional imports of dairy products, not from the central government. In the
event, the dairy cooperative system as a whole is currently profitable, though individual MPUs and even federations
are still unprofitable where state governments control milk prices or limit the ability of cooperatives to correct
overstaffing.
30. It is incorrect to refer to a government payment to an organization with a government-appointed managing director
as a subsidy, just as the concept of a cooperative with a government-appointed managing director is a seeming
contradiction.



44
acts usually require cooperatives to have their accounts audited by the auditor general, a
requirement that may well involve a delay of several years.3'
4.23    A fundamental problem for cooperatives is the conflict between efficiency and equity.
Mention has already been made of the greater efficiency of milk collection from large farmers.
The same issue applies to the collection of milk from small DCSs and the servicing of remote
villages.32 Economic efficiency would dictate either not collecting from these more expensive
sites or at the very least paying a lower price to reflect the higher cost of providing service.
Typically, cooperatives prefer to provide service equally to all suppliers at the same cost on
grounds of equity (and to some extent simplicity), but are always subject to receiving a sufficient
volume of milk to cover variable costs. Cooperatives typically provide for some cross-
subsidization from the better off to the poor.33 Given the Bank's overarching objective of
reducing poverty, careful thought needs to be given before the Bank advocates an increase in
efficiency if efficiency is to be obtained by paying lower prices to the poor or withdrawing
service altogether. In the final analysis, MPUs will decide how much cross-subsidization they
wish to provide. Their decision will, of course, be constrained by the need to operate profitably.
Where the volume of milk and existing route pattern do not allow variable costs to be covered,
MPUs withdraw service to DCSs as is witnessed by the number of DCSs which have become
nonfunctional.
4.24    As argued earlier (paras. 1.20-1.21), cooperative and private trader are likely to behave
differently in a monoposonistic relationship with milk producers. A similar difference in
behavior can be expected between cooperative and private companies at the corporate level.
Private companies, in attempting to assure their profitability and survival, are unlikely to
distribute profits to the point that working capital is seriously eroded. Cooperatives may be
tempted to return too much to producers to the point that too little money is retained as working
capital. Political considerations may lead boards of directors to authorize overly generous
payments to producers. In India the asymmetry between the tax treatment of farmers, who do not
have to pay income tax, and companies (including cooperatives) that have to pay income tax at
the 35 percent rate on profits is an additional powerful argument for maximum producer payout
to reduce tax liability.
31. Cooperatives can get their accounts audited privately, but this does not exempt thern from the requirement to also have
their accounts audited by an auditor general. This option results in a double dose of audit fees. Understandably, it is seldom
used. Again, Bihar provides an exception. It has recently been permitted to substitute private auditors for the services of its
Auditor General.
32. It is interesting to see how this is described in the literature critical of Operation Flood:
OF authorities have shown a preference for establishing cooperatives in regions which were far away from
the main metropolitan centers thereby avoiding tough price competition with the many small traders near
cities .... The infrastructural investment for organizing this type of procurement is, however, sizable,
especially when milk has to be marketed in metropolitan cities. (Doombos and others 1990, p. 117).
The reader is left with an impression of a lack of competitiveness of the cooperative system and excessive investment,
as if it would somehow have been better to leave remote villages unserved in order to compete successfully with the
small peri-urban traders who are already providing an economic and low-cost service.
33. The extent of the subsidy, if any, is open to debate. It is standard practice worldwide for cooperatives and private
milk processors to pay all suppliers to the plant the same amount, regardless of transport costs. In part, this is a matter
of simplicity and goodwill; even more importantly, though the marginal transport cost of additional milk collected
from remote villages exceeds average transport costs, the marginal processing cost for the additional milk falls below
average processing cost, leaving net impact on profitability moot.



45
4.25   The above-mentioned temptation for cooperatives to pay too much to their producers is
reflected in somewhat slow repayment of project loans by MPUs as shown in Table 4.4.
Ironically, two of the three states (out of 20) that were helped by specific Bank projects have
double the rate of arrears compared to OFI and OFII. The most significant arrears are from
Rajasthan, where the state government has asked the NDDB to take over management of the
cooperative sector until financial profitability can be restored. The NDDB is confident of
resolving the financial problems in Rajasthan within five years.

4.26   Some cooperatives have developed the device of part payment in equity. In this case, a
part of the final (bonus) payment for milk is in the form of equity in the DCS, which in turn is
reflected in DCS equity in the MPU.34 The result is that the MPU limits its tax payment, and the
cooperative members increase their equity in the MPU, thereby increasing working capital or
allowing the govermnents loans or equity to be reduced.
4.27   Financial Sustainability. Financial sustainability is an extremely complex topic in the
context of Operation Flood. Just as the Bank insists that the central government guarantee funds
made available to the NDDB, the NDDB requires that state govermnents guarantee loans to the
federations and MPUs. Thus, nominally at least, the NDDB's financial security depends on the
creditworthiness of the state governments rather than on individual projects. This reliance on the
states' creditworthiness is particularly important in states that continue to interfere with the
pricing and staffing decisions of federations and MPUs (Table 6.11). The Bank-supported
projects aimed to free the cooperative sector from state interference. Had they succeeded, direct
lending without a state guarantee would have made sense. But the project was unable to
eliminate state interference altogether. Many states take the position that as long as they are
guaranteeing loans to federations and MPUs and as long as they own part of the assets, they have
the right to appoint directors and managers and to have a say in pricing and staffing decisions.
34. Strictly, the final payment has to be described as an adjustnent to the price of milk paid during the year, since a
bonus would need to be paid out of profits which would first have to be declared and taxes paid.

4.28    The profitability of federations and MPUs improved markedly in the three years before
the NDPII closed. As Table 4.535 shows, loss-making MPUs and state federations were reduced
from 73 to 46 (13 of them in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh) over two years, and the increase in
profits and reduction in losses has been spectacular: overall losses of Rs 584 million in 1992-93
have been converted into profits of Rs 285 million in 1994-95. Even so, accumulated losses over
this period were Rs 627 million or about US$18 million.

4.29    While payments to the NDDB are still often in arrears, the rate of increase in these
arrears has slowed substantially. The NDDB is taking steps to correct the problem, which is not
currently a threat to the survival of the dairy cooperative system. Total overdue loan installments
increased 27.5 percent (from Rs 796 million to 1,020 million) from March 1995 to March 1996
and represented about one-third of repayments due at the end of March 1996.36 From 1990-91 to
1994-95, these arrears grew at an annual rate of 180 percent from a very modest base of Rs 82
million.
4.30    To put the numbers in perspective, the NDDB's surplus (excess of income over
expenditure) was Rs 466 million in FY95. Its total assets were Rs 27.8 billion, and its equity was
Rs 14.1 billion. Thus, total arrears were equal to around three years' surplus, and total loans
outstanding (Rs 10.7 billion)37 could in extreme circumstances be written off and still leave the
NDDB with about 30 percent of its equity.
35. India has 170 Milk Producer's Unions and 20 federations. For those not covered in Table 4.5 (58 organizations),
either audited accounts were not available (some states require a state or cooperative auditor to do the auditing, often
resulting in delays of up to several years), or there was an amalgamation of units.
36. The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for NDPII, para. 50, puts arrears at I percent of NDDB's loan
portfolio, but this is presumably a misprint. Total overdue loans (Rs 1,020 million) exceed total overdue on Bank
projects (Rs 976.3 million) since some loans were advanced using NDDB's own funds.
37. Rs 7.3 billion committed to subborrowers and 2.8 billion of accrued interest as of March 1995, plus 564 million of
capital and interest outstanding under the Working Capital facility in March 1996.



47
4.31    The above figures are subject to various interpretations. Some will fix on the first
derivative and emphasize that Rs 627 million accumulated losses over three years, arrears are
continuing to increase, and 46 MPUs and federations continued to make losses in 1994-95.
Others will look at the second derivative and note that the rate of increase of arrears has slowed,
the number of MPUs and federations making losses had been reduced, and, for the first time in
three years, 1994-95 saw MPUs and federations, as a whole, make a profit. This looks more like
a "turn-around" situation than the threat of a pending financial crisis; however, others may read
the data less optimistically, and for the 46 loss-making MPUs, it is to be expected that loan
recovery will be difficult.
4.32    International Competitiveness of the Indian Dairy Industry. Empirical research
undertaken as part of the impact study shows that the protection of the Indian dairy industry has
declined remarkably over the last 20 years (Table 4.6). The initially high protection has now
been significantly reduced. Indeed, for skim milk powder (SMP) in 1994-95 and 1995-96,
protection was negative, as the effective protection coefficients (EPCs) are less than 1.00. In
large measure, this reflects a recovery of world prices, though the stable environment (and

4.33    It is worth pausing for a moment to consider the data in Table 4.6 in more detail,
especially since the results for the final year 1995-96 are atypical. Looking just at milk, had the
time series stopped in 1994-95, it would have been appropriate to conclude that the Indian dairy
industry has been very successful in reducing initially very high levels of protection, but
protection was still about 30 percent. The last row of Table 4.6 is somewhat misleading since it
is a peak in world prices of SMP and butter which explains the low protection in 1995-96. The
real world price for SMP was the second highest on record (the highest price occurred in 1988-
89), and butter was at its highest real price since 1989-90. As shown in Table 4.7, the latest
estimate of world prices for SMP and butter suggest a 10 percent fall for SMP and perhaps 30
percent for butter, implying roughly an 18 percent level of protection for India on the basis of the
latest world prices.
4.34    The protection figures in Table 4.6 refer to processed milk products. Since both milk
itself and collection, transport, and processing are "non-tradables," it is not possible to infer how
protection is allocated among these non-tradables. What is clear is that the Indian system of
getting milk from the farmer's pail to the point where it has been cooled and can be handled in
bulk is both organizationally sophisticated and technically inefficient. Indian producers get about
63 percent of the total cost of wholesale urban milk (Gulati and Bhide 1997, Table A3. 10) for
supplying warm milk in small quantities. The share of wholesale cost going to chilling centers
which supply bulk chilled milk is 81 percent (this includes the 63 percent to producers as one of
its costs). Processing margins, starting with chilled bulk milk at rural centers is thus 19 percent.
It is this figure which needs to be compared with developed-country processing margins, since
they pick up bulk chilled milk from the farm.

4.35   A byproduct impact of Operation Flood and accompanying dairy expansion has been the
establishment of an indigenous dairy equipment manufacturing industry (only 7 percent of dairy
equipment is now imported) and an impressive body of indigenous expertise that includes animal
nutrition, animal health, Al, management information systems, dairy engineering, food
technology, and the like. The Bank's insistence on International Competitive Bidding means
that, as far as Operation Flood goes, India's dairy manufacturing industry has been established in
competition with international suppliers. However, supplies of Indian equipment to non-Flood
dairy processors may have benefited from the artificial stimulus of "self-reliance" which ruled in
many industries prior to 1991 and raised the cost of those processors. This indigenous
infrastructure explains in large part why milk processing and marketing costs of Operation Flood
have not exploded in the face of having to procure and account for minute quantities of milk.

5. Village-Level Impact
5.1    Two village-level participatory studies were undertaken as a part of the evaluation. The
first of these was in nine villages in the Mysore district of Karnataka state (Sampark 1997) and
the second in 12 villages in three milksheds in Madhya Pradesh (Hiremath, Singh, and Mergos
1997). The villages in this latter study had been surveyed in 1983, and the in-depth village
studies were supported by a survey of secondary data on two hundred villages in the same
milksheds.
5.2    Both studies covered villages with and without a DCS. In the Madhya Pradesh sample,
there were villages that had had a DCS in 1983 and still had one in 1996, villages in which the
DCS had ceased to operate, a village where a DCS had been open since 1983, and a village that
had never had a DCS. Both studies administered questionnaires to individual families and used a
participatory approach. In Madhya Pradesh, this took the form of focus group discussions; in
Karnataka, social mapping and group validation of survey findings were used.
5.3    Despite the similarity of approach, quite different pictures emerged from the two studies.
The Mysore MPU in Karnataka appears to have substantial operational independence.38
Certainly it is free to set producer prices and, with the support of an integrated business plan, it
lowers producer prices in the flush and raises them in the lean period. The MPU appears to have
satisfactory relations with the supplying DCSs and has not been substantially adversely affected
by the entry of private companies under the liberalization policy. The three MPUs studied in
Madhya Pradesh appear to suffer from greater governmental interference that prevents them
from raising producer prices to be fully competitive with small traders and private companies.
This, and the withdrawal of MPU-subsidized animal health services, has led to a decline in
relations between the MPUs and their supplying DCSs. In addition, the introduction of soybeans
in Madhya Pradesh has revolutionized agriculture with large declines in the area under cotton
and groundnuts. Since soybeans provide less feed residue than cotton and groundnuts, this has
adversely affected dairying. In addition, the higher incomes from soybeans have boosted
prosperity to the point that wage labor provides incomes competitive with those from dairying.
The Mysore district has not enjoyed a similar technological change.
Karnataka
5.4    The nine villages included in the Karnataka survey comprised five with operating DCSs
(the DCS villages), two where a DCS had closed (the "defunct Flood" villages) and two that had
38. A reviewer has commented that this may be indicative of the Mysore MPU being "one of the better ones," and
while the results will be representative for Mysore Union they may be unrepresentative for India as a whole. This
comment applies to all village studies, since a sample of even 40 villages in one state or milkshed, however carefully
selected and however representative of the area being sampled, is bound to be unrepresentative of the 50,000 plus
villages with DCSs. However, an evaluation interested in impact is compelled to look for evidence at the village level.
39. The village-level focus of these studies meant that the operations of the MPUs were not studied in detail.
Comments thus primarily reflect the "view from the village" and may appear differently at the regional level.



52
never had a DCS (the "never Flood" villages). In addition to the participatory activities, the
survey interviewed a stratified random sample40 of 451 people.
5.5    Depending on how benefits are measured, quite different conclusions can emerge as to
who benefits most from the cooperative system. Thus DCS membership substantially exceeds
the number of people "pouring" to the DCS. In an effort to open up the DCS to women,
membership rules have been revised in several villages to allow two members per family. In
addition, some families that have ceased to own cattle have retained their membership.
Membership may thus not be a good measure of "beneficiaries" as usually understood. Small and
marginal farmers dominate the people pouring (74 percent of pourers contributing 74 percent of
milk to DCSs).41 Landless42 contributed another 15 percent of pourers (pours 11 percent of
milk). Large farmers were 11 percent of pourers (pours 15 percent of milk).
5.6   Important though dairying is to the landless, not all of them can participate because of
the cost of cattle and the need to purchase feed. Though the direction of causation may be in
doubt (are people wealthier because they own milch animals, or can only the wealthier afford to
own milch animals?) dairying families earn more money in DCS villages than dairying people in
defunct- and never-Flood villages. In DCS villages dairy families have higher incomes than
nondairy families, and in all villages the landless with dairy cattle are better off than those
without.
5.7    There was a general preference for selling to the DCS rather than to a private vendor.
Vendor prices tend to be higher than DCS prices close to an urban center and lower (if a vendor
is even active) in more remote villages. Women who have no access and control over the
family's total income do have some control in the case of milk money. Milk money is small
when it comes in daily or every week, and the expenditure can be on small items. Leaving a
small amount of money to their wives is not seen as a problem by some men.
5.8    The closure of the DCSs in the two defunct-Flood villages followed embezzlement by
the secretaries, irregular committee meetings, and interference from state-level authorities. This
resulted in poor cash returns to producers, falling milk procurement, and eventually a decision by
the MPU that the DCSs were no longer viable (and hence the MPU would cease to pick up milk
from the villages). Closure affected the landless and scheduled castes and tribes most adversely.
Without the DCSs, there was no alternative market, and cattle often had to be sold. The villagers
were not in a position to reactivate the DCS.
5.9   If the impact is to be evaluated from the viewpoint of equity, the study (Sampark 1997)
concludes that there is definitely a positive impact on those who are at the lower end of the
economic ladder, both in terms of landholding and caste to which they belong. However, those
who do not have access to resources to own cattle are left out of the fold of dairy cooperative and
have not been able to access this opportunity for augmenting incomes.

42. The landless in non-DCS villages had no dairy income (and presumably no cows). Actual consumption in DCS
villages was 0.8 I/day for landless, 0.9 I/day for marginal farmers, 1.3 I/day for small farmers, and 1.59 I/day for large
farmers.



53
Madhya Pradesh
5.10   As noted above, the 12 villages surveyed were initially surveyed in 1983 in connection
with the completion of the NDP (Mergos and Slade 1987). In 1983 nine of the villages had
DCSs, and in four of these (the defunct-Flood villages) the DCSs had closed. Three villages had
no DCSs in 1983, although one had formed a DCS in the meantime. Thus, in 1996 there were
five DCS villages, four defunct-Flood villages, and two never-Flood villages. Although the data
was available from the earlier study, the names of the respondents could not be recovered.
Accordingly, a new stratified random sample of 30 families from each village (360 interviews)
and a supplementary survey of village-level data was conducted in 200 villages to check the
generality of the village-level observations in the 12 resurveyed villages.
5.11   In general, Madhya Pradesh emerged as having a much more fluid dairying situation
than Karnataka. Price controls prevented the cooperative sector from raising prices to compete
fully with private companies, and the rapid expansion of the area under soybeans reflects a more
profitable farming system that provides fewer crop residues for ruminants. This, together with a
fairly widespread rash of dishonesty amongst DCS secretaries, had led to the collapse of a
significant number of DCSs. For the MPU as a whole, the proportion of functional DCSs has
dropped from 77 percent of those organized in 1983 to 55 percent in 1996. Hiremath, Singh, and
Mergos (1997, p. 91) note, "Our survey of 200 DCS villages indicated that DCSs were
functioning in 184 villages and in the remaining 16 villages the DCSs had become dysfunctional.
The reasons for DCS closure include declining milk production, poor leadership in the village,
bad choice of secretary and complaint against the DCS's operations. Nearly 31 percent of DCS's
closure was attributed to competition from the private sector as a result of the new economic
policies. Some 38 percent of the DCS closure was mainly the results of declining milk
production in villages that may be due to the impact of changing cropping patterns. Among the
remaining dysfunctional DCSs, 25 percent had closed due to both private competition and
internal reasons and 6 percent due to internal reasons alone."43
5.12   The high proportion of internal reasons for DCS collapse is disturbing. A key
assumption of the Anand system is that villages can manage their own affairs themselves." In
part, the recent Bank-sponsored withdrawal from the provision of preventative animal health
care seems to have resulted in less frequent contact between villages and representatives of the
MPU with a growing feeling of estrangement on the part of individual producers and less
opportunity for MPU staff to monitor emerging difficulties in the operation of DCSs. This is
probably the most serious concern as to the sustainability of some MPUs.
5.13   Part of the loss of suppliers to small-scale dudhiyas around urban centers is to be
welcomed. With short distances from farm to consumer, the dudhiyas can be economically
efficient. In practice, part of their competitive edge may be due to the routine adulteration of
milk by farmers or in transit. Dudhiyas also provide credit and, in doing so, provide an additional
service not available from DCSs. Competition with private companies represents a different
issue. To the extent that companies can operate more efficiently because they are not subject to
price fixing and overstaffing mandated by the state, the solution is in the hands of the state and
43. Poor leadership in the village and bad choice of secretary.
44. NDDB supports a Cooperative Development Program to improve farmers' understanding of the cooperative system
and their rights and responsibilities (para. 4.6). This recognizes that tensions within the village can undermine the
operations of the DCS. See also Attwood 1985, p. 37.



54
the cooperative sector.45 If excessive debt in the cooperative sector is the problem, then some
financial restructuring may be required. To the extent that private companies are able to pay
more to convenient villages with low transport costs, the cooperatives may eventually be forced
to reconsider their panterritorial pricing policy.
5.14    The loss of DCSs due to declining milk production is to be welcomed if it represents the
realization of new opportunities for farmers to use their resources more profitably or rising
incomes that will ultimately lead to higher home consumption.46 In the Bhopal milkshed, it
appears that much of the decline in milk availability is the result of the introduction of soybeans.
5.15    As for Karnataka, the surveyed relationships between wealth and dairying need to be
interpreted cautiously. A striking change for all villages from 1983 to 1996 has been the increase
in the years of education for the head of household which had doubled and in some cases almost
tripled. Within this general trend, the households without milch animals (with or without a DCS)
have increased their educational levels faster than the dairying households. This may reflect the
reliance of nondairy households on nonfarm jobs that require education at higher levels.
5.16   In 1983, incomes were higher in non-DCS villages than in DCS villages, but by 1996
this relationship had been reversed. In the period between the two surveys, real income rose at
6.5 percent per annum in the DCS villages but at only 3.5 percent in the non-DCS villages.
Despite this, the defunct-Flood villages were reported to be the most developed in terms of
educational and income levels, agricultural land owned and irrigated, numbers of milch animals
owned, and milk sold. This suggests that these villages were close to town and thus able to
capitalize on their locational advantage to get high milk prices from dudhiyas even in the
absence of a DCS.
5.17   In those villages with a DCS in 1996, the DCS's performance was rated highly with
respect to milk price, provision of a reliable market for milk, and regularity of payment.
Respondents were much less satisfied with the provision of veterinary services and fodder. In
large measure, this more critical view of veterinary services was the correct reflection of a new
"unbundling" policy introduced at the Bank's urging by OFIII. Under OFI and OFII, both regular
health camps and emergency veterinary services had been provided free or at highly subsidized
rates by the MPU. In part, this represented a view that "prevention is better than cure" and that
farmers were better off paying a compulsory insurance premium through a slightly lower milk
check than remaining uninsured. The Bank argued that this undermined the market for the
private supply of veterinary services and by implication that the risk element could be ignored. It
was agreed that the health camps would be discontinued and even emergency service moved
toward full cost recovery. The results of this policy can be seen in Table 5.1 and Table 5.2. The
need for veterinary services increased substantially, and the proportion of cases where the need
was satisfied fell. 7 This was particularly marked for members of a DCS, but also applied to
45. To the extent that corporate competition is based upon government equity and tax holidays not available to the
cooperative sector, the solution is the withdrawal of this assistance to private companies (Box 6.1). See also para. 6.3 1.
46. If reduced supply is due to price controls holding prices at levels below what the market could bear, it is not to be
welcomed but is evidence of the need to remove state interference from pricing decisions.
47. A reviewer reports: "Vets in Anand interviewed during a visit said that increased cost recovery reduced emergency
calls from farmers for nonemergency matters. Since the visits were practically free, farmers tended to seek more help
than necessary since the cost of vet visits was undervalued." The reviewer also criticized the survey reported in Table
5.1 as not adequately answering the question of whether farmers are better or worse off. Perhaps a question that should
have been asked was: "Do you prefer the present system where you pay for veterinary services directly or the old

needs were met in non-DCS villagcs.

5.19    An unappreciated benefit of the MPU's provision of veterinary services was the resulting
increased contact between MPU staff and the village. The loss of this contact probably explains
some of the deterioration in the performance of DCS secretaries and lethargic management
committees.
5.20    Since farmers attitudes may well differ from state to state or even MPU to MPU, the
decision on bundling or unbundling services is probably best left to the management of
individual MPUs.
system where these services were 'subsidized,' but at the cost of receiving less money for every liter of milk?"
Unfortunately, we cannot go back and rerun the survey. In fact, both questions are needed. The indications from the
questions in Table 5.1 are that farmers would probably be willing to pay something to revert to the old system. The
reviewer is right to question whether they would be willing to have their milk money docked enough to pay the full
cost.

6.  Project Impact
6.1     Caveat #1. As argued earlier, "project," and hence project impact, is here interpreted as
relating to the fundamental policy change support which both largely terminated direct new
public sector support for dairy development and launched Operation Flood. Indirect assistance to
the dairy industry as a whole through animal health, Al, research, extension, and miscellaneous
credit programs continued unabated.
6.2     Caveat #2. The impact of the Bank's assistance is evaluated relative to the preexisting
low-growth policies with direct government involvement in milk procurement, pricing, and
distribution. The evaluation takes India's highly protectionist self-reliant policy as given. This
imposed high costs on consumers as indicated by the high Net Protection Coefficient of about 3
in 1975 (Table 4.6). In the event, this "second best" policy has brought India close to a "first
best" result. Currently the industry is subject to only modest effective protection, say about 18
percent, in large part due to rising world prices and a real devaluation of the rupee.
Milk Production
6.3     Milk production and Operation Flood milk procurement and sales are shown in Table 6.1
and Figures 6.148 and 6.2. These show a change in national milk production from a growth rate
of 0.7 percent per annum until 196949 and 4.7 percent per annum cumulative since. Though this
change occurred prior to the approval of the Bank's first project (March 1974), it can best be
attributed to the policy changes accompanying the launching of Operation Flood in 1970. This
change in government dairy policy abandoned government schemes that underpaid producers
and tried to compensate by providing improved technology and credit and replaced it with a
dairy cooperative scheme that was allowed to capture the rents generated by sale of milk powder
and butter-oil supplied as food aid.
6.4     Had the first dairy credit been approved in 1994, rather than 1974, it might have been
recognized as a new-style sector adjustment credit, albeit in support of policies already in
process of implementation. The projects being evaluated represent a series of five investment
credits predicated upon a major policy change made, "owned," and persisted with by
government.
48. Table 6.1 corresponds almost exactly with Figure 2.1 "Measurement of Project Impact," in Mergos and Slade
(1987). This figure is used by the authors as the basis for a methodological discussion of the measurement of project
impact. As they say: "We assume that there is an underlying upward trend .... We are concerned with the additional
change, attributable to the project, over and above the underlying secular trend" (p. 23).
49. Linear regression suggests the change occurred almost simultaneously with project approval. The exponential
model suggests 1971, five years after the decision to rely on the cooperative sector for daity development.

6.5     Given the extensive time lag from policy decision to project approval, one might well
ask how Bank projects could be credited with any of the benefits from the policy change. The
projects supported the policy change long before they were approved by the Board. This support
should be dated from the first time the Bank indicated its willingness to consider appraising the
first project (Box 1.1). Not only was this indication of Bank support helpful in endorsing the
wisdom of the government's policy change, but it helped validate the EC's and WFP's decision to
provide generous amounts of dairy products to India to support Operation Flood. As the credits
took shape, they became a potent argument against policy reversal in the event that the bureaucratic
beneficiaries of the old policy were ever in a danger of mounting a counterrevolution. Moreover,
the Bank projects allowed the govermnent to support the major investments needed for the new
policy without the government having to bear the immediate pain of finding all the resources.

Notes-
1. The production estimates are total production and are based on a sample survey. Purchases and sales are from NDDB.
2. For some reason the production survey does not include the amount marketed, so there are no official estimates of total
marketings.
3. To some extent this compares different things, since the fat content of milk can vary from say 3.0 percent in a poor
Fresian to 12 percent in a good buffalo. A proper accounting would include data on butterfat and solids-not-fat (SNF)
produced.

6.6     Given the policy decision that had been made and the dynamic nature of Operation
Flood management, the most likely "counter factual" if the Bank had failed to support Operation
Flood is that one or more other donors would have stepped into the breach. However, without
any donor support, it is reasonable to suppose that the expansion involved in Operation Flood
would have had to be implemented more slowly. This slower expansion would have forced
increased reliance on imported milk powder, urban milk shortages, or significantly higher milk



61
prices. Any of these alternatives would have invited a return to more interventionist and
managed (more strictly, mismanaged) dairy policy. Such a policy reversal would then have
undermined the expansion of the whole dairy industry, which was the real payoff from the policy
change.
6.7    It takes nothing from the achievements of Operation Flood to suggest that its biggest
contribution may have been to ensure that the non-Operation Flood portion of the industry was
allowed to grow. This was excellent policy-based lending-not to achieve a change in policy but
rather in support of a policy change that was already being implemented.50
6.8    Two key policy changes were involved with this series of projects. The first was to stop
direct (especially central) government support for intervention to provide low cost milk by the
importation of skim milk powder and butterfat and direct milk collection and processing. This
policy change had already been adopted when the first Bank project was approved, and Bank
lending can thus be seen as supportive of this changed policy. The second policy change was to
get state governments to stop implementing dairy policy through the cooperatives by interfering
with pricing or staffing. Table 6.11 shows that progress was made in this direction, but it was
incomplete. NDPII was predicated on attaining independence of dairy cooperatives; this goal
was not fully achieved.
Supply or Demand Shift?
6.9    An increase in production (or consumption) over time can be brought about in two ways
either by a movement along the supply (or demand) curve or by a shift in the relevant curve.
These have very different developmental implications and are at the core of the attribution of
benefits in this impact study. An increase in production due to a shift along the supply curve
implies that higher prices are being paid for the product (due to the demand curve having shifted
to the right). No technical progress has been achieved and should prices decline to their former
level, then production would also decline to its original value. If this happened, the observed
increase in production would be brought at the cost of higher prices and be caused primarily by
changes in the economy generally. A (rightwards) shift of the supply function itself, however,
represents a willingness by producers to supply a larger quantity at the old price (or the same
quantity at a lower price). This is "economic progress" or "development" and represents
improved technology, costs reductions, and accumulated investments in production (or just
possibly a price decline in alternative products). To the extent that the demand curve has shifted
to the right, this represents a stimulus to the dairy industry due to macroeconomic factors such as
population growth, higher incomes, and reduced transaction costs in a liberal economy. To the
extent that the supply curve has shifted to the right, this represents technical progress and
development. It is important in interpreting an observed increase in production to know to what
extent it is the result of macroeconomic factors at work in the economy and to what extent it
represents development on the supply side.
50. The rapid (4.7 percent) growth of milk production has been challenged as "biologically impossible" (Mishra and
Sharma 1990). They estimate milk yield would have to increase "7.6 percent a year during 1971-72 to 1977-78" and
in 1985-86 by 18 percent. They make no allowance for the crossbreeding of local cows (which triples the yield). When
this is factored in, even mating no more than 3 percent of local cows to exotic breeds leads to a cumulative
improvement in yield of 2.2 percent per annum which, while high, is not biologically impossible.



62
6.10   Over a twenty-five year period, it is to be expected that both demand and supply
functions will have shifted. Demand will have shifted under the influence of macroeconomic
variables such as population and income increase and lowered transactions costs, while the
supply function will have shifted due to changed technology (such as crossbred cows) and
accumulated investment in the industry. These variables cannot (or certainly have not) been
observed directly. As shown in Table 6.2, the real price of producer milk has fallen from Rs 7.77
per liter in 1975-76 to Rs 5.29 per liter in 1993-94 (both in 1990-91 Rs). Real urban processed
milk prices are graphed against total milk production over the life of Operation Flood in Figure
6.3. This clearly shows that the real price of milk has fallen even as production has increased.
This fact argues that there has been a larger shift in the supply function. The first and last year's
observations from Figure 6.3 have been transposed to Figure 6.4 in order to consider the relative
magnitude of the shifts. Point Al in Figure 6.4 represents 1977-78, and A2 represents 1993-94.
The price elasticity of demand for milk in India has been estimated at -1.077 (Dairy India 1997,
p. 59). As shown in Figure 6.4, this implies a shift from demand function DI to D2. This is a
shift in quantity demanded from QI to Q2. If short-run supply were perfectly inelastic, the shift
in supply would be from QI to Q2. In the less extreme case where supply elasticity51 is taken to
be 1, represented by supply function S1, the shift in the supply function is from Ql " (the amount
which would have been supplied at the lower price in 1993-94 using the original S1 supply
timeline) to Q2 (the amount which actually was supplied). In either case, the shift in supply
exceeds the shift in demand. Both have shifted-supply more than demand.
6.11   As shown in Figure 6.4, there appear to have been both supply and demand shifts. The
annual rate of production increase (i.e., shift of the supply function at constant prices) for
Operation Flood (4.7 percent) exceeds that for rice and wheat from the commencement of the
green revolution (3.4 percent). For wheat alone, the rate of increase (5.0 percent) has been
slightly higher than for milk, while for rice, the rate (2.8 percent) has been significantly lower.
Thus, the supplyfunction shiftfor milk under Operation Flood and associatedpolicy changes52
has been quite comparable (even greater than) the supply shiftfor the green revolution grains in
India. Some comparisons between the growth rates, price declines, and economic significance of
wheat, rice, and milk are given in Table 6.3.
51. It has not been possible to identify an estimate in the literature of the supply elasticity for milk in India.
52. Government production support to the dairy industry (animal health, Al, extension, and credit schemes for the
purchase of cows) has been provided both before and after the period of accelerated growth in both Operation Flood
and non-Flood areas.

Economic Performance
6.12   Total Bank investment in the five projects was $500 million nominal, which converts
after compounding at 10 percent and allowance for inflation to $1.9 billion in 1996 dollars
(Annex A). By 1996, the higher growth rate associated with the Operation Flood period
(especially the associated policy changes, para. 6.3) was resulting in an extra 43 million metric
tons of milk per annum. Since the start of the faster growth trend, and using a 10 percent rate to
compound its value to 1996, the total increment was 1,086 million metric tons. Each ton would
require about $310 of imported ingredients if it were to be replaced with recombined milk. If
even 0.56 percent of the observed increase in milk production were due to Bank investments, the
projects would return an economic rate of return (ERR) of 10 percent; if all investments (from
the WFP, EC, and government of India) are taken into account, at most 2 percent of the increased
production would need to be attributable to the project to yield an ERR of 10 percent. It seems
highly likely that at least these modest increases can be attributed to the projects. Two cost
headings not included in these calculations are (i) state reimbursement to state federations and
MPUs for losses incurred on the instructions of government or under state-appointed managers
and (ii) general assistance to the dairy industry since these expenses would have been incurred
even without a change in policy.
6.13   Using a narrower definition of project impact (i.e., direct nonpolicy impact), the PARs
for the first four projects and the ICR of the final project provide the estimates of economic
benefits listed in Table 6.4.

6.14   The cost of Operation Flood depends on what items are included. Table 6.5 provides the
impact's estimates of these costs (see Annex B for the derivation of this table and how these
estimates differ from earlier estimates). One item which is missing from Table 6.5 is direct
assistance from state governments to MPUs and state federations. It has not been possible to
obtain estimates of these transfers. Typically they are made to compensate for losses made by
MPUs or federations. However, such losses occur in two quite different ways. The first is where
a fully independent, farmer-controlled MPU or federation makes losses in the normal course of
its business. Government transfers to make up for such losses can clearly be described as
"subsidies." A second situation is where the losses are directly due to government dictated
pricing decisions or losses made under government nominated management or due to
government mandated overstaffing. Government transfers in such circumstances are better
described as "reimbursement" to the cooperatives, even though they may in the case of pricing
directives be subsidies to consumers or producers. Since it has not been possible to derive these
costs, it has not been necessary to try to partition them into subsidies and reimbursements.

6.15   A further cost which has not been included is the general support that state governments
extend to the dairy industry in general through extension, research, animal health, AI, and
regulatory services. Again, it was not possible to assemble the necessary cost data. Though
provided to both Flood and non-Flood areas, these costs still enter the overall envelope of
financial assistance to the dairy industry as a whole.
6.16   A cost which is included, but is not at all well documented (Annex B, para. 17), is the
value of govermuent dairy plants (and sometimes associated debts) transferred to dairy
cooperatives or leased to them without charge or for a peppercorn rent. This has been set at
US$0.8 billion in 1996 dollars.
6.17   The costs in Table 6.5 refer to the total value of assistance over the period 1971-72 to
1996-97, expressed in 1996 US dollars. It is important to note that for the costs covered, these
cost elements cover both capital and recurrent costs. Annual central government expenditures on
animal health, for example, have been converted to 1996 US dollars and summed.
6.18   The most general level of assistance is total central government assistance to the dairy
industry in general, including Operation Flood. Much of this assistance (especially for Operation
Flood) was provided from food aid and Bank loans and credits. Most of this assistance flowed
through the government's consolidated accounts, appearing first as consolidated revenues and
then as consolidated expenditures. The total cost of central government, including transfer of
state assets to cooperatives, is estimated to be US$2.98 billion.
6.19   Of this, US$250 million was for identifiably non-Flood central government support to
the industry in general, leaving US$2.73 billion as the assistance to Operation Flood (strictly
assistance to NDDB/IDC and Operation Flood, see para. 6.21). The sources of this funding are
shown in Table 6.5.



68
6.20   This leaves two possible sources of overestimation. First, there is the very shaky
estimate of US$0.8 billion for the value of plant transfers. If this is deleted, the estimated
expenditure falls to US$1.93 billion (now probably an underestimate).
6.21   Another possible source of overestimation is the inclusion of all payments to
NDDB/IDC from the central government as costs of Operation Flood. Starting in 1979-80, the
consolidated accounts itemize expenditures on NDDB/IDC. How much of this was for Operation
Flood? Earlier they did not make this break-out. It was felt that some of the payments to
NDDB/IDC might be for closely related dairy activities which were highly supportive of
Operation Flood. Accordingly, the above estimates have included all central government
payments to NDDB/IDC.
6.22   Finally, we need to know how many beneficiaries. Since many farmers have only one or
two cows, they will be able to supply milk at some times of year, while not at others. NDDB has
provided estimates (Annex B, Table B 16) that 6.3 million members supply milk at some time in
the year, but only 3.5 million poured milk in December 1996. Accordingly, costs per beneficiary
are also provided on the basis of the 6.3 million members who supplied at some time in the year
and the 3.5 million farmers who supplied in December, 1996.
6.23   These alternative cost and beneficiary estimates have been consolidated in Table 6.6 into
a range of estimates of per beneficiary capital costs. Even though some state assistance to the
dairy industry is excluded, the first row of Table 6.6 is clearly an overestimate, since total
assistance to the dairy industry has been divided by the producers of only 6.3 percent of total
production. The second and last rows probably provide good upper and lower bounds on the cost
of Operation Flood. Remembering that this covers capital and recurrent costs (para. 6.17), the
annual cost per member (who pours at some time in the year) for capital and recurrent
expenditures is between US$10 and US$17.53

6.24   Another way of looking at economic performance is to consider either how the same
outcome (consumption and price level) could have been achieved by alternative means (trade, in
this case) or the change in producer and consumer surplus induced by the project. The
appropriate calculationsfor one year (1996) are provided in Annex C. The results are given in
Table 6.7. That the dominant gains are in consumer surplus confirms the argument advanced
elsewhere (paras. 6.9-6.11) that the dominant impact has been a shift in the supply function. As
53. If one wanted to express this for "an average year of the project," this could be doubled since there has been a
build-up in membership. On the other hand, the industry still has substantial assets; not all these resources have been
used up.

calculated in Table 6.7, the gains in just one year would have paid for the whole of Operation
Flood and associated policy changes, thus underlining the key importance of getting policies
right.

Exploration of the Free Trade Option
6.25   The political realities in India, prior to the late 1980s, ruled out a reversal of the highly
protectionist policy of economic self-reliance or, more modestly, an exemption for the dairy
industry. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to examine the magnitude of benefits forgone by refusing
to follow a "first best" policy of free trade, at least for the dairy industry.
6.26   An attempt to model general free trade in a formerly protected economy runs into the
intractable problem that the new price regime would change the distribution of income and
wealth within the economy, which would lead to shifts in demand functions, which in turn
determine the new price structure and hence incomes and wealth. There is no satisfactory way to
model these simultaneous and recursive changes.
6.27   This section finesses this problem by asking what would have been the impact of an
exemption of self-reliance for the dairy industry, leaving the rest of the economy protected? In
the interests of clarity, the assumptions are simple and minimal. The first assumption is that only
urban consumption of milk would have been affected (i.e., about 30 percent of production). This
implies no effect on village-level consumption and, more seriously, no impact on processed
products. The second assumption is that, under free trade or self-sufficiency, without Operation
Flood the supply function would have shifted half as much as it did under Operation Flood. That
is, technical advances would have been adopted, but not as quickly as under the stimulus of
Operation Flood. The results for 1993-94 (the last year for which production data are available)
are given in Table 6.8.

6.28   The argument for free trade is that it leads to a maximization of consumer surplus and
indeed Table 6.8 suggests that consumer surplus would have been increased by free trade, as
compared to Operation Flood. However, the extra foreign exchange cost of imported raw
materials exceeds the gain in consumer surplus (and this foreign exchange represents other
consumption forgone in the rest of the economy).54 To the extent that weight is put on the loss of
producer surplus (much of it going to the very poor), then the advantages of the free trade option
are reduced.
Industrial Structure
6.29   The industrial structure which emerged as a result of Operation Flood involved an
organized sector composed of Operation Flood cooperatives, private companies, and "other
cooperatives and government schemes," and an informal sector composed of small traders
(dudhiyas), urban milk producers, and intravillage trade directly from producer to consumer.
Both the small traders and urban milk producers sell directly to urban consumers without
pasteurization or other factory treatment.
6.30   Although Operation Flood cooperatives comprise the largest single dairy organization, it
is engaged in active competition with small traders in peri-urban villages and with some private
companies in urban milk sales. Relative milk procurement is given in Table 6.9.
6.31   Prior to the New Economic Policy (NEP) announced in the 1992-93 budget, competition
within the dairy industry was controlled in two ways. Firstly, NDDB had a monopoly on the
importation of dairy products. Secondly, construction of new processing capacity was subject to
industrial licensing. Repeal of industrial licensing under the NEP resulted in a boom in
investment in new processing capacity, since this was obviously a growth industry. This
investment also enjoyed a large number of incentive payments and tax holidays as described in
Box 6.1. The well-known case for the economic efficiency of private investment and competition
rests on the assumption of an absence of significant subsidies and taxes. Clearly, this condition is
not currently met in the Indian dairy sector. As a result of the NEP (liberalization accompanied
by subsidies), significant excess processing capacity has been created. Thus, prior to
liberalization, the Operation Flood cooperatives had about 58 percent of the processing capacity
54. Of course, with a full macroeconomic analysis, the exchange rate would shift too, thus changing consumption
patterns and incomes throughout the economy and leaving the position of the demand function itself moot.



71
in the Punjab with the balance in the rest of the organized sector. Since liberalization, the supply
of milk to the organized sector is expected to rise by 0.56 million l/day. The Operation Flood
cooperatives have raised their processing capacity by 0.28 million I/day (roughly in line with a
50 to 60 percent market share). The balance of the organized sector has raised installed capacity
by 1.1 million 1/day and applied for a capacity expansion of 2.71 million I/day.55 Thus, the
relatively orderly, low cost, and competitive expansion of the dairy industry which characterized
the Operation Flood period has been succeeded by a rapid and excessive expansion of processing
capacity under the NEP, driven by subsidies far in excess of anything which was offered in the
Flood period.

6.32    A Milk and Milk Products Order (MMPO) was introduced eight months after the 1992-
93 budget to dampen the "irrational exuberance" of private sector dairy processing investors.
This again requires licensing of large plants (over 50,000 I/day) but has not been very effective.
6.33    Most private processors rely on contractors and informal traders to procure milk from
farmers, only taking possession of the milk at the factory receiving dock. They thus have no
55. "Fears about over-capitalization were further reinforced because many state governments were reckless in
announcing all manner of concessions and subsidies in order to attract private capital to their state. In Haryana, for
example, some 40 new plants were proposed to raise processing capacity to a total of 40 lakh liters per day (lId) from
the existing 15 plants which had a capacity of 10 lid. This looked ridiculous because a majority of the existing plants
were hardly viable; the Haryana Cooperative Federation, which has been operating for nearly two decades, had never
been able to collect more than 2 lid in flush and 50,000 liters in lean seasons. There seemed no way the new plant
could become viable. Vij has suggested that the private businessmen were interested more in the tax breaks and
subsidies which they could claim under the present regime. In his estimate, the 11 new plants proposed would earn, by
way of tax exemptions alone, nearly Rs 100 crores by making disproportionate investment in land and machinery
expressly for claiming these concessions; there would be additional subsidies and concessions from both the state as

direct contact with producers and no control over the treatment of milk before it reaches the
factory (Box 4.1) or the prices paid to farmers. Milk is, of course, tested on receipt.
Box 6.1: A Level Playing Field?
India is a very diverse, federal republic, meaning that much industrial policy is constitutionally determined
by the state governments. Both before and after the NEP, the most rapid growth of private sector dairying has been in
the Punjab. Even before the NEP, one multinational had a plant with 0.8 million I/day processing capacity, compared
to a total cooperative capacity in the state of 1.5 million I/day.
Since the NEP, the private sector has added about 1.1 million I/day nominal capacity. It is nominal since
reporting requirements are lax, and investors have an incentive to overstate intended processing capacity in order to
attract larger state equity investments.
Incentives available to attract new industrial investment (including private corporate' dairy processing) in the
Punjab include:
*   A 49 percent state equity in large companies as ajoint venture, thus halving the capital an investor must put up. State
equity is contributed in cash, whereas the entrepreneur's contribution can include assets and good will, possibly
valued quite arbitrarily.
*   Reduction for seven years of 8.8 percent state sales tax to 4.4 percent.
*   Exemption from a 20 percent surcharge on power consumption.
*   An income tax holiday for seven years.
In addition, any milk described as originating from outside the state is exempt from a 4 percent tax on milk
for processing. Since the cooperative system is organized on an intrastate basis, this results in a defacto concession to
b
the private sector. The sales tax concession alone far exceeds a reasonable profit margin for milk processing.
Forced to register under the Registrar of Cooperatives, cooperatives have to operate in a much more
paternalistic and interference-prone environment than companies that answer to the Registrar of Companies.
Though perhaps partially self-imposed, cooperatives relate their salary scales to those within the public
service. Managerial and professional staffs can typically at least double their salaries on joining a private company.'
It is possible to argue about the level of assistance provided to the cooperative sector in the past,d but as of
today, the "playing field," in Punjab at least, is heavily tilted in favor of the private corporate sector, which can only
lead to serious misallocation of resources.
In the milkshed for the Ropar District Cooperative Milk Producers' Union, 0.9 miRlion 1/day (nominal)
capacity was added by private investors in the eight-month period following the announcement of the NEP and before
the introduction of the MMPO. The Ropar MPU has a capacity of 0. 1 million I/day. Though the five plants that
resulted draw from a wider area than the Ropar MPU, the probability that they could all survive was low ex ante, and
in fact one has already closed, and others may do so. Capital investment cost is about Rs 1,000 (US$27) per liter. The
investment has been about US$25 million, some of it now of little more than scrap value.
a. But not cooperative investment, since this falls under the Registrar of Cooperatives.
b. Similarly, D.M. Attwood and B.S. Baviskar (1987) remark in the context of sugar". . . although the [sugar]
cooperatives receive some helpful subsidies from the government, much larger subsidies are directed to the private
factories at the expense of the more efficient cooperatives."
c. Indeed, the managerial and professional staffs may well prove to be the main beneficiaries of the liberalization in the
dairy industry, as cooperatives are forced to go some way toward meeting private sector salary scales for key staff.
d. The activities of the NDDB have been almost entirely self-financed, albeit including substantial profits generated by the
sale of concessionally priced food imports. Bank assistance was advanced in the form of loans, which are being repaid on
agreed terms. The government accepted, as it should, the foreign exchange risk of borrowing externally, and inflation has
substantially eroded the real cost of the NDDB's debt, as it has for all debtors. It is clear that any debate as to subsidy
levels is unlikely to be fruitful, unless it starts with a conceptually clear definition of the subsidy element to be estimated.

Farmer Incomes
6.34    We have already seen that milk production has grown at over 4 percent annually since
the inception of Operation Flood. In constant (1995) rupees, the annual payment by the
cooperative system dairy farmers has risen from Rs 2.1 billion in 19725 to Rs 34.0 billion in
1995.57 Village interviews during the evaluation mission brought out two key points. First,
dairying is shifting, in a few cases, from a sideline activity to a serious economic enterprise and,
in some cases, even becoming the main source of farm income. Second, dairying was
particularly valued because of the reliability and regularity of payments. In many families,
dairying is relied upon to pay recurrent household expenditures, leaving the crop income to
finance investments and major social events. A cost of production study carried out by the
Punjab Agricultural University in two milksheds in the Punjab (Gill and others 1995) reported an
average gross revenue of 9.30 Rs/l in 1994-95, with a gross margin of 3.61 Rs/l and a net return
of 3.06 Rs/l, or 33 percent. The study correctly included imputed costs of labor, capital, and land.
Rates of return and payback periods were correspondingly high (45 percent) and low (2.5 years),
respectively.
6.35   This high return to dairying is in part borne out by reports that milk vendors continue to
be able to purchase milk from some non-DCS villages at discounts of as much as 30 percent off
the cooperative price.
Credit
6.36   The impact of a DCS on credit arrangements in a village is very complex. In the first
place, neither a DCS nor an MPU will extend credit officially. However, some DCS secretaries
may informally provide advance payments, though this is discouraged due to the possibility of
embezzlement and discrimination in favor of an elite. Some MPUs visited have acted as brokers,
putting DCSs or individuals in touch with private banks or official credit schemes.
6.37   Membership in a DCS often improves a person's creditworthiness with retailers and
others (Table 3.9). However, the willingness of dudhiyas to extend credit quietly, quickly, and in
confidence in times of need is highly valued and in part explains their persistence even in
villages with DCSs (George 1991, p. 284). The high real rate of interest charged is still
preferable to borrowing from a money lender, since future milk income can be used as security.
Women
6.38   Women in most Indian villages have a strongly socially-constructed role.58 They run the
household and are employed outside the home only in very poor families where the husband is
56. Dairy India (1997, p. 18a) gives the price of milk as 9 Rs/kg. Volume is from Table 6.9.
57. Dairy India (1997, p. 5). This agrees closely with the estimate of Rs 30.0 billion given in the ICR, Appendix D, p.
6.
58. India is, of course, a highly diverse country. The generalizations expressed in this section undoubtedly have many
exceptions. However, they are useful in emphasizing the revolutionary impact women-dominated DCSs can have on
women, at least in some villages.



74
unable to earn even a minimum survival income.59 They are traditionally dependent on their
husbands for even quite modest and essential expenditures. They play virtually no visible role in
village politics or social organizations and are understandably shy. Their household tasks include
the care and feeding (and dung utilization) of dair7 animals. In a male-dominated DCS, the
husband may or may not collect the milk income.  Who collects milk money is less important
than for what it is used. Provided it is used for current household expenditures, food, and
education, the woman's practical needs are met. Empirical data on this point is weak.61
6.39   The social (and production) impact of women's DCSs (WDCSs) is dramatic. In such
DCSs only women members are accepted, the management committees are composed
exclusively of women, and the secretary and Al worker can be women. Women thus find
themselves empowered, since they are "authorized" to meet collectively outside the home and
explicitly make their own decisions. Latent leadership talents emerge, and self-confidence is
built and reinforced, even among the followers.
6.40   The Bank's study of Gender and Poverty in India (World Bank 1991, para. 4.18-4.31)
emphasizes the lead role played by NGOs (notably, the Self-employed Women's Association
and Bhagavatula Charitable Trust), in some cases with Ford Foundation support, in establishing
YVDCSs. Increasingly, WDCSs are being mainstreamed in Operation Flood's expansion. There
is, of course, no compulsion for NGO-organized village women's dairy societies to join
Operation Flood. For the most part, they have chosen to do so and have been welcomed.
6.41   Because dairying is their primary, and usually only, commercial activity, women, when
empowered, prove more adept at the utilization of improved husbandry methods than their
husbands. At home all day, they are better able to identify when an animal comes into heat, for
instance, and thus to get it to the AI worker in a timely fashion.
6.42   When women get the milk income (by far the dominant pattern in a WDCS), it enables
them to make most household expenditures without having to ask their husbands for money and
even to save small amounts for emergencies. Women report much reduced domestic tension
from having an independent, if modest, income.
6.43   Discussion with WDCS members reported some initial opposition from the village men
in some cases, but especially when the women demonstrated their ability to increase production
and a reduced need for income from the husband, opposition changes to support. The man who
had recently been ashamed to have his wife be seen taking an active role outside the house
switched almost unconsciously to taking pride in her leadership qualities as demonstrated within
the WDCS. As for the women, they are excited by their achievements.
59. The Bank's study of Gender and Poverty in India (World Bank 1991, p. viii) emphasizes the inside/outside
dichotomy with most women's tasks being confined within the household, resulting in conscious or unconscious
female seclusion. This dichotomy is one which both boys and girls are led to expect almost from birth-hence, the
reference to a socially-constructed role.
60. The women's literature emphasizes the collection of milk money by men, even though the money may be given to
the wife for safekeeping (Rangnekar, Vasini, and Rangnekar 1994 and Sinha undated).
61. NDDB notes that the absolute number of women members of DCSs increased from approximately 66,000 in 1984-
85 to approximately 1.70 million in 1995-96.



75
6.44   Visits to the dairy factory and feed plant and interstate travel to Anand (for WDCS
chairwomen) gets women out of the village as a group and widens their horizons. Moreover, the
thorough understanding of the cow's reproductive cycle, which is part and parcel of the effective
use of Al, provides a compulsory tutorial on the possibilities for family planning.
6.45   No doubt Operation Flood will be criticized by some for not promoting a "gender
neutral" approach to cooperative development.62 As their name suggests, WDCSs do imply a
gender-differentiated role for women. Because it provides social endorsement for women to meet
outside the home, to develop leadership skills, and to take business responsibility, it changes
significantly the socially-constructed pattern by which women expect to live their lives. It is a
vastly improved pattern, and that should be enough.
6.46   Nominally gender neutral, the original project design resulted in male-dominated
management committees for the DCSs and male articulation of needs to the MPU and Operation
Flood. The dominant productive role of women was not reflected in the management of the DCS,
nor was technical information extended to them directly. The Cooperative Development
program, especially in the context of WDCS, has increasingly emphasized the role of women and
has organized visits to the dairy factory and to discuss the rights and responsibilities of (women)
members as well as Al, animal feeding, and improved husbandry. With something like 6,000
WDCSs (and more to come) or approximately 300,000 active members of WDCSs, Operation
Flood provides an example of large-scale program redesign to address gender issues.
Employment Generation
6.47   As mentioned above, one of Operation Flood's key impacts was to allow women to give
up coolie (laboring) work outside the home. In addition to releasing children to go to school, this
also translated into "employment creation." With 3.5 million pourers, it is reasonable to assume
that 5 percent represented women who were able to stay home rather than go out to work. This
withdrawal of women from the labor force will have opened up an additional 175,000 laboring
jobs (admittedly ill-paid jobs), predominantly for the very poor. Operation Flood has been a
major employment generating project.
Improved Technology
6.48   Operation Flood has been assiduous in promoting improved technologies, including Al;
crossbred cows; vaccinations; improved feeds and forage seeds; urea treatment of straw, fan, and
sprinkler cooling of cows in summer; and biogas plants.63 In particular, the program has
provided training to villagers in Al, elementary animal health, and first aid. Far more animals are
inseminated, at higher conception rates, by these Operation Flood technicians than by the
professional veterinarians stationed at government expense at Al centers, even when the density
of the government system reaches as high as one center to six villages. The changes promoted by
62. The normal DCSs are gender neutral according to their bylaws. Membership is open equally to men and women (but
only one person per family, a rule relaxed in some DCSs). The only gender-specific requirement is that at least one woman
be on the management committee. But in practice, such societies are usually run by the men of the village, with the token
woman making no significant contribution to decisions made by the committee.
63. Biogas certainly beats handmade cow-dung patties as a cooking medium, especially for the women, who traditionally
not only have to cook but also make the dung patties. Many programs promote biogas plants. Indeed, the key way
Operation Flood promotes them is to broker farmer access to such programs.



76
Operation Flood have been widely adopted by other farmers and villages. Anecdotal information
suggests that maximum yield per animal is rising quite fast, but none of the available statistics
are in a form that allows for checking yields within the cooperative system. And indeed, village
level time-series data only hint at the trend in procurement per farmer that might have been
expected to follow from the higher yields reported in interviews.
Adulteration
6.49   Adulteration is a long-standing problem in India, as it is elsewhere in the developing
world. As incomes increase, consumers can be expected to become more discriminatory, and
hygiene regulations are likely to be enforced more strictly. In their 1986-87 study, Kaur and Gill
(undated) make the throwaway comment that "the share of creamery in the consumer's rupee
was 15.18 percent which was apparently low but they earned more by way of adulterating milk."
In a 1993 study, Gill and Kaur (1993) report that 70 percent of the 90 consumers interviewed
mentioned problems with adulterated milk, while 68.8 percent mentioned unhygienic milk and
problems of taste. Middlemen (dudhiyas) in 32 percent of cases mentioned problems with
adulteration of milk by farmers. However, the dudhiyas 'most frequent complaint was that they
were "harassed by the staff of Health Department who took bribes by threat of taking milk
samples" (Gill and Kaur 1993). Box 4.1 describes one unhygienic noncooperative milk cooling
center; Box 4.2 documents problems with "artificial milk," and Table 6.10 reports that 16 percent
of the millc samples drawn by the Health Department in the Punjab showed adulteration64 in 1994
and 24 percent in 1995. More significant is the very small number of samples taken. In 1994, the
number was less than 600, and in 1995 it will be less than 500 if the few nonreporting villages are
sampled at the same rate as in 1994. Two large DCSs (of the 5,100 DCSs in the Punjab) would take
this many samples in a single day. The conclusion from Table 6.10 is that in the last two years little
has been done to prevent adulteration of milk in the Punjab, and quite likely the same conclusion
applies to other states. As reported in Box 4.2, when consumers in Delhi became dissatisfied with
the quality of the milk on offer, they turned to an NGO (FRAC) rather than the Health Departnent.
An Indian reviewer has commented that this study's concern with adulteration of milk may be
misplaced:
My experience suggests that consumers generally pay for what they buy. In the Indian context,
normally each dudhiya supplies not one kind of milk but 3 or 4 kinds. The consumers are aware
which kind they are buying-namely they pay a lower price for adulterated milk, still lower for
much more adulterated milk, and a fairly high one for 'pure' milk. Also, contamination (which
arises because of dilution with impure water) is taken care of in the Indian household by simply
boiling the milk.
This relaxed view overlooks the energy cost of having to boil milk and the plight of less well-
informed consumers. Also, where there is chemical adulteration and the milk is used for
processing, there may be a low-level but widespread public health hazard, even before
identifiable symptoms occur.
64. Actual adulteration was probably even higher, since milk can be declared as "cow milk" even though it originated with
a buffalo. This results in more lenient standards forjudging milk to be adulterated.

6.50    Improved hygiene was never an explicit objective of the Bank-supported projects. It
never appeared in project conditionality, presumably because the projects confined themselves to
supporting Operation Flood where cooperative control of milk from producer to factory stage,
together with milk cooling stations and routine pasteurization of all milk, ensured high standards
of hygiene. In principle, the cooperative system has a "double-entry" accounting system for milk
solids, whereby the individual producer's milk is tested for SNF and butterfat. This allows
estimation of the total SNF and butterfat in each delivery of milk by the DCS, which is
independently checked by the MPU. Recently, the problem of artificial milk has reared its head
within the cooperative system (Box 4.2), as some transporters have replaced the milk in their
bulk tankers with artificial milk prior to delivery at the dairy. This will require much more
sophisticated testing of milk receipts by dairies than has been customary in the past.
6.51    Most noncooperative milk processors hold down costs by "out-sourcing" milk
procurement. This means that they have no direct control over milk adulteration between the
producer and the factory stage. Weak operation of public milk testing services thus affects most
adversely the quality of milk processed in the corporate sector.
Education
6.52   Education was a high priority in all villages visited. For the poorer villages, milk income
meant the difference between going to primary school and not being able to attend. For slightly
wealthier villages, it helped children stay in high school or allowed those who would have
dropped out to be able to afford to stay in school. In still wealthier villages, where school
attendance was universal, some of the earnings of the cooperative had been set aside to help the
local schools and, in one case, a local private university.
6.53    The above field observations are reinforced by the survey results reported in Table 3.9.
The survey shows that increased school attendance for girls is the second most frequently
mentioned impact of a DCS and increased school attendance for boys the third. Significantly, the



78
impact on education for girls is listed more frequently. This is confirmed by OED's recent study
in Karnataka (Sampark 1997, p. 67):
Women and Education of Children: Among the landless and marginal farners, women go for
coolie work. The main reason for girls dropping out of school is household chores along with care
of siblings. Dairying enables women to stay home and supplement their income. They shoulder
the responsibilities, thus enabling their young children (8-15 age group) to attend school.
6.54   In some families several children were in school who would not otherwise have been,
and in others children were staying in school. Unfortunately, there is no direct quantitative data
on extra school attendance. However, the likely scale of the impact can be gauged by noting that
if even one family in three had an extra child in school, with 3.5 million pouring members this
would be 1.1 million extra children. Even one family in ten having an extra child in school yields
350,000 extra children in school. Including the indirect effect of higher dairy incomes in general,
the impact is even bigger. Of course, this extra enrollment does not come free. Extra teachers and
extra school rooms have had to be provided, but given the high income elasticity of demand for
education in India, Operation Flood can be seen as a major "demand side " educational project.
Cooperative as NGO
6.55   Cooperatives are included in the Bank's definition of nongoverment organizations
(NGOs) as membership NGOs (World Bank 1995, p. 14). As we have seen, the degree of
autonomy for the MPUs and state federations is mixed. Significant progress has been made
(Table 6.11) towards organizational autonomy and the full Anand cooperative principles.
6.56   At the village level, the DCS clearly is farmer-controlled and autonomous. The project
thus supports 53,000 NGOs and is probably the largest program involving membership NGOs in
program delivery supported by the Bank.

7. Findings and Recommendations
Findings
7.1    Operation Flood can be viewed as a twenty-year experiment confirming the Rural
Development Vision (World Bank Reports 1997c). It does this in several dimensions. It
demonstrates:
* The role of agriculture in poverty reduction
* Rural development involves more than agricultural production
* The value of national "ownership" in development
* The beneficial effects of higher incomes in relieving the worst aspects of poverty
- The capacity of agriculture to create jobs
* The capacity of agriculture to benefit the poor at low cost
* The importance of a commercial approach to development
* The capacity of single-commodity projects to have multidimensional impacts
* The importance of getting government out of commercial enterprises
* The importance of market failure in agriculture
* The power and problems of participatory organizations
* The importance of policy
But it warns:
* This is not easy, and
* The Bank has difficulty in recognizing success
These facets of Operation Flood are discussed in greater detail below.
7.2   The Role ofAgriculture in Poverty Reduction. We have seen that not all of Operation
Flood's procurement represents new production; some of it represents switching from other
purchasers or uses to Operation Flood. By the same token, not all the payments made by
Operation Flood represent new income to villagers. Nevertheless, the income flows from
Operation Flood to villages are now massive. We have already seen (para. 6.34) that annual
payments by the cooperative system to farmers now average about Rs 34.5 billion (or US$1.0
billion per annum). Allowing for both cash costs of milk production (especially cattle feed) and
switching, perhaps a quarter of this, say US$250 million per annum, is net increased income.



80
Faster growth of incomes in Operation Flood villages and higher levels of milk production have
been identified in village studies (see paras. 3.6-3.765 and 5.16).
7.3     For milk production as a whole, the switching problem is irrelevant since this is, by
definition, extra production. About 10 percent of the increased production is handled by the
formal sector, and the rest is either consumed within the village or handled by the informal
sector (Table 6.9). This is extra value created regardless of how it is marketed. Since Operation
Flood only handles about 6.3 percent of production, the extra cashflow to villagers from the
higher dairy growth rate approximates about US$16 billion per year. Investment in dairy stock
and recurrent cash costs are involved in the generation of this gross revenue at the village level,
but clearly, cash flows of this magnitude can be expected to generate real poverty alleviation and
linked benefits. Studies have shown that as many as 70 percent of suppliers are from the
marginal and small farmers, together with some landless, so a large part of these benefits are
reaching the very poor.
7.4    More than Agricultural Production. As pointed out in the introduction (paras. 1.1-1.2),
Operation Flood is only incidentally a production project. Primarily, it is a marketing project. It
has also been demonstrated in Zambia (para. 1.2) that provision of a market may be enough to
stimulate production. Theorists, in illustrating the nonagricultural dimension of rural
development, are inclined to cite the value of rural road building in reducing transport costs and,
hence, opening villages to the cash economy. In fact, what Operation Flood provided was a
reliable buyer in the village. In many cases, this demonstrated need for a better road resulted in
either road construction by villagers or political agitation to get a road built by the panchayat.
This raises an interesting question (para. 7.8) as to whether development is more effectively
promoted by supply- or demand-side interventions. Is it better to build a road in the expectation
that this will attract trade or promote trade in the hope that it will result in the construction of
needed infrastructure?
7.5    National Ownership. As described earlier (paras. 1.3, 1.5, and 6.3-6.7), Operation Flood
was an Indian project long before the first Bank-supported project was approved by the Board.
Operation Flood reflected the politicalldevelopmental insight in 1964 of Lal Bahadur Shastri, a
farm boy who rose to be Prime Minister. The Bank was most constructive when it simply
assisted the program.
7.6    Higher Incomes Reduce the Worst Aspects of Poverty. Unfortunately, only anecdotal
information is available on the impact of Operation Flood on education (paras. 6.52-6.54 and
Table 3.9). However, in every one of the approximately 40 villages visited, improved education
for children was cited as among the most important impacts of higher dairy income. One of the
key reasons very poor women prefer to stay home to look after a cow, rather than go out for
wage labor (apart from it being a lot easier), is that this allows a child (usually a daughter) to go
to school rather than having to stay home to look after younger siblings. For the very poor,
education seems to be nearly as important as being able to buy enough to eat.
65. A reviewer cautions against a too facile acceptance of these sections since (i) the three-village studies show
relatively little difference between Operation Flood and non-Operation Flood villages (para. 3.17); (ii) possible
sampling error and the absence of baseline studies make the conclusions based on the Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka
village studies questionable (footnote 39); (iii) available evidence indicates that the proportion of income from
Operation Flood is modest (para. 3.12); (iv) a resurvey in 1996 of the villages in Karnataka found that defunct Flood
villages were reported to be the most developed in terms of educational and income levels, number of milk animals
owned, and milk sold (para. 5.16).



81
7.7    Health services are more of a public good than education. Parents know how much
education they are able to provide their children. With health, the issue is the availability of
service whether or not it is used by an individual respondent. Accordingly, the health impacts of
improved prosperity were less salient than the educational impact. However, a recurrent theme in
DCSs visited was that they had used profits from the DCS to support some improvement in the
health services available to the village.
7.8    This finding poses a major question: Are the "worst symptoms of poverty" best reduced
by the provision of "supply-driven," single-purpose health, education, and nutrition projects or
by "demand-driven," income-generating projects? The new growth economics would assure us
that both demand and supply have their own separate effects (and that there is an interaction
term) in determining both the level of education, health, and nutrition enjoyed and the further
growth in incomes. However, this generalized advice is not very helpful without quantification.
It is probably a fair- comment that neither OED nor development researchers, more generally, nor
indeed hardheaded field workers66 engaged in implementing projects are in a position to quantify
these effects.
7.9    Capacity ofAgriculture to Create Jobs. Much of the milk collected by Operation Flood
would otherwise have been processed in the village, but some comes from one or more
additional cows being kept by farmers (or, more accurately, their wives) or as a result of better
husbandry. However, a proportion of the extra production came from women who were enabled
to stay home to look after a newly purchased cow and thus avoid the necessity to go out for
work. Each such change opened up a job for someone else needing work. If even 5 percent of
producers made this switch (unfortunately, we lack data to properly quantify this point), this
would represent the creation of 175,000 jobs.
7.10   Benefiting the Poor at Low Cost. Taking the NDDB estimate of 6.3 million direct
beneficiaries and all-up identifiable costs of Operation Flood (Annex B), Table 6.5 and Table 6.6
show that cost per beneficiary over the life of the project was from US$306 (1996 dollars) to
US$433. If, however, beneficiaries were taken to include the families of these pourers, the
number would be about 32 million.
7.11   Some of the benefits were undoubtedly enjoyed by larger farmers (still in most cases
poor by any absolute standard), but there is strong evidence that the majority of beneficiaries
were small and marginal farmers and were from "other backward castes."67 Since the Bank does
not routinely calculate the unit costs of reaching the poor, it is not possible to say whether the
above costs are low in any comparative sense.
7.12   A Commercial Approach. Operation Flood has had a remarkably hardheaded and
commercial attitude to the supplying DCSs. If a DCS cannot supply sufficient milk to cover the
variable costs of collection, then after appropriate discussion, the MPU withdraws its collection
service. Of 72,700 DCSs formed, MPUs were collecting from only 55,000 in June 1996. This is a
very substantial attrition, driven by commercial realities. NDDB has also been active in
66. Those Keynes so unkindly described as "the slaves of long dead philosophers."
67. In all DCS villages, marginal farmers make up the largest group of the pourers followed by small farmers.
Marginal and small farmers together constitute more than 70 percent of total pourers, and there is a gradual increase in
the representation of these groups (Sampark 1997). Fulton and Bhargava (1994) estimate that 60 percent of members
are landless or marginal farmers (para. 7.14).



82
supplying managerial staff, if requested, to MPUs that are in financial difficulties. Three of 173
MPUs have been closed or merged with other MPUs when it became evident that they were not
independently financially sustainable.
7.13   Multidimensional Impacts. The multidimensional impact of this single-commodity
project has been illustrated above. These effects include, education, employment, income, and
contributions to village-level social amenities. Thus, although a project may be quite narrow in
its interventions, it may still have a wide range of impacts.
7.14   Getting Government Out of Commerce. Operation Flood had two major thrusts. The first
was to expand the geographical range of villages from which milk could be collected and
processed. The second was to provide these services in the context of Anand-pattern
cooperatives. As shown in Table 6.10, considerable progress has been made in this regard. Those
states which have not yet adopted the Anand pattern have Cooperative Federations with the most
severe financial problems.
7.15   Market Failure. As discussed above (para. 1.21), the dairy industry is particularly
vulnerable to market failure which in part explains the prevalence of cooperatives in the dairy
68
industry worldwide. By maximizing the return to producers rather than the suppliers of capital,
cooperatives avoid the tendency to market failure in dairy processing.
7.16   Participatory Organizations. The DCSs are farmer-controlled, village-level
organizations. By and large they have functioned well. However, as mentioned in para. 4.4, there
have been problems or organizational breakdown based upon caste rivalries within the village,
reflecting state-level political conflicts, malfeasance by DCS secretaries (often in apparent
complicity with the board of the DCS), and simple incompetence of the secretary. NDDB has
supported an aggressive program of Cooperative Development (para. 4.6) designed to inform
members of their rights and responsibilities, to instill a sense of pride and "privilege to serve" in
DCS board members, and to train secretaries and milk-testers. The observation that villagers
have a great capacity to organize themselves does not mean they do not need any help with this
activity.
7.17   It is significant that most villages prefer to select, rather than elect, their board members.
Obviously, this leaves room for power to be seized by the village elite. However, it also reflects
a desire to avoid the divisive effect in the village of electoral campaigns and a desire to avoid the
cost of an election. The process of selection (consensus among DCS members) does not mean
that less thought has gone into who will be the board members than would occur with a
multicandidate election.
7.18   The Importance of Policy. The study has focused on Operation Flood; however,
Operation Flood has grown fast but not significantly faster than the dairy industry as a whole.
The magic of Lal Bahadur Shastri's decision to endorse Operation Flood was that this same
policy protected the whole dairy industry from dumped imports of dairy products and arrested
the proliferation of government schemes designed to develop the industry (paras. 6.3-6.7).
68. Even where there is no technical basis for market failure, monopoly marketing organizations are an almost
ubiquitous developmental tool with very adverse effects on small farmers and agricultural development generally
(Bauer and Paish 1952).



83
Figure 7.1 illustrates the quite modest share of increased dairy production which was procured
by Operation Flood.
7.19   This is Not Easy. Four characteristics of Operation Flood mentioned above warn of some
difficulties in going from Vision to Action (let alone Results). The first is that NDDB is a
financially independent parastatal. Second, this was an indigenous program enjoying top-level
political support before the Bank ever indicated its interest. Third, Operation Flood has been
very economical in the use of foreign technical assistance, and fourth, this is a project which has
been steadily supported for over two decades.
7.20   Financial independence, together with an assertive and talented leadership, meant that
NDDB could operate on a wide canvas more decisively and independently than normal
parastatals. This is not a combination which can easily be found in the public sector (nor indeed
among NGOs which are predominantly small-scale operations).
7.21   Such projects require identification by donors of indigenous initiatives which are
producing results, albeit perhaps on a small scale. It argues also for being very careful not to
"drown" such local initiative in either excessive resources or excessive technical assistance and
for being willing to patiently "grow the project" over a significant time span. It may also argue
for more encouragement of south-south transfers of technology and managerial practices.
7.22   Recognition of Success. One of the most curious features of the present impact study is
the extent to which the above findings seem to run counter to current views in the Bank. Thus, in
recommending against a further extension of the final project, an internal memo said "the key
argument [for no extension beyond December 1995] is the project design is not consistent with
GOI [government of India] and Bank strategy of leveling the playing field for agroindustrial
development between cooperatives and the private entrepreneurs, thus putting the project at odds
with the recommendations of our macroeconomic work as well as the recent livestock sector
review" (World Bank Reports 1997, Box 3.2).69
7.23   In part, the Bank's new paradigm, enunciated in the livestock sector review, was based
on the observation of the restrictions imposed by the MMPO which had been introduced to
compensate for NEP's repeal of the Industry Licensing Act. It seems to have been assumed that
repeal of MMPO would immediately transfer the Indian dairy industry into a "first-best world"
of private investment, easy entry, and competition. The use of private resources was expected to
guarantee against overinvestment, and easy entry and competition were expected to guarantee
that monopoly positions would be quickly eroded. The present study, on the other hand,
interprets the MMPO as an attempt to escape a third-best world of heavy state subsidies to the
private (but not cooperative) sector for new processing investments and a moribund public
testing and inspection system for milk quality and hygienic operating conditions which does not
protect milk quality in the corporate sector (paras. 6.49-6.51).
7.24   The overestimation of project cost and particularly the central government's contribution
of its own resources (Annex B, Tables B3 and B 15) seems to have confirmed the view that
69. In fact, no sooner had the Bank conveyed to the government the decision not to extend the project than the
Secretary of the Treasury wrote assuring the Bank that project extension was highly consistent with the government of
India's strategy for development of the dairy industry.

Operation Flood was primarily a public sector activity and an extremely expensive one at that.
Thus the livestock sector review says
An analysis of the 1992-93 expenditures indicates that:
* Activities which could be taken over by the private sector, such as poultry
development, cattle breeding and dairying (especially Operation Flood), receive
about 60 percent of total agriculture funds. Funding of such activities should be
phased out (para. 6.10).
Operation Flood is quoted as having actual government of India expenditures of Rs 805 million
in 1992-93 (51 percent of total expenditures on Animal Husbandry and Dairying). This agrees
exactly with budget estimate figure for 1992-93 given in Annual Plan 1993-94 for the
Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (page 28). The Annual Plan document also
gives the projected source of these expenditures (Table 7.1).
Table 7.1: Projected Source of Expenditures for Operation Flood m, 1992-93 (Rs million)

Source: Annual Plan 1993-94, Statement 11.2.
7.25   Since the loan to NDDB represents on-lending from the Bank, and the EEC assistance is
a grant, there is at most 20 (about US$750,000 at the official exchange rate) of the Rs 805
million which is a direct charge on Indian resources.71
7.26 As has been brought out earlier, this study concludes that even though Operation Flood
is apparently an "old-style" project dedicated to improving the marketing channels for a single
commodity through the nexus of increased incomes, the projects have had a big impact on
employment; support of membership NGOs; increased leadership opportunities for women;
education, nutrition, and poverty reduction, sometimes in excess of newer-style projects
dedicated to just one of these objectives. The study concludes that the impact of the Bank's dairy
assistance to India has been large and positive. Operations felt, even after an extensive review of
the livestock sector in India, that the project was at odds with Bank strategy. It is unusual for an
OED report to feel that the Bank has an unrecognized success story.
Recommendations
7.27   The Bank's livestock sector review concluded that Bank policy should be to "level the
playing field" between the cooperative and companies72 by (i) eliminating all state intervention
in cooperatives, (ii) repealing the MMPO, (iii) establishing a mechanism to monitor the milk
70. Real Expenditure is given as Rs 850 million.
71. Annex B, Table B15 estimates total central government resources over the period 1971-72 to 1996-97 as US$33
million, in 1996 dollars, or Rs 1.15 billion.
72. World Bank Reports 1996, para. 4.52.



86
market to ensure fair competition, and (iv) strengthening public monitoring and enforcement of
hygiene standards. This omits reference to the need to remove tax concessions and other
incentives provided to private investors.
7.28   Both "ensuring fair competition" and "enforcing hygiene standards" are easier said than
done. Effective mechanisms for achieving these desirable objectives would very largely remove
the need for the MMPO. As argued earlier (paras. 1.19-1.20), private companies and full Anand-
pattern cooperatives can be expected to behave quite differently in a monopsony situation, with
cooperatives treating farmers (their owners) more generously than would private companies.
Thus, cooperatives should be treated no worse than private companies.
7.29   The problem of ineffective enforcement of hygiene standards has already been discussed
(para. 6.49 and Boxes 4.1 and 4.2). The legislative and administrative basis for enforcing
hygiene standards is already in place. The problem is the political and bureaucratic will to
enforce the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act of 1954. Pending proper enforcement of the act,
retention of the MMPO provides another avenue for enforcement of hygiene standards.
7.30   Similarly, pending removal of incentives for dairy plant investment by companies, the
retention of the MMPO provides some protection against the waste of public resources from the
overexpansion of processing capacity by the private sector (utilizing large amounts of public
direct investment and tax concessions).
7.31   The policy recommendations that follow from the analysis in this impact study differ
slightly in content, and certainly in sequencing, from current Bank proposals:
(i)  Elimination of all state intervention in Operation Flood cooperatives. Where this
involves the transfer of state-owned assets to the cooperatives, the cooperatives
could issue bonds to the state to be retired over a suitable time period.
(ii) Elimination of all government incentives for investment in the dairy industry. In
the absence of such a change, and as a distinct second best solution, any incentives
should be equally applicable to cooperative or corporate investments.
(iii) A renewed effort to enforce the provisions of the Prevention of Food Adulteration
Act of 1954. This would include inspection and approval of quality control/milk
testing procedures of processors, inspection of processing facilities, and testing
dudhiya milk supplies for adulteration. This would require increased state
expenditures. However, the sums involved are dwarfed by the savings which
would follow from the withdrawal of government incentives (Box 6.1). The
livestock sector review has suggested that states could experiment with paying
private sector organizations to carry out the inspection and enforcement function.
7.32   Pending successful implementation of the above three conditions, repeal of the MMPO
would be premature. This is an issue of sequencing of reforms. The MMPO provides a weak
bulwark against overinvestment, substandard equipment, and unhygienic operating conditions.
7.33   Continued support for the Indian dairy industry can be justified by the intention to bring
about the policies recommended in para. 7.31 and perhaps afterward, depending on whether a tilt
towards the cooperatives is felt to be appropriate.



87
7.34   At the very least, there should be no further lending to the dairy sector in states which
have not yet adopted the full Anand-pattern for Operation Flood cooperatives or do not treat
these cooperatives equally with private corporations.73 Implementation should be required, ex
ante, since NDP and NDPII have shown that formal adoption of the Anand principles is not
necessarily followed by their implementation.
Lessons
7.35   As has been hinted at earlier, the very success of the expansion of the Indian dairy
industry poses in a stark fashion the question of attribution. To what extent was this a reaction to
increased demand, itself a function of rising incomes and population increase? To what extent
can it be attributed to technology, such as increased straw from the Green Revolution and the
adoption of crossbred cattle? What part did the removal of the risk of price declines based on
massive imports of milk products affect the willingness of farmers and private processors to
invest? What part was played by Operation Flood's demonstration to other investors of the
potential viability of well-organized and modem processing of milk collected from a large
number of small producers? What role did individual and prescient personalities play? (Neither
the visit of the prime minister of India nor visit of the president of the Bank was an entirely
unorchestrated event.)
7.36   Despite these attribution problems, a first lesson stands out:
Lesson 1: A well conceived investment project in support of an already adopted
and appropriate policy change can be associated with results out of all proportion to the
investment involved. This occurs in part because it solves the "ownership" problem, in
part because it avoids having to create an institution at the same time that the new
institution is being expected to implement the project, and in part perhaps for a number
of reasons not yet well understood.
This lesson intentionally finesses the exact extent of causation involved.
7.37   A second lesson concerns the multidimensional impact of the project:
Lesson 2: By raising incomes, an apparently simple single-commodity project
can have multiple beneficial effects, including nutrition, education (especially of girls),
and job-creation.
This poses a question as to the relative efficiency of production projects that aim to reduce
poverty directly, as compared to health, nutrition, and education projects designed to remove
poverty indirectly or area development projects designed to intervene in many ways
simultaneously.
7.38   Though not explicitly a "targeted" project, yet 60 percent of the beneficiaries were
marginal or small farmers and landless.
Lesson 3: By focusing a project on a predominant activity of the poor, "self-
selection" is likely to result in a major portion of the beneficiaries being poor.
This provides an alternative to "targeted" projects for reaching the poor.
73. This requirement should also be incorporated in the up-front conditionality of statewide adjustment lending.

Estimation of Economic Impact
1.    As shown in Table Al, the nominal value of Bank assistance to Operation Flood under
the five projects was US$500 million. When this is compounded at 10 percent, it becomes the
equivalent of US$1.9 billion in 1996 dollars.
2.    The increased milk production attributable to the faster growth of the Indian dairy
industry from 1975 to 1996 is shown in Table A2. This table also shows the total compounded to
1996 at a 10 percent rate of interest.
3.    A million metric tons of milk requires about 85,000 tons of skim milk powder (SMP)
and 50,000 tons of ghee (butter-oil), or 60,000 tons of butter. In 1996 world prices were about
US$2,195 per metric ton for SMP and about US$2,525 per metric ton for ghee. Thus, the cost
would be US$310 per ton of milk for raw materials alone. For 1,086 million tons of milk, raw
materials would cost US$336.7 billion, indicating that the Bank's assistance to Operation Flood
would have had to account only for 0.56 percent of the observed increase in production to break
even at a 10 percent rate of interest. (And this takes no account of benefits likely to be
experienced after 1996.)
4.    Support for Operation Flood was also provided by the World Food Program, European
Community, and the government of India. Allowing for the Bank's contribution of at least 20
percent of the total, all contributions would need to account for around 3 percent of the observed
increase in milk production to have an economic rate of return (ERR) of 10 percent. Capitalizing
the current annual increment of 40 million metric tons (that is, assuming growth reverted to the
pre-Operation Flood rate) would add 43 percent to benefits, or allow only 2.1 percent of these
augmented benefits, for the investment to yield an ERR of 10 percent.

Earlier Estimates
1.    Estimation of the cost of Operation Flood is not easy. The first expenditures on
Operation Flood that the impact has identified (food aid in 1971) occurred over 25 years ago,
three years prior to the first Bank project (approved in 1974). Before 1976-77 Operation Flood
expenditures were not identified as a line item in the budget documents, and indeed it appears
that in this early period food aid may have gone directly to IDC, thus bypassing the
government's consolidated revenue and expenditure accounts (para. 15). There have been
significant changes over these twenty-five years in the presentation of budget data by the
Ministry of Finance. This annex lays out the impact's estimates in some detail, both because
others may wish to refine or correct these estimates and because the revised estimates are
radically lower than the Bank's Livestock Sector Review (World Bank Reports 1996).2 Before
1976-77, payments to IDC and NDDB were not shown as line items in the budget, and it was not
until 1979-80 that expenditures on Operation Flood were separated from other payments to IDC
and NDDB. For purposes of this exercise we have treated all payments to IDC and NDDB as
Operation Flood expenditures. This inflates slightly the estimated cost of the operation, but
avoids arbitrary inference.
2.    The estimates in the Review provide a good starting point, since they identify the major
cost elements, and refinements of these estimates can then be made step-by-step. Estimates of
the value of food aid received by NDDB are presented in Table B 1. The Review's estimate of
Government Spending and World Bank Loans for the Dairy Sector are given in Table B2. These
estimates are then consolidated in Table B3 to give the estimated cost of Operation Flood both in
1990 dollars (US$4.26 billion) as originally reported and in 1996 dollars (US$5.06 billion) for
comparison with other estimates.
2. Hereafter, the Review.



Annex B                                 105
Deflation
3.     The first adjustment is in the deflator used to go from "current" to "real" dollars.
Columns 2-5 of Table B4 have the same headings as Table B 1, but they give the value of food
aid received in current dollars (i.e., the cost of the food aid in the year it was received). Column 6
of Table B4 then gives total current dollar value of food aid received year-by-year. Column 7
gives the Indian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator (with 1990 = 100). This measures the
rate of inflation in India. The deflator of 20.5 for 1971 means that it is estimated that to buy as
much skim milk powder in 1990 as was bought for US$3.74 million in 1971 would require
(3.74*100)/20.50 = US$18.23 million in 1990. These are the mechanics of using the Indian GDP
deflator, and it can be readily checked that the total value of food aid reported in Column 6 of
Table B 1 is highly correlated with the estimates derived in Column 8 of Table B4.
4.    Next is the question of which deflator to use to relate dollar values year-by-year to dollar
values in 1990. Movements in dollar prices are measured by the US GDP deflator, or for the
dollar price of internationally traded goods, by the Manufactured Goods Unit Value Index
(MUV). If we want to know how many dollars we need in 1990 to buy as much skim milk
powder as a given number of dollars in 1971, we need to use a deflator of changes in dollar
prices. Column 9 of Table B4 gives the MUV deflator (1990 = 100), and Column 10 gives the
real (1990 dollar) value of food aid using the MUV deflator. The total value of food aid,
expressed in US 1990 dollars, drops from $1.145 billion to $0.89 billion.
5.    The same problem occurred with respect to the value of Bank projects. Column 3 of
Table B2 gives the value of the projects deflated by the Indian GDP (i.e., as reported in the
Review), and Column 4 gives the values in 1990 dollars as recalculated using the MUV index.
Using the latter index results in the total value of Bank assistance in 1990 dollars being reduced
from $1.13 billion to $0.85 billion. Table B2 also gives those costs in 1996 dollars.
Timing
6.    A second problem focuses on the timing of disbursements to Operation Flood. In Table
B2, the Review has assumed that the plan amounts were disbursed in the mid-year of the plan
and similarly that Bank assistance was assumed to be disbursed in the year of approval, as
different from the actual disbursement profile over the life of the project. Table B5 reproduces
Table B2, with the differences that (i) plan amounts are assumed to be disbursed evenly over the
life of the plan (a very minor change), and (ii) the actual disbursement profile is used for Bank
projects, and the MUV index is used to get constant dollars. This table also reflects that some
amounts of Bank assistance were canceled and never disbursed. With these two changes, the
estimate of plan expenditures drops from $1.72 billion3 (Table B2) to $1.58 billion (Table B5),
both in 1996 dollars, and the value of Bank loans from $1.34 billion4 to $0.69 billion.
3. US$1.46 billion in 1990 dollars (Table B2, Column 3) converts to US$1.72 billion in 1996 dollars using the MUV
deflator.
4. US$1.134 billion in 1990 dollars (Table B2, Column 3) converts to US$1.34 billion in 1996 dollars using the MUV.

Double Counting
7.    Table B3 reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the Indian planning and budgeting
process. In India, as in most other countries, Government planning and budgeting are based on
consolidated revenues and expenditures. Consolidated revenue reflects total receipts whether
from taxation, parastatal earnings, or foreign grants and loans. Government expenditures are then
consolidated expenditures whether financed from domestic or foreign resources. Thus, food aid
and Bank assistance are already included in Government expenditures (see, however, para. 15
for the probability that prior to 1976 food aid bypassed this standard budgetary process).
Moreover, the government grant listed in Table B3 is derived not from the government accounts,
but rather from a side calculation that all Bank loans are supported by a 30 percent grant from
government: "Since the loans ($1.13 billion) cover only 70 percent of program costs, the NDDB
received an additional grant from the government of about $480 million" (the Review, para.
4.32). While there was some contribution of domestic resources to the earlier projects, the bulk
of the additional funding came from food aid and NDDB's own retained resources. Since there is
no clear basis for the estimated grant (nor evidence of it as a separate item in the consolidated
expenditures), it is dropped from Table B6.
8.    The total loans and subsidies (US$1.58 billion) in Table B6 is derived from the estimate
of Total Government of India Dairy Expenditures in Table B5. The changes in Table B6 are the
result of eliminating double counting. The negative entry for NDDB's contribution in Table B6
may appear counterintuitive at first glance; and indeed, given the rather tenuous data underlying
these calculations, it could be due to rounding. However, there is no inherent reason why the
combination of disbursements by the Bank and the value of food aid grants should not exceed the
value of government-budgeted expenditures. What this means in real terms depends on where the
negative is "captured." It might be a residual in consolidated revenue, but is more likely to have
been passed on to NDDB as food aid which NDDB sold, retaining the excess as undisbursed EC
funds to be utilized for special program approved by the EC. In fact, NDDB's equity in 1995 was
about US$553 million (1996 dollars). Some of this represents gains on other activities, but a part
of it may be profits made on food aid and not yet disbursed for the benefit of the dairy industry.
There is thus some evidence that it is likely that the sum of Bank loans and food aid grants
exceeded the cost of the project, since it has not only financed the project, but also resulted in a
significant build-up in the equity of NDDB. These initial corrections drop the estimated cost of
Operation Flood from US$5.06 billion (1996 dollars) in the Review to US$1.58 billion in Table
B6. Some further refinements lead to an "all in" estimate of almost US$3 billion.
9.    Table B6 still includes an element of overestimation of costs since the government's
dairy expenditures include not only expenditures on Operation Flood, but also expenditures on
the rest of the industry (see para. 19 below). (There is also some question as to how food aid was
valued for budgetary purposes, which affects the estimate of government expenditures.)
Under Counting
10.   In addition to the upward bias in the Bank estimates discussed above, there are also
elements of undercounting. Table B I shows that from 1971-79 the value of butter-oil is
described as "not available," and the total value of food aid does not include butter-oil. When
butter-oil in the earlier years is valued at the average real cost for the years when a price is
available (US$2,513 per metric ton, 1990 dollars), this adds US$90 million (1996 dollars) to the
value of food aid.

Omitted Costs
11.   As appraised, the state governments were expected to make substantial contributions to
the three state projects, and the central government was to contribute significantly to all projects
except NDPII. The projected contributions in nominal dollars (rupees for NDP) taken from the
SARs are given in Table B7.
12.   Actual project costs, as reported in the PCRs and ICR, deviated substantially from
projected financing, as shown in Table B8. Bank contribution is somewhat understated in the
PCRs for the first four projects due to using the exchange rate for the first project year. The
Revised World Bank contribution uses the exchange rate appropriate to the year of disbursement.
13.   There was no mention of the use of food aid to fund the first three projects. However,
Table B9 shows that food aid received over the period of the state projects (Rs 4.19 billion)
greatly exceeds the total cost of the three state projects (Rs 1.09 billion). An examination of
central government revenue accounts shows that from 1976 food aid was included in
consolidated revenue so that the government contribution recorded in consolidated expenditure
could easily have been financed from food aid. The same cannot be said of state government
expenditures and contributions from banks and farmers, which presumably represent additional
resources not included in the estimates provided in the Review. Since significant inflation
characterized the period of implementation of the three state projects, Table B9 has been restated
in constant 1994 rupees in Table B1O. Since we are working here in rupees, the Indian GDP
deflator is the appropriate deflator. Unfortunately, it is not available after 1994. Column 2 of
Table B 10 is the nominal rupees (given in Table B9) deflated by the Indian GDP deflator to give
real 1994 rupees. Column 3 then converted this to 1994 dollars at the official exchange rate of
1:31.37. Column 4 is similar to Column 3, but the rupee expenditures were distributed in
accordance with project disbursement profiles and then converted to dollars, year-by-year, at the
official exchange rate and deflated by the MUV to give real 1994 dollars. The striking difference
between Columns 3 and 4 indicated the extent of real devaluation of the rupee which has taken
place over this period. Column 5 has been obtained from Column 4 by using the MUV deflator
to give values in 1996 dollars to be comparable with most other estimates. The higher estimate
has been used (i) to be consistent with other rupee:dollar conversions and (ii) to avoid the
appearance that the impact might be trying to minimize its estimate of the cost of Operation
Flood. To see these costs in perspective, Table B7 (SAR estimates) and Table B8 (PCR/ICR
actuals) have been recalculated in constant 1996 dollars as Table B 11 and Table B 12,
respectively. Farmer and commercial bank contributions totaled $7 million, less than 1 percent
of total actual expenditure.5
Data Correction
14.   Table B 13 gives the physical quantities and prices of food aid received by NDDB. This
table is copied from Annex Table 4.3 of the Review (itself based on information provided by the
staff of NDDB) and was used in the construction of Table 4.1 in the Review. For the impact
study, NDDB has clarified and corrected some of this data. NDDB explained that the data refers
to financial (April-March) years rather than calendar years. IP addition, they note that whole
milk powder was never received from either the World Food Program (WFP) or the European
5. Note that estimated actual expenditure on the three state projects in Table B12 in 1996 US dollars is US$211.3 as
compared to US$211.5 shown in the last column of Table B1O.

Community (EC). Quantities of whole milk powder reported for the years 1986 and 1987 were
actually for skimmed milk powder (SMP). NDDB further notes that 3,000 metric tons of SMP
was received during 1993-94. No food aid or cash assistance from EC was received after 1993-
94. They point out that the volume of butter-oil received in 1975 was 8,210 metric tons instead
of 3,210 metric tons. Moreover, no butter-oil was received after 1988. Table B14 reproduces
Table B13, with the exception that the above corrections have been made together with the
corrections suggested in para. 10 above.
Approximations
15.   The Review estimate used all dairy expenditures under the fifth, sixth, and seventh
plans. In fact, Operation Flood also received funding under the fourth and eighth plans and the
two annual plans for 1978-79 and 1979-80. The first year when transfers to NDDBIIDC appear
as a line item in the budget is 1976-77; in earlier years Operation Flood expenditures were
included with all other dairy expenditures. All other dairy expenditures in the period 1971-1975
comes to Rs 26 million; the value of food aid over this period was Rs 463 million (US$184
million, 1996 dollars). What appears to have happened over this period is that food aid bypassed
the standard budget process being delivered directly to IDC. When Operation Flood expenditures
are separated from the annual budgets, it appears that total government assistance to Operation
Flood (including revenues contributed from food aid and Bank loans) was about US$1.87 billion
(1996 dollars).6 This is in general agreement with the US$1.58 billion estimated (using the MIUV
deflator and correcting for year of disbursemeitt) by the Review, using expenditures for the dairy
industry as a whole but from only three plans.
Mssing Data
16.   Table B8 and Table B12 give the total cost of the five Bank-funded projects. Two types
of contributions to Operation Flood are missing from these tables and from the Review. The first
is contributions in kind (such as processing plants transferred to cooperative entities, sometimes
accompanied by debts) and facilities made available to the cooperatives at no charge or for a
peppercorn rent. The second set of missing data referred to is payments made by state
governments to federations or MPUs for losses incurred. Unfortunately, it has not proved
possible to generate reliable estimates of the magnitude of either of these costs.
17.   A hint as to the possible value of transfers of state plants to state federations and MPUs
is provided by the PCR of NDP which presents a budget for the profitability of a representative
MPU. This budget provides for the transfer of a government plant to the MPU in the first year
(1979) (PCR, Table 18.2). The plant is valued at Rs 24 million. This is specified as the book
value of the plant. At the 1979 market exchange rate, this would have been US$2.6 million;
corrected to 1996 dollars, this would be US$4.7 million. As a very general order of magnitude, if
this had applied to all 170 MPUs, this contribution could have been valued at as much as US$0.8
billion in 1996 dollars. Actual value could have exceeded book value, but only selected MPUs
will have had plants transferred to them (sometimes with debts attached).7 These are very rough
figures, but may serve to help put external assistance into perspective.
6. US$184 million as food aid prior to 1976 plus budget totals US$1.69 billion from 1973-74 on.
7. There is also the question of the value to attach to a loss-making operation.



Annex B                                     109
18.    With respect to the second set of costs, not only is the data missing, but even if it were
present, there would be a problem of its correct interpretation. If a fully independent MPU loses
money and then goes to the state to make up the loss, there is no doubt that that is a subsidy to
the MPU. If the state directs the MPU to sell its milk below its break-even price, making up the
loss is a reimbursement to the MPU and a subsidy to consumers. As mentioned in the main text,
government interference in the cooperative sector takes many forms, including appointment of
key staff, insistence on overstaffing, and price setting. This interference is not ubiquitous and
varies greatly from state to state. In the event, it has not been possible to generate data on state
transfers, and hence, it has not been necessary to attempt to partition these transfers into
subsidies and reimbursement for services provided. Had the states not been willing to make these
subventions, then either the affected MPUs would have had to close, or the states would have
had to allow them to set break-even prices and reduce costs by laying off staff and closing
unprofitable milk routes.
Cost of General Support
19.    In addition to the above costs which apply directly to Operation Flood, governments also
provided support to the dairy industry generally, particularly with respect to animal health and
Al, but also including research, extension, regulatory and inspection services, and policy
development and implementation. It has not been possible to derive the state expenditures for
this purpose (this too is missing data), but the value of central government assistance to the dairy
industry over the period 1971-72 to 1996-97, expressed in 1996 dollars, is US$1.69 billion'
(adding in food aid of US$184 million prior to 1976-77, we get US$1.87 billion). This estimate
is obtained from the respective budget documents, converted at the official exchange rate, and
8. This is the sum, in 1996 US dollars, of all budgeted amounts under consolidated revenues and expenditures. As
discussed in para. 15, as much as US$184 million of food aid may also have gone directly to IDC. Under later
accounting conventions, this too would have been reflected in the consolidated accounts.



I10                              Annex B
deflated by the MUV index. These central government expenditures can by analyzed as follows
(in 1996 US$ billion):
Total Assistance to Dairy Industry                  1.69
of which was Paid to NDDB/IDC                   1.44
of which was Ear-marked for Operation Flood  1.26
20.   Central government assistance to the dairy industry, net of direct assistance to
NDDB/IDC, was thus about US$250 million (1996 dollars) over the period 1971-72 to 1996-97.
This assistance would have been directed to the dairy industry countrywide, regardless of
whether Operation Flood was active in the area being served.
Impact Estimate 1996
21.   All of the above corrections lead to revised estimates in terms of 1996 dollars as shown
in Table B 15. Note that the difference in the total cost estimates (both in 1996 dollars) between
Table B12 (US$1.29 billion) and Table B15 (US$2.73 billion) is that the former refers to Bank
projects (and thus excludes the first phase of Operation Flood), while Table B 15 refers to
Operation Flood as a whole and includes allowance for US$0.8 billion of state government
assistance not included in the estimated Bank-project financing. Total Loans and Subsidies
comes from the consolidated expenditure budgets of the central government (US$1.69 billion),
plus food aid delivered directly to IDC (US$0.184 billion), plus state government expenditures
(reported in the PCRs) of US$0.054 billion, plus inferred value of transferred plants US$0.799
billion, plus contributions from commercial banks US$6 million and from farmers US$1 million,
to give US$2.733 billion. To this can be added US$0.25 billion of central government
expenditures on the dairy industry not channeled to NDDB/IDC, to give total government
assistance to the dairy industry of US$2.983 billion. If we subtract Bank Loans and Credits
(US$0.694 billion) from Total Loans and Subsidies (US$2.733 billion), we get Total Direct
Subsidies (US$2.039 billion). Subtracting food aid and identified state government assistance (in
cash and kind) and commercial bank and farmer contributions, we get a central government
contribution of 2.039 - 0.184 - 0.962 - 0.799 - 0.054 - 0.006 - 0.001 = 0.033. This matches
almost exactly with the US$0.03 billion reported by the PCRs as a further net central government
expenditure (i.e., not financed from food aid).
Number of Beneficiaries
22.   At project closing (March 1996), there were 9.3 million members of DCSs. Some 72,744
DCSs had been organized, and 55,042 were functional (Table 4.1). NDDB has provided the
estimates (Table B16) of direct beneficiaries (i.e., those who supply milk to a DCS at some time
during the year) of Operation Flood in 1996.9
23.   It is important to note that small producers with only one animal are only able to supply
milk for about six months per year, and even with two cows there will be significant dry periods
when neither animal is in milk. This means that there is a major difference between the number
of people pouring in any given day and the number who pour at some time during the year. It is
this latter number which is used as an estimate of beneficiaries.
9. The number of people who have benefited from Operation Flood at some point in time would, of course, be larger.



Annex B                                      111
24.    Note also that Table B 16 provides both estimated and actual pourers. Actual pourers
refers to data collected in December 1996. Since December is in the flush and estimated pourers
exceed actual pourers, it is likely that some of the estimated corrections are slightly conservative.
Cost per Beneficiary
25.    The necessary data has now been assembled to calculate cost per beneficiary. This is a
simple calculation; all that is required is to decide who will be counted as a beneficiary and
which cost estimate to use. Table B 17 presents per beneficiary costs on the basis of members
who pour at some time of year (6.3 million) or pourers in December 1996 (3.5 million). Three
costs are used: total assistance to the industry, assistance to Operation Flood,10 and assistance to
Operation Flood less value of imputed plant transfers.
10. As discussed in para. 19, central government funds paid to NDDB/IDC included about US$180 million (1996
dollars) not earmarked for Operation Flood. The high total payments to NDDB/IDC figure has been used as central
government assistance to Operation Flood.

Annex C                                129
Estimation of Producer and Consumer Surplus
1.    The following estimates are offered principally for illustrative purposes. However, they
do give general orders of magnitude of producer and consumer surplus in 1996 arising from
Operation Flood and associated policy changes on the basis of one interpretation of the data. No
pretense is made that this interpretation is unique or even best. The most that is claimed is that it
is clear.
2.    In Figure 1, Point A represents the quantity of milk produced in 1995 (66.3 million tons)
and an average urban wholesale price of Rs 8 per liter. The 1995 constant elasticity demand
curve DD' passes through this point with an elasticity of -1.077 (Dairy India 1997, p. 59). Point
B represents the quantity of milk (25 million tons, Figure 6.2) which would have been produced
in 1995 had the prepolicy change trend continued and the price (Rs 7.13 per liter) at which
reconstituted milk, based on imported ingredients, could have been sold. (No endogenous long-
term supply function is assumed for either the with or without policy change situation, although,
obviously, when these are estimated, they could be inserted without substantial effect on the
analysis.) One estimate of the total value of the supply shift associated with the policy change is
the dotted area BA'q2ql. Numerically, this is Rs 289.9 billion and corresponds to "without
project" scenario that milk consumption would have been kept at the "with project" level by
importation of the required ingredients. (The double shaded area BB'AA' represents a
government tax forgone of Rs 35.3 billion in this "without project" scenario.)
3.    Points A and B' in Figure 2 correspond to Figure 1, as does the demand curve DD'. Point
C represents the price (Rs 19.4 per liter) which would have occurred on the assumption of a
perfectly inelastic short-run supply curve and no importation. The shaded area (corresponding to
Rs 435 billion) is the consumer surplus of the policy change under the "perfectly inelastic short-
run supply curve" assumption.
4.    Figure 3 assumes a unit elasticity supply function. SI' is the supply function without
Operation Flood, and S2' is the supply function with Operation Flood and associated policy
changes. In both cases, we assume self-sufficiency. The quantity Q- is obtained on the basis of
the pre-Flood growth rate, and quantity Q+ is the observed production in 1995. Point E is the
equilibrium without Operation Flood, and Point A (corresponding also to A in Figure 2) is the
equilibrium with Operation Flood. The gain in consumer surplus as a result of going to Operation
Flood is the dotted area (about Rs 269 billion). The producer surplus in the without case is Rs
243 billion and is Rs 260 in the with case. There is, thus, a slight gain in producer surplus (Rs
260 - 243 = 17 billion) in going from the without to with Operation Flood cases. These results
are summarized in Table C1.

Estimation of the Impact of Free Trade in Dairy Products
1.    This annex considers the impact of a partial exemption from the Indian policy of self-
reliance. The exemption covers only urban milk consumption, which is thought to be
approximately 30 percent of total milk production.
2.    Figure I presents data from 1977-78. The left axis gives urban retail milk prices in
1977-78 rupees, and the right axis gives the same prices in constant 1993-94 rupees. Point A is
the observed national production and urban retail milk price. Point U is the inferred urban
consumption (30 percent of production), and DuDu' is the urban demand function with elasticity
-0.535 (Dairy India 1997, p. 58). Qu is the inferred urban consumption under the self-reliant
policy. Pw is urban retail price of milk based on imported and reconstituted ingredients. Point F
is the intersection of the urban demand function DuDu' and world price Pw. Qf is the
corresponding free trade urban consumption, and Qg is the quantity of milk produced at the
world price in the unit elasticity of supply case.
3.    The gain in urban consumer surplus as a result of going from self-sufficiency to free
trade is the area FPwPiU which is approximately Rs 16.33 billion in 1977-78 (Rs 59.64 billion
in constant 1993-94 rupees). The loss of producer surplus depends on the assumption with
respect to the elasticity of supply. For a completely inelastic supply function, the loss is the
rectangle U'PwPiU, which is approximately Rs 13.284 billion in 1977-78 (Rs 48.50 billion in
constant 1993-94 rupees); for a unit elasticity supply function, the loss is the trapezoid GPwPiU,
which is approximately Rs 9.44 billion in 1977-78 (Rs 34.5 billion in constant 1993-94 rupees).
4.    The direct foreign exchange cost for the limited free trade option also depends on the
elasticity of supply. In the perfectly inelastic case, the expenditure on imported and recombined
milk is the rectangle QuU'FQf. In the unit elasticity case, it is the rectangle QgGFQf. Raw
material imports constitute about 89 percent of the cost of urban milk. The direct foreign
exchange costs of the increased urban milk consumption would have thus been 0.89 times the
above rectangles. Table Dl records these changes in 1993-94 rupees and 1996 dollars.

a. Raw materials only.
5.    A similar analysis for 1993-94 is depicted in Figure D2. The left axis gives urban retail
prices in 1993-94 rupees. The observed urban price and total production is again Point A. This
defines the Indian urban price Pi (Rs 8.80 per liter). Point U is the urban demand at this price,

corresponding to quantity Qu, and DuDu' is the urban demand function (elasticity -0.535)
through this point. Pw (Rs 7.66 per liter) is the urban price of milk based on reconstituted
imported ingredients, and F is the price and quantity (Qf) for urban consumption which would
occur under free trade.
6.      Supply is a little more complex. OS+ is the (unit elasticity) supply function which
characterized the with-protection and Operation Flood scenario. OS is the supply function shown
in Figure DI, which ruled in 1977-78. The question, then, is: By how much (if at all) should we
assume that the supply function would shift under free trade? If we assume that technology
explains perhaps half the observed shift with the balance explained by market access and other
assurances provided by the self-reliance policy and that the shift due to technology would have
occurred in any case,) then OS- is the new shifted supply function under the free trade option
and without Operation Flood.
7.      Three scenarios are illustrated in Figure D2 with respect to urban milk pricing and
supply:
(i)     Simple self-reliance with supply function S- and price-quantity equilibrium2 at
D;
(ii)    Operation Flood with supply function S+ and price-quantity equilibrium at U;
and
(iii)    Free trade with supply function S- and price-quantity equilibrium at F.
8.      Point G is where the self-sufficiency/free trade supply function S- intersects world price.
The corresponding quantity is Qg.
9.      Table D2 expresses the consumer and producer surpluses relative to the self-reliance
option in 1993-94 rupees. The same data is reported in Table D3 in terms of 1996 dollars.

Consumer Surplus                               5.66                           14.76

Foreign Exchangea                           0.00                          (49.84)
a. Raw materials only.
1. A generous assumption, since technology adoption is directly related to the profitability of the technology. A more
realistic assessment might be to give a third of the shift to technology alone, a third to protection and Operation Flood
alone, and a third to the synergy if both were undertaken together.
2. This, too, is a conservative assumption, since it is to be assumed that the even higher prices than under Operation
Flood would have induced further technological adoption. For the skeptics, and to get orders of magnitude, the
Operation Flood scenario can also be interpreted as a self-reliance scenario where all the supply shift is due to higher
prices, and Operation Flood has no impact.

Dear Mr Slade.
Thank you for your letter dated June 30. 1997 enclosing a copv of the draft report on "Tbe Impact of
Dairying Development in India: The Bank's Contribution Impact Evaluation Report" and inviung
our comments on it
Your letter was received in Anand on Julv 16th. hence, we have onh% been able to go through iL hurredly
In sun. I find it a heartemng confirmauon of what we feel wve ha% e achiueved and of our approach which.
as vou know. has been to place farmers in control of the resources thc create. and thus. in control of their
own destmnes I would agree witht he repon s conciusion that a maor impediment to fully achievmng all
of ou- - -. . -ias been the reluctance of the state governments to endorse and suppon Anand Pattern - that
is tii Liarmer-owned and controUed -- cooperatives I was pleased with the recogniuon that talk of a
level playing field is meanmngless unless one takes full account of the subsidies and concessions offered
to. and evasions resorted to. bv corporate plavers and traders  The repon quite effecuvely argues for
retenuon and enforcement of the MMPO unul such ume as there is a genwnehv level playing field  I was
parucm- v struck, but not surpnsed bv. the author s comment that it is unusual for him to encounter a
succe, .rv that the World Bank does not recoenuse which. he suggests is the case with Operauon
Flood I ao hope that the Bank s Execuuve Directors will give due considerauon to the report's findings
and recommendations
