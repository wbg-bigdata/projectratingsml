                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the project has experienced some challenges over the last six months, particularly in the areas of producing financial management reports, processing
                         procurement documents and managing associated contracts and providing comprehensive monitoring and evaluation reports. However, the Bank team has been working with the
                         government to resolve these issues. Also, this project has been under implementation for 13 years. During this 13 year period Cote d’Ivoire experienced considerable political turmoil.
                         This turmoil led to the project being suspended off and on for a total of 5 years and 4 months. While the suspensions presented serious implementation challenges, the project did

                         have some successes (mostly achieved after the 2008 restructuring), which included an impressive increase in disbursements from 9.5 percent in 2008 to 85 percent in May 2012.
                         Other achievements include the construction and equipment of 300 primary classrooms and 8 colleges and the rehabilitation of an additional college which was in a state of disrepair.
                         This college is 90 percent completed and it is expected to be fully completed prior to project closing. Combined, the primary and colleges will benefit 18,000 students (14,400 at the
                         primary level and 3,600 at the college level). These new classrooms are expected to help alleviate overcrowding in classrooms. The project also financed the re-opening of all 14

                         teacher training institutes (CAFOP) which only required the provision of the necessary equipment. In addition to equipment, the project was also able to rehabilitate of 2 of the
                         institutes which were in disrepair. The project also purchased and distributed 6.4 million textbooks and teachers’ guides thereby exceeding the project target and leading to the
                         achievement of the textbook:student target. The project's support for textbook acquisition and distribution was the main reason for achieving the related HIPC target. Another
                         achievement is the continued increase in enrollments despite the crisis and numerous project suspensions. These data show: (i) GER in 1st grade increased from 70.6% in 2006/07
                         to 74% in 2010/2011, and (ii) GER in primary increased from 74% in 2006/07 to 83.6%, slightly exceeding the end-of-project target. Completion rates have also increased from 43.4%
                         in 1998/99 to 46% in 2006/07 to 64.2% in 2011/12, again surpassing the end of project target. Repetition rates have also exceed the project target although they have slipped below
                         the 2007/08 levels. However, challenges remain with low transition rate from primary to lower secondary and there is a declining success rate. The project also identified the
                         connection between the weaknesses in teacher training and the use of the competency-based approach and the success rates of children. The project was able to suggest mitigation
                         measures that guided the CAFOP restructuring interventions financed by the GPE project (i.e. evaluation of CAFOP functioning, curriculum and teacher training practices). The
                         project did not carry out the student learning assessments at the secondary level, which was introduced as part of the 2008 restructuring. However, a new department (Observatoire
                         des Acquis des Elèves, which used to be Sous-Direction de l’Evaluation) to oversee all student learning assessment activities has been established with support of the project and is
                         now directly linked to the Minister's cabinet. This new department's mission objectives are in the process of being finalized. The project also carried out a PASEC assessment and is
                         currently finalizing the analysis of Grade 3 learning achievement results but the secondary level assessment was not done because after the crisis the government focused on
                         primary education because the need at that level was the main focus.
