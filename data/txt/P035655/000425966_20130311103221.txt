1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. In early 1994, following the devaluation of the CFA Franc
(CFAF), Côte d’Ivoire had successfully implemented a multiyear program of economic
recovery and reform, aimed at achieving sustained economic growth and restoring
financial viability with the assistance of the International Development Association
(IDA), the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) through a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF). The result of the comprehensive adjustment strategy adopted in 1994 was that
real gross domestic project (GDP) rose from 2.1 percent in 1994 to 7.1 percent in 1995
and 6.8 percent in 1996. The 12-month inflation rate fell from 32.2 percent in December
1994 to 3.5 percent December 1996. At the same time a comprehensive strategy to
manage external and internal debt was put in place. All external payment arrears to
official bilaterals and multilateral creditors and most domestic arrears were cleared by the
end of 1996. The economic situation had a substantial impact on all the social indicators
which fell below the norms for most countries with similar income levels.

2.      In the late 1990s, Côte d’Ivoire underwent severe political and social crisis,
culminating in a brief civil war which effectively divided the country in two. It was
estimated in the 2011 World Development Report (WDR) “Conflict, Security and
Development? that “civil conflict costs the average developing country roughly 30 years
of GDP growth, and countries in protracted crisis can fall over 20 percentage points
behind in overcoming poverty?. During the period 2000-06, the annual real GDP declined
0.4 percent. This combined with the 1.7 percent average population growth, resulted in an
annual per capita real GDP decline of 2.1 percent, aggravating already very high
unemployment levels, especially among youth. Poverty increased from an official 38.2
percent just before the crisis in 2002 to 43.2 percent in 2006. Côte d’Ivoire was in debt
distress. Another phenomenon during this time was the increase in global food prices,
which led to unprecedented increases in the prices of rice, cooking oil, and other food
items and to food shortages.

3.      Sector Context. The Bank approved three education credits in Côte d’Ivoire in
the 1970s. When the last education project closed in 1986 the Bank was absent from the
sector 1 until 1991 when IDA supported an adjustment operation (Human Resource
Development Program – HRDP, 1991-1996) covering all human resources sectors. In
1998, the first education sector specific project, since 1986, the Education Training and
Support Project (PASEF) was approved by the Bank Board of Executive Directors. At
this time, the population of Côte d’Ivoire was expected to grow from 14 million in 1997


1
  The implementation period of the third Bank--supported project coincided with the onset of a long and severe
economic recession, which put a strain on resources for education. Through its dialogue, the Bank sought to find
approaches to respond to these pressures. However, there was no consensus on the issues and IDA was absent from the
education sector as a lender from 1986 to 1991 when IDA supported the HRDP project. (PAD, p. 7)


                                                        1
to 27 million by 2015. Approximately 36.8 percent of the population lived below the
poverty line. Protein-calorie malnutrition was 20 percent in urban areas and 28 percent in
rural areas. The adult literacy rate was estimated at 43 percent (higher among females at
32 percent). Children under the age of 15 accounted for 45 percent of the population and
net enrollment rate (NER) at the primary school level was less than 51 percent (41
percent female). Access to education for children in poor households was 41 percent and
30 percent in the poorest. Quality of education was poor with 22.8 percent repetition in
first grade and 42.5 percent in sixth grade and the primary school completion rate was
less than 40 percent. The primary GER for boys was 80.9 percent and 61.4 percent for
girls in 1996/97. There were high costs and poor accessibility for poor households and
low efficiency within the public education system.

4.      In order to begin to deal with these issues, government adopted a goal of universal
primary education by 2010. At the Consultative Group (CG) meeting in 1995, the CG set
out its strategy to achieve this goal as well as to attain greater quality, access and
efficiency. The CG document provided a conceptual framework for the development and
implementation of sector-wide reforms, but still gave a strong sense of central top-down
planning, with more emphasis on infrastructure than on teaching and learning. An
education law based on an improved strategy was approved by the National Assembly in
September 1995, followed by a draft National Policy Statement on Education and
Training. There were two participatory planning seminars that brought together
stakeholders including teacher unions, sector personnel and donors and from these
seminars the National Education and Training Development Plan (NETDP) emerged. The
NETDP also established proposals for donor support in other areas including literacy,
vocational training and higher education. It was presented at a Donor Round Table in
September 1997. The NETDP was characterized by three essential features: (i) coverage
of all education sub-sectors; (ii) support to broader economic, social and personal
development; and (iii) open and responsive management of the education system.

5.      The 2001/02 socio-political instability also had an impact on enrollments. During
this period gross enrollment rates (GER) dropped from 76 percent in 2001/02 to 53.3
percent in 2002/2003, which coincided with the onset of the political instability. Only in
2008/09 did GER reached 76.2 which was the pre-crisis level. Data collection was
difficult during the political instability because the areas under the “Force Nouvelles?
control were not accessible. In addition, Côte d’Ivoire had four assessments of student
learning between 1995 and 2012, including two with the support of the Program for the
Analysis of Education Systems (PASEC) in 1996 and 2009. The comparison between
school performance in 1995/96 and 2008/09 shows that in grade 2, the average learning
score declined by 16.1 points and in grade 5 by 17.1 points. This represents an average
annual decline of approximately 1.3 and 1.4 respectively over the conflict period.
Furthermore, this period was marked by destruction of classrooms, closing of some
teacher training institutes (Centres d’Animation et Formation Pédagogique – CAFOP) as
well as deterioration of CAFOP facilities, limited availability of textbooks, and teaching
materials. The deterioration of the education system led to the decision to restructure the
project with a focus on primary education.




                                            2
6.      Project Context. The PASEF project became effective on September 25, 1998,
which was a politically volatile time for Côte d’Ivoire and had a lasting impact on overall
implementation. An evaluation of the PASEF project requires a full understanding of the
political context within which the project was implemented. In 1999, Côte d’Ivoire had
begun to experience significant political turmoil, the government went into arrears and
the project was suspended in 2000. In 2002 the arrears were cleared and project funds
were available immediately. The political turmoil culminated in a civil conflict in 2002-
2003 so that on September 19, 2002 the country was divided into two parts –with the
“Forces Nouvelles? holding the north and west and the government in control in the
southern and central regions. During this period, real GDP contracted by 6 percent and
poverty increased from an official 38 percent before the crisis to 42 - 44 percent after the
crisis.

7.      In March 2004, tensions escalated again and resulted in an additional four years of
civil conflict and a suspension of all World Bank activities. A breakthrough was achieved
with the signing of the Ouagadougou Peace Accords on March 4, 2007. The Bank’s
support to the peace process was a pre-arrears clearance grant, the Post-Conflict
Assistance Project (PCAP, US$120 million) approved by the Board on July 17, 2007 and
the Economic Governance and Recovery Grant (EGRG, US$308 million) approved by
the Board on April 1, 2008. Clearance of arrears paved the way for the reactivation of
Côte d’Ivoire’s suspended portfolio that included the PASEF project. On July 29, 2008
the PASEF project was reactivated in the post-conflict setting. It only took 12 days after
reactivation for the funds to be available to support the rebuilding of the education system
in Côte d’Ivoire which was a major benefit of having the PASEF project in the portfolio.

8.      Shortly after the October 2010 elections, the country entered another phase of
civil conflict and in February 2011 project disbursements were suspended again until
June 7, 2011 when the conflict ended and the government cleared their arrears again.
Again, the funds were immediately available to support the education system and re-open
schools.

9.      Côte d’Ivoire Donor Context. Côte d’Ivoire has relatively few partners active in
the education sector. The United Nations Children’s fund (UNICEF), and some NGOs
support primary education but most of the other major partners only support post-primary
education and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). The EC, the
French Cooperation and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) have been
providing support to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and youth employment. The
AFD is planning a TVET project; and the German Agency for International Cooperation
(GIZ), with EC and World Bank financing, has been implementing activities in labor
intensive public works, youth employment and the reintegration of ex-combatants to
address post-conflict emergency needs.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

10.     The objectives of the Project as recorded in the DCA dated June 17, 1998 were to
assist the Government in its efforts to: (i) strengthen its capacity to carry out a



                                             3
comprehensive basic education reform program; (ii) increase access to, and improve
completion rates in, primary education; and (iii) to improve the quality of instruction and
learning outcomes for students in primary and lower secondary education. Progress
would be evaluated on the basis of the following:

                   Indicator                                   Baseline (1997)             Target (2001-2002)

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11.     The level one restructuring of the project on August 15, 2008 led to revisions in
the PDOs and key performance indicators (KPI). The new PDOs were to assist the
Borrower to resume the delivery of education services in primary schools, which implied:
(i) providing quality school inputs to guarantee teaching and learning in classrooms, and
(ii) improving access to education and retention of primary school children. The new
KPIs—along with their respective baseline values and expected outcome targets—were
modified and became the following:

Indicator                                             Baseline 20081 Target 2010  Target 20122
Gross enrollment rate in grade 1                                 71%          80%         80%
Gross enrollment rate in primary                                 74%          82%         82%

Repetition Rate (% children repeating                            22%          14%         14%
in the beginning of a school year)

 Baseline date represents data for the school year 2007/08.
2
 The August 2011 project restructuring to extend the closing date to August 31, 2012 did not change the project targets.

12.     The primary reason for the restatement of the PDO was to align the objectives of
the project with country’s recovery needs and the Government’s post-conflict priorities
after years of conflict and the associated devastation. The new PDO and activities would
also be aligned with the government’s donor-endorsed Education Recovery Restoration
Plan (ERRP) that was prepared in mid-2007 which focused almost entirely on supporting
the restoration of basic education service delivery.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.     The project beneficiaries of the 2008 re-structured project were a highly
vulnerable group. A diagnosis of the project areas by the Ministry of State and Ministry
of Planning and Development showed that there had been a decrease in the number of
students because schools were closed or destroyed and there was pressure in safer areas
because people were fleeing areas of conflict or tension. As a resulted, the project
targeted approximately 2.4 million primary school-age children and 450,000 lower
secondary students. The other beneficiaries were approximately: (i) 17,300 teachers that
received pre-service and in-service training; (ii) 15,000 school staff, as well as parents
and communities where new classrooms were constructed; (iii) 3,000 adults that received
literacy training; and (iv) 3,000 staff at the Ministry of National Education (MEN), the
Regional Directorate for National Education (DREN), the Ministry of Higher Education
and Scientific Research (MESRS) and Ministry of Vocational and Professional Training
(METFP). The approximate total of direct beneficiaries is 2.88 million, of which 43.9
percent were women.

1.5 Original Components

The original project design included the following five components:

14.     Project Component 1: Improving Learning at the Primary and Secondary
Levels. (US$26.5 million equivalent, of which US$18 million IDA) This component
aimed to strengthen the role of the school in improving teaching and learning, both at the
primary and secondary levels. It supported changes in the curriculum to increase the
relevance of education and aimed to increase the availability of textbooks while shifting
textbook publishing to the private sector. This component had five sub-components: (i)
revision of curriculum content and implementation; (ii) school-based pre-service and in-
service teacher training; (iii) applied research and pedagogical innovations; (iv) provision
of textbooks in the targeted areas; and (v) a student learning evaluation system. Each sub-
component was designed with particular attention to promoting girls' education.

15.     Project Component 2: Expanding Access to Primary Schools and Colleges
(US$36.7 million equivalent, of which US$19.5 million IDA). This component aimed
to increase access to primary and secondary schools in underserved and unserved areas
through a construction and renovation program accompanied by a sustainable school
maintenance program. These activities were to focus on small schools with multigrade
classrooms and schools with combined preschool and first grade classes (classe
préparatoire unique - CM3 and CP1) instead of first and second grade classes (CP1 and
CP2), to facilitate access in areas that were less populated or which had a low enrollment
rate among girls and disadvantaged children. Small neighborhood secondary schools
(collèges de proximité or collèges de petite échelle) were also to be constructed. The
component aimed to renovate four teacher training institutes (CAFOPs) in the targeted
areas. This component had two sub-components: (a) school construction and renovation;
and (b) school maintenance.




                                             5
16.     Project Component 3: Developing Institutional Capacity (US$7.0 million
equivalent, of which US$6.1 million IDA). This component supported the improvement
and strengthening of the planning, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacities of
MENFB at all levels, including strategic resource planning. Planning for girls' education
and the health of school children. This component’s five sub-components aimed to
provide the necessary inputs for: (i) decentralization; (ii) strategic planning and
management; (iii) improved resource management; (iv) creation of a girls' education
promotion unit (Cellule de Promotion de l'Education des Filles - CPEF); and (v) school
health and nutrition.

17.     Project Component 4: Enhancing Strategic Sector Planning and Sector
Coordination (US$9.6 million equivalent, of which US$7.5 million IDA). This
component aimed to ensure better coordination of the education sector as a whole, by: (i)
increasing relevance and external efficiency. It had three sub-components: (i) strategic
planning and management of higher education; (ii) strategic planning and management of
vocational and professional training; and (iii) sector coordination and dialogue.

18.    Component 5: Project Management (US$2.3 million equivalent, of which
US$1.5 million IDA). The Project Implementation Unit – PIU (Bureau d’Exécution des
Projets - BEP) and regional branches. Project management of civil works was organized
both through a central service based in Abidjan and its regional branches (antennes
régionales) within the ten DRENFB.

1.6 Revised Components

19.     During the July 29, 2008 restructuring the project components were also realigned
to support the post-conflict priorities of the government by focusing on the restoration of
basic education service delivery. The new components were articulated as follows:

20.     Component 1: Improving the quality of basic education (US$27.7 million
equivalent). This component involved: (i) developing, printing, and distributing
textbooks and teachers’ manuals to achieve a ratio of three textbooks for students in
grades 1 and 2, and five textbooks for each student in grades 3 to 6, and improving the
existing textbook rental scheme in primary schools; (ii) finalizing the primary education’s
curriculum reform based on the competency-based approach and providing related
training to teachers and other pedagogic supervisors in the school districts; (iii)
strengthening the national student evaluation system, conducting student evaluations in
one grade in primary and secondary education, and analyzing and distributing the results;
(iv) rehabilitating and re-equipping teacher training centers (CAFOP), providing teaching
and learning materials to student-teachers and training teacher-trainers in the
competency-based approach; (v) supporting the National Literacy Support Fund (FNAA)
to provide literacy training to 3,000 people (of which 75 percent would be women) in the
zones under Forces Nouvelles control; and (vi) purchasing, through the World Food
Programme (WFP), and delivering food to 400 primary schools in the regions of Abidjan,
Yamoussoukro, Dimbokro, Daloa and Gagnoa from September 2008 to June 2009.




                                            6
21.     Component 2: Supporting access to primary and lower secondary education
(US$16.2 million equivalent). This component aimed to finance the construction and
equipping of 300 primary classrooms and 8 lower secondary schools – these were to be
largely new constructions. The number of teachers available was adequate (including
volunteers who became de facto teachers during the 2004 crisis) and the Government’s
education budget could support their salaries. Despite some localized issues, there were
no salary arrears.

22.     Component 3: Developing institutional capacity (US$17.8 million equivalent).
This component included support and capacity building for each of the three ministries of
education 2, but with a larger focus both financially and technically on the MEN. First, the
Project aimed to reinforce the strategic and operational capacity of the MEN through: (i)
the setting up and staffing of a 4-person strategic executive unit located in the Minister’s
Cabinet; (ii) the development and installation of an education and management
information system (EMIS); (iii) the strengthening of human resources in charge of
education statistics, human resource management, school mapping, elaboration of an
education Country Status Report (CSR) and support for the Education For All- Fast
Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) endorsement process; and (iv) the re-equipping of central and
decentralized MEN structures. Second, in both the Ministry of Technical Education and
Vocational Training (METFP) and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific
Research (MESRS), support was provided for: (i) the development and installation of an
EMIS; (ii) human capacity development – notably by means of technical assistance (TA)
– in the areas of statistics, human resource management, Public Expenditure Review
(PER/EPTS); (iii) studies and consultations for the elaboration of national strategies in
the technical and vocational training sector and higher education; and (iv) a limited
number of vehicles and equipment for planning divisions and a few decentralized
structures in the METFP and MESRS.

23.    Component 4: Project management (US$4.4 million equivalent). This
component financed the running costs of the project execution unit (BEP). The BEP was
responsible for fiduciary management, civil works management, programming and
monitoring of project activities, and production of execution and audit reports.
Expenditures under this component included: (i) the purchase of new equipment; (ii)
operating costs; (iii) consultant services; (iv) studies; and (v) training.

1.7 Other significant changes

24.    On October 31, 2000 the Bank suspended disbursements for the project because
the government was in arrears. By January 30, 2002 the government cleared the arrears
and disbursements began shortly thereafter.

  The three Ministries of Education remained largely the same as under the original project but with slightly different
names: (i) Ministry of National Education (Ministère de l’Education Nationale – MEN); (ii) Ministry of Technical
Education and Vocational Training (Ministère de l’Enseignement Technique et de la Formation Professionnelle –
METFP); and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de
la Recherche Scientifique – MESRS).


                                                           7
25.     December 23, 2002, IDA, at the request of the government, granted a six-month
extension of the original project closing date from December 31, 2002 to June 30, 2003
due to the ongoing civil conflict.

26.     In June 2003, the Côte d’Ivoire country portfolio was restructured and, at that
time, the project closing date was extended from June 30, 2003 to June 30, 2004.

27.     On June 14, 2004 the government went into arrears again and the project
disbursements were suspended on June 15, 2004. This suspension lasted until April 2,
2008 when four years of civil war ended and the government cleared their arrears thereby
paving the way for reactivation of the Côte d’Ivoire suspended portfolio. On July 29,
2008, four projects in the Côte d’Ivoire portfolio were restructured as a part of the Bank’s
re-engagement, and the PASEF project was one of them. The restructuring retroactively
extended the project closing date from June 30, 2004 to August 30, 2010. It also
eliminated the borrower portion of the overall project costs but maintained the total credit
amount of SDR39.6 million. During the four year suspension, the project benefitted from
fluctuations in the SDR:US$ exchange rate. In 1998 the SDR:US$ equivalent value of the
project was US$53.3 million and by July 2008 it was US$66.1 million. The restructuring
modified the project activities to focus almost entirely on supporting the restoration of
basic education service delivery and used the additional resources to support teacher
training, literacy and respond to the country’s food crisis. The restructuring: (i) restated
the PDO as indicated above; (ii) simplified the project components by reducing the
number of project activities and combining the original components 3 and 4; and (iii)
added three new activities to help: (a) respond to the food crisis, its impact on school
children and their education, (b) improve literacy; and (c) rehabilitate teacher training
centers (CAFOP) that were in a state of disrepair after so many years of neglect due to
the crisis. This restructuring also reduced the overall scope of classroom construction
from 900 to 300 for new classrooms and 300 rehabilitated classrooms and reallocated
project resources (see Table 1).

28.    In 2009, the project was restructured to increase the procurement thresholds.

29.     In March 2010, the project was restructured again to: (i) extend the project closing
date from August 30, 2010 to August 30, 2011; and (ii) reallocate the Credit proceeds
between disbursement categories.

30.   On February 12, 2011, disbursements were suspended one more time because the
government was in arrears. This suspension was lifted on June 7, 2011.

31.    On August 16, 2011, the project was restructured for the final time. At this time,
the project closing date was extended from August 30, 2011 to August 30, 2012. This
extension was requested to complete ongoing activities so that the PDO could be
achieved and critical activities completed such as the school feeding program and the
purchase of additional desks that were financed by the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

32.      Project Preparation. In 1997, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire and the Bank
initially considered a sector-wide education operation that was to be supported by a
Sector Investment Program (SIP) instrument. It was ultimately decided that this type of
operation would not be appropriate because the strategies for technical and higher
education were not sufficiently developed, and this would create unnecessary delays for
implementation of reforms to basic education. The Bank preparation and appraisal teams
consisted of technical experts that were appropriate for the development of the project.
Project preparation was also spread over several months, which allowed for the
development and continuation of a sector-wide dialogue with the government, all three
education ministries (MENFB, METFPA and MESRIT) and the donor community. This
was done in an effort to engender strong and sustained political leadership, championship
and ownership, which the team felt were important for the success of the project. On the
government side, the development the NETDP, meetings and workshops, were used to
build consensus around the NETDP among donors, the rest of government and civil
society in support of the NETDP education reforms. The project preparation process
seems to have been thoughtful, collaborative, and technically sound and to the extent
possible, based on lessons learned from previous operations.

33.     Original Project Design. The original PASEF project design fit squarely into the
NETDP, the HIPC agreement and the associated HIPC education sector targets, as well
as the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). They shared the common objectives of
supporting growth, rapid poverty reduction, and improved public sector managements
and recognized the strong links between universal basic education, high economic growth
and poverty reduction. The project design took into consideration comments by the peer
reviewers which, in 1997, were responsible for providing the quality guidance on the
project. The quality reviewers included two Bank education specialists as well as an
outside reviewer who worked for the Institute of International Research on improving
educational quality. The preparation team also incorporated lessons learned from past
sector investment loans (SILs) and the adjustment program, such as: (i) the need for
specific interventions in the education sector rather than relying on a programmatic
approach through the Ministry of Finance; (ii) ensuring that sectoral policies were
addressed in ways that were consistent with the broader macroeconomic environment;
and (iii) ensuring that projects were responsive to national and regional economic



                                           9
conditions and demand for skills. Initial discussions included adopting a “Sector
Investment Program? approach. However, other sub-sector strategies were not
sufficiently developed at the time of project preparation, which led to the project being
developed as a SIL.

34.      The project design included the appropriate activities to assist the government in
reaching their goal of universal basic education (UBE) and improved quality through: (i)
expanding access to schools in underserved and unserved areas; (ii) focusing on girl’s
education; (iii) dealing with weak capacity to deliver education services with the
inclusion of a sector capacity building component; and (iv) improving quality through
teacher training, provision of textbooks and learning assessments. It also included a
critical pre-investment component to move the sector-wide dialogue forward in the areas
of vocational training and higher education. To support the implementation of all these
activities, it was decided that: (i) there would be an oversight group that included
representatives from all three education ministries; (ii) MENFB would coordinate all
communication with the Bank, and (iii) the BEP would handle all of the financial
management and procurement activities. This structure was appropriate to ensure
continued ownerships by all three ministries, and the BEP had the capacity and
experience to implement Bank procurement and financial management. Finally, the
results framework for the project was derived from the NETDP and HIPC education
targets which were appropriate.

35.     Restructuring Design. In 2008, after four years of civil war and suspension of
the Bank’s Côte d’Ivoire portfolio, the project was restructured as part of the Bank’s
support for the country’s emergency recovery. The restructuring was again fully aligned
within the three strategic objectives of the Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) which
were to: (i) support stabilization after the crisis and assist government in addressing key
conflict factors through implementation of the Ouagadougou Peace Accords; (ii) assist
war-affected populations by way of community rehabilitation and support for the
provision of basic social services; and (iii) assist economic recovery and reform by
focusing on economic governance and fostering demand for accountability. As
mentioned, the restructuring modified the project activities to focus almost entirely on
supporting the restoration of basic education service delivery, reducing the scope of the
overall project and used the available resources to support teacher training, literacy and
respond to the country’s food crisis. The project’s institutional arrangements remained
the same because they were judged to be valid and appropriate for implementation.
Finally, the results framework was also redesigned to measure the simplified project
structure with new baselines and targets to match the country reality after four years of
civil war. Specifically, Component 1 included: (i) almost twice as many textbooks and
teachers’ guides than originally programmed; (ii) a new school-feeding initiative, which
had to be extended for an additional year due to the 2011 crisis; and (iii) a new literacy
program to support those who missed the chance for an education due to the political and
security situation prevalent at the time. Similarly, Component 2 added a particular
emphasis on providing schools with 30,870 additional student desks to help replace the
large numbers lost due to years of conflict. Lastly, Component 3 moved beyond its
original focus of providing mostly technical assistance and small information technology



                                            10
equipment to the three ministries: the conflict required the project to support both
physical replacement of assets (computers, office furniture and vehicles) as well as
capacity building. These new activities represented a marked shift in the project with the
focus now on restoring the delivery of basic education services.

36.     The restructuring was appropriate particularly in light of the post-conflict fragile
state status of Côte d’Ivoire at the time of re-engagement. The project was important
because it was able to provide needed resources for the sector immediately and quicker
than an emergency operation because the funds were readily available upon clearing of
the country’s arrears. Providing resources quickly had a direct impact on bringing
teachers, students and school administrators back into the education system.

2.2 Implementation

37.     The PASEF project was in the Côte d’Ivoire country portfolio for 14 years.
During this period, the project was formally suspended for a total of 5 years and 4 months.
Implementation of the project was successful to a greater or lesser extent depending on
the time period: phase one was the period September 1998 to April 2008 and phase two,
the post-restructuring period, was August 2008 to August 2012. As previously mentioned,
there were many exogenous factors that complicated implementation over the project
period. Despite many implementation challenges, the project had many successes most of
which were achieved following restructuring.

38.     During phase I (9/1998-4/2008), the project disbursed only 10.4 percent of the
total credit. During the first 16 months following Board approval, the project made good
progress: (i) project effectiveness occurred three months after board approval; (ii)
progress was being made toward recruiting the required TA for the revision of the
curriculum, learning evaluation and teacher training reform; (iii) procurement and
distribution of approximately 1.2 million primary school textbooks in the 61 targeted
areas had taken place; (iv) teacher training institutions (ENSs) were moving quickly on
pedagogical reform; (v) studies were launched for the new computerization scheme
(EMIS) and job post evaluation; (vi) training on the new financial management system
had been provided to staff at the regional level; (vii) a draft program for school health and
HIV/AIDS had been endorsed by government; (viii) the Bank’s no objections had been
issued for the construction of 300 classrooms; and (ix) counterpart funds were being
provided as agreed.

39.     Implementation of Component 3: Sector Development and Coordination
component was mixed: (i) capacity building activities in METFP and MESRS slowed due
to replacement of the ministers and turnover of key staff associated with these changes;
and (ii) the inter-ministerial committee (Comité Interministeriel de Coordination du
Secteur de 1'Education - CICSEF) that was to be the coordination mechanism was legally
established but was functioning at a basic level, particularly after the August 1999
reshuffle of the government. Project management was hampered by the introduction of a
highly complex and cumbersome Integrated Public Finance Management System
(Système Intégré de Gestion des Finances Publique - SIGFIP), which required multiple



                                             11
approval steps and delayed disbursements and therefore payments to contractors. Despite
the 1999 coup d’état and slow disbursements, the PDO indicators were being measured
and data were available to Bank supervision teams. Based on the initial implementation
progress, the project was rated satisfactory during this time.

40.     By September 2000, there were still delays in payments and disbursements as a
result of SIGFIP. This whole process was being further aggravated by the late adoption of
the 2000 budget that was caused by the 1999 coup d’état. Activities were moving
forward albeit it with counterpart funding because the country went into arrears and
project disbursements were suspended. At this time, the PDO rating and project
management were downgraded to unsatisfactory. In January 2002 the arrears were
cleared and in June 2002, the Bank conducted a mid-term review (MTR) of the project.
Upon completion of the MTR, the DO was upgraded to satisfactory because the
government had continued to implement project activities. In addition, data showed
positive trends toward achievement of the DO with increases in GER, girl’s participation
rates and pass rates.

41.      In September 2002, civil war broke out in Côte d’Ivoire and all Bank missions
were stopped. The Bank and the government implementation team, continued to
supervise the project through video conference meetings as well as reverse supervision
missions. Based on these “supervision? findings, the project was rated unsatisfactory
because many activities could not be implemented, especially in the North where the
Forces Nouvelles were in control. After the signing of the Marcoussis Peace Agreement:
(i) the Bank re-engaged, (ii) the closing date was extended to June 30, 2004; (iii)
disbursements started to pick up; and (iv) the Bank and government began discussions on
a proposed project restructuring to address the post-conflict nature of Côte d’Ivoire. At
this time, there was a real benefit to having the PASEF project in the country portfolio
because it meant that funds were immediately available to support the education sector.
However, the 2004 restructuring never materialized because by June 2004, Côte d’Ivoire
was in arrears again due to government instability and shortly thereafter, all Bank
activities were suspended due to the civil war which lasted four years. The last ISR for
this implementation period was archived in April 2005.

42.     Phase two (8/2008-8/2012) was marked by Bank re-engagement in a post-crisis,
fragile state environment for Côte d’Ivoire. Again, as mentioned, one of the most
important benefits to having the PASEF project in the country portfolio was that funds
were immediately available to support the education sector. During this period, the
project disbursed 88.8 percent of the project funds. This was due, in large part, to the
restructuring of the project, which simplified the PDO and reduced the activities to focus
mainly on primary education. The simplified project structure with the focus on basic
education was appropriate for the post-crisis situation due to the fact that the education
sector had not functioned for five years and the need was for inputs to rebuild the system
and capacity building to deliver education services. During this period, project
implementation began slowly due to the fact that institutions need to be reestablished.
However, once the BEP was re-engaged, project disbursements began to move.




                                           12
43.      In early 2009, the Bank placed the task team leader in Côte d’Ivoire to work
closely with the government to solve project problems more effectively and efficiently.
This had the intended effect as the Bank was able to quickly respond to implementation
issues and guide the BEP in the day-to-day management of the project. By 2010, in a
post-crisis fragile state situation, project disbursements had increased from 10.4 percent
to 68.9 percent with a commitment rate of 95 percent. This could be seen by the fact that:
(i) primary school classrooms were being constructed, (ii) textbooks were being
purchased and delivered; (iii) teachers were being trained; (iv) schools were being re-
equipped; (v) CAFOP were being rehabilitated and supplied with furniture; and (vi)
institutional capacity was being strengthened through management training. This is an
impressive achievement for a sector that needed to be rebuilt after 10 years of a
combination of civil war and social unrest/insecurity. As mentioned earlier, the project
experienced one more period of political instability. Shortly after the October 2010
elections, the country had another phase of civil conflict and in February 2011, project
disbursements were suspended due to arrears until June 7, 2011, when the government
cleared the arrears. Despite this civil conflict, project activities continued and by the
project closing date, all activities were completed and the project had disbursed 99.2
percent of project funds.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

44.     Design. As stated previously, the original set of indicators for the project were
appropriate for the project design and reflected the project design practices of the time.
The indicators were linked to the PDO and were adequate to measure achievement of the
PDO. The intermediate indicators were also linked to the components and included
details on the various units responsible for collecting the data. After the 2008
restructuring, the PDO indicators were focused and closely aligned with project
objectives, the intermediate indicators linked to the project investments, and the data
collection responsibilities clearly articulated (see datasheet for full list of indictors). The
original project design and the restructured project design both sought to develop and
install an Education Management Information System (EMIS) and the design for the
EMIS activities proved to be appropriate for the project.

45.     Implementation and Utilization of Monitoring and Evaluation. During phase
one of implementation, education data was being collected and reported on by the
government albeit hampered at times by the unstable political situation. The statistics
office of the MEN did provide Bank missions with data and information that allowed the
teams to make judgments on progress toward achieving the PDO and the project’s
implementation progress. This information was regularly reported on by the Bank in
aides-memoire and ISRs. The implementation of a full EMIS system that was envisioned
in the original design was not realized during the first phase of implementation. Again,
this was mainly due to the political and fiscal instability of the country, which made
procurement of goods and services difficult.

46.    After the 2008 restructuring, the M&E activities improved. The MEN began to
focus on developing an integrated EMIS system. MEN purchased an education statistics



                                              13
system (SPASS) as a transitional data software to allow them the ability to process data
quickly while they worked on developing an integrated EMIS system. The regional
education offices (Direction Régionale de l’Enseignement Nationale - DRENs) received
IT equipment and training to facilitate the collection of data for SPASS. The SPASS
became fully operational in 2010/11 and was used to produce statistics for the new
yearbook 2011/12. The project was not able to develop a fully integrated EMIS system
for the MESRS or METFP during the project life; however, the new Global Partnership
for Education (GPE) project design supports the SPASS’s integration into a full-fledged
EMIS.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

47.     Safeguards. The project was originally classified as a Category C based on the
Bank’s Operational Policy in 1997 and on the fact that no environmental risks were
foreseen and construction would comply with national environmental laws. There was a
social assessment during project preparation in 1998. During the 2008 project
restructuring, the environmental category was changed to Category B because it included
school construction and at that time an environmental assessment was done. A new
Integrated Safeguard Data Sheet (ISDS) was prepared and disclosed in the InfoShop. An
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was prepared, approved and
disclosed in Côte d’Ivoire and the InfoShop in April 2008. There was a post-project
environmental audit that showed that construction and rehabilitation activities were
carried out in accordance with the ESMF and that the project was in compliance with all
safeguards requirements.

48.     Fiduciary and Procurement Compliance. As mentioned previously, the BEP
was responsible for implementing the project under the MEN. The BEP fiduciary
management capacity was satisfactory for the implementation of the original project and
the restructured project according to OP/BP 10.02. At the time of restructuring, the
financial management software was updated and project personnel were trained by Bank
staff on new fiduciary requirements and procedures for Bank projects. By project closing,
there were no outstanding FMRs and PASEF was fully compliant with the submission of
the quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs). The Bank received the second-to-final
project audit report for 2011, which was qualified due to fact that some of the supporting
documentation related to the 2004 and 2005 counterpart funds was not included in the
records. In response to the audit, the government hired a consultant to assist in providing
clarification to the issues raised in the audit report. The MEN was able to provide the
additional documentation that led to a revision in the audit report to unqualified status by
project closing. The final 2012 audit report is in the process of being completed and is
due by June 30, 2013.

49.     Financial management (FM) capacity within the BEP was weak because there
was a lack of training and support during the civil crisis. When the project restarted in
2008 the Bank had new procedures for FM that required retraining and upgrading of
skills. This support was provided however, at one point in June 2012 FM was
downgraded to unsatisfactory because of lingering capacity constraints. These constraints



                                            14
were discussed with the Minister of National Education and it was agreed to hire two
additional accountants for the project. The additional support helped improve the
financial management performance and led to 99.2 percent of project funds being
disbursed by project closing. Project procurement was conducted in accordance with
Bank policies and procedures. However, towards the end of the project implementation
period, the BEP displayed capacity issues related to solving issues of nonperforming
contracts for the production and delivery of student desks. These issues led to
procurement being downgraded to unsatisfactory in June 2012. By project closing, the
PIU, with TA support, was able to cancel the nonperforming contracts, sign new
contracts, and ensure that all the desks were delivered to schools before project closing.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

50.     There are two emergency projects currently being implemented in Côte d’Ivoire
that were designed to sustain the achievements and build on the successes of PASEF. The
Emergency Basic Education Support Project (P119328), which is funded by the Global
Partnership for Education (GPE) with the Bank as the supervising entity, was approved
and became effective on April 2, 2012. It supports: (i) access to basic education services
through rehabilitation and replacement of primary classrooms, providing desks; and
promoting access to lower secondary schools particularly for girls; (ii) improving the
quality of teaching and learning through pre-service and in-service teacher training,
learning assessment; pedagogical inputs and school health and nutrition; and (iii)
strengthen institutional capacity through clarification of national, central and school
levels, training of regional level education management staff and strengthening the roles
and responsibilities of communities through school-based management committees. The
Bank-supported Emergency Youth Employment and Skills Development Project
(P122546), approved in September 15, 2011 and effective on December 27, 2011,
provides support for improved access to temporary employment and skills development
opportunities through skills training and literacy programs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

51.     Relevance of Objectives. The original project objectives were highly relevant to
the country’s sectoral needs when the project was developed. The project objectives fit
into the Bank’s CAS and the HIPC agreement’s objectives of economic growth and
poverty reduction through improved education services. Moreover, the government had
adopted a goal of universal basic education (UBE) and the project objectives fit squarely
into assisting the government in reaching their goal of UBE by 2010. While the original
project objectives were relevant at the time of design, years of civil war created a country
environment that warranted a more narrowly focused project objective as the country
began to rebuild in a post-conflict fragile state environment. The revised project
objectives were also highly relevant to supporting the restoration of basic education
services, teacher training and literacy and continue to fit into the current CAS.




                                            15
52.     Relevance of Design. The original project design was appropriate for assisting
the government in reaching their goal of UBE. Therefore, the relevance is judged to
substantial. In addition, the relevance of the restructured design is judged to be
substantial. This judgment is based on the fact that the: (i) PDO was linked directly to
the post-conflict status of Côte d’Ivoire; (ii) PDO indicators were simplified and new
baselines provided that reflected the country situation; and (iii) components were
simplified to focus on basic education with project activities that directly address the
sector needs and post-conflict realities.

53.      Relevance of Implementation. The immediate availability of project funds after
each Bank re-engagement led to the fast resumption of implementation and supports a
higher relevance for overall project implementation. The relevance of phase one project
implementation is judged to be modest. This is mainly based on the exogenous factors
that impacted implementation such as: (i) civil war; (ii) country arrears; and (iii)
introduction of the SIGFIP system that had a negative impact on project disbursements. It
should be noted that despite the various exogenous factors, the PIU did continue to
implement some project activities with counterpart funds and attempted to meet the
supervision and reporting obligations when the country situation permitted such activities.
Phase two project implementation relevance is judged to be substantial. Although there
was a slow start to the implementation of phase two, the rating is based on the fact that:
(i) all project activities were implemented; (ii) 99.2 percent of funds were disbursed; (iii)
BEP monitored project safeguards; and (iv) MEN improved capacity to deliver education
services as well as their ability to monitor and evaluation the education system with the
use of SPASS.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

54.     Prior to restructuring, data related to the original PDO indicators were being
collected and used for measuring progress toward achievement of the project’s objectives.
However, progress toward achievement of the PDO was mixed, varying between
satisfactory and unsatisfactory depending on the political situation, and the Bank and
government’s access to information to measure progress. Based on this, the achievement
of the PDO prior to restructuring is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

55.     After restructuring of the project, four new outcome indicators were introduced to
measure progress toward achievement of the PDO. This section evaluates the outcomes
against the results framework developed during the 2008 restructuring and other
indicators of system performance. The overall rating for the project post-restructuring is
rated moderately satisfactory.

56.     Improved access and retention was to be measured by an increase in GER in
primary schools, increase in gross enrollment rate in first grade and increase in the
retention rate. The enrollment rate in primary schools increased from 74 percent in 2008
to 83.6 percent in 2011/12 exceeding the project target. The gross enrollment rate in first
grade increased from 71 percent in 2008 to 76.4 percent, missing the target of 80 percent.
Although the project missed the target by 3.6 percent, the trend is positive and it is a



                                            16
substantial increase considering that the 2010 civil conflict closed schools and prevented
children from attending. During the implementation period, repetition rates for Grades 1
– 5 fell from 22 percent in 2008 to 16.6 percent in 2011/12 missing the target of 14
percent. Again, while the target was missed by 2.6 percent, a decrease of 5.4 percent in a
post-conflict environment is a substantial achievement.

57.     The intermediate indicators used to measure improved access were: (i) additional
primary school classrooms built or rehabilitated and (ii) construction of lower secondary
schools. The project constructed 300 primary school classrooms, which met the project
target. The project constructed 9 lower secondary schools (or collèges) surpassing the
target of 8 and helped finance the rehabilitation of an additional lower secondary school.
These lower secondary schools were mainly in rural and semi-rural areas which had been
under “Forces Nouvelles? control. Their locations were chosen on the basis of school
mapping data and responded to the urgent need for investment in lower secondary school
places. There was also an independent technical audit of the construction to determine the
quality of schools built. The audit concluded that the project built and equipped 300
primary schools and 9 colleges. The audit highlighted the difficult conditions of the
country because of the various crises that the country experienced. The audit also
determined that the quality of the construction was good. In addition, it showed that
communities constructed the schools and that the activity was important for bring
communities back together around a common purpose of improving education within
their communities.

58.     Providing quality school inputs to guarantee teaching and learning in
classrooms was measured, at the PDO level, by increased primary school completion
rates. During implementation of the restructured project, the primary completion rate
increased from 46 percent in 2008 to 64.2 percent in 2011/12, surpassing the project
target of 50 percent. This is a substantial achievement.

59.    The following intermediate indicator results were recorded: (i) textbooks
purchased, delivered and in use in the classroom based on an implementation audit
conducted by the MEN were 6,791,971, exceeding the target of 6,326,215; (ii) pre-
service teachers trained to minimum qualifications and certification requirements at the
primary level were 9,768 and at the secondary level 3,897, far exceeding the target of
7,276; (iii) in-service primary and lower secondary school teachers trained were 9,790
meeting the target; and (iv) textbook-pupil ratio in primary school was achieved with a
primary ratio of 1:3 in grades 1-3, and 1:5 in grades 4-6, which was also related to the
HIPC target.

60.     The project also conducted a validation exercise that confirmed the delivery of
textbooks and did a review of the competency-based curriculum that was being taught in
the teacher training institutions. The MEN used the findings of the assessment to make
modifications to the curriculum to better align it with the needs of students.

61.  With regard to the textbooks, school equipment and teacher training supported by
PASEF, the 2009 Country Status Report (CSR) found that 58 - 67 percent of the



                                           17
differences in results between students were related to what happens inside the school.
The report also found that, all things being equal, the grade 6 primary exam success rate
was higher for students who had reading and mathematics textbooks than the students in
schools without such books. The report also found that having two or more students share
a mathematics book 3 significantly and negatively impacted their ability to learn. Analysis
show that having a reading textbook per student could increase a student’s success rate by
0.5 percentage points and 1.5 percentage points in the case of mathematics textbooks. In
terms of furniture, a 2009 PASEC analysis showed that only 51.89 percent of students in
grade 2 and 63.07 percent of students in the grade 5 shared a desk with only one other
student. The model results showed a significant and negative relationship between the
number of students per desk (if greater than or equal to three) and student learning, which
means that making desks available in all schools would increase the success rate of final
exam students.

62.    Furthermore, the CSR found that the presence of a canteen, electricity and latrines
had a positive impact on school results in national examinations, keeping all other things
equal. Students in grade 2 located in well-equipped schools would benefit from a better
learning environment, and were more likely to do better in school. The study further
showed that the success rate during the final exam improved by 0.33 points if schools had
canteens, 1.07 points if the school had electricity and 1.12 points if latrines were
available.

63.    The pre-service teacher training was strengthened by the re-opening of 14
CAFOPs, including the rehabilitation of two CAFOPs, and the provision of pedagogical
materials for staff and students, which met the project target. The project also introduced
a new primary school curriculum and teachers were trained in the new curriculum,
meeting the project target. A learning assessment for grades 2, 3 and 5 was also carried
out with support of the project, which established baselines and met the project target.
The MEN will conduct another assessment in SY2012/13. The ICR datasheet and Annex
2 provide additional information on the project achievements.

3.3 Efficiency

64.     Implementation efficiency related to keeping the project suspended and “on the
books?, was high compared to closing it and then preparing an emergency project. This
implementation efficiency is evident when looking at three comparisons. These
comparisons are: (i) it took less than one month in the case of all three suspensions to re-
engage and resume project implementation in support of education service delivery. This
should be compared to the average preparation time of 14 months for an investment
project in Africa (source: AFTOS Africa Dashboard January 2013). As indicated in the
2011 World Development Report “Conflict, Security and Development?, one of the four
key principles required to avoid re-emergence of conflict is “early results to build citizen
confidence and create momentum for longer term institutional transformation?.
Therefore, the time-efficiency of extending this project several times is best practice,


3
    In grade 5, nearly 22 percent of students shared a mathematics textbook, against 12.5 percent in grade 2.


                                                             18
since it enabled the Bank to quickly support the opening of schools across the country
and, thus, show a benefit of peace; (ii) the supervision costs, during suspension in FY05-
08, totaled US$150,000, which should be compared to the average project preparation
cost of an investment project in Africa of US$611,000 (source: AFTOS Africa
Dashboard January 2013); and (iii) the continuation of the project implied a continuation
of project capacity (personnel, structures and procedures), which both led to higher
resilience of education service delivery during the crises –as described above the BEP
continued to support primary education delivery during the crisis—and to a fast
resumption of service delivery and aid flows after conflict.

65.     The efficiency gains from the project were impacted by the political instability
that prevailed during the life of the project. Given the difficult environment the efficiency
gains are judged to be substantial because the project was able to: (i) provide textbooks
in a cost effective manner, (ii) construct and equip 300 classrooms at a reasonable cost
given the political context, and (iii) successfully improve the capacity of MEN. The
analysis shows that there is no significant gain to income for a primary school education.
The low marginal benefit of obtaining a primary education, when compared to receiving
no education, seems appropriate. This is due to the post-conflict nature of the country
where there is an oversupply of primary school graduates and limited job opportunities
due to the slow economic growth and the closing of enterprises during the conflict. It is
estimated that the number of enterprises affected range from 30 to 50 percent according
to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Côte d’Ivoire (CCICI). An estimated 70-80
percent of formal sector employees were also laid off in March 2011. However, the wage
income premiums are none the less substantial for TVET and higher education graduates.

66.     The efficiency analysis for acquisition of textbooks shows a high cost-efficiency
compared to the original projected unit cost for textbooks and that costs are in line with
those recently realized in projects in Burundi and Niger. Cost-efficiency of the
construction of 300 new classrooms and nine lower secondary schools is low compared
to the original projected unit costs. The projected cost estimates are based on the original
project component from 1998, and the difference in projected and realized costs may thus
be explained by the limited capacity to construct schools that prevailed after the conflict.
An overall comparison with other projects suggests that the construction costs are in the
high range, but without being excessively high. However, when limiting the cost
comparison to projects undertaken in Côte d’Ivoire, cost-efficiency of the project shows
to be relatively high. This indicates a general higher level of construction prices in Côte
d’Ivoire, which may be due to the limited construction capacity prevailing from the
conflict. Thus evaluated in this context, the project has provided an efficient use of funds
with respect to construction.

67.     The direct economic effect of the increased access to primary and lower
secondary education is quantified based on expected income-gain for those graduating.
Low income and limited dispersion in wages for the lower education levels reduce the
direct economic benefit from the increase in primary and secondary education. In
combination with high unit cost for students in primary and secondary education this
leads to a negative value of return from investment, when benefits are solely measured by



                                             19
the average wage-gain. However, there exist a series of other benefits from the expansion
of basic education, as it increases the foundation of people suitable for higher education
and provides important social benefits. These benefits are however difficult to quantify in
monetary terms.

68.     The establishment of a task force under MEN with donor support and PASEF
financing has resulted in economic gains through support for development of ministerial
strategies, which amongst others have attracted a Euro 9.28 million TVET project
financed through the French Development Agency. The project’s overall reinforcement
of the strategic and operational capacity of the ministries is particularly important in a
post-conflict context, where the ability of a project to immediately intervene after a
conflict can help restore confidence in the state and support economic recovery.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

69.     An overall outcome rating of the project is moderately satisfactory and is
reflected by the two contrasting periods of project implementation. Phase one shows that
the project design was appropriate but implementation was slow and erratic. Furthermore,
efficacy and efficiency were difficult to measure due to all the exogenous factors that
impacted project implementation. The restructured project design, PDO and
implementation were relevant, achievement of the PDO based on analysis of the PDO
indicators is substantial, and efficiency of the project related to the restructured period is
judged to be substantial. These judgments differ from the last two project ISRs because at
the time the ISRs were submitted several key factors for rating the project MS were not
clear. These were: (i) key indicator data was still being gathered and therefore, the data
was only preliminary; (ii) technical assistance provided for financial management and
procurement activities had just begun to improve the overall reporting situation; (iii) the
project efficiency analysis that helps substantiate the overall rating was only done for the
ICR; and (iv) final disbursement information was not yet available. When the ICR was
written, the outstanding information was available and based on this, the overall project
outcome is judged to be moderately satisfactory. Annexes 2 and 3 provide additional
achievements related to the project’s outcomes and efficiency gains.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

70.      The restructured project helped finance the establishment of the “Task Force?,
which is an inter-ministerial body and has been in charge of producing the following
analytical pieces: (i) the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework; (ii) an overall sector
policy, which provides a comprehensive vision for basic and higher education, the TVET
sector, as well as the literacy and pre-school sub-sectors; and (iii) the letter of sectoral
policy and the ten-year macro-financial framework that supports it. The Task Force, in
collaboration with regional and local education authorities and NGOs, supported the
UNICEF-led “Education Cluster 4 ? in preparing a country-wide assessment of the
situation of schools after the 2011 crisis to identify the most urgent needs. This
assessment provided information for the preparation of the new GPE project. Finally, the
Task Force helped prepare the 2011 Country Status Report, which provided the first in-
depth analysis of the education sector in six years. The proven capacity of this inter-
ministerial body also encouraged other donors to use it to help coordinate their
investments in the education sector: currently, investments from Japan and Germany are
being channeled through the Task Force. In addition, the Agence Française de
Développement – AFD (French Development Agency) is using the Task Force to help
coordinate its’ three interventions, which cover general education, higher education as
well as TVET. The Task Force also prepared the GPE application in 2011, which led to
the development of a US$41.4 million basic education project, managed and
implemented by the MEN through the Task Force. Finally, the Task Force plays an
advisory role to all three education ministers, thereby strengthening their collaboration
and coordination. PASEF has therefore directly contributed to strengthening the
institutional capacity of the education sector and changed the way the three educational
ministries operate.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

71.     The risks identified during the original project preparation were mostly
appropriate: two were rated high and three were moderate with an overall rating of
moderate. During the 2008 restructuring, the original risks were still deemed appropriate
but, at that time, the team placed greater emphasis on the limited capacity within the

MEN given the post-conflict, fragile state status of the country. The identified risks
related to the education sector were appropriate for both the pre- and post-restructuring
periods as were the mitigation measures. As discussed previously, there were capacity
constraints within the MEN that led to implementation challenges, However, the MEN,
working with the Bank task team, was able to overcome the capacity issues especially at
the BEP-level by contracting the appropriate TA to support them with project
implementation. In addition, the strong capacity of the Task Force, with the intra-
ministerial coordination responsibility, will continue to play a key role and will help
mitigate the MEN risks of coordination, collaboration and capacity. The MEN and Task
Force continue to receive training related to financial management and procurement for
the two on-going Bank-supported projects, which is helping to improve MEN capacity in
these areas. In retrospect, it would have been appropriate to indicate country risks
associated with the project. However, this was not common practice within the Bank in
1998 when the project was being prepared.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

72.     During the original preparation of the project, the Bank team included the
appropriate technical specialists to develop the project. The Bank team actively engaged
the government in the preparation of the project through consultations and roundtable
discussions on education and training. The preparation team also aligned the project with
the CAS and HIPC report, and used them to identify key indicators and completion
targets. The project preparation team ensured that the project focused on the education of
girls by including explicit interventions in each component. It also aligned the operation
with the government’s “National Education and Training Development Plan - NETDP?.
The 2008 project restructuring was highly relevant to the post-conflict status of Côte
d’Ivoire. The Bank and Government of Côte d’Ivoire refocused the project resources on
basic education and simplified the project design to accommodate the capacity
constraints that were exhibited within the MEN in the period following the conflict. The
Bank also moved quickly to restructure the project so that the needed resources could be
used by the MEN to restart the education system.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

73.     The project team was actively engaged in supporting the government in its’
efforts to implement the project. An education economist and procurement-accredited
operations staff were part of the Abidjan-based project team during phase 1 of project
implementation, which facilitated the dialogue with the government. However, despite
the efforts of the BEP and the Bank team, the volatile political situation impeded




                                           22
implementation progress. The Bank team kept the dialogue open with the government
and the BEP, even during the 2004 - 2008 suspension 5, which in retrospect was important
for the project’s early accomplishments: the trust and level of engagement displayed by
the Bank’s team was repeatedly mentioned by the government as having played a major
role in its willingness to proceed with the operation and dialogue with the Bank. Phase
two--post-restructuring, the Bank’s decision to base the TTL, financial management and
procurement specialists in the field, proved instrumental in supporting the
implementation of the restructured project and reaching 99.2 percent disbursements by
project closure. Finally, the fact that Bank management allowed the project to stay active
and remain engaged helped provide Côte d’Ivoire with much needed resources every time
the country emerged from a conflict.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

74.    Based on these findings, the ICR team rates the overall Bank performance as
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     Overall government performance has been uneven over the life of the project. The
political turmoil and civil conflict had an ongoing negative impact on the project. The
government fell into arrears four times and the civil conflict caused the overall Bank
portfolio to be suspended for four years, all of which had a negative effect on project
implementation and funding for the project activities. Prior to restructuring, the
government was also reluctant to lift the monopoly on the production of primary school
textbooks as well as to support schools in the North because they were not under central
government control. These issues led to delays in implementing textbook production and
classroom construction. The frequent turn-over of staff in key positions following
changes in the government were a recurrent theme throughout the life of the project and,
at times contributed to the slow implementation. However, the government remained
accessible and open to dialogue even during the 2004 - 2008 suspension and, to the extent
possible, continued to implement some project activities with counterpart funds,
including the development and production of 22 textbook titles for grades 3-4. This
showed, to the extent possible, a level of government commitment to the continued
implementation of the project. Based on this, the phase one of implementation is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

76.   Post-restructuring, the government showed considerable commitment to
improving the project’s performance. It agreed to implement a number of

  The Bank team utilized the various options that were available to keep following project implementation such as
reversed missions and meetings via videoconferencing.

recommendations proposed by the Bank, such as: (i) conducting post-conflict needs
assessments; (ii) helping prepare a new Country Status Report; (iii) developing a
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework; and (iv) conducting learning assessments for
Grades 2, 3 and 5. These activities helped the government focus support where it was
most critical and ensured the relevance of interventions, especially given the changes in
the political and socio-economic landscape of the country. Furthermore, having carried
out the previously-mentioned analytical pieces of work, the government was able to
secure funds from the GPE and prepare a new Basic Education project that is currently
being implemented. Based on this the post-restructuring rating is satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.      The BEP was the implementing unit both pre- and post-restructuring. The BEP
was responsible for the early implementation progress and they continued to try and
implement the project with counterpart funds even when the government went into
arrears. In addition, the BEP was responsible for overseeing all of phase two
implementation when the project disbursed 89.6 percent of the project funds. It should be
noted, that the BEP exhibited capacity limitations, particularly related to Bank
procurement and financial management activities. The BEP had difficulty: (i) processing
procurement documents; (ii) cancelling non-preforming contracts for civil works
activities; (iii) ensuring the distribution textbooks; (iv) providing up-to-date financial
status reports; and (v) preparing and submitting withdrawal applications. These issues led
the Bank to downgrade procurement and financial management. Again, in a post-conflict
environment, these capacity limitations are to be expected, and the Bank recognizing
these issues, worked with the BEP and the MEN to identify appropriate technical
assistance to provide the needed support and help resolve the problems which led to the
successful completion of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

78.     The overall rating for Borrower performance is Moderately Satisfactory. This
overall rating is based on the fact that the post-restructuring of the project period is
judged to be moderately satisfactory with 89.6 percent of the project disbursed during
phase two of project implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

79.    Lesson 1. Approved projects should not be closed due to suspensions. The
PASEF project played a key role in providing needed resources for the education sector
each time Côte d’Ivoire emerged from civil unrest. Emergency projects are an option but
take time to prepare unlike an existing project such as the PASEF, where money was
immediately available each time the Bank re-engaged. This proved invaluable for getting
teachers and children back in school quickly after each crisis.

80.    Lesson 2. Government ownership is essential for ensuring implementation
quality and progress. Government’s decision to establish an inter-ministerial body to


                                           24
help it implement not only the restructured project, but also provide a better oversight of
activities and challenges in the sector as a whole. The government was committed to
allow the task force help strengthen coordination and collaboration between ministries,
the donor community and provided advice to MEN on the implementation of the PASEF
project. This government ownership ensured the completion of all project activities.

81.    Lesson 3. Oversight bodies with the overall picture of system play an
invaluable role in advising sub-sector ministries. The task force established under the
PASEF was responsible for: (i) helping prepare the 2011 Country Status Report, (ii)
preparing the overall sector policy, (iii) ensuring coordination of donor activities, (iv)
preparing the 2011 GPE application; and (v) advising all three education ministries. The
task force will remain the oversight body for the education sector, which has proven
instrumental in setting out the policy framework for the education sector.

82.     Lesson 4. Task team leaders based in post-conflict fragile state countries is
essential for ensuring the implementation of Bank-supported projects. The Bank
place the task team leader in Côte d’Ivoire shortly after the 2008 restructuring. The
presence of the TTL in country provide invaluable for daily support and monitoring of
project implementation. Experience with other Bank-supported project in post-conflict
countries has shown that have the TTL in-country is critical for ensuring timely project
implementation.

83.     Lesson 5. Project implementation, in a post-conflict environment, may
benefit from having a PIU outside the government structure. The benefit of having
the BEP as a semi-autonomous unit outside the MEN structure was important for
maintaining continuity and staffing that were committed to the project. It was also
important because: (i) the BEP remained operational because the key staff were not MEN
staff thereby, subject to political staffing changes; (ii) project implementation continued,
albeit limited, even during the 2004 - 2008 suspension; and (iii) BEP staff could be
augmented by easily hiring consultants to provide support. Therefore, in a post-conflict
fragile state situation, consideration should be given to establishing a semi-autonomous
PIU with the plan of integrating future PIUs into the normal structure of the responsible
ministry.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Improving Learning at the Primary and Secondary Levels

84.     Original component activities: This component aimed at strengthening the role of
the school in improving teaching and learning, both at the primary and secondary levels.
It was to support changes in the curriculum to increase the relevance of education. It also
aimed at increasing the availability of textbooks and shifting textbook publishing to the
private sector. The original component included five sub-components: (i) revision of
curriculum content and implementation; (ii) school-based pre-service and in-service
teacher training; (ii) applied research and pedagogical innovations; (iv) provision of
textbooks in the targeted areas; and (v) a student learning evaluation system. Each sub-
component was designed with particular attention to girls' education.

85.     Impact on girls: (i) a process was to be put in place to systematically review both
program content and coverage in order to eliminate gender stereotypes and gender
imbalance; (ii) pre-service and in-service training were to be revised to raise awareness
among teachers of issues affecting girls' participation in schooling; (iii) longitudinal
studies were to be undertaken in some écoles and collèges temoins on girls' participation
in the classroom; (iv) in the targeted areas, access to textbooks was to be equal for boys
and girls; and (v) results of the student evaluations would be disaggregated in such a way
as to better understand different learning patterns between boys and girls.

86.     Progress between 1998 and 2004. The project made significant progress in terms
of introducing revisions to the curriculum through the development of a competency-
based curriculum. By 2004, the project had undertaken the envisaged study tour to
Senegal, trained 240 school inspectors and teacher trainers in the new competency-based
teaching approach and developed curricula for Grades 1 – 10. The project also prepared a
preliminary “minimum exit profile? for students graduating from elementary and lower
secondary schools (Grades 6 and 10 respectively). No significant progress was made in
terms of school-based pre- and in-service teacher training: the project had prepared
draft legal texts that would bring about pre- and in-service teacher training reforms.
However, it is unclear whether the government succeeded in lowering the training period
at CAFOPs from three to two years prior to the 2004 suspension 9 . Draft terms of
reference had been prepared in 2000 to help identify the real number of hours that
teachers actually taught in classrooms; however, no follow-up action took place. In terms
of applied research and pedagogical innovation, study tours to Guinea and Senegal by
a consultant led to the development of a draft operations manual for the planned Ecoles
témoins, followed by training of regional coordinators and an analysis/evaluation of
existing model schools (étude diagnostique des écoles témoins). Information and
sensitization campaigns about these schools were carried out and technological
equipment and connectivity were provided. However, the project was not able to clarify



9
    Currently, the CAFOP training period is two years.




                                                         28
and define the roles and responsibilities of the institutional structure. The project was able
to provide approximately 1.16 million textbooks by January 2000, covering 62 sous-
préfectures, although certain schools did not receive the full set of textbooks needed.
During that period, the government instituted the FCFA 250 rental fee for textbooks and
financed the development and production of grades 3 and 4 between 2004 and 2008.
Market liberalization efforts made little progress. In January 2000, government had
missed the opportunity to cancel monopoly contracts with the two publishers “CEDA?
and “NEI?. The government’s agreement to cancel the contracts at the end of their term
would have opened the printing of the “Etat et Développement? collection for
competitive bidding. Despite the Bank’s insistence on the importance, this issue was only
partially resolved in 2002 (the contracts were cancelled but CEDA and NEI only released
a portion of the copyrights). The Student learning evaluation sub-component was able
to finance study tours, help identify members of the student evaluation committee for
both the primary and secondary levels, and procure technological equipment.

87.      Post-restructuring. The restructured project eliminated many of the original
activities, including the particular focus on girls. This was done because of the need to
focus entirely on rehabilitating the education system which was destroyed during the civil
conflict. The component continued to support the overall objectives but adjusted the sub-
component descriptions as follows: (i) developing, printing, and distributing textbooks
and teachers’ manuals to achieve a ratio of three textbooks per student in grades 1-3 and
five in grades 4-6, and improving the existing textbook rental scheme in primary schools;
(ii) finalizing the primary education’s curriculum reform; and (iii) strengthening the
national student evaluation system based on the new competency-based approach and
providing related training to teachers and other pedagogical supervision. However, the
restructured project also put a particular focus on the post-conflict needs of the country
and as such, included three new activities: (i) rehabilitating and re-equipping teacher
training centers (CAFOP) and training teacher-trainers in the competency-based
approach, including the provision of teaching and learning materials; (ii) supporting the
National Literacy Support Fund (FNAA) for 3,000 people (75 percent women) )in the
zones under Forces Nouvelles control; and (iii) purchasing, and delivering food to 400
primary schools through the World Food Program.

88.     Indicators used to measure progress were: (i) pre-service teacher training
strengthened; (ii) literacy services expanded in the zones CNO 10 ; (iii) textbooks
purchased; (iv) target of textbook-pupil ratio in primary achieved; (v) curriculum reform
in primary completed and implemented; (vi) pre-service teachers trained to minimum
qualifications and certification requirements; (vii) in-service teachers trained; and (viii)
assessment of student achievement outcomes carried out.

89.   Progress between 2008 and 2012. Most activities under this component were
completed. The project supported pre-service teacher training by equipping the existing
14 CAFOPs with teaching and learning equipment needed to resume operations, thereby

meeting the target. The project also financed the rehabilitation of 2 11 CAFOPs, thereby
meeting the target established during the 2011 restructuring. The project supported
literacy training for 120 organizers from three NGOs, benefitting 3,000 adults (of which
75 percent women) and providing them with the learning kits, thereby meeting the project
target. To facilitate supervision activities, eight motorcycles were purchased and provided
to supervisors at the local level. Textbook acquisition surpassed the target of 6,326,215,
with the purchase of 6,791,971 primary textbooks. In addition, the government financed
textbooks with its own resources during the 2004-2008 suspension period, increasing the
total number of textbooks acquired to approximately 9.9 million over the life of the
project. The combined number of textbooks led to a student: textbook ratio of 1:3 in
Grades 1-3 and 1:5 in Grades 4-6 meeting the project target. This textbook ratio also met
the HIPC target. The government finalized its curriculum reform, having introduced the
“competency-based? approach and trained a total of 2,400 teachers and teacher-trainers in
its application. In-service teacher training supported the upgrading of approximately
7,390 12 teachers. The number of pre-service teachers trained at the primary level
increased by 9,768 between 2008/09 – 2011/12, exceeding the end target of 7,276. At the
secondary level, the government trained 3,897 additional teachers since the start of the
2008/09 academic year, with an additional 3,070 enrolled in 2012.

90.     The government also implemented the PASEC 13 assessment for Grades 2 and 5 as
well as a Grade 3 assessment. These assessments were important for establishing the
baseline for the next round of assessments scheduled for the 2012/13 school year. The
project was not able to support the secondary school assessment as originally envisioned.
This was in large part due to the 2011 crisis that caused delays in the development of the
assessment. After the 2011 crisis, the government used the resources allocated for the
assessment to conduct a technical audit of the CAFOPs. The audit was designed to assess
the competency-based curriculum that the CAFOPs were using for training teachers
because the teachers were not showing the desired qualifications upon completion of their
training programs. The findings from the audit were used extensively in the design of the
teacher training components of the new GPE-supported project, which is now begin
implemented. The government also established a new department (Service de Veille et de
Suivi des Programmes), under the direct supervision of the ministry cabinet to ensure a
better coordination of student assessment administration and supervision.

91.     Lastly, the project, provided food supplies to 400 canteens between 2008/09 and
2009/10 to all the regions identified in 2008, plus one additional region (Bouaflé). The
decision was made during the 2011 restructuring to reallocate project resources,
originally allocated for rehabilitation of two CAFOPs, to the canteens because the World
Food Program’s storage facilities had been pillaged. The project helped to re-stock the
storage facilities in an effort to avoid a food crisis.


11
   The restructured project intended to rehabilitate 4 CAFOP. However, following the 2011 crisis, it was decided to use
funds for 2 CAFOP to finance the most pressing post-crisis needs such as additional student desks and canteen supplies.
12
   The indicator tracking in-service teacher training was not part of the restructured results framework but was added to
retro-fit the project in compliance with Africa Core Indicator.

92.    These are substantial achievements considering the post-conflict status of the
country and the total years of political turmoil.

Component 2: Expanding Access to Primary Schools and Collèges

93.     The original component activities included: (i) school construction and
renovation; and (ii) infrastructure maintenance/support to improve the patrimoine
scolaire. Indicators used to measure progress towards these components included: (i)
construction of primary classrooms; (ii) construction of eight lower secondary schools;
(iii) 30 percent of classrooms constructed should be below standard construction unit
costs (low-cost construction); and (iv) increased private sector and community
involvement in school maintenance.

94.     Impact on girls: Collèges de petite échelle are one partial solution to the
financial and social problems faced by students, including security concerns for girls.

95.    Progress between 1998 and 2004. The project’s initial target was the
construction and equipment of 900 classrooms, rehabilitation and equipment of 300
classrooms and construction of eight small lower secondary schools. Although contracts
had been issued for the construction for the first 300 classrooms and eight colleges, little
progress was made during this period. This was mainly due to procurement delays,
capacity constraints of the selected construction companies and continued civil strife.
Consequently, no activities related to infrastructure were financed.

96.    Post-restructuring. The restructured component eliminated most of the original
project activities but retained the construction of primary classrooms and lower
secondary schools. However, the scope of the construction was reduced to constructing
and equipping 300 primary classrooms and 8 lower secondary schools. This was done in
recognition of the post-conflict status of Côte d’Ivoire and the limited capacity to
construct schools.

97.      Intermediate indicators used to track progress were: (i) number of additional
classrooms built; (ii) construction of lower secondary schools; and (iii) percentage of
girls to boys in primary and secondary education.

98.     The project constructed and equipped 300 classrooms by project closing thereby
meeting the project target. The project surpassed the number of lower secondary schools
to be constructed (9 instead of 8) and helped finance the rehabilitation of an additional
lower secondary school. The restructured project focused on constructing lower
secondary schools mainly in rural and semi-rural areas which had been under “Forces
Nouvelles? control. Their locations were chosen on the basis of school mapping data and
responded to the urgent need for investment in lower secondary school places. These
schools helped: (i) relieve the transition pressure from CM2 to lower secondary; (ii)
provided a safe environment for girls in the case of the school in Man; and (iii) eased
overcrowding of the existing Bouaké lower secondary school. The project chose to build
slightly smaller schools to help maximize catchment areas within a limited budget.

99.    The project also exceeded the number of student desks to be procured, acquiring
30,870 compared to the original target of 25,000 14 . In addition to student desks, the
project equipped 93 schools with teacher’s desks and chairs, as well as bookcases.
Although the percentage of girls to boys in primary school missed the target of 48 percent
by 3 points, the 40 percent target in secondary school was met.

100. The project provided support for strengthening school management at the local
level by training 26 of local School Management Committee (COGES) coordinators in
2010 and 40 COGES members by 2011. The PASEF financed a technical audit of 3,000
COGES to help identify reasons for their persistent inefficient functioning. The audit
provided a good analysis of the institutional and financial management weaknesses
within the COGESs. These lessons were used to develop COGES activities as part of the
new GPE project.

   The increase in student desks was decided during the 2011 restructuring to respond to the shortage of student desks
following the crisis as many desks were used as fire wood. The total number of student desks acquired over the life of
the project, including those for the 300 new classrooms reached 38,351.

Component 3: Developing Institutional Capacity and Component 4: Sector
coordination and strategic planning

101.   Original components 3 and 4 were combined as part of the 2008 restructuring.

102. Component 3 – Developing Institutional Capacity: This component was to
support the improvement and the strengthening of the planning, monitoring and
evaluation capacities of the Ministry of National Education (MEN) at all levels, including
strategic resource planning for girls' education and the health of school children. To this
end, five sub-components were to provide the necessary inputs for: (a) decentralization;
(b) strategic planning and management; (c) improved resource management; (d) the
creation of a girls' education promotion unit (CPEF); and (e) school health and nutrition.

103. Indicators selected to monitor progress were: (i) hiring decisions made at the local
level; (ii) training program for financial personnel at prefecture/inspectorate level; (iii)
school record systems piloted; (iv) basic training for all DRENs completed; and (v)
analytical framework and gender strategy developed and utilized.

104. Component 4 - Sector Coordination and strategic planning: This component
aimed at ensuring better coordination of the education sector as a whole, by increasing
relevance and external efficiency. It included three sub-components: (a) strategic
planning and management of higher education; (b) strategic planning and management of
vocational and professional training; and (c) sector coordination and dialogue.

105. Indicators selected to monitor progress were: (i) the share of primary budget
expenditures to be allocated for the education sector to increase; (ii) an amount
equivalent to at least US$1,500,000 to be earmarked for the purchase of textbooks and
pedagogical guides for primary school education; (iii) development plans for each
university prepared; (iv) professional training program piloted; (v) development plans
(public/private sectors) prepared for selected training institutions; (vi) IEC designed and
implemented agenda; and (vii) agenda for private sector reform agreed.

106. Progress between 1998 and 2004. Little progress was made related to
developing institutional capacity and sector coordination after the project effectiveness in
1998. However, during this period, the project: (i) hired1,371 teachers (instituteurs
adjoints), (ii) helped complete the Country Status Report, (iii) installed an information
system at the University of Cocody, and (iv) produced school statistics for the 1998/99 –
2000/01 academic years. The project also supported the start of a dialogue about
HIV/AIDS within schools. However, the other activities within these two components
were not carried out. This was due to the fact that: (i) a new financial system was
introduced that was cumbersome in its approval process; (ii) the country went into arrears
several times which slowed implementation; (iii) the country was experiencing armed
unrest making coordination and collaboration between government entities and regions
very difficult and (iv) the central government would not support schooling in regions not
under its control.

107. Post-restructuring. Component 3: Developing institutional capacity
(combined component). Again, this component eliminated most activities of the original
components 3 and 4. However, there was a need to support and build capacity for each of
the three Ministries of Education, but with a larger focus both financially and technically
on the MEN. This restructured component was to reinforce the strategic and operational
capacity of the Ministry through: (i) setting up and staffing of a four person strategic
executive unit (the “Task Force?), located in the minister’s cabinet; (ii) development and
installation of an education and management information system; (iii) strengthening of
human resources in charge of education statistics, human resource management, school
mapping, elaboration of an education Country Status Report and support for the
Education For All-Fast Track Initiative endorsement process; and (iv) re-equipping of
central and decentralized (MEN structures. Second, in both the Ministry of Technical
Education and Vocational Training (METFP), and the Ministry of Higher Education and
Scientific Research (MESRS), support was to be provided for: (i) the development and
installation of an Education and Management Information System - EMIS; (ii) human
capacity development in the areas of statistics, human resource management PER/EPTS;
(iii) studies and consultations for the elaboration of national strategies in the technical
and vocational training sector and higher education; and (iv) small provision of vehicles
and equipment for planning divisions and a few decentralized structures in both education
ministries.

108. Indicators to measure the restructured component included: (i) strategic and
operational capacity of the MEN reinforced; (ii) strategic and operational capacity of the
MESRS reinforced; (iii) strategic and operational capacity of the METFP reinforced; and
(iv) system for learning assessment at the primary level.

109. The project supported the three ministries (both at the central as well as
deconcentrated levels) through the procurement of critical office equipment and 212
vehicles needed to resume operations, especially following the 2011 crisis. Based on the
evidence listed below, the ICR team judges that the project did reinforce the strategic and
operational capacity of all three ministries and has therefore met the targets. Significant
milestones achieved include:

       •    MEN: In 2009, the Ministry established a task force 15 under its cabinet, which
            developed the new Education Sector Strategy and successfully prepared the
            country application for the new GPE operation. The project, through the Task
            Force, also supported the completion of the 2011 Country Status Reports, re-
            printing the statistical yearbooks for the 2005/06 - 2008/09 academic years, and
            collecting and analyzing the 2010/2011 school data. Furthermore, the project
            provided technical assistance for the Task Force to develop the medium-term
            expenditure framework for basic education, TVET and higher education. This
            framework provides information on the three years of expenditures for each sub-
            sector. In addition, the activity related to the carte scolaire (school mapping) was


15
     The task force included a coordinator, an M&E specialist, an education policy specialist and an economist.


                                                            34
       also completed, which included training both at the central and deconcentrated
       levels, and will be fully integrated within the MEN. Although a fully-fledged
       EMIS was not developed, the MEN has established an education statistics
       production system called SPASS – Système de Production Annuelle des
       Statistiques Scolaires. This system, which will be integrated into the EMIS
       system being developed as part of the new GPE project, became operational in
       2010/11, and has been used by the MEN to produce education statistics and final
       project reports. The regional education offices (DRENs) also received IT
       equipment and training to facilitate the collection of data for the SPASS.

   •   MESRS and METFP: The project supported the two ministries to develop their
       strategies as a part of the overall national education strategy as well as the re-
       printing of MESRS’ 2006/07 statistical yearbooks. The project also financed
       management training for key staff within the ministries and the procurement of
       vehicles and equipment for the planning divisions and some DRENs to facilitate
       supervision of project activities. Within the METFP, seven studies were carried
       out to support the METFP strategy of which the project financed two: (i) public
       private partnerships (PPPs); and (ii) development of internship programs and the
       dissemination seminars related to the studies. These studies, along with the other
       studies, are being used by the METFP to develop internship programs and
       establish PPPs through the new Euro 9.28 million AFD-financed project.
       Furthermore, the project supported METFP re-print is 2008 and 2009 data
       collection questionnaire, trained staff and helped METFP’s regional offices in
       data collection. The project also financed a diagnostic study of the higher
       education system. The results have been used to further the Bank’s dialog with
       government on higher education reform. However, the project was not able to
       develop a fully integrated EMIS system for the MESRS or METFP due to the fact
       that the 2011 crisis made meaningful data collection not feasible. However,
       MESRS and METFP do have systems in place to collect data and which are used
       to produce statistical reports.

110. Component 4: Project Management and Coordination. This component was to
support the project implementation unit (BEP) and its regional branches: Project
management of civil works would be organized both through a central service based in
Abidjan and its antennes regionales (regional branches) within the ten regional
directorates. Costs have been based on work estimates to fulfill the Government's annual
construction program of approximately 1,000 classrooms.

111. Progress between 1998 and 2004. Overall, the BEP was viewed as providing
adequate support to help implement the project and audits were unqualified for almost
every year with the exception of the 1999 audit. The office had been strengthened with
additional fiduciary staff, equipment and clarified roles, responsibilities and internal
procedures. However, the government’s financial management system (SIGFIP) was
repeatedly cited as being the main reason for not only affecting overall project
implementation progress but also good functioning of the BEP.




                                           35
112. Post-restructuring. Component 4: Project management (original
component). This component aimed at financing operating costs of the BEP. The project
execution unit was responsible for fiduciary management, civil works management,
programming and monitoring of project activities, and production of execution and audit
reports. Expenditures under this component included: (i) the purchase of new equipment;
(ii) operating costs; (iii) consultant services; (iv) studies; and (v) training.




                                          36
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

113. Project implementation has been deeply affected by the political volatility in Côte
d’Ivoire, and the resulting project restructurings have caused project components to
change over the lifetime of the project. This economic and financial analysis will evaluate
project outcomes based on the final project design, which consists of four components: (i)
Improving learning at the primary and secondary school level, (ii) expanding access to
primary and lower secondary education, (iii) developing institutional capacity, and (iv)
project management and coordination.

Cost-efficiency
114. Cost-efficiency is assessed for part of component 1 and component 2 for which
there exist comparable cost data from similar projects.

115. As part of the activities under component 1, the project provided 6,791,971
primary school textbooks and thereby surpassed the target of 6,326,215 books. The total
cost of the textbooks amounted to US$8,921,168 (FCFA 4,308,924,359), which
corresponds to a unit price of US$1.3 (FCFA 634). Cost-efficiency on acquisition of
textbooks is high compared to the original projected unit cost for textbooks, which was
US$2.4 (FCFA 1,166 – measured in 2012-prices). 16 Compared to other similar projects,
the actual unit cost is much in line with the ones recently realized in projects in Burundi
and Niger, where textbooks were acquired for between US$1.1 and 1.4 per book. 17

116. Under component 2, the project constructed and equipped 300 classrooms
meeting the target of the restructured project. The average overall cost of providing a new
classroom was US$25,339 (FCFA 12,238,600) including construction, supervision, and
furniture. Excluding supervision and furniture, the unit price of classroom construction is
US$21,118 (FCFA 10,200,000), which exceeds the original projected cost by 42
percent. 18 The cost estimate is based on the original project component from 1998, which
means that it does not reflect the economic situation emerging from the political conflict.
The capacity to construct schools was limited after the conflict, which resulted in the
scope of the construction being reduced as part of the 2008 project restructuring, and
which may explain the difference in projected and realized costs.

117. It is difficult to systematically compare efficiency across construction projects as
constructions vary in standards, quality, and common premises included. But even for
projects undertaken in the same country using the same design and technology, unit cost
varies widely due to e.g. procurement and management methods. A study on construction
of classrooms in Senegal shows costs ranging from US$6,700 to US$48,000 for


16
   The original projected unit cost for textbook was US$1.4 (FCFA 814) measured in 1998-prices.
17
   ICR (TF-94742), Niger Basic Education Support Project, 2012: US$1.1 for elementary textbooks and US$1.4 for 6th
grade textbooks. ICR (IDA-H2730), Burundi Education Sector Reconstruction Project, 2012: Unit price of US$1.2 for
primary education textbooks.
18
   The original projected unit cost for a classroom was US$8,475 (FCFA 5 million) measured in 1998-prices. This
corresponds to US$14,822 (FCFA 7.2 million) measured in 2012-prices.


                                                       37
government and donor-funded projects carried out between 2000 and 2004, which all
uses a similar architectural design and technology. 19

118. An overall comparison of construction costs across countries and over time
suggest that the project construction costs are in the high end compared to other projects,
but without being excessively high. 20 This holds true when comparing prices with more
recent education projects supported by the World Bank. In a recent education for all fast-
track initiative in Benin the average unit costs for construction of classrooms ranged from
US$12,931 to US$20,000. 21 In an education sector reconstruction project in Burundi the
average unit price for construction of classrooms was US$24,434. 22 However, when
limiting the cost comparison to projects undertaken in Côte d’Ivoire, cost-efficiency of
the project shows to be relatively high, cf. Table 1. This indicates a general higher level
of construction prices in Côte d’Ivoire, which may be due to the limited construction
capacity prevailing from the conflict. Thus evaluated in this context, the project has
provided an efficient use of funds with respect to construction.

119. In addition to the 300 primary school classrooms, the project constructed 9 lower
secondary schools surpassing the target of 8 new schools. The overall unit cost of
construction, supervision, furniture, office equipment, and other material for science,
medical, and sport facilities amounts to US$1.6 million (FCFA 778 million), whereas the
unit price including only construction is US$1.2 million (FCFA 595 million). As for the
classrooms, the construction cost exceeds the projected cost by almost 40 percent, which
may largely be explained by the situation prevailing from the conflict.

Economic evaluation
120. Component 1 focuses on increasing quality of learning by developing new
curriculum, providing textbooks, and strengthening training teachers. These benefits are

all difficult to quantify and are expected to prevail only gradually. The higher quality of
education is expected to improve skills of the graduates and thereby increase their
productivity and future income. Furthermore, an increase in quality of education can
positively affect retention rates and thereby increase efficiency of the education system.
Although both completion and repetition rates have improved over the project period,
there remains room for improvement of the internal efficiency of the Côte d’Ivoire
education system. Today 71 out of 100 children entering primary school reaches the last
grade, whereas 63 out of 100 entering lower secondary education reaches the final
grade. 23

121. The direct benefit from construction of new classrooms and lower secondary
schools are easier to quantify, as these investments clearly link to the benefit of allowing
more students to access and complete primary and lower secondary education. Today, the
education system in Côte d’Ivoire is characterized by a lack of capacity while the school
population is growing. The primary GER increased from 71.7 percent in 1998/1999 to
83.6 percent in 2011/2012, whereas the GER for lower secondary education is relatively
low at 36.7 percent. 24 The increased capacity is thus expected to lead to a corresponding
increase in access and thereby to raise the overall education level. The 300 additional
classrooms are expected to increase capacity by 13,800 students, and the nine lower
secondary schools are expected to increase capacity with almost 5,000 students. 25

122. The direct economic effect of the increased access to primary and lower
secondary education can be quantified based on expected wage benefit for those
graduating. As in many low-income countries, the level of education and training
influences the size of income significantly. In Côte d’Ivoire the differences in wages are
particular high going from primary to lower secondary education and from TVET to
higher education, cf. Table 2.

123. Conversely there is a very limited expected wage-gain from completing primary
education compared to the average income for people without education. At the same
time unit cost for students in primary and secondary education are high in Côte d’Ivoire
compared to other Sub-Saharan African countries. 26 The yearly unit cost of a student in
primary school is US$211 (FCFA 101,877) and the unit cost for lower secondary students
US$413 (FCFA 199,654). 27 These facts lead to a negative value of return from
investment, when benefits are solely measured by the average wage-gain of those who
complete primary school compared to people without education, and likewise for lower
secondary educated comparing expected income to those with primary education.
124. Côte d’Ivoire has experienced very low economic growth of less than 1 percent
annually on average during the period of project implementation. The low income and
limited dispersion in wages for the lower education levels reduce the direct economic
benefit from the increase in primary and secondary education. Simple calculations show
that if the monthly wage of primary and secondary graduates increase by US$20 the
direct wage-benefit is sufficient to offset recurrent costs as well as costs from the
investment. 28

125. For basic education, the assessment of direct economic benefit for the students
graduating does not include all the benefits prevailing from a general higher level
education in the country. The expansion of basic education increases the foundation of
people suitable for higher education and provides important social benefits. The social
effects may include dimensions such as mortality, health, population growth, and civic
life (more educated individuals are better able to participate in an organized community
life and to make informed policy choices). These benefits are however difficult to
quantify in monetary terms.

126. In addition to the 300 classroom and 9 lower secondary schools constructed by
the project, the project financed rehabilitation of an additional lower secondary school.
Rehabilitation of the facilities is expected to raise quality of learning as well as lowering
maintenance cost, while the effect on access might be limited.

127. The focus of the restructured component 3 is to support and build capacity for
each of the three ministries of education with a larger focus on the Ministry of National
Education (MEN). Especially the establishment of a task force under MEN has resulted
in economic gains through support for development of ministerial strategies for the
Ministry of Technical Education and Vocational Training (METFP) and the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS). The strategy prepared for METFP
was able to attract a Euro 9.28 million TVET project financed through the French
Development Agency. Furthermore, the task force worked out medium-term expenditure
frameworks for basic education, TVET and higher education, provided support for

   The wage increase corresponds to an 18.3% and a 14.2% wage increase for primary and lower secondary graduates
respectively.

development of a sector country status report, and served as an important link between
the ministries of education. Finally, the task force was central for restarting the project
after the conflict.

128. In addition to supporting the task force, the component provided critical office
equipment and vehicles needed to resume operations in the three ministries following the
conflict. The overall reinforcement of the strategic and operational capacity of the
ministries is particularly important in a post-conflict context. The ability of a project to
immediately intervene after a conflict can help restore confidence in the state and support
economic recovery providing jobs through procurement.


Financial analysis
129. The total public spending on education accounted for 19.6 percent of total public
expenditure in Côte d’Ivoire in 2012 corresponding to 5.3 percent of GDP, cf. Table 3.

130. In 2012, 41.5 percent of public expenditure on education went to pre-school and
primary education, 29.1 percent to lower and upper secondary education, 6.6 percent to
TVET, and 22.7 percent to higher education. 29

131. Total project spending was US$66 million, of which US$5.5 million was spent
during the first implementation period from 1998 to 2004 and the resulting from 2008 to
2012. The resulting fiscal impact from the project has been limited accounting for
between 0.1 percent and 1.3 percent of the total public expenditure on education over the
project period, cf. Table 4.

based on equal annual spending within each project implementation period.

132. The primary fiscal impact after project implementation stems from the higher cost
of the expanded primary and lower secondary education, i.e. the recurrent costs
associated with the additional number of students accommodated as well as maintenance
costs of the schools. A rough estimate of recurrent costs related to maintenance and
replacement of equipment in the schools amount to US$1.3 million (FCFA 612 million),
corresponding to replacement of all furniture and equipment over ten years as well as a
yearly construction maintenance cost corresponding to 5 percent of the original
construction cost. Unit costs covering education of the additional students amount to just
below US$1 million yearly (FCFA 482 million), resulting in total recurrent costs of
around 2.3 million (FCFA 1,094 million) a year. This corresponds to approximately 0.2
percent of the overall recurrent spending on education. The fiscal impact directly
attributable to the project only relates to costs of the program as far as they are additional
to the recurrent expenditure that would have been made without the project. Therefore the
future costs of e.g. teacher training and regular updates of curricula are not accounted for
as recurrent costs resulting from the project, as these types of spending in general are part
of government spending and therefore considered as “regular expenditures?.

English translation of PASEF Government ICR Exec Summary
133. The overall effectiveness of PASEF was very partial because many actions have
been dropped for procedural reasons, limited skills of the actors, and conceptualization of
the various components at the start. The project objectives were revised downward,
especially with regard to the construction and rehabilitation of classes (original target,
900 classes to build and rehabilitate; revised target 300 classrooms). Several important
activities such as the study on the implementation of GIS software, or the acquisition of
an education management information system could not be performed.
The overall efficiency is very critical. The implementation of the project has revealed
several shortcomings in terms of initial project design: (i) non-functioning of the Inter-
ministerial Committee for Coordination Sector Education / Training (CICSEF), (ii)
absence of a detailed results framework tracking individual activities and associated
results indicators by implementation period; and (iii) individual components being
implemented in isolation without much coordination of project activities. In addition, the
joint support structures involved in the implementation of the project at times faced
bottlenecks. Indeed having two structures involved in following up on physical
infrastructure contracts has not always facilitated the efficient implementation of project
activities. On the other hand, poor organization and low technical capacity of some
selected companies have considerably delayed project activities. The organizational set-
up of PASEF also had certain shortcomings, which led to a less rigorous monitoring of
activities. Furthermore, there existed certain weaknesses in the administrative
management, personnel tracking, and recording and classification of accounting records
unorganized.
134. The 2008 project restructuring, however, helped the government achieve the new
objectives. For instance, the target for construction of additional classrooms and colleges
was achieved, overall education indicators slightly improved, and the availability of
textbooks also increased. Less progress were noted in terms of pupil / teacher ratio which
rose from 39 in 1998/1999 to 46 in 2011/2012, which falls short of the national standard
of 40 students per teacher.
However, PASEF did contribute in part to the development of education by increasing
enrollment at all levels of the national education sub-sector, and secondly to improve
access and gross enrollment at all levels of the sub-sector. Furthermore, the free textbook
policy helped relieve the financial burden for parents wanting to send their children to
school. However, more efforts need to be made as 2 out of 10 school-aged children do
not attend school.
135. The economic and financial evaluation of PASEF is made based on the base cost
of the project, the withdrawal applications and in particular information obtained from
the Bank’s “ClientConnection? website. The PASEF was initially very slow to disburse,
with the first reports at the end of 2008 showing a very low disbursement rate and
activities only really taking off in 2009. Although the restructured project did not include
counterpart funding, the Ivoirian counterpart was able to support project activities by
injecting 3,648 billion FCFA.


                                            47
The PASEF also experienced some difficulties in its financial and technical management.
The main areas needing particular attention are: (i) the number of project staff and
partners who did not have the same understanding of project management; (ii) improve
programming and technical monitoring activities; and (iii) the absence of a real budget
planning mechanism and an efficient financial monitoring system. These difficulties
should be taken as lessons learnt when allocating future resources and matching them to
proposed activities.
Conclusion
136. The PASEF legacy can be understood as having re-established a truly Ivorian
education system, provided sufficient equipment and vehicles, quality classrooms and
equipment, improve sector quality (the development of competency-based programs,
additional textbooks and teaching guides in the series “School and Nation", provision to
school canteens, carrying out of a literacy program with active involvement of the target
population, and an evaluation framework). A particular focus should be the maintenance
and monitoring of the acquisitions and the progress made under the project.
