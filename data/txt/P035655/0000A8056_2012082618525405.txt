                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The PASEF project will close August 31, 2012. The team conducting the final project supervision believes that the project has seen considerable progress since 2008 and that
                         progress toward the achievement of the PDO could possibly be judged as substantial. However, the team does not have enough efficiency data or analysis at the time of project
                         closing to make the final judgment on the overall achievement of the project PDO. Therefore, the team is rating the progress toward achievement of the PDO as moderately
                         unsatisfactory pending the final ICR analysis of project efficiency and PDO indicator data. The final project supervision assessment is as follows: the PASEF has been under

                         implementation for 13 years and, over the course of these 13 years, Cote d’Ivoire experienced considerable political turmoil. Project implementation was interrupted for a total of 5
                         years and 4 months--the longest period being 4 consecutive years (2004-2008). The various suspensions presented implementation challenges however, the project has had many
                         successes, most of these were achieved after the 2008 restructuring. There was an impressive increase in disbursements post-restructuring—disbursement increased from 9.5
                         percent in 2008 to 88.5 percent by July 31, 2012. Final disbursements are expected to reach 97%. The project constructed and equipped 300 primary classrooms and 8 colleges.

                         One additional college was added to the project for rehabilitation after the 2011 crisis because it was in a state of disrepair. These primary schools and colleges will benefit 18,000
                         students (14,400 at the primary level and 3,600 at the college level). The project also rehabilitated 2 CAFOPs and provided equipment to all 14 teacher training institutes (CAFOPs) in
                         Côte d’Ivoire so that they could re-open and begin their training activities. The project was initially going to rehabilitate 2 additional CAFOPs however, after the 2011 crisis it was
                         evident that there was insufficient time to complete the civil works. Therefore, the funds were to be used to restock food warehouses that had been pillaged during the crisis so that
                         the school feeding programs could be continued, and provide 25,000 student desks which were high priority for the country after the crisis. The project also purchased and distributed
                         approximately 6.8 million textbooks and teachers’ guides. This exceed the project target and led to the achievement of the student:textbook ratio established for the project. The
                         project's support for textbook acquisition and distribution also ensured that Côte d'Ivoire met the HIPC textbook target of 3 textbooks per child. Another achievement is the continued
                         increase in enrollments despite the crisis and numerous project suspensions. This data show: (i) GER in 1st grade increased from 70.6% in 2006/07 to 76% in 2011/2012, (ii) GER in
                         primary increased from 74% in 2006/07 to 83.6%, exceeding the project target of 82%; (iii) completion rates have also increased from 43.4% in 1998/99 to 46% in 2006/07 to 64.2%
                         in 2011/12, again surpassing the end of project target; and (iv) overall repetition rate has decreased from 22% in 2008 to 16.6% (grades 1-5) in 2012. The project supported the
                         introduction of a competency based curriculum and training program for CAFOPs, and conducted an audit of the training program as well as the teacher’s ability to teach the
                         competency based curriculum at the school level. Findings from this audit were used to inform the preparation of the new GPE project which focuses on restructuring the CAFOPs
                         and improving quality of teaching. The project also carried out a PASEC assessment in 2008/2009 for grades 2 and 5 which established a learning baseline after the crisis in grades 2
                         and 5 and the Ministry of National Education (with project support) conducted an assessment for grade 3 in 2012. After the 2008 restructuring the government focused on primary and
                         therefore, it did not conduct a secondary level assessment. In 2011, the Ministry established a new department, Service de veille et de Suivi des Programmes, directly under the
                         ministry cabinet which is responsible for learning assessment. This department will conduct a new assessment for grades 2, 3 and 5 during the 2012/13 SY.
