                         Textbooks which were received before the crisis are stored in the ministerial storing facilities and were distributed on October 24, 2011. This distribution will achieve a ratio of 3
                         books per student in CP and 5 in CM. The rehabilitation of two CAFOP (Bouake and Korhogo) has started and the date of completion is scheduled for December 2011. Both CAFOPs

                         will allow resumption of teacher training in the North. The number of CAFOPs to be rehabilitated was reduced from 3 to 2 due to limited financial resources available for the remainder
                         of the project. Therefore, it is proposed that to rehabilitate 8 CAFOPs and build 2 satellite structures under the new basic education project, financed by the Global Partnership for
                         Education. In terms of infrastructure, of the 300 primary classes to be build there are only 96 to be completed, and of the colleges to be built, 7 are nearing completion. The
                         Department of National Education is committed to completing everything before December 2011. A steering committee for the purpose of tracking implementation progress was
                         established, meets monthly and is chaired by the Minister.
