I. BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has requested Bank
assistance for a project to strengthen the country's agricultural support
services, principally those administered by the Department of Primary
Industry (DPI), the main Government agency responsible for agriculture. The
project was identified by the Government with Bank assistance in November
1981 and prepared by an FAO/CP mission in May 1982./l Preparatory work for
specific components was undertaken by a group of consultants (education and
training, extension support)/2 and by ISNAR (agricultural research)./3 This
report is based on information contained in these sources and on the findings
of an appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. H.H. Thias, K. Sengupta (Bank)
and R.G. Spinks (FAO/CP) who visited Papua New Guinea in July 1982 and a post
appraisal mission consisting of Ms. C. Subido, Mr. M Altaf liussain (Bank) and
R.G. Spinks (FAO/CP) in November 1982. Mr. Saddington (Bank) reviewed the
final report.
Agriculture in PNG
1.62      With a land area of 500,000 square kilometers and a 1980 popula-
tion of 3 million growing at about 2% p.a., PNG is sparsely populated and the
considerable agricultural potential only partly utilized. The 1980 per
capita GDP of US$780 is largely attributable to the Bougainville copper
mine; average farm incomes are probably not much above US$200.
1.03      While agriculture contributes about one third to the country's GDP
and roughly 40% to its exports, most of the country s rural population /4
depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The dominant role of this
sector as employer and source of income for the great majority of the people
is unlikely to be challenged in the foreseeable future.

1.04       Papua New Guinea's diverse topography has resulted in the forma-
tion of numerous isolated environments, particularly in the Highlands
region, each with its own set of climatic, soil and other natural condi-
tions, and with a matching multitude of plant varieties. The geographic
fragmentation has also given rise to the development of numerous isolated
communities which are separated from one another by physical as well as
linguistic and cultural barriers. This natural and human diversity poses
considerable problems for administration in general and specific functions
such as agricultural research and extension in particular.
1.05       Agriculture follows three modes of production:  the plantations
(numbering about 900), originally foreign owned and managed but now
increasingly in Papua New Guinean hands, smallholder cash cropping and
subsistence production from shifting cultivation, with considerable overlap
among the last two.
1.06       The major cash crop production in PNG during 1981 is shown below:

Palm Kernels                7.9         3          317           2.5           1
Tea                         7.8         3        2,020          15.8           5

Total                282.4       100           -          305.1         100
1.07       Over the last ten years the estate sector, with the important
exception of oil palm and coffee, has declined while smallholder production,
except for copra, has followed an upward trend. However, this progress in
smallholder cash cropping was accompanied by an increase in foodstuff
imports in excess of the growth of urban populations due to higher purchas-
ing power of rural consumers. Imports supply about one quarter of the
country's food requirements and claim significant amounts of foreign
exchange, particularly rice of which about 100,000 t are imported annually.



- 3 -
1.08      The increase in consumption of imported rice in place of locally
grown foods is due to (i) farmer's better storage and transport qualities
and greater convenience; and (ii) decline in garden productivity where lands
have been diverted to cash cropping. Increasing population is also creating
land pressures in some localities, putting the traditional shifting cultiva-
tion systems under severe stress. Malnutrition is widespread, especially
amongst small children in less developed areas. However there is conflict-
ing evidence on the relationship between cash cropping and a change in
nutritional status. The need to improve nutrition and local food supplies
is therefore a multi-faceted problem requiring major inputs of both research
and extension activities.
1.09      The estate sector has stagnated mainly because of the uncertainty
about land ownership and land use rights which has kept many expatriate
planters from investing in the sector for much-needed rehabilitation. Other
difficulties are the lack of managerial and financial expertise in cases
where plantations have reverted to national management, agricultural wages
that are high in comparison with competing countries, and an unfavorable
world market situation.
Development Issues, Objectives and Strategy
1.10      Development Issues.  The Government is faced with four broad
issues in agricultural development:
(a) the adaptation of traditional village structures (including land
tenure systems) to the needs of a market economy;
(b) the effective participation and cooperation in the development
process of the many diverse and often antagonistic clan groups;
(c) the steady transfer of plantation lands from expatriate to
national ownership/management without severe adverse effects on
productivity; and
(d) the formation and mobilization of the necessary trained manpower
particularly in the Government-s agricultural services.
1.11      Development Objectives.  The main goals of agricultural development
in PNG are: in the short run to reduce food imports and to broaden
agricultural exports; and in the long run to improve the livelihood of rural
families.
1.12      Development Strategy.  In the last decade the Government-s
agricultural and rural development efforts have centered around the
following principles:
(a) an open economy with emphasis on a strong private sector
supported by agricultural credit and export crop stabilization
funds;



- 4 -
(b) the support of clans and other traditional groups as recognized
legal entities while acknowledging individual land rights in
clan lands as a basis for long-term farm improvements;
(c) the delegation of major development responsibilities to the
provincial level;
(d) financial and management assistance to nationals to enable them
to assune responsibility for plantations formerly owned and
managed by expatriates; and
(e) expansion of specialized agricultural training (Agricultural
Colleges and other vocational schools) and improvements in the
remuneration and working conditions of agricultural support
staff.
1.13       Only recently has there been a renewed awareness within the
Government that agriculture will remain the mainstay of Papua New Guinea's
economy for many years. This recognition of the importance of agriculture
is manifest in a wide area: in the greater flexibility of Government on
expatriate ownership and management of plantations, in the formulation of a
national food and nutrition policy recognizing the important role of
traditional agriculture and in the explicit realization that for agriculture
to advance on a broad front, an improvement in the Government's agricultural
support services is imperative.
The Bank's Role
1.14       Since the country's independence in 1975 the World Bank has
supported agricultural development in PNG through four projects:
(a) Popendetta Smallholder Oil Palm Development Project - (LN 1333-PNG of
US$12 million, effective January 6, 1977), (b) Southern Highlands Rural
Development (Cr 841-PNG of US$20 million, effective February 26, 1979)
(c) Enga Provincial Development Project (Ln 2125/Cr 1227-PNG of US$6 mil-
lion, 2 million, effective September 16, 1982) and (d) Second Agricultural
Credit Project - Cr 1149-PNG of US$15 million, effective May 26, 1982). The
first assists in the development of 4 ha oil palm blocks for 1,400 small-
holders, together with investments in infrastructure, extension and
inspection services and a transport company for the smallholder production.
1.15       The second assists an integrated rural development effort in the
Southern Highlands Province, one of PNG-s least developed areas. The project
includes infrastructure investments (roads, health and education facilities),
cash crop development (coffee, tea, cardamom, silk), health training, adult
education and extension and an integrated research program in subsistence
food production, nutrition and health. While the infrastructure components
have been largely completed and already show an impact on the local economy,



the software components experienced delays due to uncertainties in the
national health training policy and recruitment difficulties. However,
recent developments suggest that bottlenecks in staffing are being overcome
and that the health staff training component is now moving ahead.
1.16      The third constitutes a time slice of a phased multisectoral rural
development project.   It covers provincial institution building, a variety
of agricultural, forestry and livestock developments, investments in
infrastructure and health, education and community development components.
1.17      The fourth assists the efforts of Papua New Guinea Development
Bank (PNGDB) to finance tree crop development and pig and poultry raising
and to strengthen its development and extension efforts for cocoa, coffee
and coconuts. At the time of the last supervision (November 1982) PNGDB had
already approved almost 1,062 subloan applications totalling US$18 million
equivalent (corresponding roughly to the relevant Schedule I allocation),
but disbursements of loans are lagging, due to lack of properly trained
staff and other organizational constraints.
1.18      The Bank's future support of agricultural development in PNG will
move along two paths, one aiming at rehabilitation and diversification of
the tree crop sector through loans to Papua New Guinea Development Bank and
through larger nucleus estate projects to assist smallholders, the other at
replications of rural development projects of the Enga type. The inherent
risks and difficulties are well recognized: adverse world market prospects
for several of PNG's traditional export crops (coffee, cocoa, copra), the
administrative, legal and technical complexities of a nucleus estate project
in oil palm or rubber, and the lack of experience with the new type of
provincial development effort as represented by the Enga Project. Both
types of projects however would require a strengthening of PNG's
agricultural support services.
II. AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT SERVICES IN PNG /1
General
2.01      Agricultural support services in PNG are provided by a number of
Government and nongovernmental agencies, with the largest and most important
contribution coming from the Department of Primary Industry (DPI). DPI is
headed by a Minister and a Secretary (who is also administratively
/1 This Chapter focuses on those support services that are to be assisted
under the proposed project. A more comprehensive analysis is contained
in the 1981 Bank Review (IBRD: Country Sector Report - Papua New
Guinea: Agricultural'Services Review, Washington, D.C., 1981).

responsible for an Office of Forestry under a separate Minister) and
consists of the following Branches: Planning, Economics and Marketing
(PEM); Policy, Review and Coordination (PRC); and Fisheries /1 reporting
directly to the Secretary; and Management Services; Agriculture; Livestock;
and Education and Training reporting through a Deputy Secretary (See Chart).
The latest available data on staff of the various Branches is given in Table
2.1.
2.02      The main DPI staff categories and corresponding levels of
qualifications are as follows:
(a) Scientific Officer (SO) - 5 grades, recruitment normally /2 from
among university graduates in agriculture, science or other tech-
nical subjects;
(b) Rural Development Officer (RDO) - 5 grades, recruitment normally
from among Agricultural College Diploma holders (3 year course)
following 10 years of general education;
(c) Rural Development Technicians (RDT) - 6 grades; recruitment
normally from among Agricultural College Certificate holders
(2 year course); and
(d) Rural Development Assistant (RDA) - 3 grades; this category does
not require any formal qualification and is being phased out.
The composition of DPI staff by level of qualification is given in Table 2.2.
2.03      The devolution of administrative responsibilities to the 19 pro-
vinces brought about a reorganization of DPI, with about two thirds of the
staff being transferred to the provinces. The most important function
yielded to the provincial DPI's /3 was agricultural extension, and the great
majority of provincial agricultural staff serve in this area (Table 2.1).
Important functions retained by the central DPI were usually those where
economies of scale militated against provincialization (such as agricultural
research) or where a national interest was perceived (such as in quality
control for export crops or quarantine services).
/1  For historical reasons, Fisheries constitutes a Division headed by a
Director, whereas the Branches have Assistant Secretaries.
/2  Promotion into this and other categories of staff without this formal
qualification is possible after a certain period of service and in-
service upgrading training.
/3  The term "provIncial DPI" is used for convenience.  The provincial agri-
cultural services have adopted various names, such as Division of Rural
Development, Division of Primary Industry, etc.

2.04      The dismemberment of the old DPI meant a serious weakening of the
country-s agricultural support services as the central organization was
drastically reduced without creating an equivalent structure at the provirr-
cial level. In a number of cases, provincial agricultural services were too
small to permit the aggregation of a sufficient body of expertise, and the
fiscal basis of the provinces was seldom sufficient to support an adequate
development of its agricultural services. The difficulties stemming from
the process of administrative devolution were compounded by the simultaneous
(and still ongoing) departure of experienced expatriate officers, by a slow
decrease in the quality of general and agricultural education, and by per-
sistent staff shortages (at present about 600 positions are filled on an
acting basis). As a result, today's DPI (the combined national and
provincial services) is, by common consent, weaker than its unified
predecessor.
Crop Research
2.05      While livestock and fisheries research are integrated in the
respective Branch/Division to assure a close contact with the other technical
personnel in these subsectors, crop research is spread over six sections of
the Agriculture Branch: Hlorticulture (i.e., foodcrops), Agronomy,
Agricultural Chemistry, Land Utilization, Plant Pathology, and Entomology.
2.06      Crop research in PNG is also carried out by other Government
Departments such as Mines and Energy, by Industry Boards for cocoa, coffee and
oil palm, by the University of Papua New Guinea, the University of
Technology and other bodies.
2.07      DPI Research Stations.  There are five main stations serving
major agro-climatic zones and crops, and two smaller stations serving
particular crops as shown below:
(a)  Lowland Agricultural Experiment Station (LAES), Keravat, East
New Britain (Cocoa, coconut, staple foods, spices, and leafy
vegetables);
(b)  Agricultural Research Station, Bubia, Morobe (Rice, pulses and
coarse grains),
(c)  Highland Agricultural Experiment Station, Aiyura, Eastern High-
lands (Coffee, staple foods and farming systems);
(d)  Kuk Agricultural Research Station, Mt. Hagen, Western Highlands
(Tea, staple foods, vegetables);



- 10 -
(e)  Horticultural Research Station, Laloki, Central (Vegetables,
staple foods);
(f)  High Altitude Experiment Station, Tambul, Western Highlands
(Pyrethrum); and
(g) Rubber Center, Bisianumu, Central (Rubber).
2.08      Industry Based Research.  New Britain Palm Oil Development,
jointly owned by the Government of PNG and Harrison and Crossfield, estab-
lished Dami Oil Palm Research Station when oil palm development began in the
1960s, and initially Government provided the research scientist in charge.
Oil palm research is now solely industry financed from a production levy,
except for the salary of one seconded DPI entomologist.
2.09      The Cocoa Industry Board, from a levy of K 20 per ton of cocoa
exports, has earmarked K 13 for research and hired a plant breeder and a
plant pathologist who use the facilities of the LAES at Keravat. A nearby
plantation at Tavilo has been purchased by the Board and is being developed
partly as an experiment station and partly for production of planting
material for commercial distribution.
2.10      The Coffee Industry Board, from a levy of K 10 per ton on coffee
exports, funds an expatriate coffee specialist and a national agronomist who
are developing research programs. Both are currently based at Highland
Agricultural Experiment Station, Aiyura, but the Board is considering
possible development of an industry-owned research station along the lines
of oil palm research. Government control of industry-based research is
limited to representation on the respective Boards of Directors, and
participation by the Chief Agronomist in research advisory committees for
oil palm and coffee.
2.11      University Research.  The Faculty of Agriculture of the Univer-
sity of P pua New Guinea was established in 1975. Its research programs are
modest an  focus on winged bean, taro, erosion control, local foodstuff for
livestock and marketing. Recently steps have been taken to set up a joint
committee by DPI and the University for coordinating research.
2.12      The University of Technology at Lae has a 17 ha farm for teaching
and research. Its Department of Chemical Technology and DPI have jointly
established a food storage research unit on campus, but beyond this linkage,
there is no formal arrangement for coordinating agricultural research.
Within their financial constraints the universities provide useful
contributions to crop research.
2.13      Past crop research efforts.  Major emphasis in early years was on
tree crops and great advances were made in the major export crops like
coffee, cocoa, coconut and oil palm. As in most tropical developing
countries with an economy dominated by agriculture, PNG has emphasized



- 11 -
research on cash crops for export, while tending to neglect the food crops
produced and consumed locally.  However, following independence government
policy has required greater support to be given to food production and to
research on staple crops and farming system. Rice, the country-s main
agricultural import, has commanded research attention intermittently for
over 50 years, but this effort has failed to lead to an increase in produc-
tion./l Research on other food crops, especially traditional root crops, is
more recent and has been intensified after recognition of appreciable
malnutrition in some areas of the country. The research program for food
crops was reinforced after the declaration of the Food and Nutrition Policy
for Papua New Guinea in February 1978./l
2.14      Currently the policy for increasing food production is not very
clear, which has caused difficulties in formulating a well-defined research
program. However, the Horticulture Section stresses research on staple food
crop production and the sweet potato research program has more time allo-
cated to it than any other food crop program. Much of the farming systems
research program is also devoted to sweet potato based systems, and several
rural development projects are allocating research resources to understand-
ing and improving sweet potato cultivation.
2.15      There is ample justification for this emphasis in addition to that
of improving the nation's nutrition. Subsistence agriculture forms the
largest sector of agriculture and is based largely on root crops and
bananas. By developing a more efficient food crop production system, more
land and especially labor would be available for increasing cash crop
production. Improvement of traditional staple food production would also
decrease rice imports and increase self-reliance.
2.16      Financing of Agricultural Research.  The estimate for total
expenditure on crop research in 1981 by Government was about K 3.1 million
whereas the total levy from the industrial sector for cash crops research
was about K 0.9 million, although the latter amount was not being fully
utilized. The budget allocation for crop research was about 0.2% of GDP,
and 0.8% of the Gross Agricultural Domestic Product. Including the
/1 Previous biases in food crop research are strikingly illustrated by the
following numbers: up to 1978, 229 agronomic field trials had been
conducted for rice and 47 for taro, yams and cassava, the respective
national production figures being less than 1,000 tons and about
1 million tons. Similar discrepancies between research efforts for a
crop and its economic importance in PNG existed for traditional vs.
introduced vegetables and fruits and for sweet potatoes vs. Irish
potatoes. However it is relevant to note that in the same period,
80,000 tons of rice (equivalent in food value to 250,000 tons of root
crops) and large quantities of Irish potatoes were imported. Research
on these crops was motivated by import substitution.

potential contribution from the private sector, the total effort in PNG for
agricultural research would be about 1% of the Gross Agricultural Domestic
Project which is modest for a country whose population depends heavily on
agriculture. It is well below the 2% level tentatively recomnended in the
World Bank Sector Policy Paper on Agricultural Research./l
2.17      Staff.  Numbers and qualifications of staff occupying research
scientist positions are tabulated below:

D.Sc.   equivalent   B. Agric.   Diploma   Totals

2.18      There are numerous vacancies in the research establishment.
Currently 60% of the positions of scientific officers, 40% of RDOs, 30%
of RDTs and 25% of RDAs are filled. Recent Government cuts in staff
ceilings have reduced permitted staffing for the Agriculture Branch to only
50% of the established positions. DPI is examining the staffing strength
by category to highlight areas of strength and weakness. There is shortfall
in the proportion of technical support staff needed in relation to the
number of research scientists. About 60 field scientists are supported by
only 96 RDOs and RDTs. The research section establishment contains 61 RDO,
95 RDT and 170 RDA positions. The number of RDA positions is excessive and,
in any case, the policy is to phase out this staff category. A desirable
support ratio would be I RDO and 1.5 RDT per research scientist, with
skilled laborers providing many of the routine services for which RDAs were
used in the past.
2.19      Manpower and Training.  A research system needs appropriately and
adequately trained manpower with sufficient experience to carry out its
programs. The average length of research experience in the crop research
services has declined seriously: in 1973, 58 research staff had an average
research experience of 9.4 years; in 1980, 56 research staff averaged only
6.4 years. None of the national officers has a post-graduate degree, nor is
there a systematic program for formal training to upgrade their qualifica-
tions for research. Today agricultural research personnel need formal
/1 World Bank: Agricultural Research - Sector Policy Paper. Washington,

training not only in the basic and applied scientific disciplines but also
in research and agricultural experimentation methodology. This almost
invariably means formal training at least to the Masters and, in some cases,
to the Ph.D. level.
2.20      A second major gap is the lack of suitably trained and experienced
research support staff. Hitherto no consistent attempt has been made to
provide and train adequate numbers of support staff who could enhance the
productivity of the research scientists by providing assistance in field and
laboratory work.
2.21      Organization of Crop Research.  The Agricultural Branch, consisting
of the crop research sections and the agricultural development and quarantine
sections is headed by an Assistant Secretary who does not have any research
background. The existing structure of several separate disciplinary sections
of crop research militates against cooperation between colleagues and the
development of interdisciplinary teams.
2.22      The crop research and quarantine sections should be converted into
a Crop Research Division to become the principal generator of new
agricultural technology. It is necessary that the Crop Research Division
be led by a technical Director of Research who would provide the technical
leadership to the various sections and would present broadly based expert
view to policy and planning authorities. Problems in crop research seldom
occur within a single discipline, they more often have facets that require a
balanced interdisciplinary outlook. A unified Crop Research Division under
a technically qualified Director would provide a guiding overview in identi-
fying such problems and their solutions.
2.23      Research Program Planning.  The research activities extend from
farming systems to crop improvement and crop protection and relate to a wide
range of disciplines and commodities. The existing manpower situation and
organization of research make it difficult to concentrate critical masses of
manpower on either the important commodities or systems of production in
both lowland and highland agricultural situations (Table 2.3). It has
therefore been difficult for research to generate and adapt appropriate crop
production technologies that would have an impact on increasing the produc-
tivity of both cash and food crops. In the short run such a complex
situation can only be dealt with by a careful examination of the priority of
the various research activities and the concentration of available manpower
in Government and private industry on the most important areas while the
training and expansion of the manpower base takes place.
2.24      ISNAR have made tentative proposals for a reallocation of crop
research activities which would (i) aim at maintaining a sufficient
research capability for the most important cash crops (mainly through larger
industry contributions); and (ii) endeavor to strengthen and focus food
crop research. DPI is at present considering these proposals (Table 2.4).

2.25      Research-Extension Linkages.  Linkages between the research and
extension services are weak. In pre-independence times, research had a
plantation bias and extension service a smallholder orientation. This led
to differences in outlook and interest, and the communications gap was
widened by the administrative separation of the two services and the recent
decentralization of extension.
Agricultural Education and Training
2.26      The training of agricultural staff is the responsibility of DPI's
Education and Training Branch./l It supervises the National Fisheries
College at Kavieng (New Ireland) and four Agricultural Colleges proper, at
Popondetta (Oro), Vudal (East New Britain), Mt. Hagen (Western Highlands)
and Maprik (East Sepik). Total staff in 1982 and enrollments and
graduations for the period 1977-81 are given in Table 2.5.
2.27      Recruitment into the Agricultural Colleges comes after 10 years of
general education, and after 2 years of training and a final examination the
students graduate with a Certificate in agriculture and usually enter DPI
service as RDTs. Following several years of service, the better RDTs can go
through a one-year upgrading course leading to a Diploma and subsequent
promotion to RDO.
2.28      This system is of recent origin, following the recommendations of
a Government commission in 1975. However, this two-tiered system of
training has not worked well, mainly because of the deterioration of
standards in the general education system which required agricultural
training at both Certificate and Diploma levels to take on more elements of
general education than had orginally been envisaged. In 1982 DPI decided to
return to a three-year pre-service Diploma course, starting in January 1983
at Vudal, for students with better educational achievement than the
Certificate students. This is to be combined with a narrowing and stronger
focussing of Certificate curricula to avoid an overloading with nonessential
yet demanding subjects.
2.29      To bring the bulk of provincial and central DPI staff to an
acceptable technical level and to provide them with knowledge and skills
which they presently do not acquire at the colleges, Government plans to
expand substantially its in-service training and to devote one college (Mt.
Hagen) exclusively to that purpose.
/1 Training for the livestock services comes under the responsibility of the
Livestock Branch. It takes mostly the form of short introduction and
upgrading courses organized at the Branch's training center near Lae.

Planning and Economics
2.30      DPI's planning and economic functions are presently undertaken by
two Branches, Planning, Economics and Marketing (PEMI) and Policy Review and
Coordination (PRC). Planning work within PEM has two major orientations,
provincial and national. Provincial planning work consists of assisting,
advising and training on the Job provincial staff and of ensuring
consistency of provincial and national planning work. This includes a
monitoring and evaluation function vis-a-vis provincial agricultural
development projects.
2.31      National planning efforts aim at the formulation of nationwide
development plans in the field of agriculture, the provision of sectoral
inputs into the National Public Expenditure Plan (NPEP), liaison with other
relevant Government agencies and the monitoring and evaluation of national
agricultural programs and projects.
2.32      The economics work consists of research into the structure, pro-
duction relationships, costs, returns and prospects of specific agricultural
activities; research on village farming systems; compilation of relevant
statistics and the carrying out of agro-economic surveys.
2.33      The marketing work refers to the administration of the relevant
legislation, the rendering of marketing services to smallholders, and the
provision of marketing intelligence to other branches of DPI as well as out-
side bodies.
2.34      Before the advent of decentralization, PEM's work had a strong
field orientation, so that the present scope of work is in many respects a
continuation of well-established activities. So far it has assisted nine
provincial governments in formulating provincial development plans, and it
intends to build up its staff to a point where all 19 provinces may be
similarly assisted.
2.35      The performance of the economic and planning services is con-
strained, as is the case for all other DPI services, by a shortage of pro-
perly trained and experienced personnel, and by specific shortcomings in the
fields of sectoral planning, monitoring and evaluation, and farm systems
analysis.
2.36      A second difficulty concerns the organization of economic and
planning work in two branches, leading to a somewhat artificial separation
of planning, policy and economic data collection and analysis functions.
Following suggestions by the 1981 Bank Review, Government plans to combine
the marketing functions of PEM and the Agricultural Development Section of



- 19 -
the Agriculture Branch to form a Development and Marketing Branch, and to
combine all other economic functions in a new Policy Planning and
Coordination Branch. Details of the new administrative structure are still
pending.
2.37      The Policy Planning and Coordination branch would also serve as
Secretariat for the National Agricultural Council (consisting of the
National DPI Minister as Chairman and his provincial counterparts); the
National Agricultural Advisory Committee (consisting of the lPI Secretary
and the Assistant Secretaries of provincial primary industry departments);
and the DPI Policy Group (consisting of the DPI Secretary as Chairman,
Deputy Secretary and the branch Assistant Secretaries). So far their work
has been hampered by the absence of an appropriate base of technical
support. The designation of the new Branch as Secretariat would ensure the
support.
Agricultural Extension Support
2.38      The primary responsibility for agricultural extension has been
transferred to the provinces (para. 2.03). However, important assistance
functions such as linkage with agricultural research, advice to provincial
extension services, staff upgrading, information and publication are located
in the Education and Training Branch of the Central DPI.
2.39      Each provincial extension service is headed by the Provincial Rural
Development Officer who is supervising a number of District Rural Develop-
ment Officers who in turn are responsible for several Subdistrict Rural
Development Officers. The subdistrict is the administrative level where
most extension staff are located and deployed.
2.40      Depending on farm population densities, quality of communications
and availability of transport, extension staff work in two modes: (i) one
day visits to villages in the immediate neighborhood of the administrative
center and (ii) extended field tours (patrols) of up to two weeks covering
several isolated villages at a time which requires camping out and a well-
planned transport schedule for the extension teams.
2.41      In a narrow quantitative sense PNG's extension service compares
well with those of other countries at a comparable stage of development
(Table 2.6). However, the figures have to be read with three provisos in
mind: (i) the widely scattered population and the great geographic
fragmentation and resulting logistic difficulties; (ii) the low
qualifications of a great portion of the staff, particularly the RDAs; and
(iii) the lack of adequate and appropriate extension packages, especially
for food crops. Because of different channels of responsibilities these
problems call for a coordinated effort of provincial and central
governments.

2.42      The Role of Women.  In traditional agriculture in Papua New Guinea
most cultivation tasks, except for the initial land clearing, are undertaken
by women. While this has been known by the Government for a long time, it
has found it very difficult to increase the percentage of female extension
officers appreciably.
2.43      The reasons for this are numerous but can be reduced to three main
factors:
(a) in the traditional farm society, economic decisions are made
almost exclusively by men and they are usually the only ones
in contact with the world outside the village and its represen-
tatives (such as extension agents);
(b) within the service itself there is widespread resistance to a
larger role for female officers, although female field workers
have been accepted and perform well;
(c) the very limited number of female DPI staff (an estimated 5%
of the total number many of whom work in specialized branches
outside general extension) limits, in the short run, the number
of female extension workers. The Government has set aside an
Agricultural College enrollment quota of about 20% (and the
necessary separate boarding facilities) for female students, but
only half of this quota is being used, rural parents being
reluctant to send their daughters to boarding schools. While
Government explicitly recognizes the important role of women in
the country-s agriculture and supports the continuous training and
upgrading of female agricultural services staff, it also realizes
its limitations in radically changing deep-seated societal
behavior patterns.
Land Utilization Services
2.44      The Land Utilization Section of the Agriculture Branch undertakes
investigations and cataloguing/mapping of PNG-s physical resources, with
emphasis on soils, landforms, climate and vegetation. Its role is that of a
service and development unit, supporting other Departments and provincial
governments as well as potential investors.
2.45      For many years land utilization work in PNG has received valuable
assistance from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO) of Australia. At the end of World War II this group
was contracted to undertake a series of regional resource surveys. This
work was concluded in 1970 at a total cost of some US$18 million (in 1980



- 22 -
prices). This was followed by a systematic inventory of existing knowledge
of PNG's natural resources in the 1970s at the cost of another US$2.3 mil-
lion. The first phase resulted in 15 publications containing resource
surveys for about 50% of the country and the second led to four volumes on
the soils, climate, landforms and vegetation of PNG.
2.46      In the late 1970s plans were prepared to extend the natural
resource survey to the entire country. This work was to proceed in three
phases: (a) natural resource surveys and inventory, (b) development of
appropriate methods to assess PNG's land use potential and (c) formulation
of actual resource assessments. Funding from CSIRO began in 1981, with a
scheduled completion date for the first two phases in March 1983. The third
phase which would be the logical conclusion of more than 30 years of work
will be financed under the proposed project.
Agricultural Project Development
2.47      The Agricultural Development Section of the Agriculture Branch is
responsible for national export crop development projects. It is involved
in the following aspects of project planning and implementation: identifi-
cation of suitable areas and crops; physical design; legal preparations;
co-financing arrangements and project promotion within the country and
abroad; physical implementation, including selection and guidance of
smallholders through extension; and project monitoring and evaluation.
2.48      So far the Section has prepared five major projects, and six
additional areas have been identified as suitable for large-scale nucleus
estate development (Tables 2.7 and 2.8). In accordance with recommendations
in the 1981 Bank Review, DPI wishes to increase its project planning and
implementation capacity to a level where it could initiate one to two new
projects per year.
Livestock Services
2.49      DlI's Livestock Branch consists of three sections:  Veterinary
Services; Veterinary Research; and In-Service Training. A Livestock
Development Corporation has been recently incorporated to take over commer-
cial activities in livestock development and production, e.g., abattoirs,
cattle ranches. The slowdown in the development of PNG's beef cattle
industry and the devolution of Government functions from the center to the
provinces have affected the orientation and effectiveness of the service as
well as a measure of uncertainty about the exact demarcation of national and
provincial responsibilities.  Existing legislation may contain conflicting
provisions and DPI plans to employ a consultant to examine these questions
and to suggest any necessary modifications in the relevant laws and
regulations.
2.50      Important control and support functions which remain with the
central DPI are animal disease and pest surveillance and control, laboratory
services and livestock research. The first two functions, supplementary to

one another, are gaining in importance as PNG, traditionally free from a
number of serious animal diseases is increasingly at risk because of the
growing volume of international travel and large-scale development projects
in the border areas. Livestock research is focussing on problems of poor
growth performance and low fertility of ruminants which are thought to have
their origin in nutritional deficiencies.
Quarantine Services
2.51      Of the agricultural support services in PNG, the least appreciated
in terms of its national importance is the quarantine inspectorate. Its
status within the Government service can be gleaned from its drastic under-
staffing and underfunding and from the fact that it does not even have a
proper career structure. Yet the potential damage arising out of short-
comings of this service is obviously much larger than for any of the other
services.
2.52      The Quarantine Section forms part of the Agriculture Branch, but
can also draw support from the two Branches it is serving, Agriculture and
Livestock.  The main quarantine facilities are located near Port Moresby,
with an additional animal station outside Lae. Ten small animal quarantine
stations throughout the country are mainly concerned with internal livestock
movements and lack any specialized equipment.
2.53      Quarantine inspectors are graduates of the two-year Certificate
course of the Agricultural Colleges. Apart from a two weeks pre-service
course for animal quarantine personnel at Lae, qualifications, renumeration
and career prospects are undistinguishable from the other RDOs/RDTs./I A
recent conference of senior quarantine staff decided to introduce in 1983
special quarantine in-service courses covering both animal and plant
quarantine aspects.
2.54      With its present staff and facilities, the inspectorate is unable
to carry out its responsibilities. Only some of the country-s 12 shipping
ports and 3 international airports are staffed and equipped to undertake
quarantine work. Government plans to establish new facilities in four
locations while strengthening staff and facilities at five existing stations
to cope with the most urgent quarantine needs.
Plantation Management Training
2.55      There is a considerable demand for training of managers of small
or medium-sized agricultural enterprises.  The return to national ownership
/1 However, the Livestock Branch runs in-service courses for its staff
which cover aspects of animal disease recognition and control including
quarantine.

and management of many plantations has revealed a serious shortage of
national expertise, in all aspects of technical, commercial and financial
operation. The Plantation Management Training Program (PMTP) has been
established to meet this demand. It includes training facilities at Laloki
(near Port Moresby), Rabaul (East New Britain), and Mt. Hagen (Western
Highlands). Formerly under the supervision of the Department of Commerce
which has been recently abolished, it is now under the Department of
Primary Industry.
2.56      In the seven years of its existence, the Program has trained about
1,100 persons (Table 2.9) through four types of courses: Operational Skills
Courses, Management Skills Courses, Mini-Management Development Courses
(short-term modular) and Director/Board Member Training Courses. An
important part of the training is on-the-job follow-up work. Entry require-
ments, course content and duration and fees (to be paid by the sponsoring
enterprise) vary with the type of course.  Usually previous relevant
experience and sponsoring by a company or business group is required.  On
request, custom-made courses are also undertaken at a customers seat of
business.
2.57      In the coming years, considerable estate development/rehabilitation
is expected in the southern part of Central Province, Milne Bay Province and
possibly Oro Province.  Ir, anticipation of the resulting demand for planta-
tion management expertise, PMTP is planning to start a training center at
Milne Bay.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Formrulation
3.01      The proposed project is the result of Government's realization
that agriculture 4int PNG will remain a key sector for many years to come and
that a revitalization of this sector reou4,es a strengthening of its support
services.  This argument has been m-ade in agricultural sector reviews
undertaken by FAO,/l International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)

To meet the identif.ied needs, the Bank recommended and assisted in the devel-
opment of an Agri ^ultural Support Service-s Project withl the major components
irn agricultural research, education ard training, extension support, economics
and planning, agricultural project development and regulatory services.
3.02      The project is essentialV a "software project" w'hich would lead
to significant staff ircreases in DPI (136 national and 24 expatriate
staff) and about US$3.0 -million, an 183'% ncrease to DPI's annual recurrent
budget.  The additional staff represents about 10% of the National DPI
staff and 5% of the total DPI staff at the national and provincial levels.
The project would have a long gestation period anrd many of its expected
benefits would be either of a general            (suatcr h as the increase in the
competence and efficiency or DPIF staf   or gwould come in the form of avoided
losses the likelihood and extent of wThfch are difficult to assess.  Never-
theless the proposed proj4ect is justif-ied on the following grounds:
fa)  Over the last decade PNG's agriculture sector and related support
services have suffered from. comparative neglect. and the devolu-
tion of some agricultural services to the erovinces and the
departure of many qualified and experienced expatriate staff have
worsened the situation.  Onl-' -.ecently has agriculture been
recognized as tce key sector for che country-s long-term
aevelopment. The proposed project would improve the institutional
basis for this new emphasis.
(b)  The long gestation period for projects that focus on institutional
and manpower development require corrective action as early as
possible.  As the country continues to lose long-serving expa-
triate personnel, any further delays in replacing these personnel
and strengthening DPI would only multiply future difficulties.
(c)  Without staff upgrading and assistance from the center, most pro-
vincial agricultural services seen unable to carry out effectively
the functions transferred to themn.  With its present manpower and
budget allotments, DPI can only give very limited help, and delays
in stepping up assistance to the provinces would result in a
serious decline of administrative and technical standards which
would unavoidably affect development.
(d) The proposed project wouk 5 bring about u-rgently needed and
overdue institutional and organrzational chan-ges within DPI.
Project Description
3.03      The project w'o0uld encc-,pass expenditures for civil works; equip-
ment, furniture and vehicwes. salaries oF expatriate and national staff;
travel and subsistence expertses; other operaLional expenses such as
materials and supplies, utilities and rental and operation of vehicles;
consultancies; and fellowships.  It wouLld consist of the following
components: (a)  Crop research; (b) agricultural education and training;



- 29 
(c) planning and economics; (d) agricultural extension support; (e) land
utilization services; (f) agricultural project development; (g) livestock
services; (h) quarantine services; (i) plantation management training;
(j) transit staff housing; (k) monitoring and evaluation; (1) fellowships;
and (m) consultancies.
Project Components
Crop Research (US$4.8 million) /1
3.04      The component would have four distinct elements:  the creation of
a Crop Research Division; the improvement of central research support
(laboratory services); the strengthening of DPI's research and experiment
stations; and a post-graduate training program for national scientific
officers to staff the research organization.
3.05      Crop Research Division.  The establishment of a separate Crop
Research Division would consolidate activities now undertaken by six
sections within the Agriculture Branch provide all crop research with a
superstructure and expedite implementation of the other subcomponents. The
new Division would be headed by a Research Director(E) /2 with the rank of
Assistant Secretary, aided by a Deputy Director and an Executive Officer (E)
with administrative responsibilities. The duty statement of the Research
Director should include and give priority to the formulation of a comprehen-
sive crop research program over a medium- and long-term horizon, the publi-
cation by March 31, 1984 of two summary reports covering crop research
activities during the periods 1973-77 and 1978-82 respectively, and the
preparation by June 30 of each year (starting in 1984) of an Annual Crop
Research report for the previous calendar year. An administrative cell
headed by a senior administrative officer (CC 9) and comprising two clerks
and one secretary would provide the administrative support structure and
free the Research Director and his associates for work on research policies
and programs. Except for the positions of Deputy Director and head of the
administrative cell (CC 9), these posts would be incremental./3 Apart from
the salaries for the above staff, the proposed project would finance office
furniture and equipment, travel and subsistence and other operational
expenses.

- 30 -
3.06      Central Research Support.  This subcomponent would assure an
adequate back-up of field work in the areas of: analysis; data processing
and storage; statistical analysis; identification of insect pests and
diseases; and expertise in post-harvest handling of perishable foods and in
food processing. It would comprise the following incremental positions:
three scientific officers (E), seven technical officers grade 1, one
clerical and one secretarial staff. An urgently needed insect store is
proposed to accommodate the Department's virtually irreplacable collection
of insect pests and plant diseases material. It is presently housed in
timber-frame buildings threatened both by fire and termites. Other items
are office furniture and equipment, laboratory and field equipment, travel
and subsistence, and other operational expenses.
3.07      Research and Experiment Stations.  The subcomponent would support
the concentration of research programs and available staff on the most
important cash crops and food systems (cocoa/coconut, coffee/tea, lowland
food crops, highland food crops). Two additional scientific officers (E)
would be hired to develop programs concerning food crops.
3.08      More importantly, the project would include additional support
staff (at RDO and RDT levels) to achieve a desirable support staff/scientist
ratio of 2.5 to 1 (instead of the present ratio of 1.6 to 1), thus freeing
the scientists from many low-level routine jobs and permitting them to focus
on their proper functions. The total number of support positions to be
created would be 13 RDO and 13 RDT. Further items under this subcomponent
would be staff housing for the additional personnel and for officers being
transferred to new positions, the upgrading of offices and laboratories,
related furniture and equipment (laboratory and field), travel and subsis-
tence and other operational expenses.
3.09      Government has investigated the suitability of different stations
and has selected following stations for the location of specific crop
research:
Cocoa and Coconut Research   -  Keravat and/or Tavilo
Coffee and Tea Research        -  Kuk
Highland Food Crop Research  -  Aiyura
Rhinoceros Beetle remains a problem for coconut cultivation at Keravat and
Tavilo but recent research indicates that the damage can be kept to a
tolerable level.  The earlier concern expressed about the suitability of
Kuk soils for coffee research does not appear to be justified.
3.10      The location of lowland food crop research has not yet been
finally decided. There is no scope for acquiring further land or reclaiming
the swamp at Bubia. DPI is therefore exploring the possibility of sharing
the facilities for research with the University of Technology, Lae if the
Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby
is relocated there, failing which the research has to be located at Keravat



- 31 -
or Laloki. Government would inform the Bank by December 31, 1983 of the
status of the proposed arrangement with the University of Technology.
3.11      The desirability of sharing the research efforts on cash crops
between DPI and the private sector has been emphasized by the ISNAR Report
and accepted in principle. DPI is presently engaged in discussions with the
Coffee and Cocoa Industry Boards on several alternative proposals to develop
joint work programs which would specify the directions of research and
inputs of personnel, land, facilities and equipment and would also address
questions of finance, organization and management. Government will continue
to discuss further developments with the Bank in the process of reaching a
final decision.
3.12      Research Scientist Training.  The project would provide for post-
graduate training to permit an eventual staffing by national officers of
PNG-s crop research service. This program would be the beginning of
long-term staff development and would include 21 scientific officers already
employed by DPI.  An Officer-in-charge of Research Training (E) would be
responsible for selection of candidates and suitable places for them to
undertake studies and would later on also address other aspects of research
staff development, such as in-service training for support staff.
3.13      Apart from this officer, the project would provide for the
recruitment of seven new national graduates to carry on the work of the
officers seconded for training. Since the present annual output of univer-
sity graduates in agriculture is 15-20, this should not pose any problems
on the supply side. The subcomponent would also include a amall amount for
office furniture, travel and subsistence and other operational expenses.
The fellowship program proper is dealt with in a separate section below
(paras. 3.42-3.44).
Agricultural Education and Training (US$2.4 million)
3.14      This component encompasses pre-service education at Certificate
and Diploma levels and in-service training of central and provincial DPI
staff as a follow-up of the first Bank-assisted Education Project
(Cr. 661-PNG). The pre-service portion is comparatively small and aims at
minor improvements of the existing Colleges. It includes the conversion of
a dormitory into a laboratory at Popondetta, scientific equipment, office
equipment, teaching aids and library subscriptions for Vudal, Sepik and
Popondetta, three additional staff (one curriculum officer, one education
officer and one secretary) and related travel and subsistence expenses.
3.15      The bulk of assistance to this component would refer to in-
service training. Government plans to convert the Highlands Agricultural
College at Mt. Hagen (Western Highlands) to an in-service training facility.
This would include the construction of some new and upgrading of existing
facilities, vehicles, furniture, library subscription and other operational



- 32 -
expenses. Incremental staff financed under the project would consist of two
Education Oficers at So 4 level (E) supported by 3 technical (RDO/RDT) and 2
clerical (CC) staff. Travel and subsistence costs of the technical staff
and of trainees would also be met. Candidates for training would be
selected on the basis of their performance in the field for a few years.
3.16      While the general scope and content of the various training
activities (Certificate and Diploma courses; in-service training) is already
known, specifics of the respective curricula and trainee numbers are still
being finalized.
3.17      DPI's original proposal for in-service training included technical
as well as management training. It was felt that a number of the envisaged
general management courses could be carried out by the Administrative
College which has a long experience in conducting this type of training.
However, it seems doubtful whether they would be able to accommodate the
number of additional trainees, given their present staff constraints./l
3.18      DPI has examineed jointly with the Administrative College the
staff implication of delegating part of the in-service training program to
the latter. Necessary staff increases would be sought for the Administrative
College under the 1984 NIPEP. If funding under the NPEP is not forthcoming
for the additional staff, a modified program will be discussed and agreed
with the Bank.
Planning and Economics (US$2.4 million)
3.19      The project would assist the Planning, Economics and Statistical
Sections of PEM. The Planning Section staff would be upgraded and streng-
thened to enable it to help provincial planning efforts and other parts of
the national DPI. Two additional expatriate scientific officers would be
supported by four technician level (RDO) staff.  About half of the addi-
tional staff would assist with the coordination and monitoring of sectoral
planning, while the others would strengthen the Section's provincial
planning support to enable it to address over a 2-3 year period the initial
planning needs of the ten provinces which have not yet received central DPI
assistance for their planning work, and thereafter to repeat the planning
exercise - with widening scope and increasing depth for all provinces in a
five-year cycle. The project would also provide for office equipment and
furniture, travel and subsistence and other operational expenses.
/1  DPI's in-service training plans call for an intake of 300 technical
trainees in year 2, increasing to almost 500 in year 5; and for a start
of management training with 68 trainees in year 3, rising to 109 in
year 5.



3.20      The Economic Section would be strengthened to enable it to carry
out production and marketing research and industry evaluation for policy
formulation and planning purposes. Four graduate economists (E) and three
national officers would be recruited, two to work on farm systems research,
the other to address questions of production and marketing for major cash
and food crops. These economists would form part of the multidisciplinary
technology validation and introduction teams which are a central feature of
the envisaged research/ extension linkage.
3.21      The Statistical Section would be expanded by four clerical
positions. The coverage of non-staff expenses would be similar to that for
the other Sections, with an additional allowance for the hire and operation
of two vehicles.
Agricultural Extension Support (US$1.8 million)
3.22      The proposed project would strengthen the four Units (Extension
Advisory, Publications, Radio Broadcast and Libraries) constituting the
Information Section of DPI's Education and Training Branch by assigning
three Scientific Officers, two technicians (RDO) and one secretary to the
first Unit; four officers would be located in each of the country's major
regions, and two of the RDO's would be recruited as trainees.
3.23      The Publications Unit would be increased by two Scientific
Officers (E), namely a scientific editor and an information/communications
specialist, one more Scientific Officer and two RDOs who would work as
trainees with the expatriate specialists. The existing printshop personnel
would be increased by seven staff including an illustrator and a photographer.
Two clerical and secretarial staff would also be added to the Unit. The Radio
Broadcast Unit would add a technical officer to assist in the preparation of
extension-oriented radio broadcasts. Also included would be equipment for the
Extension Advisory, Publications and Libraries Units, as well as books and
journals for the latter, travel and subsistence costs for the Extension
Advisory and Publications Units and other operating expenses.
3.24      The proposed project would provide extension advisory services to
provinces and aim at creating institutional linkages between agricultural
research and extension through establishment of a more widespread network
of testing stations on farmer's field in close collaboration and consulta-
tion between research staff and provincial extension staff. The success
would to a large measure depend on the active cooperation of the provincial
DPIs. While individual perceptions of the respective roles of central and
provincial agricultural services and of possible forms of assistance and
cooperation obviously differ widely, the general reaction of provincial
governments is favorable.
3.25      In view of manpower and budget constraints and because of various
degrees of acceptance and of absorptive capacity, the establishment of
testing stations would be geared for an initial assistance, over its four-
and-a-half-year implementation period, to four to six provinces. This would



- 34 -
give the DPI teams an opportunity to modify and improve their approach and
would also permit a demonstration effect to develop which in time would
convince the other provinces of the advantages of availing themselves of
this service.
Land Utilization Services (US$1.4 million)
3.26      This component would include assistance for three activities: soil
erosion studies; a land capability survey of alienated land; and a land
evaluation for subsistence and cash cropping.  The first would determine
soil losses and run-off in six provinces to help develop a suit able package
of soil conservation measures under various agro-ecological conditions. The
subcomponent would include hiring of one additional SO 1 and one RDO 1,
equipment, travel and subsistence and other operating expenses.
3.27      The land capability survey for alienated land would cover 200,000
ha of unused privately or Government-held lands. It would evaluate the
land-s development potential as a basis for subsequent programs to develop
or rehabilitate it. The subcomponent would require hiring of two expatriate
and two national Scientific Officers and of fourteen technician level support
staff. It would also include office furniture and equipment, scientific
equipment, travel and subsistence and other operating expenses.
3.28      The land evaluation for subsistence and cash cropping would
constitute the last phase of CSIRO's work in Papua New Guinea, its
end-product being an overall resource inventory and assessment of land
potential (para. 2.46). In addition to the funding of the consultancy for
CSIRO, the subcomponent would provide two additional RDOs and funds for
travel and subsistence and other operating expenses.
Agricultural Project Development (US$1.1 million)
3.29      Under the proposed project, the Agricultural Development Section
would be strengthened by the addition of five Scientific Officers (three E)
two clerical officers and one secretary and supplemented by funds for office
equipment and furniture; travel and subsistence; and vehicle rental. This
would enable the Section to step up its activities to a level of 1-2 pro-
jects per year. In order to meet peak manpower demands and to provide
specific technical expertise not available in the Section, an amount of
K 190,000 (about US$270,000) has been added for consultancies; this would
correspond to an input of approximately 32 m/m.
3.30      The original project proposal contained an Alienated Land Use
Survey to be undertaken by the Department of Lands. This proposal was not
sufficiently developed at appraisal time and could not be considered for
inclusion in the proposed project. Ilowever, since the Department provides
an important input into the work of the Agricultural Development Section,
through land survey, lease processing, and inspection, it has been recom-
mended to Government that the Department of Lands should make an assessment



- 35 -
of the additional staff requirement for funding under the 1984 NTPEP. At
negotiations Government informed that the Department of Lands is in the
process of preparing an 1984 NPEP submission for these additional posts.
Livestock Services (US$0.9 million)
3.31      The proposed component would strengthen the animal disease and
pest surveillance program throughout the country; provide funds for essen-
tial facilities and equipment at the central veterinary laboratory and
support a survey of the mineral status of ruminants.
3.32      The disease and pest surveillance program would be increased by
nine gazetted stock inspectors (RDO 3), three of them to be posted along the
land border with Indonesia, the other six in provinces with significant
livestock development (Morobe, Oro, Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands,
East New Britain, North Solomons). They would be provided with transport
(seven 4WD pick-up trucks and two boats). Because of their beinIg posted
outside urban centers, these officers would also require housing, and they
would be provided with camping gear and basic equipment.
3.33      In order to ensure that this important support becomes the unequi-
vocal responsibility of the national DPI, it appears that some changes in
the relevant legislation will have to be made so that the existing stock
inspectors could be degazetted and new ones regazetted as national DPI
staff. DPI hired a consultant to examine the legal aspects of the existing
quarantine and animal disease legislation and to develop recommendations for
its clarification and simplification but the consultant failed to produce a
report. The Government will, therefore, request the New Zealand Government
to carry out the study.
3.34      The Central Veterinary Laboratory would be improved to achieve a
high level of work security. This would include construction of a fireproof
store for toxic materials and dangerous chemicals and of five special kennels
for animals suspected of rabies. Additional funds would be made available
for equipment and stand-by generators. The staff would be strengthened
through recruitment of an expatriate veterinary officer, a pathologist with
expertise in poultry.  Support to the survey of the nutritional status of
ruminants would be limited to minor purchases of supplies (specimen sample
bottles), the costs of travel and subsistence and of laboratory analyses of
specimens.
Quarantine Services (US$0.7 million)
3.35      The proposed project would build up the quarantine inspectorate to
a level where it could cope with the greatly expanded workload deriving
from PNG's increased contacts with foreign countries. Twelve additional
quarantine inspectors would be hired , to be stationed in six existing
quarantine centers and four new ones. The administrative staff in Port
Moresby would be strengthened by one secretary (KBO 2). Other items to be



- 36 -
included in this component would be essential quarantine equipment, includ-
ing three fumigation chambers, office furniture and equipment, travel and
subsistence, vehicles (two motorcycles and five 4WD pick-up trucks), and
other operational expenses.
3.36      At present PNG quarantine certificates are not recognized by
Australia which means reexamination in Australian ports of PNG exports which
adds appreciably to their costs. DPI plans to upgrade its inspection stand-
ards to a point where reexamination would not be necessary and to establish
container export ports for the main export crops. This would, however,
require a previous review and overhaul of all aspects of the quarantine
service, including procedures and legislation. The New Zealand Government
examining the country s quarantine and animal disease legislation (para.
3.33) would also address questions of improvements in quarantine standards.
Because of the importance of this service for PNG's agriculture, an
assurance has been obtained that the Government would inform the Bank by
July 31, 1983 of the findings and of relevant follow-up action.
Plantation Management Training (US$0.4 million)
3.37      The assistance under the proposed project is limited to the
upgrading of a classroom and a dormitory at the planned new training
facility at Milne Bay, the purchase of three 4 WD vehicles, of furniture and
equipment, plus other operational expenses.
3.38      While the staff expansion to be financed under the 1983 NPEP would
be sufficient to start training at the new center, another three staff posi-
tions would be needed to carry out the full training program as envisaged by
PMTP. At negotiations Government agreed to seek 1984 NPEP funding for these
positions.
Transit Staff Housing (US$0.1 million)
3.39      The availability of staff housing in Port Moresby has declined
sharply as a result of Government's recent move to sell its stock of housing
(usually to the present occupants) and to cease the policy of guaranteed
housing for national staff moving to Port Moresby. In order to facilitate
the transfer of national officers to project components located in the
capital and thus to assure timely implementation of these components and the
ultimate success of the project, the construction is proposed on DPI land,
of three low-cost transit housing units.
Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.2 million)
3.40      The Planning Section within the Planning, Economic and Marketing
Branch of DPI would be responsible for the continuous monitoring of project
implementation; the necessary staff would be available for this task.
Following normal procedures for NPEP projects, these officers would also



- 37 --
prepare quarterly progress reports for review by National Planning Office
(NPO) and the Department of Finance. In addition, the proposed project
would provide funds for three evaluation exercises by external consultants
at the start, near midpoint and towards the end of project implementation.
An initial baseline survey would be conducted.
3.41      An important element of the initial baseline survey for crop
research would be two summary reports covering crop research activities
during the periods 1973-77 and 1978-82 respectively. The absence of such an
account has been a serious drawback for formulating a comprehensive crop
research program, given recent staff turnover and the dispersal of individ-
ual research results over the country. The availability of such concise
source reference books would be an invaluable aid for crop researchers
starting their DPI career or entering a new assignment. The preparation of
these reports will be one of the primary responsibilities of the Research
Director.
Fellowships (US$1.4 million)
3.42      In addition to the post-graduate training in crop research
mentioned in the relevant section above, the proposed project would provide
for training at various levels and for durations ranging from short-term
courses to one year of formal education in support of the following project
components:
(a) Crop Research: 21 staff for a total of 648 months of training;
(b)  Agricultural Education and Training:  16 staff for 192 months;
(c)  Agricultural Extension Support:  8 Staff for 46 months;
(d)  Agricultural Project Development:  4 staff for 30 months; and
(e)  Quarantine Services:  9 staff for 27 months.
Total: 58 staff for 943 months.
3.43      This training component would upgrade DPI staff in specific areas
where training is not available locally. It would increase the competence
and efficiency of their respective services and facilitate the eventual
national staffing of positions presently held by expatriate officers.
3.44      UNDP indicated that about US$500,000 may be available for fellow-
ships under the proposed project in its 1983-86 Country Program for PNG. At
negotiation Government informed the Bank that the UNDP fund would not be
available for this purpose. The Bank will therefore finance the total
amount required for fellowships.



- 38 -
Consultancies (US$1.2 million)
3.45      Under the proposed project, 69 man-months of expatriate technical
assistance would be provided to DPI for the following components:
(a) Policy and Planning (6 man-months) to assist in the development
of data system and the coordination of national and provincial
planning;
(b) Agricultural Project Development (32 man-months) to help
identify and prepare agricultural projects;
(c) In-Service Training (4 man-months) to assist in the
development of training materials for in-service training
courses and in the delivery of short-term courses;
(d) Unspecified (27 man-months).
(e) CSIRO program: US$0.7 million
3.46      The consultancies, most of them short-term assignments,/l have
been costed at K 5,850 (about US$8,200)/month (Annex 1, Table 3). This
figure would cover salaries and travel to/from the duty station. At the
time of project appraisal billing rates for experienced consultants averaged
about US$4,300 depending on such factors as nationality, area of
specialization, age.
Implementation Schedule
3.47      The project would be implemented from mid-1983 to the end of 1987.
An implementation schedule is given in Table 3.1. In the second semester of
1983, eight staff will be recruited and hired including the Research
Director, Officer-in-Charge of Research Training, Land Development Officer,
Information and Communications Specialist and four Quarantine Officers.
About seven staff will be selected to go on the long-term fellowship program
(12-30 months). Recruitment of expatriate staff will extend up to 1985
(15 in 1984 and 5 in 1985) while additional national officers will be
recruited up to 1987 (68 in 1984, 37 in 1985, 13 in 1986, 14 in 1987). Most
of the civil works, e.g. insect store, transit staff houses, covenant
/1 For longer-term assignments Government usually prefers the mode of con-
tract employment in the public service for a standard period of three
years. This arrangement has the advantages of a more economical basic
rate (about US$3,480 equivalent per month for officers at the top of the
scale and with maximum gratuity for long service), of lower overheads
and of better administrative control.

houses, dormitory and laboratory will be undertaken in 1984 and 1985.
Consultants will be engaged starting in 1984 for policy and planning,
agricultural project development and in-service training. About 51 fellow-
ships will be granted in 1984 and 1985 for short term and long term courses.
IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Project Cost
4.01      Total project cost over the four and a half years of project
implementation amount to US$24.3 million of which US$14.0 million (58%) is
the foreign exchange component. Base cost estimates are expressed in March
1983 prices and includes about US$1.1 million in taxes and duties. Unit
prices for housing, subsistence and car rental follow the relevant
Government standards; for staff salaries the DPI salary scales were used.
Consultant service costs are based on recent cost quotations of the National
Planning Office.
4.02      Physical contingencies of 10% were applied for all items except
staff salaries and consultancies. The cost estimates also include allow-
ances for annual price escalation during implementation based on: 6% for
1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985, and 6% for 1986 and 1987 for local and
foreign costs alike. They total 21% of base costs plus physical contin-
gencies. Project costs by components are summarized in Table 4.1.
Financing (excluding front-end fee)
4.03      The Bank would finance US$14.0 million of the total project costs,
equivalent to the foreign exchange component of 58%. The Government would
finance US$10.3 million (42%).
Procurement
4.04      Because of their overall small size (not likely to exceed
US$200,000 equivalent for any given location and year) and spread over
several provinces, project components and years, civil works are unlikely to
attract foreign bidders and would be carried out following local competitive
bidding in line with national bidding procedures which have been found
satisfactory. In some isolated locations where suitable contractors would
be unavailable construction under force account by the Department of Works
and Supply would be acceptable.
4.05      Purchases of vehicles, furniture and equipment totalling
US$1.3 million would be similarly fragmented and rather small, with only 20
equipment items (totalling less than US$300,000) having unit costs in excess
of US$5,000 and no single contract expected to reach US$100,000 equivalent.

- 42 -
In addition, a sufficient number of foreign suppliers are represented in PNG
to assure a degree of competition and satisfactory maintenance and repair
services. For these reasons, the application of local competitive bidding
procedures or for small items where government regulations permit prudent
shopping would be justified.
4.06      Civil works and furniture contracts in excess of US$100,000 and
US$50,000 equivalent, respectively, expected to cover about 55% and 60% res-
pectively of purchases in the two categories, would be subject to Bank
review of bidding documents prior to bidding and of winning bids prior to
award.
4.07      Except for the special case of the CSIRO contract, consultant
services in the amount of US$0.7 million would be contracted in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
Disbursement
4.08      Disbursements from the proposed loan would cover:
(a) 60% of total expenditures for civil works,,
(b) 100% of foreign and 80% of local expenditures for equipment,
vehicles and furniture;
(c) 100% of total expenditures for expatriate salaries, consultants'
services and fellowships and 60% of total expenditures for staff
travel and subsistence and monitoring and evaluation.
4.09      Disbursements will be fully documented except those relating to
local expenditures for civil works by force account, local expenditures for
civil works under contracts of less than kina 30,000, and for the local
component of expatriate salaries. Disbursements for these items will be
made against statements of expenditure certified by the Project Coordinator
and made available for review by Bank supervision missions. For equipment,
vehicles and furniture procured through government stores, the ILPOC
(Integrated Local Purchase Order Claim) form will be sufficient documenta-
tion. A schedule of disbursements for the four-and-a-half years implementa-
tion period (envisaged to extend from July 1983 through December 1987) is
given in Annex 1, Table 4 and a draft Schedule I (Proposed allocation of
Loan Proceeds) in Annex 1, Table 5. Because of the unique character of the
proposed project being largely a "software" project, neither the sectoral
disbursements profile for PNG nor the aggregated agricultural projects
disbursement profile for the East Asia and Pacific Region were considered
suitable comparators.
4.10      Accounting and Auditing.  The Departmental Accountants in DPI
would have responsibility for the maintenance of separate accounts for the
individual project components in accordance with sound accounting practices,



- 43 -
and would ensure that an annual auditing of these accounts by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank would take place before June 30 of the
following year (i.e., six months after the close of PNG-s fiscal year).
Certified copies of the audits and the auditor's report would be forwarded
to the Bank by September 30. The audit reports would certify that funds
disbursed against statement of expenditures had been used for the purposes
for which they were provided.
4.11      The work of the Department Accountants should be greatly facili-
tated by the introduction, in early 1984, of a comprehensive computer
program (the Standardized Government Accounting Package) to which all
Departments could access through individual terminals. Government informed
the Bank at negotiations on the progress in the preparation of this system.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Responsibilities
5.01      The main responsibility for physical project implementation would
be with the DPI The relevant DPI Branches would be in charge of the day-to-
day implementation of the individual project components, and in each
participating Branch, one staff would act as Component Manager. DPI has
appointed the Component lIanagers and the Project Coordinator who would
assure proper linkages between the various components and who would be the
main point of contact with the Bank. In the case of any subsequent new
appointments the Bank would be given an opportunity to comment on the
suitability of the candidates.
Reorganization of DPI
5.02      Government, in response to proposals in the 1981 Bank Review, is
considering further modifications in the DPI structure to improve its
efficiency. These changes have been discussed in detail within DPI but are
still subject to modifications and would furthermore need the concurrence of
other Government agencies (Public Service Commission (PSC) and Department of
Finance). While they are considered important, they are not deemed essen-
tial for the success of the project. At negotiations Government informed
the Bank that the Crop Research Division is expected to be established by
March 31, 1984 and the reorganization of the entire DPI is expected to be
implemented by June 30, 1984.
Early Recruitments
5.03      For a number of new positions, early recruitment is essential
either to assure a timely start of major project components or to address
critical shortcomings in a vital national support service (quarantine).
Government had been requested to assure the funding of these key posts for



- 44 -
1983 and an early posting. At negotiation Government informed the Bank that
the following key positions are expected to be filled and appointees in
place by October 1, 1983: four Quarantine Officers, Research Director,
Officer-in-charge of Research Training, Land Development Officer and
Information and Communications Specialist.
Recruitment Procedures
5.04      The identification and appointment of the incremental staff
(136 national and 24 expatriate officers) will put a heavy administrative
burden on the relevant Government agencies, particularly DPI and the Public
Service Commission (PSC). In order to facilitate the search for expatriate
staff, PSC has agreed to consider enlisting the services of specialized
recruitment agencies. As a possible alternative the Bank has suggested that
Government avail itself of the assistance of FAO's Agricultural Operations
Division. PSC will examine incentives on individual basis to attract some
highly qualified foreign personnel. Finally, they will assign a few of
their staff to assist DPI with the preparation of the necessary staff
submissions. A duty statement will be prepared for each expatriate post
specifying the required qualifications, detailed work responsibilities and
outputs of the officer. The employment of the expatriate staff will be
governed by the set of Terms and Conditions of Service issued by PSC under
authority derived from the Public Employment (non-Citizens) Act. The supply
of manpower for the national staff is not expected to be a problem in view
of the adequate number of graduates from the local agricultural schools and
universities. At negotiation Government informed the Bank that ISNAR has
been requested to suggest a suitable person for the post of Research
Director. If ISNAR fails other suitable agencies including FAO would be
approached.
Reporting
5.05      Based on the quarterly progress reports to NPO/ Department of
Finance (para. 3.40) the Component Managers would prepare semi-annual status
reports to be aggregated by the Project Coordinator and submitted to the
Bank before the end of the quarter following the reporting period, the first
being due March 31, 1984. The initial status reports would pay particular
attention to the following: staffing situation; crop research; extension
support including research/extension linkages; and in-service training.
5.06      In addition to the two summary reports on crop research during
the period 1973-82 (para. 3.41), the Crop Research Division would issue, not
later than six months after the end of the reporting period (calendar year),
Annual Crop Research Reports outlining the major research activities and
results and to the extent feasible, relevant development in industry-
sponsored crop research. The first such report would be due in June 1984.



- 45 -
5.07      At the end of project implementation, the Project Coordinator
would assemble a Project Completion Report from individual Component
Completion Reports prepared by the Component Managers. This report would be
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after project completion.
Operation and Maintenance
5.08      The success of the project would ultimately depend on the con-
tinued commitment of adequate manpower and physical resources after the
period of project implementation. By the end of project implementation,
revenues from new mining ventures should ease the resource constraints of
Government and enable it to finance the expanded and improved agricultural
support service (para. 3.02) from its regular budget without undue strain.
The expatriate staff would be gradually replaced by the national staff who
will either be understudies of the expatriate staff and/or outputs of the
fellowship program of the project. After project implementation, 50% of the
expatriate posts (1 S04, 1 S03, and 2 S02) in the Crop Research component
will be localized. National Staff would also take over the functions of two
expatriate officers (S04) in Agricultural Education and Training, and two
officers (SO3) in Agricultural Extension and Support. In the Agricultural
Project Development Section, two (S04) out of three expatriate positions
allotted for in the prject will be occupied by local people while in the
PEM, four (2 ECO2, 1 ECO3, and 1 S02) out of six project expatriate
posts will be phased out. Thus, in the first year after project implemen-
tation, 55% of the total expatriate staff will be localized and the
remainder when suitable replacements have been found and or trained.
VI. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The main benefits expected from the project would be the follow-
ing: an increased or more cost-efficient production in all three segments of
PNG's agriculture, that is, in smallholder cash cropping, subsistence agri-
culture and estate production; the avoidance of possible economic losses
from the strengthening of the quarantine and animal disease control
services; and an increase in the general administrative efficiency and
technical expertise of DPI staff.
6.02      These benefits are difficult to quantify.  However, findings from
other developing countries suggest that specific improvements in agricul-
tural support services can lead to impressive results: the introduction of
the T&V extension system in Turkey and India led to substantial yield
increases for cotton, paddy and wheat often without a significant increase



- 46 -
in other inputs./l Similarly, research on a number of crops in Brazil,
Colombia and Mexico yielded annual internal rates of return between 35 and
96%./2 Investment in quarantine and animal disease control should be seen
as a prudent insurance policy: to quote just one example, the cultivation
of sweet potatoes in PNG is second in economic importance only to copper
mining, but a devastating disease would have a far more profound impact on
the nation than an interruption of mining activities.
Justification
6.03      The argument for an Agricultural Support Services Project in Papua
New Guinea can be summarized as follows: the agriculture sector is perform-
ing well below its potential and the deterioration in agricultural support
services over the last decade is one of the main contributing factors of the
unsatisfactory state of PNG's agriculture. The support services have been
fragmented and weakened by the decentralization of important support
functions and continuing departure of experienced expatriate staff. Unless
a determined effort is made to strengthen the central DPI in several key
areas and to enable it to assist the provincial agricultural staff, the
service may eventually cease functioning except in a narrow administrative
and regulatory role. The result would be a sector remaining largely static
and being at an increased risk of widespread damage by introduced pests and
diseases.
Environmental Considerations
6.04      By improving plant quarantine services and reducing the risk of
major pest and disease attack, the project will be beneficial in environ-
mental terms.  It would also enhance Government's ability to design and
implement environmentally sound agricultural development programs and
projects.
Risks
6.05      If properly implemented and maintained, the proposed project would
be essentially risk-free. Uncertainties would be limited to project imple-
mentation itself: The proposed project would require a considerable input
of specialized staff, and a careful timing of budgeting, staff recruitment
and other administrative procedures. The Government is fully alerted to the
difficulties of this task and has agreed in principle to avail itself of the
services of professional recruitment agents or alternatively, to seek
assistance from FAO's Agricultural Operations Division.

1977, p. 3.
/2 World Bank: Agricultural Research, Sector Policy Paper, 1981, Annex 3.



- 47 -
6.06      In view of the country's policy of gradually replacing expatriate
staff, steps must be taken to assure the identification and preparation of
national staff eventually to assume additional responsibilities (although in
some highly specialized positions such as in agricultural research, expa-
triate personnel is expected to be required for some time to come)./l The
proposed project includes a substantial fellowship component, and many of
the trainees to be sent abroad and later to take over from expatriate staff
have already been identified. The trainees would have to execute bond to
serve at least for the number of years spent abroad for training.
6.07      Several project components require a close cooperation between the
central and provincial agricultural services. This applies particularly to
the research/extension linkage which even in the best circumstances is a
complex and demanding task. Government and Bank realize the inherent
uncertainties. It is therefore proposed that the extension advisory
component and its links with agricultural research be given continuous
attention during supervision and a prominent place in the monitoring and
evaluation process.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government on
the following points:
(a) the Government expects the following key positions to be filled
and appointees in place by October 1, 1983: four Quarantine
Officers; Research Director; Officer-inr-charge of Research
Training; Land Development Officer; and Information and
Communication Specialist (para. 5.03);
(b) the Government of PNG would make 1984-1987 NPEP submissions
for the training programs, for the Administrative College and
the Plantation Management Training Program as well as additional
staff for the Lands Department and ensure that these submissions
are given high priority by the relevant departments. If
funding under 1984 NPEP is not forthcoming, modified programs
will be discussed and agreed with the Bank by December 31, 1983
(paras. 3.18, 3.38 and 3.30);
(c) DPI has decided to locate cocoa and coconut research at Keravat
and/or Tavilo; coffee and tea research at Kuk; highland food
/1 The ISNAR Report assumes that under favorable conditions the agricul-
tural research service could be fully nationalized within sixteen years
(that is, by 1998).



- 48 -
crop research at Aiyura. The location of low-land food crop
research has not yet been finalized. DPI is therefore
exploring the possibility of sharing the facilities for
research with the University of Technology at Lae if the
Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Papua New Guinea,
Port Moresby is relocated there, failing which the research
has to be located at Keravat or Laloki. The Government of
PNG would inform the Bank by December 31, 1983 of the status
of this proposed arrangement with the University of Technology
( paras. 3.09 and 3.10);
(d) DPI is presently engaged in discussions with the Coffee and
Cocoa Industry Board on several alternative proposals.
Government will continue to discuss further developments with
the Bank in the process of reaching a final decision
(para. 3.11);
(e) the Government of PNG provided the details on curricula and
planned student intake for the Agricultural Certificate and
Diploma Courses (para. 3.16);
(f) the Department of Lands is currently assessing its technical
staff strength with a view to recruiting additional staff to
meet the Department's as well as DPI's requirements particu-
larly with reference to agricultural development projects
(para. 3.30);
(g) DPI engaged a consultant to conduct a review of PNG's
Quarantine and Animal Disease Legislation who failed to
produce a report. The Government of PNG will make a formal
request to New Zealand Government in April 1983 to carry out
the study. The study is expected to be completed by mid-1983.
The Government of PNG would inform the Bank by July 31, 1983
of the findings and action taken or proposed to be taken
(para. 3.33 and 3.36);
(h) the Government of PNG informed the Bank that UNDP fund for
financing part of fellowship component would not be available.
The loan amount has therefore been increased from US$13.9 mil-
lion to $14.1 million (para. 3.44);
(i) the Government of PNG furnished the names of the Project
Coordinator and Component Managers at negotiations (para. 5.01);
(j) the Government of PNG informed the Bank at negotiation that
the Crop Research Divison is expected to be established by
March 31, 1984 and the reorganization of the entire DPI to be
implemented by June 30, 1984 (para. 5.02).



- 49 -
7.02      With the above agreements the projects would be suitable for a
Bank loan of US$14.1 million with a 17 year maturity including a grace
period of four years. The borrower would be the Independent State of
Papua New Guinea.
