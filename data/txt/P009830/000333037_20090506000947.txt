advantages of potential crops would change as markets, p r i c e s , aud costs of
inputs change in the future.                   For the purpose of design of the f a c i l i t i e s ,

1 9 .           The main canal would extend from the reservoir t o the Rajasthan
border, generally reducing i n capacity a t each major turnout.                       It would
receive i t s water through gated headworks on the most northerly of the small
reservoirs adjacent t o the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River.                             Water
would normally be released from Sardar Sarovar Dam t o the minor reservoirs
through the canal power plant.                An i r r i g a t i o n bypass tunnel with an invert
elevation of 290 f t (88.4 m) would be provided t o release water from storage
i n the main reservoir below t h a t required f o r power releases (MDDL of 363 f t
(110.6 m)) so t h a t the additional storage i n the reservoir can be u t i l i z e d i n
emergency s i t u a t i o n s .

20.             The main canal would have an unreinforced concrete lining and side
slopes would be 2 : l with a variable bottom width and with appropriate water
depth, lined freeboard and bank freeboard.                         Radial gated cross-regulating
s t r u c t u r e s would be located on the canal as necessary t o control water levels
within s e t l i m i t s during normal and emergency operation, t o s t o r e a l l water
during shutdown and t o i s o l a t e reaches o r r i v e r crossings i n case of f a i l u r e .
Diversion t o branch canals would be through r a d i a l gated turnouts and no
other delivery f a c i l i t i e s would be constructed on the main canal.                   Gated
escapes of limited capacity would be provided.                         River crossings, where the
canal i s confined i n a s t r u c t u r e , would incorporate multiple b a r r e l s o r
channels t o allow isolation.of individual passages f o r repair.

21.             Branch canals would have channel configurations, in-line s t r u c t u r e s
and turnouts similar t o the main canal, though as canal depths reduce, s i d e
slopes may be steepened t o 1.5:l.                A l l diversions from branch canals t o
d i s t r i b u t a r i e s would be through r a d i a l gated turncuts.       The design of the
cross section and p r o f i l e of the d i s t r i b u t a r y channel and the type of in-line
regulators would be similar t o those adopted f o r the main and branch canals.
The d i s t r i b u t a r i e s would be operated t o maintain a near-constant water sur-
face elevation adjacent t o the SA turnout t o f a c i l i t a t e constant delivery
r a t e s t o the SAs.

22.             The SA would receive water from the d i s t r i b u t a r y from one turnout.
This s t r u c t u r e would have a calibrated adjustable flow-control device that
may be locked a t a given s e t t i n g and an open/shut gate immediately upstream.
Within the SAY lined minors with in-line control and drop s t r u c t u r e s , o r
pipelines would be i n s t a l l e d t o ensure appropriate flow conditions t o the
chaks.          The diversion structures t o the chaks would have fixed devices which
would assure consistent proportioning of the range of flows anticipated on
the minors, or lockable adjustable devices.                         There would be no d i r e c t farm
turnouts from the.minor canals.                 The water courses within the chaks would be
lined o r i n pipe t o 8 ha and in-line on/off gated structures would be
i n s t a l l e d a t the o u t l e t t o the 8 ha subchaks.         An on/off gated turnout struc-
ture on the unlined channel below 8 ha would be provided a t each farm tur-
nout.         The e n t i r e delivery system i n the SA would be free-draining.

23.             No discharge measuring structures would be provided i n the system.
Discharges would be determined by monitoring gate s e t t i n g s i n flow-regulating
structures and conveyance system turnouts t h a t would be calibrated in place.                         P

canals, s t r u c t u r e s , or c r i t i c a l embankment areas. Right-of-way    and vehicular
access would be provided t o allow inspection and repair of a l l f a c i l i t i e s ,

2 5 .          To avoid small SAs, lands severed from l a r g e r areas by canals, roads,

system.

sized t o s a t i s f y the service t o be provided t o the farmers and t o deliver the
M & I water as appropriate.             M & I water would generally have f i r s t p r i o r i t y t o

available during the buildup period, and the frequency with which c l a s s B
water would be available a t f u l l development ( s t a t i s t i c a l l y three years out

and water course system within the SA would be 0.9 lps/ha net CCA and the
water may be provided exclusively from surface water o r i n combination with
agency groundwater.                  Adopted delivery capacities t o SAs a r e summarized by

31.          Size of the Main Canal.        The capacity of each main canal reach would
r e f l e c t the simultaneous maximum demand imposed on it by the requirements
of the downstream branches and by Rajasthan.                        Since a l l the branches do not
peak simultaneously, the headworks capacity of the main canal would be l e s s
than the sum of the annual peaks on a l l the branches.                        Modifying f a c t o r s t o
peak capacity include concurrent v a r i a t i o n s i n p r e c i p i t a t i o n conditions
within the project area during k h a r i f , staggered planting dates and d i f f e r i n g
seasons of maximum i r r i g a t i o n between the regions.                These f a c t o r s reduce peak
values on the appropriate reaches.               A v a i l a b i l i t y of agency groundwater i n
various p a r t s of the command arbs a l s o reduces the peak demand f o r surface
water on t h e p a r t i c u l a r reach involved and f r e e s a proportion of the flow of
r i v e r water i n the main canal f o r meeting peaks on other branches.                        However,
uncertainty o f ' t h e amount, location and timing of development of agency
groundwater diminishes the degree of reliance which can be placed on t h i s
source f o r main canal sizing decisions.                    Flow requirements a t branch canal
heads a r e summarized i n t a b l e 3.        The main canal capacity of t h e headworks i s
estimated t o be 1,133 cumecs (40,000 cusecs).

32.             Control of the Conveyance and Delivery Systems.                  Conditions of water
surface elevations, canal discharge, and s t a t u s of gates i n regulating struc-
tures and turnouts of the main canal, branch canals, d i s t r i b u t a r i e s , and
branch pumping p l a n t s , would be monitored remotely from appropriate control
centers.           On-site sensors would indicate water surface elevations upstream
and downstream of regulating s t r u c t u r e s and a t other locations of p a r t i c u l a r
concern on the canals.              Water surfaces t o be maintained by g a t e s , gate posi-
tions of each gate i n each s t r u c t u r e , s t a t u s of the power supply (including
standby) would be other primary information transmitted t o the responsible
control center.             The data would be processed t o evaluate the i d e n t i f i e d
conditions leading t o control decisions f o r operation of the system.                            The
conditions would be appropriately displayed t o indicate the s t a t u s of the
f a c i l i t i e s and t o depict the physical relationships of the f a c i l i t i e s in the
f i e l d .     Audiovisual alarms would be displayed and actuated f o r each s i t e .

33.             Control of gates i n regulating s t r u c t u r e s and turnouts of
approximately 300 cusecs (8.5 cumecs) o r g r e a t e r would be possible by four
modes :

                controller and s e t t o maintain a selected water surface
                elevation upstream or downstream of the structure;

      ( c )     Remote s e t t i n g of the water surface t h a t the local controller
                i s t o maintain;

      (dl       Remote operation of a l l gates i n the structure, thus overriding
                the local operator.

A l l escape gates on the main and branch canals would be remotely controlled
and operated.

3 4 .           Gates on cross-regulator structures of l e s s than about 300 cusec
capacity and on turnouts t o v i l l a g e SAs would be locally controlled.
However, the upstream and downstream water surface elevations a t the cross
regulator and the s t a t u s of the SA turnouts (whether open o r shut) would be
remotely monitored a t appropriate control centers.                        The information would be
processed t o evaluate the identified conditions and t o make control decisions
which would be transmitted to the local controller a t the cross-regulation                                 .

                                                                                                              ,r
3 5 .           The SA i s served by an onloff free-draining system, which i s unregu-

system i s operating.               The water supply i s free-draining i n the chaks and i s
rotated within the chak according t o a fixed and predetermined schedule
organized and controlled by the water users within the chak.

3 6 .           Conrmunications.       Communication f a c i l i t i e s of high r e l i a b i l i t y would
be constructed linking a l l s i t e s to be monitored and controlled with t h e i r
designated control centers, and links would also be needed between a l l con-
t r o l - c e n t e r s i n the project.    Communication links would be provided t o relay
information exchanges between the agency s t a f f responsible f o r delivery t o
SAs, the SA, and the responsible control center.                        Therefore, a looped com-
munication system with backup would be provided throughout the project area.

3 7 .           Mobile radio transmitters and receivers would be provided f o r use by
operating personnel and linkages would be maintained t o the offices and
residences of key s t a f f .          This equipment would have 24-hourlday r e l i a b i l i t y .

Groundwater Drainage and System

44.             The groundwater drainage and conjunctive use a s p e c t s of t h e p r o j e c t
a r e described i n d e t a i l i n annex 6.                       The agency would have r e s p o n s i b i l i t y f o r
ensuring adequate groundwater drainage.                                   However, a n o b j e c t i v e of t h e p r o j e c t
would be t o provide t h e drainage s o f a r a s p o s s i b l e by wells--a                                   v e r t i c a l

     46  .           Operation of public Sector Drainage and Conjunctive Use.                      The public
     sector conjunctive use tubewell systems would be f u l l y integrated with and
     would discharge i n t o the surface water conveyance system a t the v i l l a g e SA
     level (about 500 ha), and would be powered through a dedicated mains system
     from the 66/11 kV substations.                   Delivery of water from the conjunctive use
     wells would be synchronized with surface water d e l i v e r i e s t o the v i l l a g e SA
     t o ensure the t o t a l water supply and permit controlled blending when neces-
     sary.         b i s implies centralized control of well operaton or an automated
     control linked t o flows of surface water i n the v i l l a g e feeder canal.                       The
     drainage wells would be c e n t r a l l y controlled and would be operated
     exclusively f o r water level control t o ensure that the water level never
     r i s e s t o l e s s than 5 m from land surface.

   --Roads

     47  .           Project roads would be completed i n the course of constructing the
     i r r i g a t i o n and drainage system t o assure a l l weather access t o a l l f a c i l i t i e s
     from the headworks t o the SA.                  The c l a s s of road would depend on the s i z e of
     equipment needed during maintenance and the daily t r a f f i c load, p a r t i c u l a r l y
     where public t r a v e l i s t o be accommodated on a j o i n t l y used road.                 Recogniz-
     ing the minor nature of most of the f a c i l i t i e s within the SAY access t o these
     areas would not require extensive road work and passage s u i t a b l e f o r l i g h t
     vehicles and motor cycles along the minor canals would be provided.

     48.             The existing roads f o r public use within the command area f a l l into
     the following categories:                  national highways; S t a t e highways; major d i s t r i c t
     roads; other d i s t r i c t roads; and v i l l a g e roads.             The t o t a l length of a l l
     categories i n the command area i s about 6670 km with an average density of
     0.21 km/km2.               The minimum need i s assessed 'as 10,360 km of roads.              About
     one-third of the e x i s t i n g network would require reconstruction, and the
     balance would need considerable improvement and upgrading.

     Operation and Maintenance (ObM)                 I/

     49.             F a c i l i t i e s . An indispensible component, inherent in a delivery
     system a r e the O&M f a c i l i t i e s .      These c o n s t i t u t e the buildings a t the Project
     Control Center and a t the area centers that would contain the O&M s t a f f and
     the equipment needed f o r OdM.                 Subarea o f f i c e s would also be constructed i f
G


     the travel distance f o r the s t a f f dealing with SA operations becomes too
     great.          Storage f o r supplies, equipment, vehicles, and r e p a i r shops f o r l i g h t
s    and heavy equipment would be s t r a t e g i c a l l y located.               Residences would be
     constructed f o r key s t a f f a t various levels i n order t o make supervising
     personnel available and on c a l l 24-hours a day througliout the year.                         The
     design of these f a c i l i t i e s would be launched immediately so they may be ready

and functioning s i x months before commencing delivery system operations.
Accelerated completion appears warranted so t h a t some f a c i l i t i e s may be used
by agency personnel during the construction phase.

50.             ObM Staffing.              Immediate structuring of the skeleton ObM organization
would be undertaken.                      The selection of a highly qualified cadre t o define t h e
detailed organizational s t r u c t u r e and operating maintenance procedures and
manuals, formulate farmer education programs, schedule and monitor the timely
completion of f a c i l i t i e s and procurement, and formulate and i n s t i t u t e s t a f f
t e s t i n g , h i r i n g , and training would e n t a i l major e f f o r t s .        The complexity and
importance of creating the ObM e n t i t y and prompt s t a f f i n g t o required l e v e l s
place t h i s e f f o r t i n p a r a l l e l with the other primary actions of the agency.

                                111. Operational Plan for Water Deliveries-

General

51.             The conveyance system must be designed and operated i n a manner t o
make d e l i v e r i e s t o t.he three primary customers:                    Rajasthan-,-MI users, and
farmers within the project area.                      The f i r s t two do not impose sudden fluctua-
tions i n demand and d e l i v e r i e s would be made a t a limited number of points.
Rajasthan would receive a l l d e l i v e r i e s a t the terminus of the main canal a t
the s t a t e border.              M & I water would be delivered from designated turnouts,
from branch canals i n most cases.                     The a g r i c u l t u r a l delivery, with i t s great
v a r i a t i o n s and numerous delivery points, d i c t a t e s the l e v e l of operational
f l e x i b i l i t y of the system under normal conditions.                      Emergency conditions,
present yet more demanding conditions and the response necessary t o minimize
losses and damage due t o sudden changes in flow o r malfunction of f a c i l i t i e s
imposes even more s t r i n g e n t requirements on the system.

52.             The plan of operation f o r which the delivery system is formulated
would assure the services t o the farmers a s described within the l i m i t s of
safety and r e l i a b i l i t y and would c o n s t i t u t e an advance in r e l i a b i l i t y and in
accommodating farmer needs b e t t e r than e x i s t i n g systems i n India.                      The
f a c i l i t i e s would permit f u r t h e r improvements i n the future; however, the
basic features incorporated i n the adopted i n i t i a l plan would assure a f u l l y
adequate delivery.

Delivery Schedules f o r Rajasthan and f o r M&I Water i n Guiarat

53  .           Deliveries of water t o Rajasthan would be s e t f o r each seven-day
period, r e f l e c t i n g d i r e c t i v e s of the NCA.        Reasonable i r r i g a t i o n schedules
would be used f o r both kharif and r a b i , with a peak of 72 cumecs (2,500 c f s ) .
Delivery schedules f o r M&I water would be established j o i n t l y with the prin-
c i p a l users and the responsible s t a t e a u t h o r i t i e s .             Points of delivery and
f o r t n i g h t l y amounts would be s e t t o allow provision f o r them t o be included
i n system designs.                  Village supplies f o r domestic use would be provided from
wells o r from canal f a c i l i t i e s , as permitted under normal operations f o r
a g r i c u l t u r a l d e l i v e r i e s and no special provisions would be made.

                                                                                             ANNEX 6
                                                                                              Page    19




54.             Quantities and dates of d e l i v e r i e s would vary annually and by season.
The basic design of the system assumes d e l i v e r i e s t o support a kharif crop
and a r a b i crop with NWDT water allocations.                    These d e l i v e r i e s w i l be used a s
one limit. However, f o r a substantial period of years surplus waters would
be available t o t h e lands f i r s t developed before the remaining lands a r e
brought i n t o service.                Additionally, surplus water supplies would be avail-
a b l e a t frequent i n t e r v a l s i n the Narmada River before the numerous
water-consuming projects planned upstream in the basin a r e completed.
Accordingly, procedures have been formulated t o e s t a b l i s h annual and seasonal
delivery capacities t h a t would accommodate a l l water supply conditions judged
t o be reasonable.

55.             Classes of A,          B, and C water have been established, as discussed
e a r l i e r .    Deliver schedules w i l be developed f o r the seasonal allocations of
these classes of water through a s e r i e s of exchanges of information between
the agency and each v i l l a g e SA.

56.             Projections of available c l a s s A,B,         and C water f o r the water year
beginning April 1 would be made by the agency on March 15, broken down i n t o
the periods f o r May 1 t o October 31 and November 1 t o April 30.                             Estimates
would-be refined on August 1 f o r the f i r s t s i x months and September 15 and
October 15 f o r the second s i x months.                Confidence l e v e l s i n the estimates of
available c l a s s A,            B,   and C water would be s t a t e d with each projection..

57.             Projected annual volumes of water f o r agriculture would,be allocated
among regions i n s t r i c t accordance with project p o l i c i e s and procedures so
t h a t the agency can s u s t a i n the farmer's          confidence and preclude factors t h a t
would a l t e r the established equitable allotments.                     Some negotiations i n
s e t t i n g seasonal allocations may be necessary i f conveyance capacity in the
main canal l i m i t s f u l l u t i l i z a t i o n of surplus waters without staggering
regional peak demands.                   The day of the week when d e l i v e r i e s would be s t a r t e d
t o s p e c i f i c SAs would be estimated i n anticipation of the d e s i r e s of the
service area farmers.                   Some staggering among adjacent SAs on the same dis-
t r i b u t a r y would a s s i s t agency personnel i n assuring a r e l i a b l e service.             But
t h i s arrangement would be worked out with the SAs when the f i n a l schedules
a r e established.

58.             The i r r i g a t i o n schedule of farmers within each SA would be formulated
c o l l e c t i v e l y by the farmers.        Recognizing t h a t the system design d i c t a t e s
t h a t a l l farmers within a given SA be served under a common deliver schedule,
considerable i n t e r n a l public'negotiations would be necessary.                         A l l crops
r a i s e d within a SA would therefore have t o be compatible with the adopted
schedule and available private groundwater supplies.

59.             The SA i r r i g a t i o n schedule would r e f l e c t the s i z e of the season's
individual i r r i g a t i o n s and the dates when the a l l o t t e d amounts a r e t o be
delivered.             Since the scheme of operation i s predicated on adjusting service
f a c i l i t i e s once a t the beginning of a season and a l l d e l i v e r i e s t o a SA would

be on f o r a seven-day period, the farmers must s e l e c t the volumes of i r r i g a -
t i o n s t o be used f o r d e l i v e r i e s throughout the season.          An i r r i g a t i o n would
be l a r g e enough t o meet the maximum demands under the adopted cropping when
delivered a t seven-day i n t e r v a l s during peak periods.                Physical r e s t r i c t i o n s
w i l l be imposed by the maximum d e l i v e r capacity of the f a c i l i t i e s constructed
i n the SA.

60.           A SA committee would forward the SA cropping plan and the i r r i g a t i o n
schedule t o the agency by April 10 and September 25.                        Subsequently, the
modified cropping plans and i r r i g a t i o n schedules based on the August 1 water
supply data would be submitted a s soon a s the service area has resolved any
desired revisions.                  Actual crop planting plans would be submitted t o the
agency by June 1 and November 15.                     A SA may modify water deliver dates during
the season by submitting a revision one week before the scheduled delivery.

61.            The agency would receive SA cropping plans and i r r i g a t i o n schedules
a t the area control o f f i c e s .           The cropping pattern would be coded on display
maps.        Delivery schedules and discharges would be compiled and the time,

updated a s new information i s received from SAs.                       Identical information would
be forwarded t o the Project Control Center and information on a l l areas would
be aggregated and displayed t o best f a c i l i t a t e system operations.                                     -

tion--would have t o be made during k h a r i f , i f advantage i s t o be taken of
precipitation.              Procedures f o r the agency t o take action and the conditions
under which such actions would be effected would be formulated j o i n t l y by the
agency and representatives from the SAs.

63.           Records of a c t u a l d e l i v e r i e s made t o each SA would be compiled
monthly by the agency.                  Copies would be delivered t o each SA and t o the Area
Control Center, the Project Control Center, and the I r r i g a t i o n Department i n
Gandhinagar       .
Scheme of Operation:                  System-Normal

64.          A controlled-volume operation has been adopted f o r the conveyance
system (i.e.,           above the SA level).            Through proper manipulation-flow regulat-
ing structures, the amount of water contained i n each reach of canal can be
a l t e r e d a s desired t o accommodate operational needs.                 Though flow i n the
canals would vary throughout the year in response t o scheduled d e l i v e r i e s ,
the volume of water within the reaches of the canal would remain near t h a t
found a t f u l l discharge.              To meet the minor mismatching          and short-term
changes i n local d e l i v e r i e s , water would be drawn out of o r placed i n t o
"storage" within the canal reaches as conditions d i c t a t e .                   These accommoda-
tions would be made through careful monitoring of surface water elevations i n
the reaches and appropriate adjustments of flow regulating gates in the

                                                                                          Page        21



canals.        No s p i l l i n g of water from i t s conveyance system would occur during
normal operation.

65.          Delivery t o a SA would be "on" or "off" a t a constant r a t e preset f o r
the season during the periods of delivery, which would a l s o be
pre-established f o r the season.                      Within the SA, an unregulated free-draining
delivery system would convey water t o chaks consisting of 25 t o 65 ha.                                 Water
would flow continuously t o a l l chaks i n proportion t o t h e i r net CCA during
period t h a t water is delivered t o the SA.

66.          Delivery within a chak would be through a regulated free-draining
system.        Open channels with s t r u c t u r e s o r gated pipes would allow r o t a t i n g
full-chak flows t o individual farmers i f they own farms greater than 8 ha
o r groups of farms constituting about 5 t o 8 ha t o t a l .                   The farmers within
these areas would e s t a b l i s h an appropriate r o t a t i o n depenaent on individual
farm areas.

67.           The v a r i a b l e discharge control devices and on/off gates a t the head
of the SA would be adjusted and operated by agency s t a f f .                     A l l s t r u c t u r e s i n
the minors and subminors would a l s o be inspected and adjusted, i f necessary,
by agency s t a f f .

Scheme of Operation:               System Emergency

68.           Emergency conditions may be expected t o a r i s e i n the system due t o a
v a r i e t y of causes.         By d e f i n i t i o n these a r e unpredictable, requiring rapid
adjustments i n operations without advanced notice.                         Sudden intense precipita-
t i o n , breaches i n canal embankments, blockage of canals, and ruptures of
stream crossings would be possible emergency causes.                          Loss of power to pump-
ing plants on t h e Saurashtra and Kutch branches would c r e a t e emergencies i n
those subsystems and, t o reduced degrees, i n the main canal reaches serving
them.        The operations required t o respond t o various emergencies would d i f -
f e r .

69.          A plan f o r system operations in response t o each type of emergency
would be formulated before the system is placed i n operation.                          This would
require a description of each type of emergency, including t h e s p e c i f i c
location, the changes i n flow o r other conditions i n the canal t h a t can be
used t o detect and describe the emergency, and the exact measures t o be
taken-for        example, the gate changes t o be made and the sequence of such
changes.        It i s essential that these plans be formulated i n advance--time
does not permit an analysis t o determine an appropriate response t o an emer-
gency.

70.          The anticipated actions i n response t o emergencies would be formuated
assuming t h a t system s t a t u s can be continuously monitored and t h a t regulatory
gates a t 300 cusecs and greater capacity can be activated remotely i n a
sequence appropriate t o the emergency.                      Emergencies t o be considered (and
t h e i r locations) i n the main canal would include the following:

                                                                                         ANNEX 6
                                                                                         Page  22



(a)   Failure of embankments would be assessed f o r s p e c i f i c
      conditions, since foundations and embankments a r e designed
      l i k e major dam embankments, a breach may be such a remote
      p o s s i b i l i t y t h a t it can be ignored.

(b)   Failure of embankment due t o flood and erosion from cross-
      draining streams and r i v e r s would be analyzed i n a r a t i o n a l
      manner, and possible e f f e c t s on the canal would be described.
      Any inflow can a f f e c t the system s i g n i f i c a n t l y and breaching
      e f f e c t s would depend on degree of inflow.                    These occurrences
      would be s i t e specific.

( c ) Obstruction due t o s l i d e s i n t o the canal may be the most
      common problem.              The p o t e n t i a l amount of material, r a t e
      of movement, and the e f f e c t s on flow capacity and stage would
      be assessed.             With the wide section adopted, t h i s type of
      obstruction usually would not have a major impact on the upper
      reaches of the main canal, and again, s l i d e p o t e n t i a l is~sitc
      specific,

( d l Failure or breaching of r i v e r crossings would have by f a r the
      g r e a t e s t impact on the system.               I n t h e extr'eme, a f u l l rupture
      could suddenly d i v e r t a l l canal flow from both upstream and
      downstream of the breach .and the r e s u l t i n g rapid drawdown could
      cause severe damage t o the lining and sloughing of the banks.
      Rapid i s o l a t i o n of t h e s i t e , both upstream and downstream, would be
      c r i t i c a l t o minimize damage t o t h e crossing and damage downstream
      i n smaller r i v e r s .        Further, the capability t o close down t h e
      e n t i r e system downstream of the breach and upstream t o the extent
      of d e l i v e r i e s passing t h a t point would be e s s e n t i a l i n avoiding
      major costs due t o damaged l i n i n g and overtopping of canal
      embankments           .
( e l Sudden intense storms may cause a complete drop i n demand f o r
      i r r i g a t i o n and flooding.        Protection against such storms would
      require rapid and major reductions of flow in the affected p a r t s
      of the system,               Although intense storms may be c a l l e d normal
      happenings, the need f o r preplanning of operations and response
      c a p a b i l i t i e s of the system j u s t i f i e s placing t h i s source of
      damage under the anergency category.                        The possible extent of
      storms--geographically              and i n terms of volume and degree of
      r e l i a b l e forecasting--would            be ascertained f o r each subsystem
      and the impacts and the necessary responses of the system would be
      described.

Introduct ion

1.                Increased recharge i n the command area i s a natural and inevitable
r e s u l t of the introduction of an i r r i g a t i o n system based on imported surface
water.          This has the possibly beneficial e f f e c t of increasing the groundwater
resource available f o r development, and therefore the t o t a l water resource,
i f the abstracted water i s of usable chemical quality for i r r i g a t i o n .                      It also
has a possible negative e f f e c t , i f the additional recharge exceeds the n a t u r a l
drainage capacity of the aquifer system and, the excess water i s taken into
storage.           This r e s u l t s i n a r i s i n g water table and, ultimately, i n the develop-
ment of a waterlogging and secondary s o i l s a l i n i z a t i o n hazard.                    Both situa-
t i o n s , which are not mutually exclusive, pose planning and design problems f o r
i r r i g a t i o n and drainage systems, which aim a t maximizing a scarce water supply
and preservation of the optimum environment f o r crop production.

2.                The physical c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the rocks underlying the command area
may control whether a system may be drained v e r t i c a l l y by wells o r whether only
horizontal drainage i s possible, and whether d i r e c t public sector intervention
i s technically and/or economically f e a s i b l e f o r development of groundwater f o r
i r r i g a t i o n or provision of v e r t i c a l drainage sector wells.              In some cases, an
aquifer system that i s s u i t a b l e f o r public sector wells may be developed by the
private sector & a degree t h a t inadvertantly provides the necessary groundwater
drainage requirement and controls the water table.                         In other cases, low-aquifer
yield prescribes t h a t the only f e a s i b l e mode of groundwater development i s by
the private sector.                However, it must be accepted that the private sector i s
motivated only t o pump f o r i r r i g a t i o n ; any drainage benefit i s incidental.
Thus groundwater q u a l i t y f i n a l l y controls whether the private sector may be
expected to contribute to groundwater drainage.

3 .               The Sardar Sarovar command area presents a range of aquifer condi-
t i o n s , groundwater q u a l i t i e s , natural drainage conditions, and degrees of
existing groundwater development.                       The aquifer conditions range from "hardrock"
with low yield thaf can be developed only by the private sector, t o thick
alluvium containing highly permeable aquifer material i n which high-yielding
public sector wells can be constructed, and t o thick clay sequences that are
not suitable f o r i r r i g a t i o n wells of any kind and, i f drainage i s required,
only a horizontal drainage solution i s possible.

4.                The chemical q u a l i t y of the groundwater ranges from suitable f o r
d i r e c t use f o r i r r i g a t i o n , through suitable f o r i r r i g a t i o n a f t e r blending with

                                                                                          ANNEX 7
                                                                                          Page  2


good q u a l i t y surface water, t o highly s a l i n e water t h a t would not be f e a s i b l e
t o use i n a blend.        The c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the s o i l t o which the water i s
applied and the quantity of i r r i g a t i o n water available f o r application or as
r a i n f a l l largely determine the q u a l i t y of the i r r i g a t i o n water t h a t can be
u t i l i z e d .

5.               The natural drainage conditions range from areas with s u f f i c i e n t
r e l i e f or proximity t o deeply incised streams such t h a t additional recharge
due to surface water i r r i g a t i o n can be disposed of as subsurface runoff, t o
broad f l a t plains or interfluves where accumulation of the additional recharge
i n storage would be ,inevitable i n the absence of some form of a r t i f i c i a l
drainage.          The heavy clay of the coastal alluvium around the Gulf of Cambay
demands horizontal drainage, and would then require a very close network t o
be e f f e c t i v e that would involve very high cost.

6 .              Within the Sardar Sarovar command area, the groundwater system's
response t o recharge (mainly from r a i n f a l l ) and abstraction has been monitored
i n terms of water level change f o r the past decade through a network of obser-
vation wells.          The network is presently being strengthened- i n the- Fhase 1 area
(Narmada-Mahi doab) by i n s t a l l a t i o n of specially constructed and located
piezometers i n anticipation of the additional water t a b l e monitoring require-
ments, which would a r i s e when surface water i r r i g a t i o n through the Sardar
Sarovar system i s introduced.              The hydrogeological and groundwater q u a l i t y
conditions i n the command area have been mapped wit'h f a i r accuracy.                      The growth
of groundwater development by the public and private sectors has been monitored

structed and calibrated f o r the a l l u v i a l aquifer system of the Phase 1 area.
It has been run to provide forecasts of the groundwater system's responses to
various development scenarios f o r surface water and groundwater i n terms of

quantitative estimates of the amount and d i s t r i b u t i o n of the groundwater
drainage requirement.

Type of Private and Public Sector Groundwater Development f o r Coniunctive Use
and Drainage

7 .              Any method of groundwater development by the private or public sectors
within a command area increases the t o t a l water supply and thus implies some
level of conjunctive use.           The private sector may u t i l i z e dug wells,
dug-cum-bored         wells or tubewells of various capacities.                   Dug wells and
dug-cum-bored         wells, constructed by the private sector are the only p r a c t i c a l
solution f o r groundwater development i n hard rock areas; whereas, a l l three
types of wells are available t o the sector i n areas with thick a l l u v i a l
aquifers and i n the Mesozoic sandstone areas of Saurashtra.                          The private sector
wells serve individual commands that also receive surface water supplies, o r
can be i n s t a l l e d on high spots i n the surface water command that cannot be
reached by gravity.

8.               Public sector groundwater development f o r i r r i g a t i o n would be by
                                                  3
tubewells with discharges of 100 m /h ( 1 cusec) or more.                          As presently con-
ceived, the tubewell system would be f u l l y integrated with and would discharge
i n t o the surface water conveyance system a t the v i l l a g e area level (about 500
ha) f o r conjunctive use.        Because of the location of the point of delivery of

                                                                                     ANNEX 7
                                                                                     Page 3


          groundwater to the surface water,conveyance and because, in some cases, of the
          need to blend poor quality groundwater with good quality surface water, the
          wells would be centrally controlled. This would be achieved either through
          dedicated 11 kV power lines with centralized switch gear at the 66/11 kV sub-
          stations or by automating the wells to synchronize their operation with surface
          water flows to the village area that they serve.

          9.        Some wells would almost certainly be installed exclusively for
          drainage of saline groundwater that cannot be used for irrigation, even with
          blending.   Provision of such wells would be a public sector undertaking. They
          would be centrally controlled through dedicated power lines and would be
          provided with the necessary conveyance facility to discharge to a surface drain
          at a suitable point.

          10.       The distribution by regions (annex4, map IBRD 17939) of the various

11.               The tabulated data show t h a t 57% of the gross command area i s under-
l a i n by thick a l l u v i a l aquifer system.               Moreover, about half of the a l l u v i a l
aquifer area contains groundwater ( a t l e a s t i n the upper layers) t h a t i s too
s a l i n e f o r d i r e c t use f o r i r r i g a t i o n and would require blending.         This almost
c e r t a i n l y implies a public sector operation.                     Hardrocks occupy 23% of t h e
gross command area and the groundwater i n such areas can be developed only by
the p r i v a t e sector.               The areas with t h i c k clay deposits a r e problematic, a s
such deposits would yield l i t t l e water even i f i t s q u a l i t y i s good.                   Dug
wells penetrating t o underlying hardrocks could be successful as water sup-
p l i e s , though they would provide limited drainage benefit.

12.               I f the d i s t r i b u t i o n of the CCA within the gross command area i s
considered, somewhat d i f f e r e n t proportions of rock types and water q u a l i t i e s
a r e found.            Alluvial aquifer underlie about 60% of the CCA and i n 55% of t h i s
area the water must be blended.                       Hardrock aquifers underlie 24% of the CCA,
and i n 80% of t h i s area the water q u a l i t y i s s u i t a b l e f o r d i r e c t use f o r
i r r i g a t i o n , while the balance i s too s a l i n e f o r use.            I n the CCA underlain by
thick clay deposits (15%), only about 40% of the area contains groundwater of
s u i t a b l e q u a l i t y f o r use.        Thus, 57% of the CCA i s underlain by good q u a l i t y
water, 33% by water (contained i n a l l u v i a l aquifers) t h a t requires blending,
and 10% contains water t h a t i s too s a l i n e f o r any use.

C r i t e r i a f o r Groundwater Development f o r Conjunctive Use and Drainage

13.               The following general c r i t e r i a would be applied f o r planning
groundwater development f o r conjunctive use and drainage:

      (a)       A l l groundwater development i n hardrock areas or areas with t h i n
                a l l u v i a l cover over hardrock would be by the p r i v a t e s e c t o r ;

      (b)       I n areas where thick a l l u v i a l aquifers contain d i r e c t l y usable
                groundwater, there i s an element of choice between private and public
                sector development.               While it i s recognized t h a t private sector
                development incurs higher cost i n c a p i t a l , and OdM, these a r e out-
                weighed by the higher return t o water i n the private s e c t o r , which i s
                about 50% higher than a canal water supply.                      Private sector develop-
                ment would, therefore, be encouraged i n such areas.                      The f i n a l deci-
                sion of whether public sector conjunctive use would be planned f o r
                would depend on the i n t e n s i t y of p r i v a t e sector development and the
                possible danger of development of waterlogging.                      I n general, it may
                be assumed t h a t i n areas where p r i v a t e groundwater i r r i g a t e s more
                than 40% of the cropped area a t the time of planning decision, public
                sector conjunctive use wduld not be required;

      (c)       In a l l u v i a l aquifer areas where t h e groundwater q u a l i t y d i c t a t e s t h a t
                blending with surface water would be necessary f o r use of the water
                f o r i r r i g a t i o n , public sector conjunctive use would be planned from
                the outset;

      (dl       I n a l l u v i a l aquifer area where the water q u a l i t y would be u n f i t for
                i r r i g a t i o n even a f t e r blending, v e r t i c a l drainage wells would be

       Regulation of Discharge from P u b l i c S e c t o r Conjunctive Use Wells

       15.               For a c o n s i d e r a b l e period during t h e development of t h e Sardar
       Sarovar i r r i g a t i o n system, t h e r e would be a s u r p l u s of s u r f a c e water.                            The
       primary f u n c t i o n of t h e p u b l i c s e c t o r w e l l s would be f o r groundwater drainage
       during t h i s p e r i o d , though they would have an i n c r e a s i n g i r r i g a t i o n b e n e f i t
       a s t h e i r r i g a t e d s u r f a c e extends and t h e s u r f a c e water i r r i g a t i o n supply,
       i n terms of d e l t a , g r a d u a l l y d e c r e a s e s .           The w e l l f i e l d s i n i t i a l l y i n s t a l l e d
       would be designed t o optimize t h e drainage o p e r a t i o n , though a l l u s a b l e
       groundwater pumped would be disposed of through the i r r i g a t i o n system.                                             The
       optimum drainage o p e r a t i o n is provided by h i g h l y u t i l i z e d , high-yielding
       w e l l s t h a t minimizes t h e number of water p o i n t s r e q u i r e d .                     However, i f blend-

       of s u r f a c e water t o t h e v i l l a g e SA.


 e.    16.               During any ( r o t a t i o n ) week when t h e v i l l a g e a r e a i s being s u p p l i e d ,
       t h e s u r f a c e water would be d e l i v e r e d continuously i n t h e v i l l a g e a r e a f e e d e r
       c a n a l .    However, i t cannot be ensured t h a t t h e power supply f o r pumping would
       be a v a i l a b l e f o r a 24-hr/day.                 It i s assumed that a 16-hr/day power supply
       can be ensured.                   It would therefore be necessary to regulate the 16-hours
       inflow from t h e w e l l ( s ) t o a continuous 24-hour outflow t o t h e v i l l a g e f e e d e r
       canal a t a c o n s t a n t r a t e .            This would be achieved through a s u i t a b l y s i z e d ,

Programming I n s t a l l a t i o n of P u b l i c Sector Conjunctive Use and Drainage Wells

17.               As p u b l i c s e c t o r w e l l s would be served by dedicated power l i n e s , it
would be necessary t o i n s t a l l them i n c l u s t e r s .               It therefore follows that
a r e a s t h a t a r e developing a groundwater drainage hazard, o r e x h i b i t such a
hazard from t h e o u t s e t , must be recognized a s s u b s t a n t i a l blocks so t h a t t h e
i n s t a l l a t i o n of t h e w e l l s , pumping equipment, conveyance system, and the
a s s o c i a t e d power supply can be programmed.                  The primary groundwater l e v e l

Public Sector Well Network Design

18.               A s s t a t e d previously, t h e primary f u n c t i o n of t h e p u b l i c s e c t o r
w e l l s would be t o provide ve::tical                  drainage, though t h e w e l l s would have a
very important f u n c t i o n f o r augmenting water supply i n t h e long term.                                 The
well network must t h e r e f o r e be capable of removing, w i t h i n t h e annual
hydrological c y c l e , t h a t p a r t of t h e a d d i t i d n a l recharge imposed by deep
p e r c o l a t i o n of imported s u r f a c e water f o r i r r i g a t i o n t h a t would otherwise
be taken i n t o s t o r a g e , r e s u l t i n g i n a, r i s i n g w a t e r . t a b l e .

19.               With a d i s t r i b u t i o n system l i n e d t o 8 ha, it may be assumed t h a t t h e
deep p e r c o l a t i o n is d i s t r i b u t e d more o r l e s s e q u a l l y on the i r r i g a t e d sur-
f a c e .     The assumption breaks down only i n t h e v i c i n i t y of t h e l a r g e r elements
of t h e d i s t r i b u t i o n system t h a t run f o r long periods of t h e y e a r , and where
seepage l o s s e s t o groundwater a r e l o c a l l y concentrated.                        Thus, the drainage
w e l l network must be d i s t r i b u t e d over t h e i r r i g a t e d s u r f a c e t o be e f f e c t i v e .

20.               Consider an e q u a l l y spaced network of drainage w e l l s and pumping
a t the same r a t e and f o r t h e same time during t h e year.                            Each well would be
surrounded by a c e l l of equal s i z e with boundaries defined by the intercep-
t i o n of i t s cone of depression with t h e cone of t h e n e a r e s t adjacent w e l l .
A l l water taken from a w e l l would be provided from w i t h i n i t s c e l l .                          I f the

a d d i t i o n a l annual recharge imposed by t h e i r r i g a t i o n system on t h e c e l l a r e a ,

Present Value Cost of Water

45.     The present value cost of water based on well condition and opera-
tion as described under para 39 and 42 can be derived from the following cost
stream, assuming a discount rate of 12% and a 30-year project life:

         Initial capital expenditure in year 0        =   Rs 237,500
        Annual maintenance cost                       =   Rs.  4,000
        Annual economic cost of energy                =   Rs 46,660
        Replacement of well in year 15                =   Rs 72,200
        Replacement of pump in years 10 and 20        =   Rs  14,700
        Replacement of piped conveyance in year 20    =   Rs 59,100

The annualized cost of delivering 1 m3 of water through the regula-
tion tank into the delivery canal to the village SA would be Rs 0.14/rn3.

                        t h i s training could be furnished separately t o O&M s t a f f and
                        farmer representatives, there would probably be significant
                        benefit t o having both groups p a r t i c i p a t e i n the same c l a s s e s ;

     ( e l      The training f a c i l i t y would be established and s t a f f e d a t the very

                project--the          f a c i 1 i t i . e ~and t h e i r operation, can be provided t o the
                0&M s t a f f who would i n i t i a t e water d e l i v e r i e s t o .the project lands.
                The f a c i l i t y need only be adequate f o r the' training of s t a f f f o r one
                o r possibly two d i s t r i c t s and portions of s t a f f from one division of
                a region a t one time, because cadre f o r additional increments of the
                p r o j e c t , as completed, would be drawn i n part from the then existing
                O&M s t a f f .      This training a c t i v i t y , however, would remain r e l a t i v e l y
                constant over a long period of time as the project expands.

     (£1       Manuals presenting procedures and standard O&M methods, policy
               manuals, and administrative and management ins truc- t ions, would be
               prepared in advance of s i g n i f i c a n t O&M a c t i v i t i e s on the project.
               These would be modified as experience i n the f i r s t portions of the
               project i s gained.                The i n i t i a l f u l l s e t of documents, however, must
               be completed several months p r i o r t o turning water i n t o the main
                canal and three months p r i o r t o s t a f f training t o allow preparation
                of training lessons and materials.


2 .            The guiding objective of the project i s t o furnish an adequate,
equitably d i s t r i b u t e d supply of water t o each farmer i n the project.                       The
water would be distributed i n a manner t h a t assures g r e a t e s t benefits t o the
farmers a t the l e a s t cost consistent with good service, long system l i f e , and
sound financial practice.                       Further, the project i s t o remove excess
p r e c i p i t a t i o n and control groundwater levels t o prevent detrimental e f f e c t s
on crop production and operate and maintain these f a c i l i t i e s i n the same
manner as the water delivery f a c i l i t i e s .                         The importance of these project
objectives in the formulation, functioning, and effectiveness of the OdM
e n t i t y cannot be overstressed.                       A s p e c i f i c statement must be made, as a c l e a r

  13.             Minor and subminor channels w i t h i n t h e SA would convey water propor-
  t i o n a t e l y t o chaks of approximately 50-ha                        s i z e .     R o t a t i o n a l use of t h e water

  a u t h o r i t y and r e s p o n s i b i l i t y f o r channel maintenance down t o t h e subchak
. l e v e l .     To t h e e x t e n t p o s s i b l e , day-to-day          maintenance w i t h i n t h e SA would be
  c a r r i e d out by farmers, w i t h p r o j e c t a s s i s t a n c e a s a p p r o p r i a t e .             A monetary

  t h e SA members.              The SAIC chairman a l s o would be r e s p o n s i b l e f o r forwarding
  crop and water records w i t h i n i t s boundaries.                                I n t h i s t a s k he would have t h e

  16.             Water assessments c o l l e c t e d by t h e d i s t r i c t would g e n e r a l l y r e f l e c t

  0&M and a d m i n i s t r a t i o n .      Delivery of f u l l water a l l o t m e n t t o t h e SA would be

  17.             SAIC chairmen from a l l SAs w i t h i n a d i s t r i c t would form t h e D i s t r i c t

19.            To c a r r y out maintenance, each block would be served by 3
l a b o r e r s l l i g h t equipment o p e r a t o r s , and one maintenance foreman who
p r e f e r a b l y would r e s i d e w i t h i n t h e block.              These people would r e p o r t t o t h e
a s s i s t a n t d i s t r i c t watermaster         -  maintenance and construction.                      The block
work s t a t i o n would have a small o f f i c e and s t o r e room, a fenced yard and
s t o r a g e shed(s) f o r s u p p l i e s , vehicles,and equipment.                           I f t h e block i s com-

system.           S e c u r i t y would be improved by t h i s arrangement.

20.            D i s t r i c t .   The d i s t r i c t , headed by a watermaster, would be t h e lowest
a d m i n i s t r a t i v e u n i t of t h e p r o j e c t and i s t h e e n t i t y t h a t d i r e c t l y serves
t h e SAs.          As indicated i n f i g u r e 2 , t h e - d i s t r i c t would s e r v i c e approximately
50 SAs grouped i n t o 5 blocks of 10 SAs each.                                 Hence, t h e d i s t r i c t would
normally have a s i z e of approximately 25,000 ha, with 50 SA t u r n o u t s and
about 100 km of canal and drainage channels.

21.            A canal operator would be r e s p o n s i b l e f o r operating approximately 30
km of canal, about two and one-half blocks, serving about 25 CAs.                                              I n addi-
t i o n t o h i s normal water o p e r a t i o n d u t i e s , he would be spending some time
each day working with t h e SAIC chairman t o review operations w i t h i n t h e SAs
and t o f a c i l i t a t e l i a i s o n between t h e d i s t r i c t watermaster and t h e SA and
i n d i v i d u a l farmers       .

22.             Each d i s t r i c t would r e q u i r e , on average, only t h r e e canal o p e r a t o r s
and t h a t t h i s i s s u f f i c i e n t t o ensure coverage of a l l operations even i n t h e
event of a c c i d e n t , s i c k n e s s , o r o t h e r causes of absence of one member.                          The
very l a r g e d i s t a n c e s and a r e a s served by each operator i s a r e f l e c t i o n of t h e
r e l a t i v e ease of operation of t h e system a s adopted i n t h e p r o j e c t c r i t e r i a .
The c a n a l o p e r a t o r s would be a s s i s t e d by up t o t h r e e w e l l o p e r a t o r s i n any
d i s t r i c t where an extensive number of w e l l s a r e operated.                                Canal operators
would a s s i s t t h e a g r i c u l t u r a l extension a d v i s o r on purely t e c h n i c a l matters

23.             Supervision and t r a i n i n g of operators would be by t h e d i s t r i c t a s s i s -
t a n t watermaster              - o p e r a t i o n . I n a d d i t i o n , t h e a s s i s t a n t watermaster would

with p r o j e c t standards.                 One of h i s major d u t i e s , i n a d d i t i o n t o operation of
t h e system, would be t o ensure prompt and f u l l two-day communications of

among t h e farmers and between t h e i r r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s and t h e p r o j e c t u n i t s .

24.             Some major maintenance equipment would be located a t t h e d i s t r i c t

c o n s t r u c t i o n .    One pump maintenance m a n / e l e c t r i c i a n would work out of each
d i s t r i c t o f f i c e .

Annual and seasonal projections of project water a v a i l a b i l i t y , water alloca-
tions among regions, and project power and water supply operations would be
determined by the project o f f i c e .                   As mentioned, i n addition t o the regions,
the main canal division and the power and dams division, equivalent t o an
i r r i g a t i o n division though not reporting t o a region, would report t o the
project o f f i c e .

37.             With the exception of major projectwide policy decision making and
the establishment of project water and power operations, no l i n e functions
would be carried out a t the project l e v e l , nor would there be any requirement
f o r providing s t a f f support t o the u n i t s below except i n unusual circumstan-
ces.        In such cases, special assistance from the s t a t e or national i r r i g a t i o n
departments o r from consultants would be more e f f e c t i v e and l e s s expensive
than the retention of full-time highly paid s t a f f .

38.             The administrator would meet a t l e a s t monthly with the regional
d i r e c t o r s and semiannually with division managers.                         The a s s i s t a n t regional
d i r e c t o r s f o r evaluation, planning, and budget should p a r t i c i p a t e i n meetings
with regional d i r e c t o r s on a quarterly basis t o ensure optimum performance of
project r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s a t a l l levels-.

S t a f f i n g , F a c i l i t y , and Equipment Requirements

39.             Staffing, f a c i l i t i e s , and equipment needs are described f o r each u n i t

r e f l e c t a c t u a l s i t u a t i o n s and conditions.          For example, the number of wells,
s i z e and number of open d r a i n s , and s i z e of canals, would vary considerably
from one area t o another.                     These, p a r t i c u l a r l y the drains and large canals,
w i l l g r e a t l y a f f e c t equipment and associated personnel needs.                           It should be
noted t h a t some equipment a t the d i s t r i c t and division levels serve as backup
t o lower u n i t s and can be pooled t o meet peak demands.                            In emergencies,
mutual support by divisions would be possible.

41.             Certain f a c i l i t i e s , communications systems, and equipment t o be used
during construction w i l l be transferred t o the O&M u n i t s .                           Because the O&M
use i s long-term,              compared t o the construction period, anticipated O&M func-
tions and requirements should have p r i o r i t y i n design and specifications f o r
procurement of such items with construction elements accommodated on a tem-
porary b a s i s .        To the extent possible, buildings and f a c i l i t i e s f o r construc-
t i o n should be located t o best s u i t O&M requirements.

listed. These quantities must be developed.

44.     Buildings.  Buildings would be designed to utilize standard plans for
the project with modifications where unit requirements differ from the norm.

45.     Communications Equipment.  Communications equipment has not been
specifically designated.  However, a very complete modern system is essen-
tial. The system must transmit information among offices (including the
farmer entities and representatives involved), and field vehicles, and vice
versa.  It must also provide for monitoring of the physical facilities and
conditions in the project.  The system must permit remote operation of
facilities as provided in the design.

46.     Computer Equipment.  Computer equipment of two levels of capability
would be needed.  Small computers now coming on the market would be adequate
for office accounting, inventory control, and many computational problems.
At the division level, greater capability would be needed for scheduling and
analysis of hourly, daily, and weekly system operations.  Capability to
interface with remote monitoring and control equipment would be necessary.
Established programs to direct system response and each facility's operations

       needed t o formulate the combination of equipment t o best meet the overall
+ .    requirements.             Alternative means of specifying procurement, i n s t a l l a t i o n , and
       development of software must be considered i n the course of t h i s e f f o r t .

flows i n a deep gorge i n the upper h i l l s and then meanders a t r e l a t i v e l y mild
slopes through the wide upper plain where the water can spread out over a
large area during major floods.                         The r i v e r then flows, with l i t t l e pos-
s i b i l i t y of overflow, even during a PMF, through a steeply sloping canyon and
then traverses the middle p l a i n and continues through a deeper canyon i n t o
and through the lower h i l l s t o the damsite.                        The t r i b u t a r i e s from the north-

Forested areas were extensive 50 years ago, but now appear quite sparse

2,000 cumecs a r e experienced f o r extended periods, and the annual maximum
usually exceeds 20,000 cumecs.                         Since 1967, flood discharges have exceeded

3.01            General.        The flood hydrology of the Narmada River was comprehen-
s i v e l y studied during preparation f o r the Sardar Sarovar Dam and Reservoir
s i t e to: (a) e s t a b l i s h a probable maximum flood (PMF) f o r obtaining the
maximum capacity of the spillway and verifying the top of dam elevation
needed t o ensure s a f e t y against overtopping and possible dam f a i l u r e which
would l i k e l y r e s u l t i n loss of l i f e ; and (b) e s t a b l i s h a "1000-year flood"
a s a basis f o r checking the design spillway c r e s t (elevation and length) f o r
compliance with the maximum water l e v e l (MWL)                    permitted by the decision of
the NWDT.             The data, models, and methodologies developed f o r these flood
studies w i l l a l s o g r e a t l y f a c i l i t a t e design flood determinations f o r the many
proposed dams and spillways being considered upstream and provide a basis f o r
other basinwide water resource planning studies and r i v e r system operations.
The studies have already produced the best and most accessible physical,
climatological, and hydrometeorological data bank available f o r future use i n
hydrologic modeling of the basin.                         Because of the importance of the flood
s t u d i e s , Appendix A i s added t o t h i s annex t o f u l l y record the events leading
t o f i n a l i z a t i o n of the flood analyses.            Moreover, the purpose of Appendix A
i s t o provide an overview of flood studies completed through the end of 1983,
assess t h e i r strengths and weaknesses, and describe how the work done lays a
foundation f o r basinwide water resource planning f o r the future.

3.02            Prior t o 1979, the determination of floods f o r design purposes i n
India was primarily based on flood frequency s t u d i e s , but a f t e r 1979, studies
included hydrometeorological analyses.                        Because of the unusually large
meteorological and physical potential f o r record flooding i n the Narmada
v a l l e y , the determination of the PMF has been intensively pursued by the
NPDDC, DRP, CWPRS, and the IMD.                        In addition, several experts i n the f i e l d of             -
flood hydrology and meteorology were retained t o advise on the matter.                                       There
i s now general agreement on the conditions t h a t produce the t h e o r e t i c a l
probable maximum p r e c i p i t a t i o n (PMP) from which the PMF has been derived by
CWPRS     .

      to the seven sequential steps in para 3.05 follow:

              combination of conditions generating the largest outflow from the
              reservoir. Since the various storms to be considered fall in various
              spatial and time patterns over the basin, tests and comparisons were
             made of storms that would provide the higher PMP and runoff values.
              The critical volume proved to be that for the July 1927 storm tran-
              sposed, downstream progressed, and maximized by a factor of 1.13 as

              a combined 1973-70 storm, then multiplied by 1.59 to guarantee the
              same volume as the 1927 storm, in order to examine the sensitivity to
              the spatial and temporal rainfall patterns that actually occurred.
              The simulated flows from the latter storm were slightly smaller and
              thus not used.

         (b) Since the initial simulations were based on the 1973 storm, it was
              reasonable to use 1973 antecedent conditions as a starting point for
              generating flows from that storm. The antecedent conditions on
              August 27, 1973, were in fact quite wet in the upper Narmada Basin
              and progressively less extreme as one travelled westward in the
              basin. Overall, the baseflows and antecedent soil moisture levels
              throughout the basin represented a reasonably wet condition for use
              for this purpose. They, in fact, represent realistic measured condi-
              tions at an actual point in time after which a PMP event could occur.
              Thereby the flow magnitudes in the Narmada upper basin on midnight
              August 27, 1973, were examined and found to be of the same order of
              magnitude as baseflow conditions that would exist 5 days after a
              25-year flood. This matches Indian practice for estimating PMF, but
              it is also recommended that this criterion be translated into a form
              amenable to application with continuous flow records.

         (c) The OPSET calibrations which were performed proved reasonable in
              terms of comparison of hydrologic parameter values among subbasins,
             matching of simulated against recorded annual flow volumes and annual

      subbasins had no gauged streams a t a l l .                   For t h e p a r t i a l l y gauged
      subbasins, the parameter values established f o r the gauged portion
      were assumed t o apply t o the e n t i r e area.                For the subbasins t h a t
      were ungauged o r could not be s a t i s f a c t o r i l y c a l i b r a t e d , the

(e)   A problem t h a t had t o be overcome i n applying the calibrated model t o
      estimate flows f o r the v a l i d a t i o n years of 1973 and 1977 was t h a t of
      a r e a l gaps i n the gauged p r e c i p i t a t i o n record.         Some basins were
      poorly represented by ordinary (storage) gauges, and others were a t
      some distance from the nearest recording r a i n gauge.                          I n a few of the
      l a t t e r cases, no recording gauge existed anywhere near the subbasin,
      and developed regional data had t o be used t o d i s t r i b u t e r a i n f a l l
      over'the day.               Since t h i s method gave good r e s u l t s f o r the two flood
      hydrographs on the mainstem Narmada when compared with v a l i d a t i o n of
      the o v e r a l l modeling e f f o r t , any e f f e c t on the estimate of the PMF
      would be r e l a t i v e l y small.

3.08    Results of PMF Studies. Peak discharges are shown on table 1 for
the 21 simulated subbasin hydrographs for storms A and B which were routed
and joined at various sites on the Narmada with the results, using both
Muskingum and inematic routing procedures, shown on table 2. Peaks on table
2 are given both with and without flood plain spillage attenuation in order
to show the magnitude of this effect as the flood wave moves downstream.
However, the flows do spill onto the flood plain, and the attenuated flows
are thus the ones recommended for use. Estimated overbank storage volumes
are given in table 3. The flood peaks in table 2 show: (a) storm A to result
in higher peak flows than storm B, (b) the floodplain storage to have the
effect of reducing by about 15% the flood peaks at Sardar Sarovar, and(c)
insignificant differences (in comparison with the overall accuracy of the
study) in the results between the kinematic and the Muskingum routing.   The
recommended PMF inflow and outflow hydrographs for the Sardar Sarovar site
for use during final designs and shown for both storms A and B in tables 4
and 5. Both Muskingum and kinematic routing procedures were used. However,
results from the kinematic procedure were preferred for application because
of its more sound theoretical basis. The hydrographs in tables 4 and 5 show
storm B to have the greater volume, but the lower peak causes it to produce
the smaller outflow peak discharge when routed through reservoir storage.
                                                                           '

One can trade peak discharge off against volume for the various inflows and
get about the same ~ e a koutflow. The design PMF inflow and outflow
hydrographs for storm A based on kinematic routing procedures, with a peak  '

inflow of 171,000 cumecs (6.04 M cusecs) and peak outflow of 132,000 cumecs
(4.66 M cusecs) are shown in figure 1. The reservoir inflow is attenuated
for ustream flood plain spillage and channel storage and is translated to the
damsite over the length of the reservoir based on the celerity of the flood
area.

3.09    Estimate of 1000-Year Flood. The NWDT required that the dam and
spillway be sized to pass the 1000-year flood without the water surface
exceeding a prescribed maximum water level (140.2 m).   For making this deter-
mination, CWPRS fit the historical record of annual flood peaks at Garudesh-
war gauge with a number of statistical distributions and extrapolated the
curves to estimate the magnitude of the 1000-year event. The results are
published in the Proceedings of the 51st Annual Research and Development
Session, Control Board of Irrigation and Power, 2-5 January 1984, Baroda,         c
                                                                                  -
Vol. I1 Hydraulics, Publication 169, 1983. The estimate was made by    fitting
an exponential distribution to a partial series of the 13 largest floods
recorded at Garudeshwar since 1948 and resulted in a 1000-year flood peak of
101,700 cumecs (3.59 M cusecs).   The unit hydrograph principle was used to
reduce the larger simulated PMF at Garudeshwar (Sardar Sarovar) by the ratio
of the peaks of 3.59 to 7.04 M cusecs (see table 2, storm A, kinematic for
latter value) or 0.510 with the results given in table 6 for the kinematic
method only.

3.10    Summary of Results. Using the Kentucky Watershed Model and Muskingam
and kinematic channel and reservoir storage routing procedures, the PMF peak
inflow to Sardar Sarovar reservoir was determined to be 171,000 cumecs, and
the peak outflow at the dam, used to verify spillway designs for safety
purposes, was estimate$ at 132,000 cumecs. The 7-day PMF inflow volume was
estimated at 33,600 Mm  .  The estimated 1000-year inflow peak discharge was
101,700 cumecs with an outflow at the dam of 87,300 cumecs. The inflow

Status of Investigations, Design, and Construction

4.11            The Main Dam and Spil-lways.             A l l exploration for construction
materials and foundation conditions has been completed.                          Investigations t o
determine the strength of weak seams i n the foundations were completed i n
1983 f o r use i n the treatment of the foundations.

4.12            Construction of the following works have been completed:                      i n i t i a l
f a c i l i t i e s f o r diverting the r i v e r , including upstream and downstream coffer
dams and submersible bridges; excavation of the dam foundations, including
the excavation of weak material i n the riverbed f a u l t zone; access roads and
camp f a c i l i t i e s and i n i t i a l batching plant for precooled concrete on the
r i g h t bank; backfilling of the riverbed f a u l t zone; and, access roads and
camp f a c i l i t i e s on the l e f t bank ( e s s e n t i a l l y completed i n 1984).

4.13           Contracts f o r the treatment of weak seams under the foundation of the
dam are in progress and a r e scheduled f o r completion by May 1985.                          Contrac-
t o r s have been pre-qualified and bids were requested i n December 1984 f o r the
main dam and f o r the c i v i l works of the underground riverbed powerhouse.

4.14           Garudeshwar Weir. The design of the weir i s as yet incomplete
because the design of the RBPH was delayed by the decision t o include a
pumped-s-torage operation.                 The f i n a l design of the weir w i l l be keyed t o the
operational requirements of the powerstation, p a r t i c u l a r l y i n the early years
of the development when water a v a i l a b i l i t y would be i n excess of i r r i g a t i o n
requirements.                Appraisal revealed that the weir should not present any
unusual problems i n design.                 S i t e investigations have been carried out f o r
several weir locations.                   Detailed geological investigations are underway a t
the selected s i t e :

4.15           Vadgam-Saddle-Dam.           The dam and CHPH headworks a r e entering f i n a l
stages of design.                  Considerable exploration has been done on the geology of
the s i t e , including 19 d r i l l holes t o e s t a b l i s h foundation rock and three
trenches to trace the contact of d o l e r i t e dikes that i n t e r s e c t the area.                    I n
addition, water t e s t i n g was carried out a t a l l d r i l l holes indicating the
                                                                                                                  .
foundation rock was t i g h t .             A decision was made to adopt a stone masonry dam
a t the saddle s i t e a f t e r investigating the most appropriate layout and design
among four a l t e r n a t i v e canalhead power s t a t i o n arrangements as requested by
the DRP.           The appraisal mission considered t h i s an appropriate decision f o r
conditions prevailing a t the s i t e .

4.16            I r r i g a t i o n Bypass Tunnel.    The design of the i r r i g a t i o n bypass tunnel
has been chosen.                   General geological conditions a t the s i t e are favorable f o r
construction of large diameter twin tunnels and geologic exploration are
being continued along the proposed tunnel centerline.                        A prudent decision has
been made t o lower the invert of the tunnel intake in order t o increase
u t i l i z a b l e water supply storage capacity in the main reservoir.                    Ample time
remains so that completion of the design, administration, and construct ion of
t h i s f a c i l i t y should not be c r i t i c a l i n implementing the project.            A t               -
appraisal no unusual problems of a technical nature were anticipated of the
s i t e or i n f i n a l i z i n g the design.        Award i s scheduled f o r June 1986.

       I r r i g a t i o n Department (ID) with the overview of the DRP.                It i s concluded
       that the design data, c r i t e r i a and r e s u l t i n g safety factors are in accordance
       with the standards l a i d down by Indian Standard 15-6512-1973 which, i n turn,
       i s i n accordance with the standards of other major dam-building a u t h o r i t i e s
       i n the world.             Also, designs and the layout of the dam as f i n a l l y adopted i s
       considered most appropriate f o r the conditions a t the s i t e .                  The layout was
       primarily influenced by requirements f o r handling of floods during construc-
       t i o n and the magnitude of spillway f a c i l i t i e s required t o handle extremely
       large floods l i k e l y to occur during the operation of the reservoir.

       problems i n d e s i g n and c o n s t r u c t i o n .              The DRP's       a c t i o n s have g r e a t l y enhanced

However, the need f o r continued independent review was agreed a t nego-
t i a t i o n s .   Accordingly, i t was agreed to establish a reconstituted DSP and
maintain such panel throughout construction f o r purposes of review of the
main dam         ,  spillways, by-pass tunnel, weir, powerhouse, channels and related
structures.           It was also agreed that a "list of consultants" approved by the
Bank be maintained f o r use i n resolving specific technical problems which
might a r i s e as a r e s u l t of the DSP reviews (see SAR 5107-IN, para 4 . 2 2 ) .

9.06           Tethnica3-A~praisal. An appraisal of the SSP, exclusive of power
component f a c i l i t i e s , was completed by the Snowy Mountain Engineering Cor-
poration of Australia (SMEC) for the Bank.                 Their report of June 1983 t i t l e d
"Narmada (Gujarat) Basin Development Project, Sardar Sarovar Dam Complex,
Appraisal of Dam Complex" and the "Executive Summary" of the f u l l report
constitute a comprehensive and thorough technical appraisal of the project's
major storage and r i v e r diversion features.             The content of the report i s
precise and the presentation technical.                 It has been furnished in i t s
e n t i r e t y to project o f f i c i a l s . The complete report w i l l be maintained i n the
project f i l e f o r future reference and use to interested parties.               The SPEC
report, including suggested changes i n various design d e t a i l s , i s f u l l y
endorsed by the mission, and each should be considered and acted upon by the
GOG and/or G O 1 i n consultation with the DRP or DSP a s the case may be.

9.07           Principal conclusions of the SMEC team are summarized as follows:

               "The investigations carried out to determine the design parameters
               f o r the Navagam Dam      L/have   been well executed and are i n accordance
               with good practice.          The factors of safety determined from these
               parameters have been .obtained from recognized methods of analysis
               and a r e i n accordance with internationally accepted c r i t e r i a .   The
               only parameter to be f i n a l l y determined i s the Probable Maximum Flood
                (PMF), which should be available by the end of 1983,          2/and   i s not
               expected to a f f e c t the present design.

               Some changes i n design d e t a i l s are suggested f o r further considera-
               tion, but they do not a f f e c t the overall adequacy of the design.

               The DRP has played an important part i n the overall design of the
               project and should continue through the construction of the works.

               The nucleus of an O&M organization for the dam should be instigated
                                                                                                    I

   ,  16 gaged subbasins.                   They achieved s u c c e s s f u l r e s u l t s f o r a l l b u t two
      of them.            Of t h e s e 1 4 subbasins (15 gages because one subbasin was
      gaged i n two p l a c e s ) , one c a l i b r a t i o n was f o r f o u r 'years, two were
      f o r one y e a r , and t h e o t h e r 11 were f o r two o r t h r e e y e a r s .                  Storm

      r a i n gage providing hourly d a t a .                  Daily r a i n f a l l t o t a l s were
      estimated from weighting based on Theisson polygons.                                    P o t e n t i a l

      with t h e a v a i l a b i l i t y of t h e records.            The parameter v a l u e s r e s u l t i n g

      needed t o have s i m i l a r v a l u e s f o r subbasins w i t h s i m i l a r topography,

      s e l e c t parameter v a l u e s f o r ungaged subbasins.                    The c a l i b r a t e d model

      hydrographs on t h e mainstem of t h e Narmada.                         The PMP was then sup-
      p l i e d , and t h e c a l i b r a t e d model synthesized t h e PMF.

( b ) Meteorological Basis.                     The 1982 s t u d i e s were based on t h e combined
      August 1973 and t h e September 1970 storm, maximized by a f a c t o r of
      1.35, and s e t i n t h e context of t h e period from August 28 through
      September 1 , 1973.                  The 1983 s t u d i e s began by examining t h r e e storms
      t o determine which one was c r i t i c a l .                 These were:

      (1)       The transposed and downstream progressed, July 1927 storm maxi-
                mized by a f a c t o r of 1.13, computed by GOG a s a d a i l y subbasin-
                wide p r e c i p i t a t i o n averages f o r which d a t a was t r a n s m i t t e d t o
                CWPRS on May 30, 1983.

      (2)       The same storms a s were used i n t h e 1982 s t u d i e s , except f o r an
                i n c r e a s e i n t h e maximization f a c t o r from 1.35 t o 1.59 t h a t was
                needed t o a r r i v e a t the same volume a s storm (1) above. The
                purpose of considering t h i s storm was t o make s u r e t h a t v a r i a b l e
                r a i n f a l l r a t e s over t h e b a s i n and from hour t o hour within t h e
                day would not lead t o l a r g e r flows.

      (3)       A 1926 storm i n subbasins 1 and 2 , and t h e transposed and down-
                stream progressed 1927 storm i n t h e o t h e r 1 8 subbasins.                             The
                f i r s t storm was maximized by a f a c t o r of 1.35; t h e second was

                maximized by a f a c t o r of 1.13; and the two were separated by two
                dry days.

      ( 4 ) Other storms were a l s o considered.                             However, it was soon found
                t h a t storms (1) and (2) above dominated a l l o t h e r storms t o t h e
                point t h a t t h e r e was no need t o make d e t a i l e d flow e s t i m a t e s .
                Therefore, PMF values were ,synthesized f o r those two storms, and
                 (1) was found t o be c r i t i c a l .              I n comparing (1) and (2) it was
                found t h a t (1) was r e l a t i v e l y l a r g e r i n t h e p o r t i o n of t h e
                Narmada Basin downstream from Mortakka where no a t t e n u a t i n g
                e f f e c t from f l o o d p l a i n s t o r a g e e x i s t s .

( c ) Hvdrologic Data.                   A g r e a t d e a l of e f f o r t was spent i n obtaining
      needed r a i n f a l l and streamflow d a t a .                    This e f f o r t delayed t h e study.
      It was finally decided that continued pursuit of additional data was
      not j u s t i f i e d , and t h e flood modelling proceeded with t h e a v a i l a b l e
      information.              The compiled d a t a included gaged streamflows from one
      t o four years a t 17 s i t e s i n t h e 20 subbasins t r i b u t a r y t o t h e Nar-
      mada, ordinary r a i n gages a t one t o e i g h t s i t e s w i t h i n o r near each
      subbasin, hourly r a i n f a l l s from one t o t h r e e self-recording r a i n
      gages i n o r near most of t h e subbasins, and r e p r e s e n t a t i v e evapora-
      t i o n data.          The gaged streamflows we.re c a r e f u l l y reviewed f o r consis-
      tency and reasonableness, following procedures o u t l i n e d by Dawdy, and
      adjustments were made t o ensure t h a t a l l the a v a i l a b l e d a t a were used
      i n determining discharges.                         Some subbasins had no nearby gages f o r
      recording hourly p r e c i p i t a t i o n t o t a l s , and curves of average r a i n f a l l
      d i s t r i b u t i o n over t h e day had t o be developed from more d i s t a n t
      self-recording r a i n gages i n order t o d i s t r i b u t e measured d a i l y
      t o t a l s w i t h i n the day.           The p r e c i p i t a t i o n d a t a were analyzed f o r
      orographic e f f e c t s , but no s i g n i f i c a n t r e l a t i o n s h i p s were found.
      Another study showed t h a t subdividing t h e subbasins i n t o p a r t s , each
      represented by a s i n g l e raingage, revamping OPSET t o c a l i b r a t e t o
      match synthesized flows summed over t h e p a r t s a g a i n s t recorded flows,
      and applying t h i s c a l i b r a t i o n , did not s i g n i f i c a n t l y improve t h e
      r e s u l t s .     O v e r a l l , t h e q u a l i t y of t h e match achieved between syn-
      t h e s i z e d and recorded flows showed t h e p r e c i p i t a t i o n and streamflow
      d a t a a s a whole t o be of r e l a t i v e l y good q u a l i t y .                  Only two subbasins
      could not be c a l i b r a t e d because of unreconciled d i f f e r e n c e s i n
      volumes and time p a t t e r n s between t h e recorded p r e c i p i t a t i o n and t h e
      recorded streamflow.                     Any d a t a e r r o r s seemed t o be random i n t h e i r
      e f f e c t s on the synthesized flood flows, and d a t a q u a l i t y problems
      were not believed t o be the cause of any s i g n i f i c a n t e r r o r i n t h e
      determination of the PMF discharge.

(d)   Kentucky Watershed Model.                       OPSET was used t o c a l i b r a t e the gaged
      subbasins year by year.                      The c a l i b r a t i o n s e l e c t e d values f o r s o i l
      moisture s t o r a g e c a p a c i t y , i n f i l t r a t i o n r a t e , f o u r minor parameters

      parameters c o n t r o l l i n g t r a v e l time and channel s t o r a g e r o u t i n g .
      Multiyear runs were used t o s e l e c t t h e b e s t c a l i b r a t i o n over the
      period of a v a i l a b l e streamflow record.                        The values f o r each parameter
      were then compared among t h e subbasins, and some were adjusted f o r

      used t o generate flows from a l l 20 subbasins f o r 1973 and 1977.
      These hydrographs were combined, using t h e c a l i b r a t e d r o u t i n g models
      a s described below, and compared w i t h t h e recorded hydrographs on t h e
      mainstem Narmada f o r those two major flood y e a r s w i t h good r e s u l t s .
      This v a l i d a t e d c a l i b r a t i o n was then used t o . s y n t h e s i z e PMF

( e ) Results.           The a p p l i c a t i o n s of t h e c a l i b r a t e d Kentucky Watershed Model
      produced 20 subbasin hydrographs from t h e subbasin PHP values.                                           These
      f l o o d s a r e somewhat smaller than what would be estimated a s a PMF f o r
      an i n d i v i d u a l subbasin where one could expect a purely l o c a l storm t o
      be more i n t e n s e .       The sum of t h e peaks from these subbasin
      hydrographs is considerably l a r g e r than t h e peak flow f o r t h e PMF a t

    Gujarat and MP better understand their common water resource, and
    negotiating new management policies that would benefit both states.
    The modelling system developed at CWPRS, now that it is calibrated,
    can be easily and quickly extended to these and other applications.

(b) Other applications. The developed hydrologic modelling capability
    can be applied throughout India in river basin development and in
    more efficient operation of existing systems.  India has some of the
    largest irrigation projects in the world and plans to build more.
    All of these plans would be aided by the ability to do a better job
    of predicting flows in time frames needed for reservoir planning and
    combining surface water supplies through canals with groundwater
    supplies as a means of system management.  Eventually, with enhance-
    ment, hydrologic modelling will be able to combine natural and
    man-made systems in a combined management analysis.

(c) Data manapement.  One of the most valuable learning experiences
    associated with this modelling effort has been that of carefully
    collecting large amounts of climatological and hydrological data,
    assessing its reasonableness by reviewing all relevant information,
    and storing the information where it can be readily retrieved and
    applied. -These data require continuous updating. Also, continued
    effort should be devoted to automation of data collection, early
    entry into data banks, and ready retrieval for the Narmada, and
    thence, for other basins in India. The process will need to be
    accelerated in the future for effective system management on a
    real-time basis.

(d) Flood Warning Applications.  The river forecasting and flood warning
    systems used in the United States apply variations of the Stanford
    Watershed Model.  The capabilities developed in this study have
    hastened the day when India will be able to simulate the movement of
    flood'peaks down major rivers and avert disaster by warning people
    downstream with reasonable lead time, and as such is an extremely
    valuable step. Momentum should not be lost in the training of addi-
    tional personnel and in its application to the remainder of the
    Narmada Basin and throughout India.
