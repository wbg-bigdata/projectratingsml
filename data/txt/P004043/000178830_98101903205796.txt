APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN KOREA
StThI_ ARY
i.        The Korean government originally requested financial assistance
for an education nro-iect- estimated toi cost about US156.h million. Due to
inadequate planning,, certain project :Ltems were subsequently deferred
and thn cost  rpcedri  to ahouit UTS$t26.  million-  The rpvispd nroiect is for
implementation in 5 years, 1969-74.
ii.       I'he principal objective of t;he project is the improvement of

iv.       Consultant architectural services to carry out the school construc-
tion program and a team oI specialists to assist in developing agricult4ral
and technical education are provided for in the proposed project.
v.        There would be sufficient qualified applicants for the additional
places in the project schools.   Teacher supply would also be sufficient
because of adequate output of general subjects and commerce teachers from
Korean universities and the inclusion of agricultural and technical teacher
training in the proposed project. Schedules of accommodation, furniture
and equipment lists and estimates of cost are satisfactory.
vi.       A family planning program Lnitiated in 1962 has helped produce a
substantia:L decline in the rate of population increase which is being re-
flected in a fall :in the rate of enrolment increase in primary schools. The
consequent savings in the cost of primary education are enabling the govern-
ment to develop secondary and higher education at a rate which would no-t
otherwise have been possible.
vii.      Of the estimated total cost of US$26.8 million for the project,
the foreign exchange canponent is estimated at US$14.3 mrillion.  Depending
on the outc2me of bidding, there is a. possibiliby that contracts for equip-
ment to the value of about US$2.0 million may' be awarded to local suDpliers
in ahich event the foreign exchange component would be U3P12.8 milliDn.
The estimated annual recurrent expenditure created bv the Droject would be
about US$4.0 million which is within the capacity of the government.
Subject to certain conditions being f`lfiflAd (nara. 8.02)- the nroiAne-t in
suitable a.s a basis for a proposed IDA Credit of US$14.8 million.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In September, 1968, the Korean government applied to the
J.L4I1ern± Li.-..1 JJ4   J.-WU}II1A1aV Ud.'U± .LL U  .Lt.  A  4. L A U -V1JJA 4-
Ite-l atlUonal DevelopmlentI- Asso-ciationLU1- for a cred" t to assist Ueve-lopm,.mi.ts

wkeJde.± A-Lt,m1iU aS eLn-VisargedU 11 Uljli .WO wf.Ve-y.Lea- TrC.oIRILLU DeVeULP11LtI-i £LdsLIul
for 1967-71 and 1972-76. The estimated cost totalled Won 15,796 million
kU@OP.L4 mILlln).  A Dank economic mission visited Korea in i9ur; its
report (No. AS-133) dated January 11, 1968, emphasized the need for develop-
ments in education oI the type includeId in the application.  A visit by a
Bank reconnaissance mission in March, 1968, was followed by Unesco missions
in June-July, 1968, and July-August, 1968, the former for project identifica-
tion and the latter to assist the government with project preparation.
1.02      An appraisal mission comprising Messrs. R. F. McMahon (technical
education), C. Hamm.erschmidt and D. H.. Lewis (architects), K. A. Blakey
(economist), 14. Girard (FAO, fisheries education) and R. Marvin, consultant
(agricultural education) visited Korea in October-November 1968.   It found
that not all the proposed project had been adequately planned for implementa-
tion at this time and recommended deferment of the fishery and marine training
components. This deferment, together with a modification of the estimated
costs in the government's proposals, have been accepted by the government
and resulted in an amended project to cost about US$ 26.8 million.
1.03      The proposed project would support the government policy of
improving the quality of the training at existing schools and colleges by
providing urgently needed facilities to teach agricultural, commercial,
scientific and industrial subjects. The project would also increase enrol-
ments in conformity with projected needs for skilled manpower.
1.04      The recommended pro.ject comprises the construction and equipment of:
- replacements for 3 secondary technical high schools,
- improvements to 24 secondary high schools of which 6 would be technical,
2 comprehensive, 5 agricultural-technical, 4 commercial and 7
agricultural,
- improvements to 4 post-secondary higher technical schools of which 3
would include technical teacher training,
- improvements to 1 post-secondary higher agricultural school, and
- improvements to the Department of Agricul-tural Educa-tion at the Seoul
National University.
Also inclulded are:
- nrorvisinn of cev        i equn'mpnt. for 3 iiniuvPritv soic- teacher
training departments,
- technical assistance and felloishl.ps to support developments inagri-
cultural and. technical education'and assist in educational planning,.and
- cons,1t+art a.rchitectr'-all ser.ie to+ +car  o te    hoolrn1 r.rrrc+.v.cti
program.
Building and commissioning of the schools and colleges would take 5 years which
is also the d-uraticon of +he proosed 4-eclica-l as sistance.

1.05      Consideration of the proposed project was aided by data from
manpower surveys in 1965 and 1968 carried out by the Ministry of Science and
Technology. Evaluation of the data indicated that all items of the recomn-
mended project are justified in regard to skilled manpower requirements.
II.  SOCIAL AND ECONOMWIC BACKGROUND
2.01      The Republic of Korea comprises the southern half of the Koreana
peninsula and adjacent islands - an area of 38,426 square miles. About 67%
of the country is mountainous and largely unproductive but suitable for
forestry.  The climate is temperate and monsoonal.
2.02      The population of 29.8 million in 1967 had almost doubled since
1945 and continuation of trends of the late nineteen-fifties would have
doubled it again in 25 years. The government initiated a family planning
campaign in 1962; since then the rate of population increase has declined
in spite of a continuing fall in the death rate.  Partly as a result of
this campaign, population is not expected to exceed 41 million in 1985.
2.03      There is general enthusiasm for education.  Primary schooling
is free and compulsorv and. together with a nation-wide Adult education
program, has reduced adult illiteracy from 78% in 1945 to 11% in 1966.
2.04      Economic development was slow during most of the pre-World War II
pernod and was firrther delayed by part.ition roP the Korean pnninsula annl
the Korean War of 1950-53. In the latter nineteen-fifties, conditions f'or
accelerated. development were set   b-lp b  large-scale i-r z.vetment  n  cno
infrastructure and manufacturing, facilitated by heavy capital imports
which led to increased erlo,-m,ent ofP lo.--,=o  labo  ~A rap gro,-+h of
national income.
2.05      implementation of the first Five-Year Economic Develcpment Plan
klXJC -J6 Uand uith  first stage  of the U11,U .L7u)- ( (J rPlan has  Lted LU. L n1 rajpiAd
expansion in production, significant improvements in fiscal performance
and. inc reats 4Aing sel-f -re-liar.cee in savi1negs and i.invest,nuent .' Fac t ors w'h ich_1aI bavnv
contributed to these achievements include the rapid development of primary
education resulting in a high proportiLon of literacy and the initiation of
comprehensive economic and manpower planning.  Present indications are
favorable i'or fuu'rther rapid and sustained econio-nic growth. nowever,
improvement in the planning and organization of post-primary education,
which has iagged behind industrial requirements, is essential.
2. 06     Mining and manufacturing have been the most rapluly growring
sectors, their joint output having increased in 1961-67 from 15% to 22%
of G1NP. Tne share of agriculture, forestry and fisheries decreased over
the period from 44%, to 33%o of GNP, although 55% of the labor force remained
in agriculture.  G1\1- per capita measured at constant prices increased at an
average rate of over 90 a year but is still very low at the equivalent of
$170 in 1968.



III. EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
The Administration of Education
3.01      The Ministry of Education (Annex 1) is, on the whole, well
organized. Followinag the formation. in December 1968, of the Deliberation
Council for Long Range Comprehensive Educational Planning, the Ministry's
Planning Office has been substantially strengthened so that in future mo:re
effective educational planning can be undertaken. The Directorate of
School Supervisors is understaffed and needs reinforcing to cover all
technical subjects.  During negotiations assurances wzere obtained that the
government would auazent the Office of School Suprervisors and appoint
officials qualified to cover agricultural, commercial, industrial, marine
and fishery subjects.
General Education - Primaxyrv and Secondary
3_ 02   The structure of education (Anne' 2) is st-isfactory andi nf a
conventional type. Public primary schools have a high pupil enrolment of
95% of the eligible age group (Annexes 3 and 1,), absorbing a large proportion
(7)4%) of total public education expenditure (Annex 5).
3.03      Enrolments in secondary schools are approximately equally dividled
be+tween" pubic and -prvate sch ols -nth expendit-res in each type near'y
equal. The unusually high enrolments in private secondary schools have
resulted fIrom. a gen;_rail %demandk fIor educatio whic,4C cus  fcosrant
in public finance, could not be met by public schools.
3.04      Primary schools have been principally responsible for a dramatic
r-eed-uction in iiliteracy from 78%0 in 1945 to 11%0 in 1965 - one of the lowest
rates in Asia. This has been achieved in spite of a pupil/teacher ratio of
60/1 and frequently with classes of up to 80 pupils.   Secondar-y schools are
similarly overcrowded with many classes of 60 pupils and their curricula
need modernizing to accord with employment opportunities in Korea's
expanding commerce and industry.
Specialized Education and Training
3.05      Courses in agricultural, commercial, fishery, marine and technical
subjects are given in higher schools (Grades 10-14) and high schools
(Grades 10-12) with enrolments of nearly 172,000 in 1968. A few public
schools have received substantial bilateral aid and in consequence are
well equipped and staffed and provide good quality courses; a few private
schools are also well equipped and staffed.   Other schools are only
moderately well equipped and many of their staff require upgrading courses.
Most schools, however, badly lack commercial, scientific and engineering
teaching equipment; pupils completing the courses are inadequately trained
and unsuited to fill skilled manpower vacancies in commerce and industry.
Steps to improve these schools and so increase the proportion of good
quality graduates are urgently needed.
3.06      T'he Office of Labor Affairs has recently signed an agreement with
U1iDP to initiate a National Vocational Training Institute. The project, to
be executed. by ILO, will last 5 years and  develop an instructor training



center, a pl* lot rr4at  na+ I+Al  n Ivg center. ~, a - nt +- V   p "4  - rogra
a trade testing system and a technical office for the preparation of
teaching mrterials. mc .h,- ThTDp financial alloca4i4o  is TT  .  r Illo n
and the government contribution US$3.367 million.
3.07      Thirty-one industrial enterprises operate training schemes; it is
Je.Fece  that these scII hemnes will coopeiaue with teproposeCd National 
Vocational Training Institute. Various other government departments,
WMl t  IinLiLb Lty of Defens Iei, inal'a1 14±adJillng schtemL-Is.  11 ,11  d-lDU
exists a traditional apprenticeship system in the crafts and service trades.
rainling is entirely informal andu based OI ap                  relatlonshlp.
It achieves satisfactory results in such trades as watch, radio and TV
repairing, tailoriLng) hairdressing and shoemaking.  No reliable statistics
are availab:Le for the numbers training under these schemes but the total
is probabiy maany thousands.
3.o8      Responsibility for fishery and marine education is shared between
the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture.   The former has
14 schools and the M\linistry of Agricul-ture operates the Deep Sea Fisheries
Training Center at Pusan wzhich is receiving assistance from UITDP with FAC)
as the executing agency. The fishery and marine schools under the Ministry
of Education are generally in need of reorganization whereas the Deep Sea
Fisheries Training Center operates efficiently.
Teacher Training
3.09      Of 120,000 teachers employed in primary and general secondary
schools in 1968, some 85%,Io were trained. Output of trained primary school
teachers from junior teachers' colleges is satisfactory and adequate for
the foreseeable future as is also the output of trained general secondary
school teachers from university education departments.
3.10      Teachers of technical subjects are trained at the Vocational
Education Department of the Seoul National University in 4-year courses
following completion of high school.   These courses are too academic and
include insufficient practical work tc, enable graduates to teach manual
skills.  The government appreciates this weakness and now plans to train
technical teachers in three higher technical schools.
3.11      Agricultural teachers are trained in the Department of Agricultural
Education at the Seoul National University.   The Department, which was formed
only 3 years ago, has not yet been fully developed and lacks essential
facilities.
3.12      Seoul's universities produce an oversupply of commerce graduates.
From this group, usually after a period of practical experience, commerce
teachers are recruited.  No difficulty is expected in obtaining teachers
for commercial education in the foreseeable future.
Higher Education
3.13      Due mainly to rapid and uncontrolled expansion during the last
20 years. -the aual:itv of universities is generally below desirable
standards. In consequence, too many gradluates of inadequate quality are

is no educational television (ETV) and no government plans have been made
for its de-velopmient. Sogang College, a prlvate institute, has prepared
courses in biology and English suitable for ETV but has been unable to
obtain broadicasting time.  This initial p:Lanning should be developed witlh
governument assistance and expert technica:L help, to enable ETV to be avai.l-
able for schools.  Korea is a suitable country for ETV because the population
is mostly concentrated in areas alread;y covered by comercial television and
because a s:ingle language is universal.
IV.   EDUCATION 'FDiANCE
Source of Funds
4.01       Ia the last five years, Korea increased by lOOo its public
expenditure on education mneasured at constant prices.   This was achieved
without great difficulty, mainly because of rising incomes, increasing
efficiency of tax collection and the earmarking for education of a propor-
tion of tax revenues. Increased school fees also made a significant
contribution.
4.02      The growth of public and private education expenditures in
relat:ion to GNP and total government expenditure are shown below:

Finance for Future 'Development
I.OL;     Financial provisions necessary to implement the educational
content of the present 5-Year Plan (1l,67-71) and subsequent development
are likely to nearly double the government's education expenditures during
1969-77 but should not substantially increase as a proportion of GAP
(about 4%',,)and as a proportion of total government expenditure (abou-t 18%),
as follows:

4.05     Owing to the declining birth rate (para. 2.02) and consequent
reduction in the rate oI increase of school age population, tne cost buraen
of primary education will decrease in relative terms. The above expenditure
program would therefore permit substantial improvement at secondary and higner
levels.  It includes the financing of improvements in standards of accwnoda-
tion and equipment, teacher training, and teachers! salaries and the develop-
ment of adequate standards of school maintenance, service and supplies.
4.06     The prograin provides for the achievement of national goals of
moderniuzing and upgrading the system of public education.  It requires on.ly
a small increase in the proportions of GNP and total government revenue to be
allocated to the education authorities and allows for some decrease in the
relat-ive im?ortance of private education.
V. FJTURE EDUCATION AND TRAINING NEEDS
5.01     Up to the present, manpower needs for economic development have been
supplied at low cost but basic education and a capacity to improvise are no
longer adequate. Progressive application of new techniques has reached a
stage where education and training to a higher level are required to provide
for employers' most urgent needs.   Both in numbers and in quality, the output
of secondary and further technical education is far below requirements.   This
is shown by the projections of Annex 7 and the following summary:

5.02    Qualitatively, there is an urgent need to improve output from existing
sc}hools.  For exnmple, of high school graduates in tec.hnicnl nnd commerci l
subjects expected tc qualify during 1972-76, only about 17% are likely tc be
about 750, or under 4% are expected to be good technicians; the remainder,
standard adequate to meet the requirements of industry and commerce.
V   Good, moderate and inadequate quality courses are referred to in para.
3.V).



5.03    Quantitatively, the potential output from existing high schools and
highe-r technical sc:hools would meet 7C) and 50% respectively of rneeds durng
1972-76, but output from higher agricultural schools would be substantially
above requirements.
5.o4    Thve priorJiy nered is for improvements to all Ligh azd higher schools
(except higher agricultural), followed. by expansions of those types of
education necessary to alleviate manpower shortages already identified.
Government is aware of these shortcomings in its educational system and its
policy is to improve appropriate schools and colleges as rapidly as feasible.
There is, however, a danger that output of higher agricultural schools will
substantially exceed need during 1972-.76. To eliminate this possibility tne
government should phase out three of the existing five schools of this type.
VI. THE PROJECT
6.01    The! proposed project would comprise the following:
(a)   27 High Schools (Grades 10-12) (Annex 8).  Construction and equipment
of:
(i) replacements for 3 technical high schools and expansion of 6
others, providing improved facilities for 9,960 pupils of which
2,600 would be increased enrolments. The replacements are
necessary because the existing schools are dilapidated and occupy
small and unsuitable sites.
(ii)  extensions to 2 comprehensive high schools, providing improved
facilities for 4,080 pupils of which 160 would be increased
enrolTents.
(iii)  extensions to 5 agricultural-technical high schools, providing
improved facilities for 14,680 pupils of which 2,350 would be
increased enrolments.
(iv)  extensions to 4 commercial hiRh schools, providing improved
facilities for 5,280 pupi.ls of which 330 would be increased.
enrolments.
(v) extensions to 7 agricultural high schools providing improved
facilities for 4,400 pupils of which 700 would be boarding
Dlaces; and 1.090 increascd enrolments.
(b?   Five Higher Schools (Grades 1(-14) (Annex 9!. Construction and
equipment cf:
(i) extensions to 4 higher technical schools, providing improved
facilities for 4,700 pu1p:Lls of which 1,690 would be increased
enrolnTLents.
(ii) extensions to one higher agricultural school, providing improved
facilities for 1,000 pupils of which 70 would be icreased
enrolrrLents.



(c)   Four University Teacher Training Departments:
(i) construction and equipment of extensions to the Department of
Agricultural Education at the Seoul National university,
providing improved faciLities for 320 students of which 100
would be boarding places and 240 increased enrolments.
(ii) provision or science equipment for the science teacher training
departments at the three national universities of Seoul,
Kyungbuk and Kongju where present enrolments of 1,880 studeCnts
are not planned to increase.
(d)   Technical ALssistance
Twenty-six man-years of technical assistance and 20 man-years
of overseas fellowships to support developments in agricultoural
and technical education.
(e)   Services of Consultant Architects who would set standards in school
buildings, furniture and costs and oversee implementation of the
buildiung program.
The Need for the Project Items
High Schools (Grades 10-12)
6.02    In the immediate future, the government does not intend to increase
significantly high school enrolments but will give priority to improving
school facilities in agricultural, technical and commercial schools. The
deveLoprment of 27 excisting high schools in the proposed project would support
this Driority need by providing, substantiallv imnroved accommodation and
equivpment for about 28,500 pupils and a modest increase in enrolment of 6,500
pun i'l s.
6.03    Technical Schools (including technical streams in comDrehensive and
agricultural-technical schools): during the Plan period 1972-76, 150,000
technically trained high school graduates would be needed of which existing
good quality schools can supply only 11,500 (para. 5.01). Schools included
in t.he nrniet. WuThi supply 3l0;000.   A shortage of normpetpnt terhnical teachers
prevents expansion of technical high schools at a rate greater than that in the
pr'oposed nrojcir.t.

from developing conmercial education at a greater rate than that shown above.
Higher Schools (GrELdes 10-14)
6.06    The development of 5 higher schools would provide improved facilities
for ~,,700 pupils,includi-ng 1,760 increased enrolments. Tnree of the technical
high schools would develop technical teacher trairing programs.
6.07    Technical ',chools.  Korea's only existing good quality higher
technical school would produce about 750 technicians in the Plan period 1972-76
to meet a projected need of 42,000 (para. 5.01).   To help meet this shortfall,
Grades 10-12 shouldl be phased out of Korea's 10 higher technical schoolk, and
their work concentrated at post-secondary level; such a reorganization could
resu.Lt in present schools producing 50; of technician manpower requirements
of 1972-76. Reorganization and development of the 5 project technical high
schools would result in production of about 10,000 graduates in 1972-76., A
shortage of technical teachers prevents an immediate greater expansion.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the government would under-
take the upgrading and reorganization of technical education at this levrel
during the next five years.
6.08    The proposed project includes provision for technical teacher training
at 3 higher technical schools by adding a third year (Grade 15). The total
output would be about 130 trained teachers yearly by 1974 <and would then
largely meet expansion and replacement needs.
6.o9    Agricultural Schools. DuringF the Plan period 1972-76 there would be
a manpowrer need of 6,500 agricultural technicians and the estimated output
from.existing schools will be 11,000 graduates of moderate quality (para. 5.01).
Consequently, of the 5 existing schools, two should be improved to provide the
required output and the remainder converted into other types of urgently needed
schools.  Government has given priority to upgrading the agricultural school
at Chinju. to be included in the Drop)osed project: upgrading of a second school
has been deferred pending developments in more urgently needed sectors of
education..  As in the case of the higher technical schools (nara. 6.07), the
the goverrnment, during negotiations, gave an assurance that Grades 10-12: would
be nhased out of higher agriltmii±mr'A srl-ools.

students and an annual output of about 70 graduates from 1972. The supply of
science equipment to three national universities at Seoul, Kyungbuk and
Kongju is n-eeded to irnprove the quality of training in the science teacher
training departments at these uriversities.  The equipment would be used
by 1,880 students.
6.11    In all cases where an increase in enrolment is proposed, pupils
graduating from lower levels of education are adequate in quantity and
quality to fill the ex-panded schools and colleges.
Technical Assistance and Fellowships
6.12    Because of the lack of experience of local staff, a team of specialists
acceptable to the Association would be essential to strengthen the Ministry
of Education staff and to support teacher training at the Seoul Lfriversity
Department of Agricultural Education and the 3 higher technical schools.
6.13    For technical education, 8 specialists would be required for a total
of 18 man-years; a team coordinator, 3 mechanical engineering specialists in
welding and sheet metal work, machine shop practice and automobile engineering,
2 building specialists in woodwork and brickwork and 2 electrical engineering
spec:.L-lis-U to cover heavy and light electrical engineering.  They would
init:ially be employed at the  Hinistry of Education in curricula and syllabus
deve:Lopment for the technical high and higher schools and associated teacher
training departments. They would then prepare eauipment lists and cooperate
with the architects in preparing layout drawings for the schools and subse-
auentlv help development of technical teacher training courses at the 3
higher tec:hnical schools.

The foreign exchange component of US$114.80 million amounts to 55% of the total
cost of the project and has been estimi.ated on the assumptions that:
(i)  all construction work would be done by local contractors,
(ii) all furniture and equipment wiould be supplied from overseas.
Because of the nature of the construction work in the project, the first
assumption has a high probability.  There is a possibility that all furniture
contracts could be awarded to local suppliers, in which case the foreign
exchange cost of the furniture would be about $0.68 million equivalent instead
of $1.23 million. Also, there is a pcssibility that local suppliers might wvin
about 15% of the contracts for eauipment, and in this event the foreign
exchange cost of equipment would be $5;.83 million instead of $7.26 million.
It is possible, therefore, that about $2 million from the credit would go for
local. currency expenditures.
6.20    The increase in annual recurrent expenditure created by the project
is estimated at US$&.0 million or about 5% of the Ministry of Educationts
present total expenditure.  During implementation of the proposed project,
the m.aximumi contribution by the goverrument tnwnrds the canital c-ost in any
year would be about US$4.4 million which is under 3% of the present Ministry
of Ediucation tota.1 e-xpennditiure. Conseqently, the additional cnpital and
recurrent costs generated by the project should be well within the govern-
ments capacity. C-wnstructii n is expected to take 5 years di-ring which t+m.e
technical aLssistance would be provided (Amnex 11).

Accommaodat:ion and Equipment
6.21      Accommodation schedules for each school and college have been
revised to acceptable standards and the estimated costs are considered
reasonable. PrelinLinary equipment and furniture lists, adequate for cost
estimating, have been examined; final equipment lists will be submitted
to the Association for approval after the experts listed in para. 6.16
have been appointeci and assisted in their ccmpilation.
VII. IlPLEMMITATI'JN OF THE PROJECT
Administration
7.01      To implement the proposed project, a Project Unit would be set up
at the Ministry of Education.  It would be headed by a Proiect Director and
incluide a full time assistant to the Project Director, a qualified architect,
the coordinator of the technical assistance tea m and an official exnerienced
in accounting and auditing procedures. During negotiations, an assurance
was giiven that a Proiect .Unit would he organized and that initial anpoint-
ments, and any changes, to the posts of Project Director, the assistant
Proiect Director Anrd architect, all of wrhom would proZbably be Koreans wrould
be subject to approval by the Association.  The Project Unit would be sup-
nortecd by an ouerse3as tPchnical si+tPnnne 1-am Of' qnecilie.  rnd wouilcd

7.02     .An overseas architectural firm with special experience in school
buil-ding and schoo:L furiture, acceptble to the Association, would be
appointed to estabLish space, construction and costing standards applicable

7.03      International competitive bidding would be used for the supply of
all equipment and furniture and for the construction of the schools.9 IteIs
would be grouped to the maxinmu extent practicable to form sizeable bid
packages an-d to pemit bulk procurement.  Procedures for prequalification
of contrac-bors and selection of the specialist firm of architects would be
acceptable to the Association.
7.04      Administrative and financial procedures would be established ior the
proper maintenance of the school buildings. Assurances were obtained fram
the goverunent durLng negotiations that adequate funds would be provided for
satisfactory maintenance of the schools and supplies of education materials.



Blding Construction
7.05    Building standards and design vary considerably throughout the
country. The structural features of secondary schools range from wooden
shelters to reinforced concrete buildings of good quality. Apart from some
cases of an over-provision of accommodation for The schoolst administrations,
secondary schools are modest buildings generally in keeping with stringent
economic requirements.  Schools have inadequate supplies of electricity and
water. It is necessary to improve these services to the project schools for
their proper functioning. Architectural and engineering practice follow
acceptable procedures.
7.06      In recent years the building industry has been very active,
ilcreasing its share in GNP from 2.2% in 1965 to 4.3% in 1967.   Building
costs are expected to rise at the rate of 8% yearly during the next 4 years
and an allowance for this has been included in the cost estimates for the
proposed project.
7.07      Very few finished building requisites are imported but those
locally manufactured require a moderate component of imported raw materials;
this is also true for school furniture. Construction equipment and practi-
cally all specialized instructional equipnment are imported.
7.08      Secondary school construction and maintenance are administered by
government through the Provincial and Special City Boards of Education who
employ the services of private architects fram time to time. There are
adequate building contracting firms active in Korea. There is a good
geographicail distribution of capable contractors in the provinces where the
project schools would be built. Tendering is normally public and advertised
in the local press. Bids are usually considered by Provincial and City
Boards; the lowest evaluated bid is usually accepted.
7.09      Suitable land is avaIlable fIor expansion of all schools except
one and no land costs are included in the proposed project. The exception
is at PusanI where aL site has not vet been selected. At negotiations. the
government agreed that developnent costs of the site, when selected, would
be professionally estimated and such clata, together with the relevant site
plan, would be trarLsmitted to the Association for its ccmment.
7.10      The building and canmissionLng of the schools are phased for
completion in five vyers (Annex 11).  Apiiua^nl disbursements during the five
years would be:
Year        First   Second   Third   Fourth   Fifth    Total
iount       0.19    5.35     5.32    3.65     0.29    14.80

Credit and Disbursement
7.11      The totaL cost of the project is estimated at US$26.8 million of
which the foreign exchange ccmponent may comprise US$14.8 million.  The
proposed Bank Cred:it of US$14.8 million would finance 55g of the total
project cost and equal the probable foreign exchange camponent. The g orern-
ment undertakes to provide the balance of the funds necessary for completing
the project.
7.12      The Association would disburse against the c.i.f. cost of imported
equi]pment and furniture for the project subsequent to the date of the Credit
Agreement.  It is possible that local suppliers could win some contracts
for equipment and furniture and about $2.0 million of the proposed credit
may be disbursed against local currency expenditures. In this event, dis-
bursement would be made against full documentation. The Association wolLLd
also disburse against the foreign exchange costs of technical assistance,
professional services and fellowships.  The remainder of the Credit would
be d:Lsbursed as a percentage, i.e., 35%, of expenditures for civil works.
The percentage wou:Ld be adjusted so that withdrawals from the Credit woLLld
be spread over the full construction period of the project; undisbursed
amounts would be avrailable for cancellation. In the event that expenditures
should excesed the present estimated cost of $26.8 million, such excess
would be rmet by the Korean government.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AID RECCMMENDATIONS
8.01      The nroitet would improve facilities at 36 technical and agricul-
tural schools and umiversity departmenlts enrolling about 36,300 students.
Deve lonment of appropriate teacher training in agricultural and technicaLl
subjects would be iLncluded. Project implementation would be supervised
bv a Project TTnit to be set up in +he  nnist.r of Education with the Proiect
Director amd the Assistant Project Director both acceptable to the Associa-
tion   fonul tant architects wold design and Supervise construction. Twrenty-
six man-years of technical assistance would support curriculum development,
school plannning and tencher training. Fellowships would e pnrovided for
the training of counterparts.
8.02      To raise school standards, the government has agreed to reinforce
the I)irectorate,of School   pervisors at the Mir.istr of Eieation by
appointing specialists in agricultural, commercial, industrial, marine
anrd fisheries tr+-iviivg  For technici. tra¾ng, the higher ai-  icultural
schools and higher technical schools would be reorganized to provide only
os- ..corl'rnda-n c-ses.
8.03      The pro   e  project i s suiabl  a  a basis for an IDA Credit of
US$14.8 mi:lion to the government of Korea. The Credit would cover the

are willing to work for low wages.

Note 1: All persons employed in the above categories could benefit fram
vocational education to high school level or above, including those
who would then qualify at craftsmen or technician levels through
in-service training.  The projected demand is not related to such
an ideal, but is based on estimates of employment opportunities.
Note 2: Strict coaparability between different occupational categories was
not possible because of limitations of the data available. For
agricultixre, aggregate employment includes all workers. For tech-
nical employment, skilLed workers and craftsmen in traditional crafts
are excluded. For the commercial category only salaried and self-
employed non-traditional clerical and sales occupations are included.
