1. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy
1.01       Since the early 1960s, the industrial sector, and more specifi-
cally manufacturing,/l has been the engine of growth of the Korean economy.
Over the period 1974-78, the manufacturing sector has grown at an average
17% p.a. in real terms compared to an average 10.3% growth of aggregate GNP.
As a consequence of this faster growth rate, the share of manufacturing in
total GNP has increased from about 20% in 1971 to nearly 32% in 1978.  By
end 1978, manufacturing employment reached just over 3 million and accounted
for 22.4% of the total employed population compared to 15.9% in 1973. Over
the five year period 1974-78, approximately 1.2 million jobs have been
created in the manufacturing sector; this represented 58% of total
employment creation during that period.
1.02       Export Orientation and Export Dependence.  Korea's success story
in economic development is largely based on a strategy of export promotion
with particular emphasis on manufactured exports. Total commodity exports
just exceeded US$10 billion in current prices in 1977 and reached
US$12.7 billion in 1978. Manufactured goods, which accounted for about
52% of total exports in 1964, have gradually increased their share and have
remained at about 90% for the past three years. It is estimated that
export expansion contributed about 35% of manufacturing output growth over
the period 19 75-77 against 74% for domestic demand./2 Gradual changes
have taken place in the structure of manufactured exports over the past
three years: light manufactured products including textiles have declined
in relative terms from 56% to 53%; machinery, transport equipment and
chemicals have increased their share from 18% in 1974 to 22% in 1977; some of
Korea's traditional light exports such as footwear and clothing have remained
buoyant, edging up from 26.7% to 28.4%.
1.03       The growth rate of commodity exports slowed down in real terms
to about 15.8% p.a. over the period 1977-78 compared to an average of 32.7%
over the period 1972-76. The 15.8% p.a. growth rate of real exports was in
fact lower than 17% average annual growth in manufacturing, which seems to
indicate the growing importance of the domestic market for the manufacturing
sector. This may prove a favorable development considering that until 1977
the export dependence of the manufacturing sector had been rising faster than
expected. The ratio of manufactured exports to output reached 28.3% in 1977
/1   In 1978, manufacturing alone accounted for 96% of total value added
(in 1975 prices) in the industrial sector (i.e. mining and
manufacturing).
/2 Import substitution made a negative (-9%) contribution.



with considerable variations in the dependence ratio between the various
subsectors./1   The ratio of commodity exports to GNP had likewise increased
from 26.7% in 1975 to 34.4% in 1978.
Structural Changes in Manufacturing
1.04      The growth of the manufacturing sector has been accompanied
by significant adjustments in the structure of production by the various
component subsectors as shown in the following table:

1.05      The composition of manufacturing shows a marked shift in favor of
the heavy and chemical sectors which exceeded 50% of total manufacturing
value added for the first time in 1978. The most significant gains have

been registered by the machinery sector. The rate of growth of chemical
industries, however, lagged behind the aggregate manufacturing sector and
their share consequently declined from about 30% in 1970 to 22.5% in 1978.
Light industries have declined steadily since 1970. The sharpest declines
were recorded in the food, beverage and tobacco sector. Textiles have been
maintaining their 1.6-17% share of total manufacturing value added. In fact,
textile yarn and fabric industries have lost ground but this was compensated
by the good performance of footwear and clothing. The changes in the
structure of manufacturing reflect a deliberate policy gradually to shift
production from Korea's traditional light industrial production towards more
skill- and technology-intensive types of production.
Geographic Distribution
1.06      The 1975 population census showed that approximately 27% of the
population of Korea lived in the cities of Seoul and Busan; the province
of North Gyeongsang in which Taegu, the third largest industrial city
is located accounted for another 14%. The following table shows that the
regional distribution of manufacturing enterprises and employment is
even more skewed in favor of Seoul and Busan.

While Seoul and Pusan remain the largest industrial centers, marginal
improvements have taken place between 1974 and 1977 in the redistribution of
industrial employment outside of these areas. This may be the first sign
that Government policies aimed at a better distribution of employment are
paying off. Government policies aiming at a reduction of the congestion of
Seoul and Pusan include severe restrictions on industrial expansion in these
two cities, a program of financial assistance for the relocation of
industries, the promotion of new industrial estates such as the Pohang,
Ulsan and Yeosu complexes and the Saemaeul Movement initiated in 1971 for
creating off-farm employment in rural areas.

Factor Use and Efficiency
1.07       The main elements which have contributed to the expansion of the
manufacturing sector are the rate of investment and efficiency in factor
use, both capital and labor.
1.08       Gross Fixed Capital Formation.  Over the period 1969-75,
manufacturing generally accounted for less than 20% of aggregate fixed capital
formation.  Over the period 1975-77, it reached an average of 21.9%.  In 1978,
total fixed investment increased by a phenomenal 40.5% in real terms; the
manufacturing sector outpaced this growth and reached 58.3% in real terms thus
increasing its share of total fixed investment to 23.8%. Within the
manufacturing sector the share of the heavy and chemical sector in total gross
domestic capital formation increased significantly from 46% in 1973 to 52.9%
in 1976 and 56.2% in 1978. The recent growth rates of GDCF substantially
exceed those projected in the FFYP; the revised plan for 1979-81 projects a
slowdown in the growth of GDCF from 30.1% for the period 1977/78 to 12.9% p.a.
Although no sectoral breakdown of investment is available, the manufacturing
sector is expected to increase further its share and manufacturing investment
should therefore grow at a slightly higher rate than aggregate investment.
1.09       Factor Efficiency.  Efficiency of the manufacturing sector in
its utilization of capital investment can be measured by the incremental
capital to output ratio (ICOR). Calculations of ICORs with a one-year lag
show a gradual decline over the three consecutive periods 1961-66, 1966-71
and 1971-75, thus indicating increasing efficiency in the use of capital
investment. Inclusion of data for 1976 and 1977 raises the ICOR estimate
to 1.012/j for the period 1971-77 compared to 0.977 /1 for the period
19 71-75. This may reflect the higher capital intensity of investment in
manufacturing in recent years because of the larger share of the heavy and
chemical sectors. Efficiency in capital utilization is also evidenced by the
growth in industrial capacity utilization which reached an average of 7.2%
over the period 1963-71 and 3.4% p.a. over 1971-77. Capacity utilization had
reached by 1971 a level comparable to that of developed countries. Labor
productivity as measured by the ratio of value added per employee has been
increasing in all manufacturing subsectors over the period 1970-76 and was
sufficient to absorb wage increases. Over the period 1977-78, however,
productivity gains have lagged behind the rapid growth in real wages.
Financial Structure of Enterprises
1.10       Surveys of the capital structure of manufacturing enterprises
indicate a high reliance on debt financing. The average aggregate debt/
equity ratio of manufacturing enterprises which stood at 2.7:1 in 1973
following the financial measures of 1972 increased to 3.2:1 in 1974 and
/1   Based on 1970 constant prices.



averaged 3.6:1 over the period 19 76-78. The long-term debt/equity ratio,
however, reached only 1.5:1 in 1978, reflecting the larger share (58%) of
short-term borrowings in total borrowings. The average interest rate paid
on borrowings, short- and long-term, ranged from 12% to 13% c- -r the period
19 76-78. Profitability measured in terms of net income to total assets has
declined marginally from 3.2% in 1976 to 2.7% in 1978 but remained quite
satisfactory.
Industrial Policies
1.11       The phenomenal growth of the manufacturing sector was to a large
extent made possible by efficient and pragmatic government policies.
Incentive packages have been developed and adjusted over time to fit evolving
priorities for industrial development. With variable emphasis, policies
have aimed at the promotion of export industries, import substitution,
assistance to small and medium enterprises, geographic dispersal of industry
and in the last few years, promotion of skill-intensive sectors with a higher
technological content. Export promotion has been the major objective since
the early sixties until the recent past. Concerns have surfaced recently
about the desirability of maintaining the same degree of priority on export
expansion because of a potentially dangerous situation of export dependence
for the Korean economy and because of the inflationary impact of export
promotion in the face of rising domestic demand. Subsidies on exports have
continued to increase in absolute terms over the period 19 75-78 but were
insufficient to compensate for the loss of competitiveness induced by higher
Korean prices relative to its major trading partners. As a result, the real
effective exchange rate deteriorated sharply for Korean exporters over that
period.
1.12       Export Incentive System.  Government incentives to exporting
industries include tax exemption, accelerated depreciation allowances,
refund of import duties on raw materials used for export production, deferred
payment of tariffs on equipment and access to subsidized credit. These
incentives are administered within the framework of an export targeting system
whereby exporting firms set for themselves certain export targets in agreement
with overall government objectives. A monthly conference is held to review
and adjust targets as well as government policies affecting their
imp lementation.
1.13       While the emphasis has clearly been on export promotion, key
import substitution industries have received substantial government support
in the form of partial tax and tariff exemptions, as well as protection from
competing imports. Production for the domestic market, however, has
generally been subject to higher duties, taxes, and interest charges on
borrowings. In 1977-78, the Government has relaxed a number of import
restrictions as part of an import liberalization program to be implemented
over a four-year period. Banned items have been abolished; since January 1,
1979, 69% of all import items are subject to automatic approval, 31% are



- 6 -
itrestricted"./l Tariff adjustments have also been introduced to improve the
competitiveness of import substituting industries. The simple average tariff
rate has been reduced from 36% to 25%.
Recent Performance
1.14      The performance of the Korean economy in the first two years
(1977-78) of the Fourth Five Year Plan (FFYP) period has exceeded the
ambitious plan targets. The average annual growth rate of GNP reached 11.5%
in real terms compared to the 9.5% envisaged in the plan for 1977 and 1978.
Due to unexpected gains in Korea's terms of trade, the real gross national
income grew by almost 28%, nearly reaching in two years the growth targeted
in the first three years of the FFYP. The per capita income in current US
dollars reached $1,242 in 1978. The growth rate of investment was twice as
high as that of GNP in 1977 and three times as high in 1978. With the
relative decline in the share of investments in inventories, the rate of
increase in gross fixed capital formation was even faster than in total
investment. Manufacturing, transport and dwellings accounted for 83% of the
increase in gross fixed capital formation in 1978. In spite of this
phenomenal growth in real investment during 1977-78, Korea's reliance on
foreign savings has declined compared to the 1972-76 period as a result of a
remarkable improvement in national savings. The national saving income
*ratio has increased from 18% in 1975 to 25.6% in 1977 and 27.2% in 1978.
1.15      The industrial sector has provided a major impetus to GNP
growth over the period 19 77-78. The growth rate of the manufacturing sector
averaged 17% p.a. in real terms over that two-year period, considerably
exceeding the FFYP target of 15.8% p.a.  During the period 1977-78, the
overall rate of growth of employment reached 3.7% p.a. but manufacturing
employment grew at 6.1% p.a. Manufacturing accounted for 22.4% of total
employment in 1978. Real wages in the manufacturing sector increased at
an average of 19.5% during 1977-78, substantially in excess of productivity
gains which reached 11.3% p.a. This may to some extent reflect a tightening
of the labor market particularly the increasing demand for skilled labor.
Prospects
1.16      The stresses imposed on the Korean economy by the rapid pace of
growth over the period 1977-78 have prompted the Government to initiate a
stabilization program in April 1979. The FFYP has been revised accordingly
and a new Economic Management Plan was introduced for the remaining plan
period of 1979-81. The main elements of the Government's program include a
deliberate slowdown in GNP growth, reduction in the growth rate of credit
and money supply, a moderate pursuit of export growth and greater emphasis
/1   In early 1978, 54% of all items were subject to automatic approval,
41% were restricted and 5% were banned.



- 7 -
on light industries geared to the domestic market. GNP growth is expected
to slow down from 11.5% to 9.3% during 1979-81. The growth of value added in
the manufacturing sector would decline from 19.7% in 1978 to an average of
13.5% for 19 ,-81. Domestic investment would also be reduced from 30% to
about 13% p.a. On January 12, 1980, Korea devalued the won by 16.55% from
W 485 to W 580 to the US dollar in an attempt to promote the competitiveness
of its exports. It is expected that such a measure will increase the momentum
of increased production and exports, which showed signs of slowing down in
the second half of 1979. The devaluation is one step towards achieving
an expanded economy based on enlarged exports, which will remain the engine
of economic growth.
2. THE SMALL INDUSTRY SECTOR
Definition
2.01      A support program aimed specifically at smaller enterprises was
initiated by the Government in the early 1960s with the enactment of the
Small and Medium Industry Cooperative Law, the Small and Medium Industries
Basic Act and the special act establishing the Small and Medium Industry
Bank (SMIB). These laws generally aimed at reducing overcompetition and at
fostering the modernization and rationalization of production by smaller
industries. No distinction is made in Korea between medium-sized and small
enterprises; both are entitled to the same degree of support. The cutoff
point between small and medium industries (SMI) and their larger competitors
has been adjusted upwards over time to take account of the economic
development of the country and of inflationary pressures. The present
limitation which has been in effect since January 1977 is set in terms of
employment or total assets as indicated below:
Sector                          Total assets      or    No. of employees
(W million)
Mining, manufacturing and
transportation                     500                       300 /a
Construction                        500                        50
Commerce and services                50                        20
/a   The 1979 Enforcement Decree of the Small and Medium Industry
Promotion Law raises the employment criterion to 500 for
selected industries including automobile parts, electronic products,
cycle parts, etc.



- 8 -
In applying for financial assistance, enterprises which exceed both of the
above criteria must apply to the Korea Development Bank (KDB) which only
caters to large firms; enterprises which satisfy either of the above
criteria (and have more than five employees) can approach SMIB.
2.02      The Citizens National Bank (CNB) was established in 1972 for the
purpose of mobilizing household savings and for making available to its
depositors small consumer and business loans. The scope of its operations
has been gradually expanded to include payment guarantees, transactions in
foreign currency and, since 1977, borrowing and lending in foreign currency.
Over time, CNB has been placing increasing emphasis on lending for small
business'. ½"overnment regulations which limited its lending to enterprises
employing less than 50 persons have been relaxed in February 1977 to include
enterprises employing up to 100 persons. The smaller segment of SM¢ is
therefore eligible for financial assistance from both SMIB and CNB. In this
report the small-scale industry (SSI) sector is notionally defined as the
segment of SMI comprising enterprises employing up to 100 persons.
2.03      A sample survey of the SMI sector conducted in 1978 by the Korea
Federation of Small Business (KFSB) indicates a high correlation between
size of employment and total assets. The survey indicates that 92% of the
total number of enterprises employing up to 100 persons had assets of
less than W 200 million /1 and 98% had assets of less than W 500 million./l
Given the impact of inflation in the past two years, it can be assumed that
approximately 95% of the population of enterprises employing less than 100
persons would have assets of less t-han W 500 million in 1980 prices. Small
scale industries in Korea can therefore be defined as enterprises employing
less than 100 persons or having assets of less than W 500 million. The KFSB
survey also shows a correlation between an employment size of 50 persons and
assets of W 250 million (in 1980 prices). Indications are that an employment
size of 300 can be linked with a total asset size of W 1.5 to 2 billion which
shows that the delineation in terms of assets between size and large
industries currently in force (para. 2.01) might need to be revised upwards.
Role of SSI in the Korean Economy
2.04      Annex 1 summarizes recent trends in the contribution of small,
medium and large enterprises to the manufacturing sector./2 SSI enterprises

The share of SSI in total manufacturing investment reached 10.9% in 1977,
a ratio which has remained practically unchanged for the past four years
except in 1976 when it peaked at 13.5%. No separate statistics are
available to show SSI contribution to Korean exports, the export orientation
of the SMI sector (including SSI) however is quite impressive: while SMI
accounted for 31% of total manufacturing output in 1977, their share of
total commodity exports reached 36.2%. This strong performance reflects
to a large extent SMI responsiveness to government incentives for export
orientation. Particularly effective in this respect are the subcontracting
and cooperative arrangements whereby SMI improve the marketability of their
production. A CNB survey indicates that export sales accounted for 16% of
total SSI sales in 1976 with no more than 22% being exported directly by the
producer. About 60% of SSI sales were actually sold on order from other
firms or through subcontracting arrangements.
2.05      The following table shows the growth trends in small, medium
and large enterprises over the period 1963-77. In 1963, SSI was the
most important sector in terms of employment and generated 42% of total
manufacturing value added. Over the following decade, however, the emphasis
lay on the development of large industry whose rapid growth overshadowed the
SSI sector. In recent years however, SSI enterprises have received more
support and SSI value added has been growing at an average of 40% p.a. over
the past five years, about the same rate as for medium and large enterprises.
Labor productivity measured by the ratio of value added per employee reached
51% of productivity in large enterprises in 1977 compared to 47% in 1973.
Productivity gains in SSI have apparently more than kept pace with those
registered by larger enterprises.

Industrial Structure of SSI Sector
2.06      The subsectoral distribution of value added and employment by
size of enterprise in 1977 is summarized below. In 1977, the four
subsectors of textiles, fabricated metals, food products and chemicals
together accounted for 71.5% of value added and 74.3% of employment in the
SSI sector. While the sectoral distribution is not substantially different
for medium and larger enterprises, it is interesting to note that the
dependence on these four subsectors increases with the size of enterprises
to reach 80% in medium industries and 83% in large industries for both value
added and employment. Labor productivity within the SSI sector is lowest in
textiles and highest in chemicals and nonmetallic minerals.

Regional Distribution of SSI
2.07      The following table shows that in 1977 SSI employment was less
concentrated in the main industrial areas of Seoul, Pusan and Gyonggi than
either medium or large industries.  SSI employment outside these areas
reached 40% in 1977, compared with 31% only for medium and large enter-
prises.

It is interesting to note however that the share of large industry
employment in Seoul and Pusan has been declining rapidly from 56% in 1972 to
50.5% in 1976 and 46.7% in 1977. This trend is the consequence of
Government restrictions on the establishment of new large industries in
these two cities and of a concerted policy of relocation of existing plants.
Paradoxically, small and medium industries which are not subject to the same
restrictions show an increased concentration in the Seoul area.
Fixed Capital Formation in SSI
2.08      Additions to fixed assets in the SSI sector can be estimated on
the basis of the manufacturing surveys conducted annually by EPB. According
to these surveys, fixed asset investment in the manufacturing sector
increased in current terms from W 589 billion in 1974 to W 1,336 billion in
1977 which represents an average annual growth rate of 31.5%. Over the same
period, SSI fixed assets investment fluctuated in relative terms but reached W
145 billion or 10.9% of total manufacturing investment in 1977 compared to W
65 billion or 11% in 1974. Over the four-year period 1974-77, SSI investment
has kept pace with overall fixed capital formation in manufacturing. No
drastic change is expected in the coming years. National income statistics
show an upsurge in manufacturing investment of 67.5% in current terms
in 1978; on that basis SSI fixed investment would have reached W 243 billion
in 1978. Based on the revised objectives of the Economic Management
Plan for the period 1979-81, manufacturing investment can be expected to
grow at a minimum average of 15% p.a. in current terms. SSI investment
should keep pace with this rate of growth and reach W 280 billion in 1979,
W 320 billion in 1980 and W 370 billion in 1981.



- 13 -
2.09      The BOK 1978 analysis of the financial structure of manufacturing
enterprises suggests that investment in land and buildings accounts for about
40% of SMI fixed assets with the remaining 60% allocated to machinery and
equipment. Another survey of SSI investment by CNB shows that similar ratios
prevail in the small industry sector and indicates that foreign currency
expenditures account for about 25% of total SSI investment in machinery and
equipment. The foreign exchange demand of SSI sector for the period 1979-81
can therefore be estimated as follows:
1978      1979       1980       1981
Total SSI fixed investment
(W billion)                        243        280        320        370
Total SSI investment in
machinery and equipment
(W billion)                        146        168        192        222
Foreign exchange demand
(US$ million)                     75.3       86.6       99.0      114.4
2.10      Until 1978, SMIB was the only source of foreign exchange finance
for SSI investment. Over the period 1976-78, the SSI sector /1 accounted
for approximately 40% of SMIB's foreign exchange lending, reaching a high
of US$42 million in 1978. SMIB's foreign exchange lending is expected to
expand at a rate of 7% p.a. over the coming years thus reaching US$45
million in 1979, US$48 million in 1980 and US$51 million in 1981. SMIB's
supply of foreign exchange would therefore cover less than half of estimated
SSI demand. The gap between supply and demand would reach US$41.6 million
in 1979, US$51 million in 1980 and US$63.4 million in 1981. CNB having
started its foreign currency lending operations in 1979 is expected to cover
a part of this gap.
Financial Structure of SSI
2.11      An analysis of the financial structure and performance of SSI
enterprises is available from SMIB's annual surveys of the SMI sector. The
ratio of fixed assets to total assets was surprisingly high in 1977 for very
small SMI enterprises but declined rapidly with size (74% for enterprises
having 5 to 9 workers, 54% for 10-19 and 46% for 20-49). BOK statistics for
/1   i.e. enterprises employing less than 100 workers.



- 14 -
1978 show an average fixed assets ratio of 36% for the SMI sector /1 well
below the 50% recorded by large enterprises./2   Assuming that the fixed
assets ratio can be considered as a reliable indicator of production
capacity and of capital utilization in the manufacturing sector, it appears
that medium sized enterprises employing 100 to 300 workers are more
efficient than both smaller and larger units. The total debt/equity ratio
of SSI enterprises is very low reaching only 0.3:1 for enterprises with less
than 9 workers and rising gradually to 1.8:1 for enterprises with 50-100
workers. These figures reflect the high reliance of SSI on self-financing;
in 1977, the ratio of net worth to total assets reached 77% for 5-9 workers
and declined to 36% for 50-100 workers. The unorganized money market (UMM)
however accounted for a minor share of 6-14% (increasing in smaller
enterprises) of total borrowings. Data on the source of funds of SSI
investment confirm that in 1977 self-financing accounted for 60% of SSI
fixed asset investments and the UMM for about 1.3%. In 1978, however,
resources available to smaller SSI enterprises from financial institutions
declined in relative terms and UMM borrowings financed about 8% of
investment by enterprises with 5-20 workers. The profitability of SSI
enterprises is markedly higher than for larger enterprises. Return on total
assets reached 12% for the 5-9 worker category in 1977 and declined to 7.6%
for 10-19 workers, 6.8% for 20-49 workers and 5.1% for 50-100 workers. By
comparison, the same ratio stood at 2.6% for large enterprises.
Government Support for SSI
2.12      As indicated above, there is no Government assistance program
aimed specifically at the smaller end of the SMI sector. Since the early
1960s, however, the Government has launched a number of programs and
established institutions which support the "nonlarge" sector of industries
labelled small and medium for the sake of convenience. CNB is the only
institution which is limited to providing financial assistance to smaller
enterprises with less than 50 workers until 1977 and less than 100 since
then. The following paragraphs accordingly review the programs of
government support for the SMI sector as a whole.
Nonfinancial Support of SMI
2.13      The Small and Medium Industry Basic Law, enacted in 1966, provides
the main orientations of government support in favor of SMI enterprises.
The primary objectives for the sector are (a) improvements in the production
process and quality of SMI; (b) protection of SMI from unfair competition by
larger industries; (c) establishment of linkages with larger industries; and
/1   i.e. enterprises employing 5 to 299 workers.
/2   employing over 300 workers.



- 15 -
(d) promotion of cooperative efforts. The Law also provides that
appropriate amounts of financial assistance should be supplied to support
these objectives. The Bureau of Small and Medium Industry of the Ministry
of Commerce and Industry is responsible for implementation of the Basic Law.
The SMI Bureau is expected to gather general information on the status and
development of the SMI sector and to assist in the formulation of government
policies. The Bureau also monitors the performance of the specialized
institutions, both technical and financial which cater to the needs of the
sector. In practice, the limited staff of the SMI Bureau and the fact that
SMIB and CNB are supervised by the Ministry of Finance has substantially
constrained the efficiency of the Bureau in its efforts to coordinate the
delivery of technical and financial assistance to SMI. In order to
alleviate these shortcomings, new legislation was enacted in late 1978. The
Small and Medium Industry Promotion Law provides for the establishment of a
Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation (SMIPC) as an independent
government entity in charge of promoting the modernization of SMI operations
and of supporting SMI cooperative projects.
2.14      The Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation.  Established
in January 1979, SMIPC operates under the direct supervision of the SMI
Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Over time, the Government
expects SMIPC to develop into a powerful national agency in charge of
implementing policies for the development of the SMI sector. SMIPC can
therefore be expected to develop gradually its capability to supervise and
coordinate the delivery of technical and financial assistance to SMI by the
various specialized agencies. At present, however, SMIPC still is a very
young institution with limited capabilities. SMIPC's major activities cover
(a) financing and implementing the modernization of specific SMI projects in
priority sectors as defined by MCI; (b) financing and implementing such
cooperative activities as industrial estates and common processing
facilities; (c) delivery of managerial and technological assistance through
on-site extension services and staff training; and (d) research and
publication of data on the SMI sector as a whole and on specific industrial
subsectors.
2.15      In order to carry out these functions, SMIPC has recruited capable
professionals, mostly with an engineering background, and has been able to
offer a very competitive salary scale relative to other government institu-
tions. Its total staff reached 151 at end October 1979 of which about 100
were professionals. Recruitment of about 50 more engineers is planned for
1980. Government expectations from the establishment of SMIPC can be
measured by the size of the financial resources made available to it mainly
from annual budgetary resources. These resources /1 reached W 26.5 billion
/1 Called the SMI Promotion Fund.



- 16 -
in 1979 and comprised (i) W 15.7 billion /1 in funds loanable to individual
SMI projects through SMIB; (ii) W 5.5 billion for cooperative and industrial
estate projects; (iii) W 1.6 billion for administrative expenses; and (iv)
W 3.7 billion for extension services and training. Total resources avail-
able to SMIPC in 1980 as Promotion Fund are expected to reach W 31.3 bil-
lion, including W 16.5 billion in loanable funds. The use of loanable
resources available from the Promotion Fund is restricted in the Enforcement
Decree of the SMI Promotion Act to enterprises employing more than 50
workers and having assets of more than W 100 million. The upper limit of
300 workers normally applicable to SMI enterprises has been raised for
specific industries to 500 workers.
2.16      Korea Federation of Small Business (KFSB).  Established in 1962 in
accordance with the SMI Cooperative Act, the Federation is the apex
institution for SMI provincial and national cooperatives. At end-July 1979,
16,100 SMI firms held membership in one of the 181 cooperatives controlled
by the Federation. The main activities of the Federation comprise joint
purchases and sales to member enterprises, delivery of technical and
managerial assistance and compilation of data and surveys of the SMI sector
as a whole.
2.17      Promotion of Rural Industries.  Beginning in the early 1970s, the
Government has been placing greater emphasis on the creation of off-farm
employment.  The Saemaeul Program incorporates various elements including
one directed at the establishment of SMI projects in rural areas. By end
August 1979, a total of 651 factories had been identified as Saemaeul
projects and 509 had been completed. Total employment creation was
estimated at about 70,000. For 1980, establishment of 100 new Saemaeul
factories is being planned.
2.18       In addition to the Saemaeul Program, the Government has been
encouraging a better regional dispersal of industries by sponsoring and
financing industrial estates reserved for SMI. By end-1978, there were 11
such estates operating in Korea. SMIPC is now expected to take the lead in
planning and establishing new industrial estates and common processing
facilities for SMI. To increase its effectiveness, SMIPC has recently
proposed to the Government a revision of the cumbersome and ineffective
legislation currently applying to the establishment of industrial estates.
2.19      Other Programs.  The Government has launched a number of programs
aimed at supporting specific objectives and activities within the SMI sec-
tor. The 1975 SMI-Affiliation Law aims at promoting linkages between large
and smaller enterprises. So far, 37 large enterprises have established
/L W 15.4 billion for working capital and W 0.3 billion for equipment
purchases.



- 17 -
such relations with some 157 SMI units operating in 5 industrial activities.
Firm contracts subject to government approval and control must be
established between large firms and their suppliers. In addition, the
Government has reserved 23 activities /1 for SMI firms only.  In 1976, the
Government also initiated a program of assistance to SMI machinery
producers. Five hundred enterprises would be selected from priority sub-
sectors between 1976 and 1981; by end 1978, 200 had been identified.
2.20      An area in which government programs have not been very successful
is technical and managerial assistance. In 1979, the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry had accredited seven institutions /2 which were expected to
deliver on-site guidance and provide training to the workers of SMI
enterprises. A total of 3,335 firms were expected to receive on-site
guidance. The number of firms to be assisted ranged from 5 for CNB to 2,200
for the Chamber of Industry. By end-August 1979, no more than 860 had
actually been assisted. Several of the agencies expected to assist SMI
enterprises are not equipped to do so efficiently. Most of them cater to a
particular segment of the SMI sector and duplication is almost inevitable.
It seems that an urgent task of reorganization and coordination needs to be
undertaken by the Government in the area of technical assistance to SMI.
Financial Institutions Supporting SMI
2.21      Financial assistance programs are discussed in para. 2.19.  The
institutional framework for the delivery of financial assistance to the SMI
sector comprises SMIB, CNB and the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF). In
addition to these institutions which specialize in assisting the SMI
sector,/3 the commercial banks also provide a large proportion of the
financial resources, albeit mostly short-term, to Korean SMI.
2.22      The Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB).  Established in 1961,
SMIB is a government-owned institution /4 geared specifically to meet the
financial and to a lesser extent technical assistance requirements of SMI.
Its mandate encompasses assistance to entrepreneurs employing 5 to 300 em-
ployees. SMIB's total loan portfolio reached W 457 billion (US$942 million)
/1 Such as knitted toys and printing.
/2 Comprising the Industry Advancement Administration of the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry, SMIPC, the Korea Federation of Small Business,
the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Korea Credit Guarantee
Fund, CNB, and SMIB.
/3 Except for KCGF which also issues guarantees for large-scale priority
industries (45% of outstanding guarantees).
/4 The Government owns 99.9% of SMIB's share capital.



- 18 -
at end-1978 and SMIB's clientele comprised 17,000 of the 27,000 SMI
enterprises in the manufacturing sector. The Government has recently au-
thorized an increase in SMIB's authorized share capital from W 30 billion to
W 100 billion in order to allow a further expansion of its lending
operations. SMIB's disbursements of term loans for equipment financing
reached about US$195 million in 1978 of which about 54% was in foreign
exchange. On average, approximately 46% of SMIB's total term lending over
the period 1976-78 has gone to the SSI sector defined as enterprises
employing up to 100 workers. SMIB's long-term lending to the SSI sector
reached W 35 billion in 1978 compared to W 17.1 billion for CNB.
2.23      The Citizens National Bank (CNB).  Established in 1962, CNB has
been very successful in attracting deposits from small savers. Its total
deposits reached W 1,010 billion at end-September 1979. Its loan portfolio,
short- and long-term, reached W 523 billion or 52% at the same date because
of restrictions imposed by MOF on its lending operations. CNB's total loan
disbursements reached W 341 billion in 1978 of which W 170 million (50%) was
for SSI and the balance for consumer financing. Of CNB's total SSI lending,
about 10% was in the form of term loans (subject to a maximum maturity of
five years). In 1979, CNB received a foreign currency loan of US$10 million
from ADB. These resources as well as the proposed US$30 million Bank loan
would enable CNB to cover partly the existing gap between demand and supply
of foreign currency resources in the SSI sector.
2.24      Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF).  Formerly operated by SMIB,
the KCGF became an independent institution in 1976. The KCGF is authorized
to issue guarantees with a maximum outstanding amount of 15 times its share
capital which reached W 96.2 billion at end-July 1979.  Total outstanding
guarantees reached W 543 billion at that date with 52% extended to SMI
enterprises./l About 80% of KCGF guarantees are for working capital loans.
Average guarantee size reached W 26 million in 1978. Separate figures for
SSI industries are not available.  Eighty percent of KCGF's share capital at
end-1978 came from annual remittances from deposit money banks equivalent to
0.5% of their outstanding loan portfolio. The balance consisted primarily
of retained earnings. KCGF charges an annual fee of 1% on loan guarantees
payable by the subborrower. Guarantee coverage by KCGF is limited to W 1
billion for large industrial and W 500 million for SMI. Guarantees are
available for projects with insufficient collateral; the KCGF is not
expected to give any guarantee coverage on the basis of risk.
/1  The KCGF Act stipulates that at least 40% of guarantees outstanding
should be for the SMI sector.

Flow of Funds to SMI
2.25      The Korean SMI sector receives direct financial support from (a)
the commercial banks (nationwide and local banks); (b) the Small and
Medium Industry Bank; and (c) the Citizens National Bank. The following
table shows a breakdown by source of funds of SMI loans outstanding over
the period 1976-November 30, 1979.
LOANS OUTSTANDING TO SMI SECTOR
(in W billion)
1976            1977             1978            1979
Amount  %       Amount   %       Amount   %      Amount   %
Nationwide banks   437.5   45        632.3   48        908.6   48    1,295.4   50
Local banks         146.4   15       204.8   15        273.0   15       358.3   14
SMIB                225.4   23       296.5   22       456.9   24       613.9   24
CNB                 166.5   17       193.4   15       237.5   13        305.2   12
Total             975.8  100    1,327.0  100    1,876.0  100    2,572.8  100
It is apparent from the above table that commercial banks represent the
major source of financial support for SMI with nearly two-thirds of the
total SMI portfolio. To a large extent, this results from a BOK requirement
that SMI lending account for 30% of the loan portfolio of nationwide
banks./1 Most of these loans however are short-term. The lending rate
applicable to these loans is the standard rate of 18.5% p.a. for loans under
three years and 19.5% over three years. SMIB has been able over the period
1976/77 to maintain a 22-24% share of outstanding SMI loans. It is
estimated that approximately 45% of its loans were extended to small
enterprises employing less than 100 persons and 55% to medium sized
ventures.
2.26      CNB's share in total SMI lending has been declining regularly over
the past three years to a point where its outstanding SSI portfolio barely
exceeds the estimated SSI component of SMIB's portfolio. This is primarily
due to the very tight credit ceilings imposed by MOF on CNB's lending
operations. These ceilings effectively prevent CNB from using for lending
purposes all the resources it mobilizes from depositors.
2.27      An important feature of SNI lending is that contrary to other
directed lending programs undertaken by financial institutions at the
/1 40% in the case of local banks.



- 20 -
request of the Government, only a minor portion can be considered as sub-
sidized credit. Net increases in SMI lending operations had been projected
by BOK at W 300 billion for 1979. Of this total, the subsidized SMI Low
Interest Fund channelled by SMIB at 15% p.a. amounted to W 60 billion or
20%. In addition, SMIB has been operating since early 1979 as the lending
channel for the SMI Promotion Fund /i (para. 2.14) whose proceeds are onlent
to borrowers at rates of 10% to 15% with a 2% spread accruing to SMIB.
3. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Financing Long-Term Capital Investment
3.01       Inspite of some recourse to rolling over of short-term borrowings
by and large Korean enterprises except for the SSI sector have had reasonable
access to long-term resources /2 to finance their investments.  These
resources comprise internally generated funds, including additional equity
financing from shareholders and external resources, i.e. borrowings. BOK
surveys of fund flow statements of manufacturing enterprises and other
studies of investment patterns in Korea suggest that internally generated
funds account for as much as 50% of GDCF in the SSI sector and about 40% for
larger firms.  It can be inferred from these studies that, on average, self-
financing accounts for about 45% of manufacturing GDCF. External sources
which comprise both domestic institutional sources (bank and nonbank) and
noninstitutional sources (capital markets, direct borrowings from abroad and
the UMM) provide the 55% balance of GDCF. Based on current price GDCF,
total financial resources raised externally by Korean manufacturing enter-
prises in 1978 could be estimated at W 850 billion.
3.02       Findings of the Financial Sector Mission, which visited Korea in
November 1979, show that in 1978 institutional sources of funds in Korea
provided incremental long-tenn resources aggregating W 591 billion; this
represented 67% of total resources mobilized externally for financing
manufacturing investment. Noninstitutional sources provided the remaining
W 259 billion. Among these, corporate debentures issued on the capital
market provided more than half.
3.03       The above figures indicate that institutional sources of funds
are the second largest source of long-term funds for the manufacturing
sector after self-financing. This role has been growing in importance over
the past few years; annual increments in outstanding term loans of financial
/1 W 15.7 billion in 1979.
/2   i.e. resources whose maturity exceeds one year.



- 21 -
institutions to the manufacturing sector have grown at an average annual
rate of 50% over the period 1976-78, compared to a growth in manufacturing
GDCF of 42% p.a. As a result, increments in term loans outstanding which
accounted for 29% of manufacturing GDCF in 1975 reached 38% in 1978.
3.04      A tremendous expansion was also recorded in the corporate bond
market. The volume of funds raised by placement of debentures on the
securities market has grown by an average of 95% p.a. over the 1975-78
period. Corporate bond issues by manufacturing sector firms reached nearly
W 241 billion in 1978 /1 compared to W 32 billion in 1975.
Financing Short-Term Requirements
3.05      The supply of long-term resources represents only part of the
support which institutional sources of funds provide to the manufacturing
sector. Manufacturing firms rely primarily on financial institutions,
including short term finance companies, for the supply of short-term
resources to cover their working capital requirements. Other sources of
funds are practically limited to the unorganized money market. As a
consequence, short-term lending operations represent a major part of the
portfolio of Korean financial institutions./2 Over the period 1976-78,
short-term operations accounted for 66% of the increases in the total
outstanding portfolio of financial institutions /3 and increments in the
outstanding short-term portfolio of financial institutions have grown at an
average of 59% p.a., faster than the 50% growth in term lending.
Institutional Sources of Funds
3.06      The institutional set-up of the Korean financial sector can be
divided into banking (or monetary) institutions which accept deposits from
the general public and nonbank financial institutions. Banking institutions
are also called "deposit money banks" (DMBs); they comprise conventional
commercial banks including branches of foreign banks and six specialized
banks./4

The operations of commercial banks are directly supervised by the Bank of
Korea (BOK) while specialized banks are under the control of the Ministry of
Finance (MOF).
3.07      Over the period 1975-78, some deepening of the financial sector
has taken place with the growing importance of nonbanking institutions.
The share of nonbank financial institutions in the total gross assets of
the financial sector reached 27% in 1978 compared to 23% in 1975. This
sign of maturing notwithstanding, the banking system still accounted for
73% of the sector's total assets in 1978 and BOK and the commercial banks
together accounted for 50% of total assets in the financial sector.
Deposit Money Banks
3.08      The Commercial Banks.  The commercial banking sector in Korea
comprises: (a) five Government controlled commercial banks with a nationwide
network of branches; (b) ten banks with operations localized in each
province; and (c) branches of foreign commercial banks. In aggregate, the
assets of commercial banks accounted for 36.9% of the total assets of the
financial sector in 1978 down from 37.7% in 1975; this component ratio could
be broken down into 30.1% for the five nationwide banks, 4.1% for the ten
regional banks and 2.7% for branches of foreign banks. The commercial
banking group remains by far the largest source of funds of the manufacturing
sector, but its importance has been slowly declining over time. The com-
mercial banks accounted for 65% of the increase in outstanding loans to the
manufacturing sector during 1978 compared to 73% in 1974. Their operations,
however, are heavily skewed towards short-term lending. In 1978, short-term
loans reached close to 90% of the increase in the total commercial bank
portfolio. In the same year, the commercial banks supplied only 21% of
the increase in the aggregate long-term portfolio of the financial sector as
a whole. By comparison, the Korea Development Bank (KDB), which is the
largest nonbank financial institution in Korea, accounted for 33%.
3.09      Deposits represent the major source of funds of commercial banks.
In 1978, demand and savings deposits together accounted for 54.3% of their
total aggregate liabilities (including equity). This ratio actually was
substantially lower than the 71.1% reached in 1970. Demand deposits have
marginally increased their share of total resources to 21.4% but time and
savings deposits have declined regularly from 52.4% in 1970 to 32.9% in
1978. This sharp decline can be related to the 1972 reduction in interest
rates and the resulting negative real deposit rates.
3.10       Specialized Banks.  The six specialized banks were established
by the Government in the early 1960s to service particular economic
sectors. Their aggregate assets accounted for 22.8% of the total assets of
the financial sector in 1978 down from 23.6% in 1975. The Korea Exchange
Bank, which was established in 1967 to take over the commercial foreign



- 23 -
exchange transactions of BOK, accounts for more than half the total assets
of specialized banks. Demand and savings deposits represent the main source
of funds of specialized banks and accounted for 56% of their total liabili-
ties and equity at mid-1978.
Nonbank Financial Intermediaries
3.11      The declining share of the monetary system, i.e., specialized
banks, commercial banks, and BOK /1 in the total assets of the financial
sector reflects a certain deepening of the sector linked to the growing
importance of nonbank financial institutions. The average annual growth
rate of the assets of nonbank financial institutions, reached 24% in real
terms over the period 1975-78 compared to an average of 17.3% for the
financial sector as a whole. Their share of total assets therefore
increased from 23.2% in 1975 to 27.1% in 1978. Nonbank financial inter-
mediaries comprise: (a) four development banks /2 of which the Korea
Development Bank (KDB) is by far the largest; (b) the trust account of the
Bank of Seoul and Trust; (c) life and nonlife insurance companies; (d)
short-term finance companies (STFC); (e) mutual savings and finance
companies; (f) postal savings accounts; and (g) securities firms. Out of
the seven types of nonbank intermediaries, development banks constitute the
largest group as they account for 64% of total assets of nonbank
intermediaries.
3.12      The Bank Group is associated with the two development banks active
in the industrial sector: KDB and the Korea Development Finance Corporation
(KDFC)./3 KDB is the single largest financial institution in Korea. As
the principal agent of government financing programs in the industrial
sector, it deals primarily with large public and private sector enterprises.
Because of the relatively large share of power and transportation projects
in its portfolio, the manufacturing sector accounted for 40% of all loans
outstanding at end-1978, a lower proportion than for other Korean financial
Institutions. The privately-owned KDFC also finances relatively large
industrial enterprises. Its clientele is restricted to the private sector
and until now it has been providing almost exclusively long-term resources
/1  BOK's share of financial sector assets declined from 15.5% in 1975 to
13.2% in 1978.
/2  The Korea Development Bank; the Korea Development Finance Corporation;
the Korea Export-Import Bank; and the Land Bank.
/3  The Bank has also made three loans available to SMIB and is proposing
that a first loan be considered for CNB. Both institutions are con-
sidered as deposit money banks because they accept deposits from the
general public. A relatively large part of their operations is, in
fact, development financing.



- 24 -
in foreign currencies. In response to rising demands for domestic currency
financing, KDFC is in the process of being converted into a long-term credit
bank which should, inter alia, ensure its access to larger amounts of
long-term domestic currency resources.
Noninstitutional Sources of Funds
3.13      Noninstitutional sources of funds include the unorganized money
market (UMM) which is primarily a source of short-term resources. Estimates
of the importance of the UMM are made difficult by the very nature of trans-
actions and by the fact that a substantial part of the lending operations of
short-term finance companies actually represent "recycled" UMM resources.
Medium-term suppliers' or buyers' credits have been a substantial source of
funds for Korean industries. These direct borrowings from abroad might
actually be considered as an institutional source of funds since their
availability is usually dependent upon a counterguarantee from a local
bank.
3.14      Other noninstitutional sources of funds comprise direct foreign
equity investments and the domestic securities market. Direct foreign
investments are restricted by the Government to specific sectors and reached
about US$77 million in 1978. The stock and bond markets, particularly
the latter, have developed over the past few years into a major source of
funds for the manufacturing sector. The importance of the stock market as a
source of term finance has fluctuated during the 1970s. Stock market
activity expanded rapidly through ihe mid-70s as a result of government
incentives to induce firms to go public. The main incentive was in the form
of a 13% tax differential which has been reduced to 5% since 1978. New
listings increased by 10% only in 1978 and no new listings were registered
in 1979. Trading declined and the stock price index plummeted from 202.8 at
end-1978 to 178.2 as of September 30, 1979. Funds raised by manufacturing
enterprises on the stock market reached about W 141.1 billion in 1978.
3.15      Since 1977, the corporate bond market has been supplying more
resources to the manufacturing sector than the stock market. In 1978, the
sale of bonds reached US$497 million compared to US$55 million in 1974. The
effective yield of bonds varies from 25.5 to 27.4% for a 1-3 year maturity.
The rapid growth of the bond market is to a large extent due to the
favorable tax treatment granted to buyers for income derived from the
purchase of bonds.
Government Control and Direction
3.16      The operations of the financial sector in Korea are characterized
by close Government control on the institutions themselves and on their
allocation of funds. The Government directly owns controlling participa-
tions in the share capital of four of the five nationwide commercial banks
and indirectly controls the fifth one. The Governent also has majority
holdings in the specialized banks and is in full control of the Korea



- 25 -
Development Bank. The top management of these institutions is usually
appointed directly by the highest authority under recommendation by the
Minister of Finance.
3.17      Directed Credit.  Government controls are most pervasive in the
area of fund allocation. The Government through the BOK and MOF manages a
system of "directed" lending, whereby funds are allocated to specific
priority sectors, subsectors or individual project enterprises in line with
macro-economic objectives. The financial intermediaries are the implementing
agencies of this directed lending program.
3.18      The selective credit programs include the support of export
activities as the highest priority, the restructuring of the industrial
sector with emphasis on heavy and chemical industries and assistance to
smaller manufacturing enterprises. These lending programs are channelled
through the deposit money banks, primarily the commercial banks, and through
KDB. They are made available to borrowers primarily in the form of
short-term credits for export loans and medium- to long-term credits for
other types of directed lending. There is increasing doubt about the
adequacy of maintaining the rigid system of directed lending in Korea
because of the growing complexity of the economy and the resulting need for
responsive fine tuning. There is no question however that this system has
largely contributed in the past to the phenomenal growth and transformation
of the industrial sector.
3.19      Subsidized Credit.  An imuportant feature of directed credits is
the interest rate subsidy attached to most of these loans, a notable
exception being the SMI loans of commercial banks. Prior to January 12,
1980, loans for export were generally available at 9% p.a. Equipment loans
carried a rate of 15% to 16% compared to a standard rate of 18.5% to 20.5%.
Export credit accounted for 62% of all subsidized loans outstanding with
deposit money banks at end-1978. KDB handles primarily subsidized loans
funded from the National Investment Fund (NIF). These loans accounted for 46%
of KDB's total lending to the manufacturing sector in 1978. Including other
types of selective credits, 67.6% of KDB's lending in 1978 was in the form of
subsidized loans. By comparison, subsidized lending by deposit money banks
accounted for 40% of their manufacturing loan portfolio at end-1978.
3.20      Close to 72% of subsidized credits outstanding with deposit money
banks at end-1978 were funded from their own resources but were re-
discountable with BOK. Government funded programs represented 8% and NIF
resources /1 20%. In spite of the negative spread between the average cost
of deposit resources and the lending rate for export loans, the
profitability of commercial banks is not overly affected since these loans
can be rediscounted with BOK with a 5% positive spread for 80% of their
value.

purchase NIF bonds.



- 26 -
Lending Rates and Inflation
3.21      The system of subsidized lending described above aims at (a)
improving the competitiveness of Korean exports; and (b) improving financial
returns to potential investors in economically desirable projects. The
efficacy of this system of subsidized lending is being increasingly
questioned, not only because of the negative interest spreads accruing to
the financial sector as a whole in view of the higher costs of deposits but
also because of potential misallocations of funds. Criticism has also been
voiced about the inability of the financial sector to improve the level of
national savings primarily because of negative real interest rates on
deposits. In order to restore the savings ratio to its 1969-73 level of
21-23% of GNP, it is argued that a 5% premium over the expected rate of
inflation is desirable. In January 1980 the Government raised interest
rates sharply (the prime lending rate, for example, rose from 18.5% to
24.5%) on both deposits and loans. The new interest rate structure
(Annex 4), apart from its anti-inflationary objective, is expected to enable
the banking institutions in Korea to achieve better results in their efforts
to mobilize savings.
4. THE CITIZENS NATIONAL BANK
A. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Legal Framework and Ownership
4.01      The Citizens National Bank (CNB) was set up in December 1962
under the Citizens National Bank Act and started its business operations
in February 1963. CNB itself evolved from the National Citizen Bank
of Korea (NCBK) which was established in 1962 by consolidating a number of
small mutual finance institutions dealing with petty finance. NCBK was con-
verted into CNB so as to set up a broad-based financial institution within
the framework of government policies to meet the financial needs of consumers
and small businesses, while at the same time attracting small household
savings as part of a national effort to raise domestic capital for economic
development. The CNB Act governs CNB's broad operating policy, scope of
operations, administration and capitalization. Under the Act, CNB is
empowered to carry out all activities normally carried out by a commercial
bank and it also has the unique authority to operate a Mutual Installment
Savings and Remuneration Scheme. The Act is supplemented by an Enforcement
Decree, Articles of Incorporation and internal regulations. The Act has
been amended several times, most recently in December 1977 when CNB's
authorized share capital was increased from W 5 billion to W 30 billion, and
CNB was authorized to borrow and lend in foreign currencies.
/1 Which originate primarily from deposits earmarked by DMBs for the
purchase NIF bonds.



- 27 -
4.02      The Government is the major shareholder in CNB.  At September 30,
1979 the Government held 65.6% of CNB's paid-in capital of W 5 billion;/l
5 nationwide commercial banks, also owned mainly by the Government, held a
further 34.1%, with the remaining 0.3% held by private interests (see
Annex 5).
4.03      Under the CNB Act, the senior management of CNB (President, Deputy
President, Auditor and Directors) are appointed by the Government which must
also approve CNB's Annual Operational Plan. In broad policy matters, CNB is
under the supervision of the MOF whose approval is required for establishing
branches, altering the Articles of Incorporation, suspending business or
merging with another institution. As a banking institution, CNB is further
subject to supervision by the Bank of Korea, particularly concerning its
commercial banking activities including deposit mobilization, bill
discounting, and liquidity ratios, all of which are regulated by the General
Banking Act. Within this broad supervisory framework, CNB's management is
independent in its conduct of CNB's operations.
Management and Or_anization
4.04      The management of CNB rests with a full-time Board of Directors
comprising the President, Deputy President, five Directors and an Auditor.
The normal term of office for directors is three years with directors being
eligible for reelection. The President, Mr. Jin Wook Chung, has spent most
of his career at CNB and was appointed President in May 1979. The Deputy
President, Mr. Chul Soon Yun and the five directors have, collectively, many
years' experience, mainly in CNB (see Annex 6). Each director is respon-
sible for at least three of CNB's 20 departments (see Organization Chart,
Annex 7). CNB has an experienced and professional body of managers and deputy
managers in its departments and branch offices. Each branch manager,
department manager, director and the deputy president has an authorized
ceiling below which he can approve loans; loans above the ceiling are referred
to a higher level, with large loans ultimately being approved by the
President.
4.05      CNB's major deposit-taking and lending operations are handled
through a wide network of branches (divided into main branches, subbranches
and deposit offices), with Seoul head office departments responsible mainly
for staff activities, such as research, personnel, planning and overall
policy, and operating guidelines and supervision of the branches. At Sept-
ember 30, 1979, CNB had 163 branches spread throughout Korea (see Map); of
these 81 were in Seoul metropolitan area. Current plans call for an increase
to 188 branches by the end of 1981. Due to the size of Busan, a special
office called the "Busan Area Activity Promotion Department" supervises and
coordinates the activities of the 8 branches in Gyungsang Nam Do as well as
/1 CNB's paid-in share capital was increased to W 30 billion as of
December 31, 1979.



- 28 -
the 16 branches in the Busan metropolitan area. No similar arrangement is
necessary for Seoul, because the Head Office is in a position to exercise
daily supervision of the Seoul branches.
Organization for Term Lending
4.06      The International Department was set up in October 1978 to handle
foreign currency borrowing and lending and is the department responsible for
the proposed loan. While the International Department will be responsible
for the lending of foreign exchange funds, term lending in domestic currency
will still remain under the Loan Administration Department. This will mean
that the term lending will come under the supervision of two directors.
This is unlikely to cause problems in the short term, given the relatively
small size of the foreign exchange operations. However, as these operations
grow, and as it becomes more necessary to combine domestic and foreign
currencies as part of single loan packages, increasing problems of coordina-
tion will arise in loan processing. CNB should, therefore, try to find ways
to coordinate its lending. A logical step would be the formation of a loan
committee with the participation of responsible departments to review
together the term loans from the respective departments. Such a committee
will enable CNB to maintain uniform criteria in its term lending operations
and a bank-wide improvement of project appraisal skills can be achieved.
CNB's management is actively considering this idea. As a first step to
strengthen the coordination between different departments, the International
Department is asked to conduct a preliminary review of all domestic currency
term loan applications and its recommendations will be taken into account
by the Loan Administration Department.
Staff
4.07      CNB's total staff numbered 6,424 at September 30, 1979 (Annex 8).
Of these, 1,340 were classified as professional staff, including 300 financial
analysts/accountants, 186 economists/market analysts, 204 lawyers, 7 engineers
and 643 general bankers (classified mainly by educational background). Of the
total staff, 5,490 or 85%, were in the branches, reflecting their role in
collecting deposits and making loans. Total staff requirements are expected
to increase at around 8% per year over the next few years, as CNB's operations
continue to grow. Staff are usually recruited directly from high school and
university, and staff members tend to see CNB as a long-term career source of
employment. Staff turnover is consequently low with the professional staff
turnover varying between 3.9% and 5.9% during 1975-78. Salary levels at CNB
are the same as at other Government-owned banks. Promotion is based on an
efficiency rating system derived from seniority, supervisors' annual assess-
ments, and achievements in training seminars.
4.08      The International Department had 41 staff members at November 30,
1979 (Annex 9). Of these, 20 were professionals with training in financial
analysis, business administration and economics. Twelve of these staff will



- 29 -
be involved in the processing of long-term foreign exchange loans, including
the proposed Bank Loan, with the rest handling the ordinary foreign exchange
services. These staff will be supplemented by 9 engineers recruited in early
1979 by CNB into the Credit Analysis Department.  These enginetrs all have
substantial working experience and held senior engineering positions in
Government and private industry prior to being recruited by CNB. The staff
involved in foreign currency lending is of adequate size and qualifications to
handle the expected volume of foreign currency lending operations in the near
term. CNB intends to further expand the staff of the International Department
and relevant staff involved in term lending, as necessary to cope with the
future workload. The International Department has high prestige in CNB and
the management was able to to select from the best available candidates. CNB
has worked out a comprehensive training program for 1980 addressed to training
the new staff and upgrading the capabilities of the existing one (para. 4.09).
Training
4.09       CNB's Training Department is responsible for co-ordinating a large
number of training programs. These programs include in-house training and
external courses, mainly through the Bankers Association of Korea. In
addition, senior staff members attend courses overseas. In 1978, 2,706 staff
members attended 43 in-house courses, 726 attended 106 external courses, and
27 staff members went overseas for periods ranging from 1 to 12 months.
4.10      Because of CNB's primary-functions, its staff training has
traditionally been oriented towards commercial banking operations and organi-
zational development within CNB. However, the movement into long-term
foreign exchange lending has brought about a need for increased expertise in
development banking, including project promotion, appraisal and supervision.
To fill this need, CNB has developed a comprehensive training program, in
association with the KDB and SMIB. Senior officers of KDB and SMIB gave a
two-month training course in March/April 1979 to all CNB staff involved in
foreign exchange financing. This course encompassed one month of classroom
instruction on lending procedures, project appraisal and supervision, and
procurement, following by one month of case studies taken from projects
previously financed by SMIB. While this comprehensive training has prepared
continue its efforts both to train the new staff needed as foreign exchange
lending increases, and to acquaint more fully other staff members (in the
head office and branches) involved in term lending with appropriate loan
processing techniques. Realizing this need, CNB has worked out a compre-
hensive training program for 1980. Under this program, a higher priority has
been assigned to the training of the staff of the International Department
and those involved in domestic currency term-loan operations. In order to
upgrade the staff's expertise in project appraisal and supervision, a selected
number of them will be sent to the Korean Banking Training Institute, the
Korea Correspondence College and graduate schools for further training. About
30 staff members are scheduled to be trained overseas in dealing with inter-
national banking business, which includes foreign exchange operations, project
the staff to handle long-term project financing, CNB will still need to



- 30 -
appraisal and supervision, and procurement procedures. CNB also plans,
wherever possible, to send senior staff to attend conferences and seminars to
broaden their knowledge of the development banking operations.
Operating Policies and Development Strategy
4.11      CNB has drawn up a Policy Statement to supplement the broad policy
and operational guidelines of the CNB Act (Annex 10). It outlines the major
policy measures through which CNB intends to assist the development of small
industry in Korea. It states that CNB will assist small industry through
financial and managerial assistance, with broad priority being given to
exporting industries, industries with high employment potential, and those
helping to develop technical expertise and product innovation. The policy
statement further outlines CNB's general operating procedures, financial
exposure limits and provisions for doubtful loans. The financial guidelines
do not specify a statutory limit on CNB's long-term debt/equity ratio, but a
limit of 7:1 has been agreed with ADB and the Bank agrees with this limit.
4.12      To further emphasize its immediate and specific development objec-
tives, CNB envisages adopting a Development Strategy for the next two years,
1980-81, which outlines specific areas on which CNB intends to place greater
emphasis. CNB will make special efforts to assist small and export-oriented
projects and those located in provincial areas, to raise long-term resources,
to strengthen its research capability and to intensify training of its staff
to cope with its expanded operations.
Prolect Appraisal and Supervision
4.13      CNB's appraisal of its existing domestic currency loans is commer-
cially oriented and relies heavily on1 the credit standing of the borrower and
on collateral security. For the foreign currency term loans financed
through the International Department, however, a comprehensive appraisal
based on a project analysis has been introduced. The financial, managerial,
marketing, and economic aspects of appraisal are carried out by International
Department staff, while the technical analysis is undertaken by engineers
from the Credit Analysis Department. Both Departments are under the super-
The staff concerned have been well-trained and have a good understanding of
the steps involved in project appraisal. During the initial period, all
project appraisal for foreign currency loans will be carried out by the
International Department, with branches simply forwarding loan applications.
However, as appraisal skills develop, CNB plans to delegate some project
appraisal to the branches. These plans will be kept under review by future
Bank missions. CNB will prepare full appraisal reports, similar to those
prepared by SMIB, for projects above the free limit, and shorter reports for
smaller projects. These shorter reports will be based on the Bank's
subproject data reporting system. To obtain an adequate picture of the
economic impact of CNB's subloans, CNB has agreed to calculate economic
rates of return for all subloans above the free limit. In addition the
vision of Director Sang Chan Kim, which will minimize coordination problems.



- 31 -
basic economic and sectoral work underlying the project appraisal needs to
be strengthened through increasing the economic staff of the Research
Department and through more in-depth industry studies carried out by CNB.
4.14      Follow-up of domestic currency loans is currently delegated
entirely to branch offices. The branches monitor projects by telephone,
mail and plant visits. The good quality of CNB's portfolio reflects the
effectiveness of the follow-up work. Supervision of foreign currency loans
will, at least initially, be handled mainly by the International Department,
with the branches involved only as necessary. The Department plans to collect
monthly reports from project sponsors and make regular follow-up visits,
normally every six months, to projects to monitor progress. As the amount of
foreign lending grows over the next 2 to 3 years, some supervision work may be
delegated to the branches.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.15      CNB has prepared a procurement manual outlining its proposed
procedures. Procurement will normally be based on competitive bidding with
contracts awarded to the lowest priced responsive bid. The procedures for
advertising, bidding and contract award are satisfactory. A separate division
has been set up in the International Department to handle procurement.
Disbursement of the Bank Loan would be made under approved subprojects at the
rate of 100% for directly imported equipment or 60% for the cost of locally
procured equipment, representing the estimated foreign exchange component.
B. RESOURCE MOBILIZATION. OPERATIONS AND
DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT
CNB's Role in Financing SSIs
4.16      In Korea, there are four specialized financial institutions, namely,
KDB, KDFC, SMIB and CNB, which provide development financing assistance to
the industrial sector. KDB and KDFC concentrate on financing relatively large
firms while SMIB and CNB deal with smaller ones. SMIB finances small- and
medium-sized firms either with total assets not exceeding W 500 million or
employing less than 300 workers./l CNB is restricted to enterprises with less
A1 500 workers for selected industries, including automobile parts, elec-
tronic apparatus and its parts, photographic goods, pottery and china,
toys and transport services.



- 32 -
than 100 employees,/l but there is no separate asset limitation. While
SMIB's total commitments in any one single enterprise in whatever form will
normally not exceed 25% of its equity,/2 CNB's domestic currency lending to
single enterprise should not exceed the following maximum limits: W 30
million for equipment loans, W 40 million for working capital loans and W 30
million for guarantees. It is clear that there is some duplication between
SMIB and CNB in the provision of finance for SSI but it is partially offset
by the counteracting conditions and practices which tend to separate the
clientele of the two institutions. These include the 'one-bank' tradition
among Korean borrowers (in part due to collateral arrangements), the branch
locations of the two institutions and the fact that CNB's borrowers are in
most cases its depositors under various deposit schemes, especially the
Mutual Installment Savings and Remuneration Scheme. Moreover, the demand
for finance by SSIs has been hitherto much higher than supply. As long as
this situation continues, as is likely for some time, the operations of
these two institutions will probably continue to be largely complementary.
4.17      CNB's lending operations have grown rapidly and its total outstan-
ding loan portfolio reached W 434.0 billion at end-1978,/3 which accounted
for 4.3% of all short- and long-term credit outstanding from the commercial
banking system (all deposit money banks) and the development banks (Annex
3). At the same time, CNB's outstanding equipment loans of W 32.3 billion
amounted to 2.4% of all equipment loans from the commercial banking system.
Its equipment loan disbursements reached W 17.3 billion in 1977, which was
about 12% of total SSI fixed asset formation for that year. In 1978, while
the level of disbursements remained almost the same as in 1977, the per-
centage dropped to around 7% given the sharp increase in the SSI fixed asset
formation in 1978.
Resource Mobilization
4.18      CNB has relied almost exclusively on its deposits in financing its
lending operations. Apart from ordinary demand and savings deposits, CNB
/1 CNB's lending is restricted to small-scale manufacturing, mining and
transportation enterprises employing 5 to 100 workers and construction
and service enterprises employing 5 to 20 workers. CNB is allowed to
lend to enterprises employing more than 100 workers, if the loan amount
is limited to W 10 million. (In the first nine months of 1979, 2.5% of
CNB's equipment loan approvals went to such enterprises.)
/2 As of the end of 1978, SMIB's equity reached W 25.8 billion. Twenty-five
percent of its equity amounted to W 6.5 billion. This compared with total
CNB's exposure in one enterprise of W 100 million.
/3 By September 30, 1979, CNB's total loan portfolio reached W 523.0 bil-
lion.

offers a variety of deposit schemes (for a sample, see Annex 4) differentiated
by depositor, purpose, and maturities, and by September 30, 1979 it had mobil-
ized deposits totaling W 1,010 billion. The most important deposit scheme is
the Mutual Installment Savings and Remuneration Scheme under ...ich CNB and
the depositor enter into a contract when the first deposit is made. The
depositor undertakes to deposit a fixed amount each month for a specified
period (15-60 months). In return, CNB agrees to make a loan (called "remu-
neration") after 1/5 of the contract period is completed and deposits made
as contracted. The loan and deposit amounts are so calculated as to be
equal, after inclusion of interest on both sides, at the end of the contract
period, when the deposits and the loan are simultaneously liquidated. CNB
has the exclusive authority to operate this Scheme in Korea. It also handles
Property Formation Deposits to facilitate the purchase of houses by wage
earners. Under this Scheme, which started in 1976, wage earners are permit-
ted to deposit up to 30% of their monthly salary in the deposit account,
earning a rate of interest up to 27% p.a. CNB receives a subsidy of 9% from
the Government and itself pays the remaining 18% to the depositor under the
Scheme. CNB is obligated to make a housing loan twice the amount of total
deposits under this Scheme. Using its widespread branch network, CNB is
able to mobilize savings from small savers, including both individuals and
enterprises, very effectively.
4.19      Compared with other development banks in Korea, CNB has relatively
limited access to government funds, particularly to long-term domestic
currency resources. (CNB has served as an on-lending agent for such govern-
ment funds as Industrial Rationalization Fund (IRF) and funds for financing
war veterans but the amounts are small, W 1.3 billion at September 30, 1979).
In view of CNB's role in financing SSI, the Government should allow CNB to
have access to the newly established SMI Promotion Fund (an amount of W 15.7
billion has been allocated for this Fund for 1979 and an additional W 16.5
billion for 1980). The appraisal mission has discussed this matter with both
the Government and CNB. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry agreed to the
proposal that CNB be given access to the funds provided under the SMI
Promotion Fund (to which, to date, only SMIB has had access). In March 1980
CNB will be designated as a handling intermediary for the SMI Promotion Fund
and an agreement for the management of part of the funds will be executed
between CNB and SMIPC. The funds have a maximum maturity of 10 years and
the onlending rate is 23.5%.
4.20      CNB's continuing resource mobilization efforts and the credit ceil-
ings imposed by MOF (in consultation with BOK) resulted in a large surplus of
liquid funds which are being kept as cash in banks, invested in securities
or onlent in the form of deposits with other banks and via the call money
market. At September 30, 1979, a total amount of W 364 billion remained in
such liquid or semiliquid form, yielding an average interest rate of 13.2%
p.a. compared with its average lending rate of around 18.5%. Since CNB's
principal role is to assist SSI, channelling of such liquid funds through



- 34 -
the commercial banking system and the call money market, which would in most
cases be benefitting large-scale industries, does not appear to be in line
with the institution's objectives and, therefore, the credit policy applic-
able to CNB deserves constant review by the Government. CNB, on its part,
is focusing more attention on its resource allocation, seeking ways to
reduce the level of its liquid funds. As a departure from its past policy,
CNB has decided to make 10-year term loans (so far it only confined to 5-
year loans) and an initial amount of W 2 billion has been earmarked by its
Board for this purpose for 1980.
Summary of CNB's Lending Operations
4.21      CNB's lending operations are summarized in Annex 12.  At end-1978,
CNB had a total outstanding loan portfolio of W 434.0 billion, more than
double the 1975 level of W 191.9 billion. (By end-September 1979, it stood
at W 523.0 billion.) Playing an important role as a popular savings bank,
CNB's operations have primarily emphasized resource mobilization, offering a
wide variety of deposit schemes to savers. On the lending side, CNB provides
three types of financial assistance (in domestic currency): 'general popu-
lace' (consumer) loans, short- and medium-term working capital loans and
medium-term equipment loans to small industries. CNB is authorized by its
Act to extend equipment loans to a maximum of W 30 million, working capital
loans to a maximum of W 40 million and guarantees up to W 30 million. The
Government is presently considering CNB's request to increase the limit on.
equipment loans from W 30 million to W 100 million. CNB started in 1979 to
provide long-term equipment loans in foreign currency against its resources
obtained from ADB. During the four-year period from 1975 to 1978, CNB's
overall loan approvals increased from W 123.0 billion to W 340.5 billion,
showing an average annual growth of 22.6%. However, for industry loans
(including working capital and equipment loans), a decline of 9% was regis-
tered in 1978 after growth at an average annual rate of 27.6% in 1975-77.
The consumer loan approvals increased at an annual rate of 26.6% in 1975-77
and rose sharply, by 57.6%, in 1978. This stemmed from the fact that the
Government started in 1978 to impose credit ceilings on financial institu-
tions and CNB was unable to maintain a proper balance between industry lend-
ing and consumer lending because of the compulsory nature of the Mutual
Installment Savings and Remuneration Scheme. The industry loan and general
populace loan approvals increased, on an annual basis, 19.5% and 18.8%
respectively in the first nine months of 1979.
4.22      Equipment Loans.  CNB's cumulative equipment loan approvals over
the period January 1975-September 1979 amounted to W 57.5 billion. Approvals
increased consistently until 1977. In 1978 equipment loan approvals
actually declined by 1.4% to W 17.1 billion (from W 17.3 billion in 1977)
mainly because of the impact of credit ceilings imposed by MOF starting in



- 35 -
August 1978.11 Equipment loans have accounted only for an average of 5.2%
of total annual approvals over the period. The number of equipment loan
approvals increased from 3,903 in 1975 to 5,257 in 1978, and their average
size incread from W 2.02 million in 1975 to W 3.25 million in 1978. In the
first nine months of 1979, the average size registered further increases to W
3.98 million. At September 30, 1979, 79.1% of CNBs outstanding equipment
loans were made under the Mutual Installment Savings and Remuneration Scheme.
The Scheme is attractive because it enables the borrower to secure medium-term
Cup to five years) loans at low interest rates and because it provides CNB
with a steady flow of deposits which have been 'contracted' and can therefore
be predicted with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, by virtue of its
contractual features which in effect give the depositor the right to borrow,
it does not leave CNB with much, if any, flexibility in making independent
allocative decisions. Apart from the loans extended under this Scheme, NB
also makes some equipment loans (up to five years maturity) on a more usual
basis outside the Scheme, based on project and collateral appraisal. These
loans accounted for 21.1% of outstanding equipment loans at September 30,
1979.
4.23      Working Capital Loans.  These accounted for 44.9% of total loan
approvaLs in the first nine months of 1979, compared with 59.7% in 1975. At
September 30, 1979, outstanding working capital loans amounted to W 257.7
billion which represented 49.3% of the total portfolio. 68.8% of the out-
standing working capital loans belong to the Mutal Installment Savings and
Remuneration Scheme. The amount of working capital loan approvals declined by
10% in 1978 but the trend was reversed in the first nine months of 1979.
Short-term working capital loans are evaluated on a collateral basis.
4.24      General Populace (Consumer) Loans.  By number, consumer loans
accounted for the overwhelming bulk of total approvals (82.6% in 1978 and 85%
in the first nine months of 1979). However, by amount, consumer loans
represented only 50% of total approvals in the same periods. The growth in
approvals has been rapid, particularly in 1978 which registered an increase of
57.6% over the 1977 level. The upward trend continued in the first nine
months of 1979 registering an increase of 19% on an annual basis. This was
achieved at the expense of loan approvals for small industry working capital
and equipment loans. As of the end of September 1979, 68.1% of the general
populace loans were under the Mutual Installment Savings and Remuneration
Scheme.
Characteristics of CNB's Ecuipment Loans
4.25      The characteristics of CNB's equipment loan approvals for 1975-78
and the first nine months of 1979 are summarized in Annex 13.
/1 These are stipulated quarterly and apply to the operations of the institu-
tion as a whole (i.e., not specified per loan activity). They are regu-
larly revised on the basis of incremental deposits received by CNB during
the previous quarter.



- 36 -
4.26      Sectoral Distribution.  The most notable feature of CNB's sectoral
allocation is its remarkable stability from 1975 to 1978. The manufacturing
sector accounted for the bulk of its equipment loan approvals, increasing
slightly from 68.7% in 1975 to 72.9% in 1978. But this pattern was changing
in the first nine months of 1979 when the share of the manufacturing sector
dropped to 48.4%. This is mainly attributable to the fact that a number of
loans were made to finance projects in the transportation sector, increasing
its share from an average of 8.6% during 1975-78, to 27.2% in the first nine
months of 1979. CNB has no explicit policy on its exposure in individual
industries. Textiles took up 21.4% of total approvals in 1978, followed by
machinery (11.5%), chemicals (10.3%) and wood products (10.2%). The corres-
ponding percentages dropped to 14.7%, 7.7%, 5.2% and 3.7%, respectively in
the first nine months of 1979.
4.27      Geographical Distribution.  The geographical pattern has been very
stable over the years 1975-78. Its actual distribution remained highly skewed
in favor of Seoul, which accounted for 56.9% of total approvals in 1978, with
Busan City absorbing a further 7.6%. The combined urban areas of Seoul and
Busan accounted for 64.5% of equipment loan approvals in 1978, which propor-
tion decreased slightly to 62.1% in the first nine months of 1979. The recent
trend of CNB's operations is therefore not towards greater geographical
dispersal. Government policy has, however, encouraged a more even spread of
industrial activity for all enterprise size groups, including SSIs which have
enjoyed preferential treatment under the Saemaeul Movement and by the
establishment of several specialized industrial estates.  CNB is prepared to
move toward more geographical dispersal, as emphasized in its Development
Strategy for 1980-81 (Annex 11).
4.28      Loan Size Distribution.  Due to price inflation and changes in
Korea's industrial structure, the average size of CNB's equipment loans has
increased substantially (Annex 13). In 1975-77, 66.0% of the loans approved
were below W 5 million but this declined to 43.5% in 1978 and the first nine
first nine months of 1979. Conversely, there were no loan approval in the
W 20-30 million range in 1975-76 and only 6.8% in 1977, while this category
accounted for 13.1% of the total during the period January 1978 to September
30, 1979. The average size of equipment loan approvals went up from W 2.02
million in 1975 to W 3.25 million in 1978, and to W 3.98 million in the first
nine months of 1979.
4.29      Duration of Loans.  The maturity of equipment loans approved by CNB
has shortened between 1975 and September 30, 1979 (Annex 13). Loans below
three years increased from 57.0% to 70.0% over that period, while maturities
of three-to-five years declined from 43.0% of total approvals to 30.0%. This
is attributable to the fact that in the earlier years CNB made loans of longer
maturities under a special government fund and term loans under the Mutual
Installment Scheme were usually of shorter duration because of the contractual
waiting period. CNB was unable to make loans having maturities longer than
five years because of lack of long-term resources.



- 37 -
4.30      Subborrower Employee Size.  The most prominent feature of CNB's
equipment loan clientele is the large proportion of very small firms.
Enterprises with only 5-20 employees received 70.0%-83.1% of CNB's equipment
loans in 1975-78 and 58.5% in the first nine months of 1979.  Tho firms
employing 50-100 workers have received only 7.0% of CNB's equipment loans
since 1975.
4.31      Other Features.  The total asset size of CNB's equipment loan
borrowers (at the application stage) averaged W 208 million /1 with a substan-
tial proportion below W 150 million. Only about 12% (by number) of CNB's
clients exceeded the W 500 million total asset size, specified as one of two
alternative definitions of SMIs. Around 20% (by number) of CNB's equipment
loans went to limited liability companies in 1978, the other borrowers being
single-ownership private enterprises. By type of project, CNB allocated its
equipment loans mostly to expansion projects in 1978, accounting for 70% of
total loan amount and 72% by number. New projects received 27% (by amount),
the remainder going to replacement projects.
4.32      Economic Analysis.  CNB has hitherto monitored only partial economic
indicators; ERRs (and FRRs) have not been calculated in the past. A sample
survey of such partial indicators covering 87 projects before July 1979 is
presented in Annex 14. There are a few features worth noting. The propor-
tion of total project cost financed by CNB is fairly low, averaging 35.2%.
This is due partly to the general inadequacy of collaterals of CNB's clients
and partly to the low ceilings on CNB's maximum equipment loan size. As
regards employment creation, the performance of CNB-financed subprojects has
been satisfactory. These projects created 806 new jobs of which 247 or 31%
were taken by skilled workers. The average investment cost per incremental
job was W 3.8 million (US$7,835) which indicates that CNB has emphasized
relatively labor-intensive subprojects.
4.33      CNB's economic evaluation of projects would be greatly strengthened
if it included a calculation of ERR's. During negotiations, agreement has
been reached that CNB will calculate ERR's for subprojects above the free
limit to be financed under the proposed loan.
4.34      ForeiRn Currency Subloans.  The average employee size of applicants
for foreign currency term loans under the ADB loan of $10 million to CNB is
44 workers. This is higher than the average for domestic currency equipment
loans. The pipeline of projects to be financed by the ADB loan shows that an
amount of US$6.3 million (out of US$10 million) may go to clients with less
than 50 employees. The average total asset size is W 329 million, with 12
(out of 50) enterprises being larger than the SMI limit of W 500 million total
asset size. The average loan size is US$199,300, with 14 (out of 50) enter-
prises provisionally receiving US$300,000, which is the ceiling on subloan
/1 Based on a review of the applications approved during 1978.



- 38 -
size agreed between CNB and ADB. On balance, while the data are preliminary
and limited, it seems that the foreign currency loans are going to slightly
larger SSIs than are the domestic currency equipment loans.
Other Activities
4.35      Extension Services.  Under the SMI Promotion Act, CNB was authorized
as one of several institutions to provide extension services to its clients.
The assistance hitherto extended by CNB has been carried out mainly at the
branch level and is usually provided in connection with a loan application.
It has focussed principally on managerial, administrative and bookkeeping
matters. This assistance serves to simultaneously improve the business
prospects for CNB's clients and therefore also the quality of CNB's portfolio.
For 1980, CNB has submitted a plan to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
outlining the extension services (including managerial counseling and
technical assistance) to be rendered to about 100 small enterprises, includ-
ing all borrowers of CNB's foreign currency subloans. This plan is satis-
factory to MCI. At the latter's suggestion, CNB will work closely with both
SMIB and SMIPC in providing technical assistance to the small firms.
4.36      Promotion Activity.  CNB's promotion work is being expanded.  It has
regularly conducted (in 1970, 1971, 1973 and 1977) a very comprehensive small
industry survey which forms part of EPB's National Wealth Survey.  This will
be continued. CNB also monitors economic developments in the SSI sector.
More recently, the Credit Analysis Department of CNB has focussed on active
project promotion by undertaking specific industry studies. Their principal
objective is to analyze the credit status and trends of enterprises in
selected industries in order to generate useful information for CNB's lending
operations. This activity should be further strengthened particularly by
including engineers in the survey staff. CNB should make full use of its
extensive branch network in identifying and developing projects in collabora-
tion with small entrepreneurs scattered in various provinces. In conjunction
with its promotion work, CNB has specified a number of lending priorities
which currently include export-oriented and subcontracting enterprises. This
is in accordance with Government policy.
4.37      Guarantees.  CNB provides security guarantees as an agent for the
KCGF. It is empowered to issue guarantees, up to a limit of W 20 million,/l
beyond which guarantees are subject to prior approval of the KCGF. Credit
analysis is undertaken in accordance with KCGF guidelines which are detailed
and cover financial, economic and managerial aspects. This type of analysis
helps promote a cash-flow business prospects approach to loan evaluation, as
opposed to a purely collateral approach. At end-September 1979, CNB had made
loans amounting to W 34.9 billion which were covered by credit guarantees.
/1 There are several exceptions to this "free limit," for example, W 100
million for defense or export industries, cooperatives, etc.



- 39 -
This accounted for 6.7% of the total outstanding portfolio as of that date.
For working capital loans, this was as high as 12.8%, and for equipment
loans 7.1%, while for consumer loans it was zero./l CNB can also issue
guarantees fo its clients who take loans from other banks.
4.38      Equity Investments.  CNB's equity investments are summarized in
Annex 15. Legally CNB is not authorized to make equity investments in its
clients in accordance with its Act (Article 18). It has, however, made a
few small investments in nonclient companies at the suggestion of MOF./2
At end-September 1979, CNB held investments in 14 companies at an original
cost of W 2.05 billion. Dividends received in 1978 were low (W 7.1 million)
representing an average yield of 0.35%. All CNB's investments represented
small minority shareholdings except for its ownership of the Bukook Mutual
Savings and Finance Company in which CNB has invested W 1.5 billion. In
this case, CNB's involvement (at the suggestion of MOF) was intended as a
rescue attermpt and may be terminated once Bukook is profitable again. All
equity holdings By C'o are considered temporary investments, putting to use
its surplus funds.
C. FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE

('JS$1,791 million) as of December 31, 1978, showing an average annual growth
of about 49%. In the first nine months of 1979 a further growth of 28% was
registered, bringing the total assets figure to W 1,113.4 billion equivalent
to US$2,295 million. This impressive growth was entirely attributable to
the sharp rise in deposits. The growth of short-term deposits was slightly
higher than that of medium/long-term deposits. This clearly indicates that
CNB's efforts in mobilizing resources from small savers have been very
successful. However, CNB's loan portfolio did not show the same growth
/1  For total loans outstanding, 80.1% was secured by collateral, 7.3% by
credit guarantees and 12.6% was unsecured.
/2  As part of MOF's monetary policy operations, CNB has, like other
financial institutions, also invested in Monetary Stabilization Bonds
(to an amount of W 55 billion outstanding at end-September 1979).
This is not, of course, an equity investment.



- 40 -
pattern.  Its short- and long-term loans combined increased at a much lower
rate, around 31% a year during 1975-78. (At December 31, 1975, CNB's total
loan portfolio accounted for 73% of its total assets. By the end of 1978,
this ratio had dropped to 50%). Its lending operations have been affected
by the credit ceilings imposed by MOF (in consultation with BOK) in August
1978, with subsequent adjustments.  The slow growth of its loan portfolio
relative to its total assets, also reflects the fact that CNB's resource
allocation was not as aggressive as its resource mobilization.  As a result,
CNB has remained very liquid, with its sizeable liquid funds lent to other
domestic banks, or in the form of call loans, or invested in securities.  As
of December 31, 1978, such liquid funds, including cash, reached W 327.2
billion, equivalent to 75% of its total loan portfolio. As of September 30,
1979, such liquid funds were W 424.5 billion and the ratio went up to 81%.
4.40      CNB has been operating on a very thin equity, which accounted for
1.3% of total liabilities and equity at the end of 1978, showing a debt/
equity relationship of 77:1 (40:1 as of September 30, 1979). The long-term
debt/equity ratio (after excluding current maturities of long-term debt)
reached 24:1 (9:1 as of September 30, 1979). After adjustments by excluding
current maturities of long-term debt, BOK's reserve requirement and
remunerated installment savings, the long-term debt/equity ratio amounted to
14:1 (5.1 as of September 30, 1979). A long-term debt/equity ratio of 7:1
with the above adjustments has been agreed upon between CNB and ADB, which is
also acceptable to the Bank. As of December 31, 1979, CNB has increased its
paid-in share capital from W 5 billion to W 30 billion by the end of 1979./i
After this increase, CNB's long-term debt/equity ratio (adjusted) is
expected to fall within the range of 5.2:1 to 6.1:1 in the following four
years, 1980-83.
4.41      Taking into account all the current maturities of its loans and
long-term debt, CNB's current ratio has risen from 1.02 in 1975 to 1.19 in
1978 and again declined to 1.10 as of September 30,1979. Since a substantial
portion of its short-term debt can be counted on to be rolled over, CNB's
liquidity position was satisfactory.  CNB has agreed with ADB to maintain
a current ratio of 1.1:1, which would be acceptable  to the Bank.  Since CNB
has been using a portion of its short-term resources to finance long-term
loans, CNB is prepared to adopt appropriate measures to correct any resulting
imbalances. It was agreed between CNB and ADB that CNB shall keep the
maturities of its deposits (and borrowings) and lendings reasonably matched
and the Government has agreed to provide long-term funds to CNB if there
should be a serious imbalance between the two in the future.
/1 The authorized capital is at present W 30 billion. The net increase in
paid-in share capital consisted of W 11.2 billion in cash and W 13.8
billion by way of assets revaluation.

Financial Performance
4.42      Annexes 17 and 18 present CNB's summarized income statements and
cash flow statements for the period 1975-78 and the first nine onths of
1979.  In 1978, CNB's gross income reached W 98.7 billion (W 109.3 billion for
the first nine months of 1979), of which 91.5% was derived from interest on
all loans. Gross income has increased at an average rate of 46% since 1975,
which is satisfactory. CNB's net income stood at W 2,106 million
(US$4.3 million) in 1978, which was more than double that of 1977 (W 1,014
million). In the first nine months of 1979, its net income reached W 2,274
million. In the first nine months of 1979, its net income reached W 2,274
million. CNB's profitability has been very low, with its net profit as a
percentage of average total assets hovering within the range between 0.2% and
0.3% during 1975-78. Its return on average equity was more satisfactory.
Given its thin equity base, its return increased from around 5% in 1975 to
around 20% in 1978 (12% for the first nine months of 1979).
4.43      CNB's low profitability was mainly attributable to its low spread
and its high administrative costs.  Its spread on "deposits" with other
domestic banks has been very low, but such deposits continued to increase.
In 1975, such deposits amounted to W 9.7 billion. In 1977-79, the average
year-end level reached W 114 billion. In this respect (and via call money
operations), CNB acted as a mobilizer of savings which it distributed to
various banks which were short of resources. During the process of such
resource allocation, CNB was not able to improve its profitability. On the
contrary, such operations have contributed to the erosion of its profits
gained from normal lending.
4.44      CNB's administrative costs in 1975 accounted for 4.6% of its average
total assets. This ratio dropped to a range of 3.6-3.8% in 1976-78, which was
much higher than other banks. CNB's extensive branch network and the high
overhead costs associated with handling numerous deposit and loan accounts
sufficiently explain this situation. Unless CNB's spread is adequately
increased across the board, it would be unrealistic to expect CNB to increase
its profitability.
4.45      The appropriation of CNB's net profits is subject to the prior
approval of MOF. In compliance with its Act, CNB has set aside 25% of its
net profit as legal reserves. CNB has paid dividends at 7 to 8% during
1975-78. The remainder of its net profits was accumulated as other re-
serves. Total reserves of CNB as of December 31, 1978 reached W 6,076 mil-
lion, corresponding to 1.2 times its paid-in share capital.
Quality of Portfolio
4.46      As of September 30, 1979, CNB's total loan portfolio reached W
522,989 million (US$1,078 millon) consisting of the following types of
loans.

Total                                       522.989         100.0
During the period 1975-78, general populace loans had increased at a higher
rate than business loans. At the end of 1975, general populace loans
accounted for 32% of CNB's entire loan portfolio. This ratio had increased
to 45% at the end of 1978 and became 44% at September 30, 1979. Given
that CNB has been successful in mobilizing resources from small savers and
that it has initiated the mutual installment savings and remuneration and
property formation savings schemes, a more rapid expansion of its loans to
general populace was a natural development, since depositors were inclined
to exercise their options of obtaining loans from CNB.
4.47      The level of arrears on CNB's loans has been low during the past
years. At the end of 1975, total arrears accounted for 2.1% of total loans
outstanding and loans affected by arrears accounted for 19% of total loans
outstanding (Annex 19). These ratios dropped to 1-1.2% and 11-14%
respectively during the following three years (1976-78). As of
September 30, 1979, arrears/loans ratio dropped further to 0.9%, although a
higher percentage (15%) of loans were affected by such arrears. CNB's loan
collection ratio averaged about 98% during the period 1975-78, and its loan
reschedulings as a percentage of average loan portfolio remained at a low
level (1.5%-2.2%) in 1975-77 and went up to 4.2% in 1978. For the first
nine months of 1979, the ratio went down to 3.7%. The Government's tight
credit policies in 1978 and 1979 have indirectly contributed to liquidity
difficulties faced by industries, thus increasing their requests for loan
rescheduling.
4.48      Loans written off in 1975-78 averaged W 16 million which was
infinitesimal compared with the size of CNB's loan portfolio. This is



- 43 -
explainable by the fact that CNB usually requires a collateral coverage of
120% of its loans. Since real estate contributes the major part of the
collaterals, the risk of depreciation in value of the collaterals is
minimal.
Provisions Policy
4.49      The Corporate Tax Code in Korea allows banking institutions to
make provisions for doubtful loans up to 2% of the loans outstanding./1 Such
provisions are exempted from taxation. However, CNB did not take advantage
of this stipulation. In 1975 and 1976, CNB did not make any provisions for
doubtful loans but simply charged bad debts to its current year's revenue
since CNB felt that it had sufficient provisions accumulated in previous
years. In 1977, the Credit Guarantee Act required CNB to accumulate special
provisions for possible defaults of general livelihood loans at the rate of
0.2% of the total outstanding amount of such loans. Accordingly, CNB set
aside W 192 million in 1977. In 1978, the rate of special provisions was
raised to 0.5%. (Although CNB is required to accumulate special provisions
only on general livelihood loans, it accumulates them on the entire general
populace loans). For overall provisions (called ordinary provisions), since
1978, CNB's policy has been guided by the State Audit Board's "Guidelines
for Settlement of Accounts by Government Invested Institutions". According
to such Guidelines, ordinary provisions for doubtful loans should be made at
a rate equal to the rate of actual write-offs on the total loan portfolio
during the preceding year. In 1978, CNB allocated W 24 million against its
revenue as ordinary provisions and W 710 million as special provisions for
doubtful loans and at the end of 1978 total provisions (ordinary and
special) stood at W 924 million. According to the Audit Board's guidelines,
unutilized ordinary provisions at the end of the year should not be
accumulated and should be returned to revenues. CNB has to adhere to such
guidelines. In view of the collateral coverage of the CNB's loans and the
negligible amounts of actual write-offs in the past, CNB's total provisions
in 1977 and 1978 were adequate. Although CNB's provisions policy on special
provisions appears to be satisfactory, on ordinary provisions it may become
inadequate in future. As CNB starts to make foreign currency loans which
will have maturities longer than five years, CNB should formulate a revised
provisions policy in anticipation of higher write-offs in the future, and
should seek approval of such a policy from the supervisory Government
agencies. CNB's past experience with regard to bad debts is no longer a
useful guide for its future operations. It needs a policy under which
adequate provisions will be made and accumulated for both domestic currency
and foreign currency loans. In the meantime, CNB has agreed with the Bank
to instruct the external auditors to certify the adequacy of the provisions
for doubtful loans based on auditors' review of CNB's portfolio in arrears,
its collateral and its future foreign currency loan operations. Based on
/1 CNB is exempted from paying corporate income tax on its income. How-
ever, it is required to pay defense tax.



- 44 -
auditors' recommendations, CNB will appropriately revise its provisions
policy in the near future.
Resource Position
4.50      Details of CNB's resource position as of September 30, 1979 are
provided in Annex 20. CNB continued to use a part of its short-term
resources to finance its long-term lending operations. As a result, it has
not been able to make loans having maturities over 5 years even though
adequate demand exists for such loans. At September 30, 1979 its long-term
resource short-fall amounted to W 166,458 million, representing 28% of its
total long-term lending and investments. This ratio compares with 46% in
1975, 41% in 1976, 36% in 1977 and 33% in 1978. As CNB's long-term lending
increased at a much slower pace than its short-term lending (in 1978, the
long-term loans outstanding increased 26% while short-term loans increased
163%), the long-term resource gap has become narrower.
4.51      In terms of total short-term resources available, this long-term
resource gap accounted for 27%, as of September 30, 1979. This compares
with 72% in 1975, 63% in 1976, 47% in 1977 and 39% in 1978. In other words,
CNB has been using its resources of less than one year maturity to finance its
loans and investments with maturities ranging from two to five years. Given a
stable deposit base, with numerous depositors, CNB is not vulnerable to wide
gyrations of withdrawals. The present 27% may be considered to fall within
prudent limits applicable to CNB's resource utilization. However, this matter
should be subject to constant review by the management of CNB and the
Government and necessary measures should be taken to avoid any imbalances.
4.52      The overall resource surplus as of September 30, 1979 amounted to
W 236.6 billion, equivalent to US$487.7 million. A fuller utilization of
this sizeable excess liquidity also deserves the management's constant
attention.
Audit
4.53      In line with the practice of the banking institutions in Korea,
CNB has been applying a cash-basis accounting procedure for revenue items
and accrual basis for expenditure items. CNB's accounts are audited by the
State Audit Board (and also subject to examination by the BOK). In accordance
with the agreement reached with ADB concerning auditing of CNB's accounts by
an external independent auditor, CNB has appointed San Kyong and Co. to audit
its accounts and issue an audit report annually starting with its 1979
accounts. This accounting firm had been accepted by the Bank as auditors of
KDB and SMIB. Necessary adjustments will be made by CNB so that its
accounting procedures will fully comply with internationally accepted
accounting standards in the future.

D. PROSPECTS AND RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
Operational Projections
4.54      In the aftermath of the devaluation which took place in January
1980, the outlook for the Korean economy is expected to remain favorable and
the long-term growth prospects for the manufacturing industries of all sizes
are good. GNP is expected to increase in 1979-81 by 9% annually in real
terms, with the manufacturing sector growing at an annual rate of 14%. The
growth of the economy will continue to be mainly export-led. Export-oriented
industries are expected to expand their capacity for production and the
factories which produce for the domestic market are also expected to modernize
and expand their facilities and increase their output. Exports of goods and
services are projected to increase 17% annually during 1979-81 with
manufactured exports providing the bulk of incremental exports. An annual
increase in gross fixed investment of around 8% is expected during the Fourth
Five Year Plan Period ending 1981. Given the priority assigned to deepening
the structure of Korean industries, the small industries are expected to play
an increasing role. CNB as an institution assisting small industries has
taken that increasing role into account in projecting its operations for the
next five years, 1980-84.
4.55      CNB's loan approvals for 1979 reached W 401.5 billion, equally
distributed between business loans and general populace loans. This compared
with total approvals of W 340.5 billion for 1978 with a similar distribution
pattern. Based on the growth trend of its entire loan portfolio during
1976-79, the annual growth rate of loan approvals after 1980 is assumed to be
around 30% p.a. with business loans increasing at a slightly faster pace than
general populace loans. The projected volume of operations is presented in
Annex 21.
4.56      The time lag between approval and commitment and that between com-
mitment and disbursement of local currency loans has been negligible in the
past and the pattern is expected to remain unchanged in the future. CNB's
foreign currency operations started in the latter part of 1979, and a time lag
between different stages has been taken into account in its projections.
Around 60% of foreign currency loan approvals are expected to be committed in
the current year and 40% in the following year. Around 45% of the commitments
are expected to be disbursed in the current year and 55% in the following
year.
4.57      CNB expects that the actual overall demand for loans would increase
at a higher rate than what it has assumed in making the projections of its own
operations. However, strict Government control on credit expansion is
expected to continue during the projected period. CNB's lending projections
have to be on the conservative side, although CNB's resource mobilization
effort is not expected to taper off.



- 46 -
4.58      With respect to small industry's demand for foreign exchange
loans, it is estimated to amount to US$80 million in 1979 (compared with
US$65 million in 1978) and US$100 million in 1980, based upon various
surveys conducted by SMIB and CNB. An estimated increase of 25% per year
would not be unrealistic. Therefore, by 1983, the demand would probably reach
US$200 million. CNB, as a new supplier of foreign funds, did not make any
foreign currency disbursements in 1979. However, as CNB mobilizes more
foreign exchange resources in subsequent years, it expects to contribute
around 8% of total demand in 1980 and an average of 17% in 1981-84. This
compares with SMIB's estimated average share of 37% during 1979-83. Since no
other institutions are equipped to provide long-term foreign currency loans to
small industry, this anticipated resource gap would prompt both CNB and SMIB
to raise more foreign currency resources in the next few years.
Resource Requirements
4.59      Local Currency Requirements.  CNB's forecast of resource position
and requirements for 1980-84 is shown in Annex 22. During the entire pro-
jection period, CNB is expected to continue to have surplus short-term
resources and to utilize such resources to fill its shortfall in long-term
commitments. By 1980, its long-term resource gap would amount to about W 215
billion representing 41% of its long-term loan commitments; the comparative
ratios for 1981-84 are 43%, 42%, 41% and 41% respectively. While demand for
loans having maturities of more than 5 years is strong, especially as CNB
enters into foreign currency loan operations where many firms are likely to
need domestic currency funds having maturities over 5 years to match their
foreign currency funds, CNB will have to confine itself mainly to making loans
with shorter maturities. CNB has received the Government approval to parti-
cipate in the Small and Medium Industry Promotion Fund; however, this Fund
would provide only limited amount of long-term funds. CNB's short-term
resource surplus each year during the forecast period is estimated to be more
than twice the size of the long-term resource gap, thus enabling CNB to fill
such a gap with resources of less than one year's maturity. The remaining
portion of the surplus short-term resources would be invested in marketable
securities, deposited with those domestic banks that are short of resources,
and lent out as call loans.
4.60      Foreign Currency Requirements.  Projected foreign currency commit-
ments during the period 1980-84 total about US$133.1 million (Annex 22).
Apart from the loan of US$10 million which CNB obtained from ADB in the first
part of 1979, CNB plans to raise an additional US$120 million from ADB and
IBRD, and US$3.1 million from the Korean Foreign Exchange Fund during 1980-83.
As of December 31, 1984, CNB is expected to have an uncommitted balance of
US$28.5 million. CNB may find it necessary to make a larger contribution in
meeting the foreign currency resource demand of the small industry sector by
enlarging both its resource mobilization and resource allocation programs in
the projection period.



- 47 -
Projected Financial Results
4.61      Projected income statements and projected indicators of financial
performance for 1979-84 are shown in Annexes 23 and 25. CNB's low profita-
bility is expected to improve in the next few years. The ,..te of growth of
CNB's gross profit will catch up with the rate of growth of its total assets.
However, due to its broad branch network and the costly operations involving
numerous transactions with individuals, households and small industrial
units, CNB's administrative costs as a percentage of its average total assets
would remain high, within the range of 4.1-4.6% during the entire forecast
period 1979-84. Profit before provisions and tax for 1979 is estimated at
W 4.0 billion, representing an increase of 29% from the level reached in 1978
(W 3.1 billion). It is expected to increase to W 8.7 billion in 1980 and to
W 28.3 billion in 1984 representing an average increase of 51% during the
six-year projection period. As a percentage of CNB's average total assets,
profit before provisions and tax was 0.4% in 1978 and will remain unchanged in
1979. It is expected to go up to 0.7% in 1980 and to 0.9 in 1984. CNB's net
profit will not increase in 1979 from the level of W 2.1 billion realized in
1978. It will rise sharply to W 5.9 billion in 1980 and increase to W 19.6
billion by 1984. The expected sharp increase in CNB's profits in 1980 is due
to the increase in its paid-in share capital which took place at the end of
1979 and the fact that share capital costs much less to CNB than deposits.
CNB's return on average equity, after registering a sharp increase from 5% to
20% in 1975-78, is expected to drop to 8.7% in 1979 because of the increase in
share capital mentioned above. The return on average equity will turn upward
to 15.1% in 1980, 17.5% in 1981 and 18.4% in 1984. Such returns would not
rise sharply because of the expected annual increase in share capital during
1981-84.
Projected Financial Position
4.62      Projected balance sheets for 1979-84 are shown in Annex 24, and
selected financial ratios in Annex 25.  Based on its operational forecasts,
CNB's total assets are expected to increase from W 868.8 billion as of
December 31, 1978 to W 1,177 billion as of December 31, 1979 and to W 3,583.8
billion as of the end of 1984, showing an average annual rate of growth of
about 27%. Short- and long-term loans are expected to increase from W 434
billion (50% of total assets) in 1978, to W 567.2 billion (48% of total
assets) in 1979 to W 988.5 billion (54% of total assets) in 1981 and to W
2,203.5 billion (62% of total assets) in 1984. While the gradual shifting of
the asset structure in favor of the loan portfolio is a healthy development,
the pace at which this takes place appears to be slow. CNB should take all
possible steps to increase its lending operations to match the pace at which
the resources are mobilized.
4.63      During the forecast period, the increase of CNB's assets will be
financed by additional demand and time depbsits which will increase from
W 796.1 billion at the end of 1978 to W 3,111.0 billion at the end of 1984, an
overall increase of 290%. Total debt will increase from W 849.6 billion in
1978 to W 3,459.8 billion in 1984, while long-term debt will increase from



- 48 -
W 267.6 billion to W 1,143.7 billion over the same period. During the nego-
tiations, the need to increase CNB's share capital to support the rapidly
rising debt was discussed. CNB's representatives shared the Bank's view that
CNB's equity base needs to be strengthened, and indicated that CNB is prepared
to increase its share capital each year during the period 1981-84. While the
amount of increase is difficult to estimate precisely, because of the
necessity of obtaining the final approval from the National Assembly, CNB will
endeavor to increase W 10 billion each year during 1981-84, at the advice of
the Bank. Assuming that such capital increases will take place, the projected
total debt/equity ratio would drop from the range of 29-33 in 1979-80 to 28-30
in 1981-84. (Without the share capital increases the total debt level would
be 42 times equity by 1984). The projected long-term debt/equity ratio, after
adjustments, remain below 4:1 during the period from 1979-84, compared to the
7.1 limit agreed upon between ADB and CNB and which is also acceptable to the
Bank. The projected current ratio would hover around 1.1:1 during 1979-84,
which is within the limit specified by ADB, and also acceptable to the Bank.
4.64      Projected cash flow statements are given in Annex 26.  Since the
pattern of CNB's resource mobilization and resources allocation is assumed
to continue in the future, additional cash surplus is projected each year
during 1980-84. The subject of CNB's sizable liquid funds deriving from
deposits was reviewed during negotiations. The average maturity of these
deposits is very short, in most cases, less than one year. In the present
circumstances, bearing in mind the volatile nature of the financial environ-
ment in which CNB operates, e.g. the Government's attempt to control inflation
by restricting credit, it is regarded generally inappropriate to use the
sizable liquid funds deriving from deposits for term lending. However, CNB's
management indicated that it would seek ways, in the context of the Govern-
ment's overall credit policies, to gradually and substantially expand its
domestic currency lending operations so as to make fuller use of its existing
and prospective deposits, thereby reducing the gap between its resource
mobilization and its resource allocation, while at the same time continuing
to give due consideration to the nature (generally short-term) of the
maturities of these deposits.
5. THE PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Recommendations and Justification
5.01      The continued growth of small-scale industries remains an
important element in Korea's development strategy in view of their demon-
strated contribution to employment creation, expansion of exports, deepen-
ing of the industrial structure, and regional dispersal of industry. The
shortage of funds, particularly of term finance available at appropriate
terms has been a crucial problem faced by the small enterprises. Statistics
available show that the ratio of reliance on bank credit decreases as the size
of the enterprises becomes smaller and a considerable number of small
enterprises have no alternative but to borrow from the curb market, or to
postpone their projects.  It is estimated that less than half of the demand
for funds from the small enterprises in the past has been satisfied.



- 49 -
5.02      CNB, as the only specialized financial institution catering exclu-
sively to the small industries, is in a position to play a vital role in
assisting such firms to meet their financial requirements. CNB has been
assisting small industrial firms, including a number of very small ones.
During the period from January 1975 to September 1979, 88% of CNB's
equipment loans, both by number and by amount, went to projects employing
less than 50 workers, including 71% which went to projects employing less
than 20 workers. CNB's projects have been highly labor intensive. An
analysis of a sample of CNB-financed projects implemented during 1975-78
indicates that the average fixed investment cost-per-job created was around
US$7,885 which is relatively low in Korea.  CNB is the only financial
institution authorized to handle the Mutual Installment Savings and
Remuneration Scheme.  This Scheme embodying the principle of linking
deposits with lending for specific purposes has proved very effective in
attracting deposits and encouraging investments. Because of the assurance
of a loan, the small entrepreneur has an inducement to save. Without such
assurance, in many cases, there would not be savings enough for investment by
SSIs. CNB has an extensive branch network throughout Korea. As of December
31, 1979, CNB had 163 branches while SMIB had 112, KDB 9 and KDFC one. CNB's
branches have day-to-day contacts with small industries located in various
provinces. Through such a broad network, CNB is in a position to reach out to
provide assistance to the SSI sector more effectively.
5.03      In the past, CNB was handicapped by the lack of access to foreign
exchange resources as well as long-term domestic funds. On December 19,
1977, CNB's Act was amended to allow CNB to borrow from foreign sources. In
MIay 1979, CNB obtained from ADB a loan of US$10 million which enabled CNB to
start its foreign currency lending operations. In March 1980, CNB was
designated as a handling intermediary for the SMI Promotion Fund. Having
now obtained access to foreign funds and to the SMI Promotion Fund, CNB is
expected to play a larger role in developing and modernizing the small
industries in Korea. The Bank has, in the past, been associated with three
DFCs in Korea (KDB, KDFC and SMIB). While SMIB has been using the Bank
funds to support small- and medium-sized industries, its assistance to the
very small ones has been limited and therefore the investment demand of a
number of them still remains unsatisfied. CNB, with a branch network which
is more extensive than any banking institution in Korea and with a solid
clientele built up under the Mutual Installment Savings and Remuneration
Scheme, is in a better position to reach the small industries in various
regions and help them fill the resource gaps, thus enabling these small
enterprises to enhance their contribution to the dispersal of industries,
expansion of exports and nonfarm employment creation.
5.04      A Bank loan of US$30 million is recommended, which is expected to
finance approximately 54% of CNB's projected foreign currency loan approvals
/1 CNB is exempted from paying corporate income tax on its income. How-
ever, it is required to pay defense tax.



- 50 -
over a two-year period from mid-1980 to mid-1982. The proceeds of the loan
will be used primarily to finance procurement of machinery and equipment
needed for modernization, rationalization, or expansion of productive capa-
cities of the small enterprises in all regions. It is estimated that
the subprojects financed under the proposed loan, approximately 150 in
number, would be able to create about 5,000 new jobs. One underlying
assumption is that approximately 15-20% of the subprojects would require
replacement equipment for rationalization or modernization and the number
of new jobs to be created in such cases would be very limited. Starting
with this operation, the Bank will be continously involved in upgrading the
project appraisal capabilities within CNB. Given the added function of
providing long-term domestic and foreign currency loans, CNB is ecpected
to become more involved in development activities, while maintaining an
undiminished role in meeting the short-term financial requirements of the
businesses and general populace.
5.05       In sum, the proposed loan will increase the flow of resources to
SSI enabling realization of new, modernization and expansion projects, will
contribute to greater regional dispersal of investment and will achieve
important institution-building objectives by strengthening the capability of
CNB to service the needs of the SSI sector in Korea. Particularly at this
juncture when Government is making a concerted effort to develop the small-
and medium-sized industries (as evidenced by the establishment of a new
institution - SHIPC, and granting of new authority to CNB to engage in
foreign currency operations), the Bank's association with CNB will assist
the Government, CNB and the SSI enterprises in achieving their objectives.
The project does not entail any unusual risk.
Main Features of the Loan
5.06       Scope of Financing.  The proposed loan will support small indus-
trial, mining and transportation firms with no more than 100 employees and
construction and service firms with no more than 20 employees, or firms with
total assets not exceeding W 500 million.
5.07      Maximum Size of Subloans.  While the current regulations restrict
the amount up to which CNB can make term loans in domestic currency to W 30
million (US$51,724), there is no limitation on its foreign currency loans
extended from its foreign resources. In order to ensure that the proceeds
of the Bank loan are utilized by a large number of SSI borrowers, it is
recommended that the size of individual subloans approved by CNB under the
Bank loan will not exceed US$400,000 equivalent.
5.08      Geographical Distribution of Subloans.  To encourage a broader dis-
persal of the Bank loan outside the metropolitan area, it is recommended that
no more than 50% of the loan will be used to finance projects located within
the city limits of Seoul.



- 51 -
5.09      Free Limit.  In order to enable the Bank to monitor closely the
project appraisal work of CNB, an initial free limit of US$250,000, is
proposed. In addition, the first five subprojects to be financed under the
loan will be submitted to the Bank for prior approval, irrespective of subloan
size. With the proposed free limit it is estimated that roughly one-third
of the number of subprojects under this loan (accounting for about one-half of
the loan amount) would require prior approval by the Bank.
5.10      Economic Evaluation of Subprojects.  In order to ensure that the
economic viability of projects will be taken into consideration in the
decision-making process, CNB should be encouraged to pay more attention
to the economic evaluation of projects. It is recommended that the Economic
Rate of Return will be calculated for all subloans above the free limit.
5.11      Component for Financing Smaller Enterprises.  Under the current CNB
Act and regulations, CNB is permitted to make loans to small-scale manufac-
turing, mining and transportation enterprises employing 5 to 100 workers and
construction and service enterprises employing 5 to 20 workers. In order to
ensure access of the smallest firms to Bank funds, it is recommended that at
least 50% of the Bank loan be used to make subloans to the SSI firms employ-
ing no more than 50 workers or with total assets below W 250 million.
5.12      Debt/Equity Ratio.  Under the loan agreement signed between ADB
and CNB in May 1979, CNB is required to maintain a long-term debt/equity
ratio of 7:1. Debt will incude all long-term debt and guarantees but
exclude current maturities of such debt, savings under the Mutual Install-
ment Savings and Remuneration Scheme and reserve requirement by Bank of
Korea. It is recommended that the same debt/equity ratio be accepted by
the Bank.
5.13      Relending Rate.  CNB intends to onlend the proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan at an interest rate of 2 percentage points above its
own borrowing rate (i.e., 10.5% p.a. assuming a Bank relending rate of 8.5%
p.a.). This is in line with the general practice of government-owned deve-
lopment financial institutions in Korea in relending the proceeds of their
borrowings from institutional sources (IBRD, ADB et al). While during the
initial period CNB's costs for processing foreign currency loans may exceed
the 2% spread, CNB expects to cover such losses by its earnings on other
operations. The interest rate policy on foreign borrowings will be kept
under constant review by the Government.
5.14      Financing of Locally Produced Equipment.  Sixty percent of the cost
of machinery and equipment (including off-the-shelf equipment already impor-
ted into the country) procured locally by CNB borrowers, representing the
estimated foreign exchange component of such capital goods, will be eligible
for financing under the proposed loan.



- 52 -
5.15      Amortization Schedule.  As is usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule which would sub-
stantially reflect the aggregate of the repayment schedules of the indivi-
dual subloans made by CNB. The loan is expected to be fully repnsid within
17 years, including a grace period of 3 years.  The estimated disbursement
schedule is presented in Annex 28.
Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
5.16      During loan negotiations:
(a) understandings were reached with the Government to the effect
that:
(i) CNB would endeavor to increase its share capital in order to
strengthen its equity base as necessary to keep pace with the
growth of its liabilities and operations (para. 4.63); and
(ii) CNB to be designated in March 1980 as a handling intermediary
in allocating the resources made available by SMI Promotion
Fund (for which so far only SNIB has been designated as the
handling intermediary) (para. 4.19).
(b) agreements and/or understandings were reached with CNB with
respect to:
(i) the limitation of the scope of financing under the Bank loan
to small industrial, mining and transportation firms with no
more than 100 employees and construction and service firms
with no more than 20 employees, or firms with total assets
not exceeding W 500 million each (para. 5.06);
(ii)  a ceiling of US$400,000 on the size of individual subloans
(para. 5.07);
(iii)  a minimum of 50% of the Bank loan for financing subprojects
employing up to 50 workers, or with total assets not
exceeding W 250 million each (para. 5.11);
(iv)  a ceiling of up to 50% of the Bank loan for financing sub-
projects within the city limits of Seoul (para. 5.08);
(v)  a free limit of US$250,000, with the first five projects to
be submitted to the Bank for prior approval irrespective
of size (para. 5.09);
(vi)  economic rate of return calculation for all subprojects
above the free limit (para. 5.10); and



- 53 -
(vii) the financing of 60% of the cost of machinery and equipment
(including off-the-shelf equipment) procured locally by CNB
borrowers, representing the estimated foreign exchange
component of such capital goods (para. 5.14).
5.17      In addition the Bank reviewed and reached understandings with CNB
on the objectives outlined by CNB in its proposed Statement of Development
Strategy for 1980/81 (Annex 11).

enterprises such as identification and development of new
projects, etc.

Underlying Assumptions for Operational and Financial Projections
I. Operational Projections
Loan Operations
1.        In the case of local currency loans, there will be no tine lag
between approvals, commitment and disbursements.
2.        In the case of foreign currency loans around 60% of foreign
currency loan approvals are expected to be conmitted in the current year and
40% in the following year. Around 45% of the comnitments are expected to be
disbursed in the current year and 55% in the following year.  The time lag
for foreign currency loans financed with the Yorean Foreign F-xchange Fund is
negligible.
3.        Total local currency loan approvals are estimated to reach
W 400 billion in 1979 and expected to increase at a rate of 30% thereafter.
(The 1979 forecast has been approved by the Yinistry of Finance.) Business
loans' share in the aggregate commitments will increase by 2%, p.a., while
general populace loans will decline. Twenty percent of business loans will
be for equipment purchases with 80% for working capital purposes.
4.        Foreign currency loan approvals are estimated to amount to
US$5 million in 1979, US$20 million in 1980 and US$30 million each in
1981-83.
Projected Rates of Increase (Decrease) in Deposits
5.         Based on the actual record of the past five years, rates of
increase (decrease) in deposits applied for projections are as follows:
Average
Type of deposits                    1979       1980-83
____(%)      -----
Itutual installment receipts         19          19.3
Demand deposits                      (9)         19.3
Time & savings deposits              20          19.7
Property formation deposits         (54)         18.0

Investment of Surplus Funds
6.        Mobilized funds will be utilized to extend loans after reserves
have been deposited with BOK. Any balance will he used for investments in
marketable securities and deposited with other banks, at a ratio of 50:50
for such items.
7.        The estimated amounts of investments in marketable securities are
arrived at on the basis of the average turnover rate (purchase anount for a
year as a percentage of outstanding balance at year-end) during the past
five years.
8.        Since call loans are short term, the year-end balance of such
loans is assumed to be zero. the call-loan operations will increase by 10%
each year.
II. Financial Projections
Interest Rates
9.        Interest income and expenses for local currency operations are
calculated by applying relevant interest rates to average balances of loans,
borrowings and deposits. A 2% spread on ADB and IBRD loans is included in
the projections.
General Administrative Expenses
10.       General administrative expenses are assumed to increase at a rate
of 27.5% p.a.
Contribution to Credit Guarantee Fund
11.       Annual contribution to Credit Guarantee Fund is computed at 0.5% of
the average business loans outstanding.
Provision for Doubtful Loans
12.       With regard to provisions for doubtful loans, 0.5% of average
balance of general populace loans is accumulated to the account of special
provisions for doubtful loans, and 0.25% of average balance of foreign cur-
rency loans and 0.21% of average balance of business loans are allocated to
the account of ordinary provisions for doubtful loans.
Provision for Retirement Grants
13.       In addition to regular accumulation, special contribution would be
made up to 1980 to cover up the deficit of W 4,204 million.

Dividend Payment
14.       Eight percent of paid-in capital.
Share Capital Increase
15.       Paid-in capital is increased by U 25 billion in 1979 through
cash payment of W 11.2 billion and revaluation of assets amounting to
W 13.8 billion.
