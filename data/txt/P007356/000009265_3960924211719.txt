PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report for the Honduras Tourism
Development Project, for which Loan 1673-HO in the amount of US$19.5
million was approved on March 20, 1979. On June 25, 1986, US$6.0 million
was cancelled. The Loan was closed on December 31, 1987, three years
behind schedule. The last disbursement took place on January 25, 1989, and
the remainder of the Loan, US$.75 million, was cancelled shortly
thereafter, on February 10, 1989.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Operations
Division, Country Department II, of the Latin America and the Caribbean
Regional Office and is based, inter alia, on a Project Completion Report
prepared by the Honduras Institute of Technology; the Staff Appraisal
Report; the Loan Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on July 7, 1989, for comments by
August 25, 1989, but none were received.

HONDURAS
TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1673-HO)
PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Tourism Development Project was initially based on the results
of a study performed by a consortium of US consulting firms. The report
proposed the construction of a major tourist complex on the north coast.
After further analysis, however, it was decided that the plans outlined in
the above mentioned study were too extensive with respect to Honduras'
implementation capabilities. Thus, the project was scaled down to a size
which was deemed more appropriate.
Obiectives
The primary objective of the project was to provide an initial
impulse to the development of international tourism in Honduras. This in
turn was to spawn: diversification of sources of foreign exchange,
increased employment and incomes and the establishment of institutions
within the target sector.
Implementation Experience
The project was to consist of the following components:
a. a line of credit for onward lending to hotel and other tourism
enterprises;
b. improved facilities for international passenger handling at
San Pedro Sula Airport;
c. Roatan airfield improvements;
d. Copan archaeological park development;
e. technical assistance for strengthening of sector institutions;
and
f. establishment of a land tenure unit for Roatan.



- vi -
The major implementation issues, aside from the fact that the line
of credit was not fully utilized because of lack of demand, were the
construction-cost overrun of the Roatan Airport works and a high default
rate on credits, principally due to an equipment loan for the Hotel
Tegucigalpa Sheraton which was never completed. The former would suggest
that the Bank should place more emphasis on reviewing the accuracy of
future cost estimates so as to avoid high cost overruns similar to that
which occurred in this project component. Regarding the Sheraton, the
management of CONADI should have been strengthened. A more active
involvement on the part of the Bank, with appropriate staffing, might have
also lead to better results.
Results and Sustainability
The objective of incre&sed tourism was only partially met,
primarily due to exogenous reasons, namely the regional political
situation. Nevertheless, as seen through the continued existence and
functioning of the Technical Unit established within the Honduran Institute
of Tourism, as well as the Hotel Training program, it would appear that the
institutions necessary for the development of the Tourism Industry have
been established, though the climate is not receptive to them at this time.
When, or if, chis situation changes in the future, it would further appear
that the established institutions will indeed be able to provide impetus
for the desired development.
Though the demand for the hotel line of credit fell well below the
appraisal-anticipated level, the economic viability of the component still
managed to surpass the original expectations. The flexibility provided by
the line of credit proved to be the saving grace of the project by allowing
expenditures to adjust to the demand. It would appear that the success of
this component was due primarily to the low renovation expenditures which
yielded similar benefits as the more expensive, newly constructed rooms.
This low-cost alternative should be taken into consideration if the Bank,
at some point in the future, were to again consider financing investments
in the tourism sector.



HONDURAS
TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1673-HO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. Introduction
1.01     At the outset of this Project, Honduras was considered to have
great potential for the development of international tourism. Its Caribbean
coast includes some of t'Ae most attractive and extensive beaches in central
America, featuring fine sand and palm-lined tropical vegetation. In
addition, the Island of Roatan, located off Honduras' northern coast,
provides access to the second largest coral reef in the world. Also, the
Copan ruins, sitaated in the northwestern section of the country, are one
of the most important archaeological centers of Mayan civilization, and
attract an ever-growing number of culture-oriented international tourists.
1.02     In the early 1970's, international tourism in Honduras was in its
infancy, and the Government accorded low priority to the sector. Tourism
flows to the country were relatively low. In 1977, of the 181,113 foreign
visitors to Honduras, nearly half were classified as 'transits' passing
through the country. More than 60Z of all visitors came from neighboring
Central American countries. By 1977, North American visitors numbered about
45,000, most of whom came to Honduras for business reasons. Between 1972
and 1979, their number increased at an annual rate of 62, in line with the
growth of business activity.
1.03     The lack of adequate hotel facilities was considered to be one of
the main reasons for the limited tourist flow to Honduras. It was
considered that the private sector, without access to suitable financial
resources, was unable to develop tourism facilities. In 1978, capacity was
estimated at 2,530 rooms, of which only about 700 could be considered
suitable for most international visitors (equivalent to three stars or
more). More than 500 of the rooms in this category were situated in the two
main cities of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, and primarily catered to
business demand. The remaining 200 rooms of international standard were
located on the Bay Islands.
1.04     Interest in tourism development in Honduras was first generated in
1972 when a USAID-financed regional study for all of Central America
indicated that Honduras had good opportunities to develop its tourism
industry, particularly on the north coast beaches. Subsequent to this
study, the Government decided, in view of Honduras' lack of experience in
tourism marketing, and in operating an international tourism industry, to
adopt a gradual and pragmatic approach for developing the country's tourism
potential. This approach had two main features:
a. selective hotel development on the mainland in places where
little additional public infrastructure was required or where
such infrastructure was already planned for other purposes;
and



-2-
b.  dispersed development on Roatan and other Bay Islands, with
small hotels at suitable sites, together with supporting
infrastructure (wells, septic tanks, electric generators and
bulldozed access roads) on the basis of an environmental
control plan, to be implemented by zoning and building
regulations, and with the improvement of air access to
Roatan.
1.05     The Honduras Tourism Development Project, subject of this report,
was intended to support this Government strategy through the provision of
adequate financing and technical assistance required to develop the target
industry.
II. Project Identification, Preparation, and objectives
2.01     Following the previously mentioned USAID study, the Government of
Honduras (GOH), with the help of the Organization of American States (OAS),
produced guidelines for a national  -urism plan. In March 1974, a
consortium of US consulting firms wa engaged by the GOH [with Central
American Bank for Economic Integrati - (CABEI) financing] to prepare plans
for a first project. The consultant'. report, submitted in late-1975,
included a master plan for the development of 18 km of beach at Tornasal on
the north coast to the west of Tela. This development entailed the
construction of a 2,870 room tourist complex for a total estimated cost of
US$81.5 million.
2.02     After an identificatior. mission i- mid-1976, the Bank felt that it
was necessary to scale down the proiect to one more suitable to meet
Honduras' implementation capabilities. Furt 3rmore, with a view towards
diversifying the Honduran tourism product, the Bank also agreed to consider
a program of works on the Island of Roatan and at the archaeological site
of Copan, as well as attempting to eliminate the constraints put on the
tourism industry by poor air access into the country. Finally, the Bank and
the GOH agreed on the need to take a more gradual and dispersed approach to
develop the Tourism Sector. The focus was to be the removal of the key
constraints stifling sector development such as limited hotel availability
and poor air access. Funds from the Bank's project preparation facility
were utilized to explore possible options.
2.03     The project was appraised in May 1978. The primary objective of
the project as described in the appraisa± report was to provide an initial
impulse to the development of an international tourist trade in Honduras
and thereby:
a.  contribute to the diversifiLation of -3urces of foreign
exchange earnings;



- 3 -
b. generate employment and incomes in regions of the country,
such as the Bay Islands, with few alternate economic
activities, or in regions deprived of their previous economic
vocations such as around Tela (where banana packing and
shipment have been severely reduced); and
c. build institutions for both tourism planning at the macro and
micro levels and for tourism implementation during the
investment and operational phases ar.d thus lay the ground work
for sustained growth.
2.04     The project was to consist of the following components:
a. a line of credit for onward lending to hotel and other tourism
enterprises;
b. improved facilities for international passenger handling at
San Pedro Sula Airport;
c. Roatan airfield improvements;
d.  Copan archaeological park development;
e.  technical assistance for strengthening of sector
institutions; and
f. establishment of a land tenure unit for Roatan.
2.05     Negotiations were held on January 29, 1979. The Executive
Directors approved a credit of US$19.5 million on March 20, 1979. The loan
was signed on June 25, 1979, and the expected date of effectiveness was
September 25, 1979. Because one of the conditions for effectiveness was
not met, namely the hiring of the foreign experts in the Technical Unit of
the Honduran Institute of Tourism (IHT), the date of effectiveness was
postponed until November 8, 1979. The estimated project completion date was
June 30, 1984.
III. Project Implementation
(i) Line of Credit
3.01     A line of credit of US$16 million was established to assist in
financing new hotels with a total capacity of about 700 rooms, extensions
to existing hotels and other related tourism enterprises. The Bank-loan
funds were to be channeled through the National Industrial Development Fund
(FONDEI) to the financial intermediaries which consisted primarily of
commercial banks, which, in turn, would lend to the ultimate subproject
borrower. At the time of appraisal there were proposals for approximately
350 additional rooms with an estimated cost of US$14 million.



3.02     During the initial stages of project execution, the allocation of
funds under the Line of Credit advanced well. After approximately 18 months
of effectiveness, 23Z of funds had been committed for five hotel projects
and an additional 44Z had been declared eligible for seven hotels.
Furthermore, six other projects were under preparation, in which an
additional 33Z of the funds would be utilized.
3.03     Later, by 1982, this project component started to experience
delays, and it became evident that the line of credit would not be fully
committed before the limit date of June 30, 1982. There were several
reasons for the delays. One major reason was the decaying financial
situation of The National Investment Corporation (CONADI), as this
institution was to be the financial inteL.iediary of several sub-components
(equivalent to US$7.3 million). Another cause for the delays experienced
was the unexpected problems, and eventual elimination of the Palmetto Bay
Tourism ,evelopment (US$2.5 million). Perhaps the most crucial reason for
the delays in the implementation of this component was the deteriorating
regional political situation, which did not provide a conducive investment
climate for Tourism Sector investments. Furthermore, it would appear that
the appraisal was too optimistic in forecasting the demand for funds that
would be requested for investment in economically viable projects. This
again could be attributed to the previously mentioned political situation.
As a result of this demand overestimation, it was decided to expand the
magnitude of this componenit to include renovation work to the originally
envisaged construction of new rooms. Originally, the construction of 700
rooms was envisaged. By the completion of the praject, 391 rooms were made
available, of which 230 were remodeled. As seen on map IBRD 13747R, these
rooms were located in the major cities of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula,
on the Island of Roatan, and on several smaller cities such as Tela and
Choluteca.
3.04     The Borrower requested funding for completion of the Hotel Posada
de Copan. It was determined that though the overall project was only to
yield a 6% financial rate of return, the rate of return for the investment
needed to complete the hotel would have been 12Z. The funds requested,
however. were to originate from Category B-Improvement and Enhancement of
Tourism Related facilities. The Bank informed the Borrower, that though it
would consider funding the hotel completion under Category A of the loan,
disbursement under Category B was inappropriate. The Goverment did not
respond, and the subproject was dropped. As a result, CONADI, which was the
owner of the hotel, lost approximately US$3.0 million in sunk costs. This
was a major undermining factor to the national investment organization's
financial stability. Furthermore, the weakness of this organization later
lead to serious implementation problems related to the Hotel Tegucigalpa
Sheraton (see para 5.05).
3.05     By November 1984, as no additional disbursement applications for
viable projects remained pending, it was estimated that a balance of
approximately US$9.1 million would remain. With this figure known, the
Bank then considered the GOH request (originally made in March 1983) to



- 5 -
utilize the funds remaining in the line of credit for the construction of
additional tourism-related infrastructure (transportation, energy, and
telecommunications) on Roatan Island. After studying the proposals, the
Bank agreed to amend the Loan Agreement to include only the
Telecommunications section of the proposed infrastructure works (see para
3.22). The other components were not considered because their
implementation would drastically extend beyond the time frame of the
project.
(ii) Roatan Airfield Improvements
3.06     At the time of appraisal, tourism development on Roatan in the Bay
Islands was deemed constrained by limited air access. The project,
therefore, was to finance the following improvements:
a. paving of the existing gravel runway, taxiway, and apron for a
total surface of some 51,000m2;
b. construction of additional sea protection and drainage
works;
c. provision of telecommunications, weather and firefighting
facilities and equipment; and
d. construction of facilities for passengers and baggage
handling.
3.07     By June 1980, procurement arrangements were completed for the
paving works at Roatan and a construction contract was awarded to the
lowest bidder. Although execution of this project initially proceeded well,
delays in the airport works began to appear by June 1982. By October, the
works were apparently paralyzed. They remained in this condition for
approximately two years. The cause of the stoppage were serious financial
problems incurred by the contractor who eventually went into bankruptcy.
The work was eventually completed successfully, after rebidding, by a
second contractor on December 21, 1985.
3.08     Approximately 56,000m2 of the runway were paved (the additional
5,000m2 were added as per agreement at the time of the reallocation of
funds). Furthermore, the additional sea protection and drainage works were
completed successfully, as were the improvements to the terminal, i.e.
construction of passenger and baggage handling facilities. After additional
review, the implementation of telecommunications, weather, and firefighting
equipment and facilities was deemed unnecessary, and, thus, not carried-out
as originally planned.
(iii) San Pedro Sula Airport Improvements
3.09     The works at this airport were to improve the international
arrival facilities at the terminal building (an addition of 220m2 to the
building), as well as adding suitable baggage handling equipment.
Furthermore, a 4,000m2 extension to the parking apron was also to be
financed under the loan.



- 6 -
3.10     Both the works on the terminal building and the parking facility
were completed successfully by early 1982. However, the baggage handling
equipment, namely a conveyor belt, was not installed due to the increase in
the cost of civil works and the lack of component funds. As this sub-
component was not deemed essential to achieve a favorable outcome of the
component, a transfer of funds from other project components was not made.
(iv) Copan Archaeological Park
3.11     The Copan works were intended for the enhancement of tourist
attractions, and were planned to include the following:
a. construction and equipping of a visitors' center;
b. training of guides;
c. production of tourism information material;
d. extension of the archaeological park;
e. installation of visitors' facilities, such as pedestrian walks
and rest benches;
f. improvement and extension of the small museum in the nearby
township of Copan Ruinas; and
g. completion of an on-going six-year technical assistance
program, the first two years of which had already been financed
by CABEI, for the exploration, consolidation, restoration and
preservation of monuments.
3.12     The Copan component was successfully implemented as envisaged in
the appraisal with only minor delays. The construction and equipping of the
visitors' center was completed within the time frame established by the
IHT. Furthermore, a total of ten guides were trained in various seminars
held by the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH).
Regarding the tourism information material, eight volumes of the "Study of
Copan" were publishe:d and presently serve as the main source of information
for tourists regarding the Mayan ruins. Other accomplishments included:
expansion of the park to include burial sites, visitor facility
installations, expansion of the museum by the planned 400m2, and the
contracting of ten archaeologiRts and twentv archaeology students from
Pennsylvania State University to provide additional technical assistance as
outlined in the component description.
3.13     By early 1984, it became apparent that there was a shortage of
component funds, and for this reason, it was necessary to eliminate the
program of archaeological study planned for 1984, as it was not considered



to be of major importance. Furthermore, museum remodeling was halted for
the first semester of the same year. The funds from the cancelled study
were utilized in the expansiin and improvement of the museum. All of the
above mentioned works were completed by January 14, 1986.
(v) Technical Assistance
3.14     This component included the provision of technical assistance to
the agencies and entities participating in the carrying out of the Project,
including:
a. employment of four foreign experts to assist in the work of
IHT's new Technical and existing Planning Departments;
b. services of foreign experts and provision of overseas training
and teaching equipment to assist in the expansion and
systematization of hotel and tourism training provided by
INFOP;
c. services of consultants for the preparation of a tourism
Environmental Control Plan for Roatan Island;
d. services of an international travel marketing expert who was to
assist IHT in the formulation of a coordinated national
marketing plan aimed at promoting Honduras as an international
tourist destination; and
e. establishment of an effective airport cost accounting system.
3.15     All of the above mentioned programs were implemented by late 1986,
though some delays were incurred. The following paragraphs will briefly
describe the specific implementation of each of the sub-components.
3.16     As indicated, the project envisaged the creation of a Technical
Unit within the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (SECTUR), with functions to
include coordination of project implementation and hotel credit evaluation.
Four foreign experts, including a chief advisor, and architect/engineer,
and economist and a financial analyst, were to assist in the work
initially. Later, local counterparts were to take over their positions.
Although administrative arrangements had been made to remunerate the local
staff outside the career civil service structure so that salaries would be
adequate to attract experienced personnel of high caliber, there
nevertheless arose staffing problems due to the low salaries. These
problems were resolved by late 1982 through further increases in
remuneration. The Technical Unit as an institution, continues to
successfully handle its original responsibilities.



- 8 -
3.17     The hotel training sub-component was to finance the employment of
an expatriate chief training advisor who was to initially advise on
curricula and courses, and was to subsequently act as senior instructor.
The chief advisor for hotel training came under contract in early 1980. His
proposals served in restructuring the INFOP hotel trainiig program. After
initial delays, three local instructors returned from hotel schools in
Spain and Italy by mid-1984 to replace the expatriate instructors who had
been aiding in the initial implementation of the sub-component. The
restructured training program is still presently in operation.
3.18     The Environmental Control Plan on Roatan was to identify tourism
zones. their use and building standards, and other requirements for
environmental protection. Due to differences that arose between the
consulting firm and the authorities, major delays were experienced ir.
signing the contract to perform the study. The plan was eventually
presented by the consultants in July 1983. After problems regarding OAS
funding of feasibility studies recommended in the Plan were resolved, the
suggestions made served as impetus for the "Development of Tourism on the
Bay Islands." This plan presently being implemented included the extension
of the Roatan Airport runway, construction of a new terminal, paving 52kms.
of Island roadway, telecommunications work, improvement of electrical
energy, and a program of environmental sanitation.
3.19     The IHT received the final version of the Tourism Market Study
presented to them by the expert in tourism marketing by late-1982, as
originally structured at appraisal. The recommendations in the study are
being utilized by the Technical Unit in the planning and execution of
tourism campaigns.
3.20     The procurement for the study of airport tariffs and the cost
accounting system was delayed due to technical difficulties. It was later
decided that the personnel from the Ministry of Communications, Public
Works and Transport (SECOPT) would carry out the work. The new tariff
system came into effect in February 1982, and the cost accounting system by
mid-1983. Both of these are currently in use and tariffs are being updated.
(vi) Roatan Land Tenure Unit
3.21     This component included the establishment of a special unit in
SECTUR for assisting in the regularization of the existing land tenure
situation on Roatan Island. The unit was established and is performing its
designated tasks.
(vii) Telecommunications on Roatan
3.22     The Telecommunications componert, which consisted of switching and
transmission equipment procurement, was added to the project by amendment
to the loan on May 29, 1985. The funds to finance this component were
provided by a reallocation from the hotel line of credit balance. As
previously mentioned, this was the only additional tourism related
infrastructure project considered viable, primarily due to implementation



- 9 -
time constraints of the other two infrastructure projects considered (see
para 3.05). This component was fully implemented, however, with some delay.
The closing date for the component was extended once after the original
extension from the December 1985 date and the final closing date was
December 31, 1987. Due to slight delays in equipment acquisition, which was
done by International Competitive Bidding (ICB), the completion date was
June 30, 1988.
IV. Project Cost and Disbursements
4.01     Appraisal estimates and the estimated final costs are shown in
Table 1. As indicated, the total cost of US$24,686,800 was substantially
lower than the appraisal estimate of US$38,350,000. This 35.6Z difference,
as mentioned above, was primarily due to the underutilization of the hotel
line of credit. For this component, the total cost of US$32 million was
reduced to US$13.8 million. The total allocation for the subsequent
Telecommunications Component was US$2.0 million. By completion, US$1.3
million was utilized. Nevertheless, there occurred a cost overrun of
approximately US$2,567,300 (41.OZ) if costs are calculated on the other
components. The cost increase was primarily due to the Roatan airport
works cost overrun.
4.02     The Roatan Airport component-cost of US$4.29 million well exceeded
the estimate of US$1.81 million. The substantial difference between the
appraisal estimate and the total cost (137.4Z) can be primarily attributed
to errors in the original estimation of unit prices for the paving works.
It is not clear with whom the fault of this cost miscalculation lies. It
should also be noted that there did occur an average annual Consumer Price
Index increase of approximately 10.5Z. The appraisal estimate of US$310,000
for the San Pedro Sula Airport works was also somewhat low, against an
actual component cost of US$364,200. Additionally, it sl.ould be noted that
the appraisal estimate included the baggage handling equipment which was
not later included in the project (see para 3.10). The other component 3
(Copan and the Land Tenure Unit) were completed within the original cost
estimates.
4.03     The Technical Assistance component total cost was 5.31
(US$110,500) aboie the estimated cost. There nevertheless occurred wide
divergences between the estimated and actual costs of the various sub-
components. The cost of establishing of the Technical Unit within SECTUR
was US$1,280,200. This was greater than the appraisal estimate of
US$845,000. This was due to the extended period for which Bank-financed
consultants provided technical assistance. The hotel training sub-component
had a total cost of US$221,300, well below the total estimated cost of
US$698,000 due to a donation from the Government of Spain. The cost of the
Environmental Control Plan, which was very much in line with the appraisal
estimate of US$223,000, was US$236,400. The total cost of the Tourism
Market Study sub-component reached US$285,700, which was well above the
original estimate of US$95,000. The additional costs were incurred by
implementation of the recommendations made in the study. Finally, although
the airport tariffs and the cost accounting system sub-component was
allocated funds at appraisal, the study was carried out with the GOH's own
resources by staff already in place.



- 10 -
4.04     The disbursements for this project were delayed beginning with
initial execution of the project. The original project (excluding the
telecommunications component) was to be disbursed in approximately five
years, but actually took about eight years. The main disbursement problem
was with the line of credit. Of the estimated US$16 million, only US$6.9
million was eventually disbursed. As mentioned in paragraph 3.03, problems
in fund disbursement arose for the following reasons: CONADI's
deteriorating financial situation, the elimination of a US$2.5 million
project (Palmetto Bay). and finally, the regional political situation.
Disbursement delays arose with other components as well. The Copan work did
experience some delays, but nevertheless, an efficient system for
processing local payments was established to avoid the problems which had
characterized earlier works at Copan financed by CABEI.
4.05     Table 2 shows the final allocation of credit funds among the
different project categories. Funds were reallocated twice. The first was
to allocate resources to enable the Roatan Airport works to be completed
despite the 137.4X rise in estimated costs. The second reallocation
occurred towards the end of the project and included the Telecommunications
component to be financed by a reallocation from tiie line of credit balance.
V. Performance Of The Borrower
5.01     The Central Bank was to administer the lire of credit, while
SECTUR was to be responsible for executing all the other components. SECOPT
was to act on behalf of SECTUR in ensuring implementation of the airport
component and the environmental control plan for Roatan. The National
Institute for Vocational Training (INFOP) was to implement the hotel
training program.
5.02     Overall, in light of the political situation, the execution of the
project was carried-out satisfactorily. Although the project was completed
three years behind schedule, this was primarily due to the addition of the
new Telecommunications component in May 1985, which took nearly three years
to implement. The Government's role with respect to particular
implementation issues is discussed below.
5.03     The performance of the Borrower with respect to the major
implementation issues of the project, namely the overestimation of the line
of credit demand, and problems regarding the Roatan Airport works
execution, appeared to be satisfactory. With respect to the former, the
lack of demand, in all likelihood, can be attributed to damaged investor
confidence resulting from the destabilizing events in the Region, and by
the ensuing publicity. It is also possible that the original estimate was
ovezly optimistic in its predictions. Because of the turbulent political
situation that emerged in the Region after the project initiation, however,
this is a matter of speculation. Hence it would not be reasonable to hold
the Central Bank accountable for a poor forecast. In any case, the borrower
did adjust to the situation and instead of financing the originally planned
new construction, turned to the renovation of existing units, which
involved less financial risks. Furthermore, the Technical  nit within the
IHT was effective in providing assistance to potential invebtors in
formulating their projects and in preparing their eligibility applications.



- 11 -
5.04     Regarding the Roatan Airport works, as discussed in paragraph
3.07, the costs were well over the appraisal estimate, and there were
delays of almost two years. The primary reason for the difference between
the appraisal and final costs of this component was the errors in the
original estimation of unit prices for the paving works. The cause of the
underestimation appeared to be more on the Bank's side than on the
Government's (see para 6.02). The delays in the execution of the component
were due to the financial instability of the company originally contracted
which was later replaced. The Government might have taken earlier action to
replace the contractor and thus prevent such long construction delays.
5.05     Another issue is that four of the fourteen banks serving as
financial intermediaries are in arrears to FONDEI for a total of US$1.7
million. Most of the arrears, US$1.4 million, are owed by CONADI which
served as the financial intermediary for the Hotel Tegucigalpa Sheraton
(HTS) subproject. In this subproject, US$2.2 million were lent to finance
the purchase of furniture and equipment for the HTS. Construction of the
Hotel was stopped in December 1981, after 75Z of the construction (US$10.3
million) was completed, because of lack of funds, yet the furniture and
equipment had already been purchased. As this hotel never became
operational, the arrears of US$1.4 million remain. In March 1982, a second
subloan was requested to allow for completion of the hotel construction.
However, in May 1984, after length negotiations and discussions, it was
finally decided not to proceed with the completion of the construction. The
long delay in taking a final decision on the second subloan appears to have
been primarily caused by the inability of the Government and the investment
consortium to propose a satisfactory financing plan to complete
construction and undertake initial operation. The total Sheraton hotel
project would have yielded a low rate of return primarily due to the high
construction costs, and the decline in tourism, however, the incremental
costs needed to complete the project were probably justified to prevent the
ensuing loses. Based on the HTS and Hotel Posada de Copan experiences and
serious delays in other subloans, the performance of CONADI was deficient
and steps should have been taken by the Government to strengthen the
institutions. The previously purchased equipment was appaLPntly re-sold,
and the hotel structure purchased by the military.
5.06     The Borrower's performance with respect to the obligations set
forth in the Loan Agreement was satisfactory. All Loan Covenants were met,
though delays occurred in the implementation of the study of airport
tariffs and the cost accounting system for airport user charges. The Bank
also expressed concern about the annual audits of the Project Accounts that
were to be opened and maintained by SECTUR, SECOPT and INFOP. These audits
were not received by the Bank until mid-1981. Delays in the execution of
other loan covenants did occur, but were relatively insignificant.



- 12 _
VI. Performance of the Bank
6.01     As indicated above, some miscalculations were made in the
appraisal estimates. The most significant of these was the estimated demand
for the hotel line of credit. However, this overestimation, as discussed in
paragraph 6.02, can not be attributed to the Bank, just as the burden of
this can not be placed on the Central Bank. It is worth noting that the
Bank was instrumental in influencing the Government to take a more cautious
approach in the development of the industry. The originally contemplated
Tornasal project, which would have involved huge resources, was rejected.
In light of the unexpected political turmoil which arose, the project would
have proved economically disastrous. It is clear, however, that the
appraisal did not accurately estimate the costs involved in the execution
of the Roatan Airport works component. The airport works estimates were
undertaken by a Bank consultant. The Bank should have been able to review
these figures and notice what was to be a 137.4% miscalculation.
6.02     Regarding the Hotel Tegucigalpa Sheraton and the failure of the
Government and the private consortium to come to a satisfactory arrangement
to complete the project, the Bank's position was that the Government should
not be required to invest any more equity into the project. This position
was reasonable considering the fact that the Government had already
invested approximately 63Z of the construction costs. Nevertheless, the
Government and the private parties could not come to an agreement to
satisfy the condition. Possibly the Bank could have taken a more active
role in facilitating the negotiations. Although it is not the role of the
Bank to enter into the negotiating process directly, additional Bank
involvement with FONDEI might have provided additional ideas and support in
order to resolve the impasse. It should be noted that the project was under
the supervision of the Urban Projects Division which had relatively little
experience in dealing with financial intermediaries and commercial lending.
It was not until 1984 that the Bank involved staff with more commercial
lending expertise from the Industrial Development Finance Division. As no
breakthrough appeared on the horizon, and negotiations were entering their
second year, the Bank issued a telex indicating that if a satisfactory
arrangement was not reached by Hay 15, 1984, consideration of the
subproject to complete construction of the hotel would be closed. The
Government never replied to the Bank's request, and the subproject was
dropped. Earlier involvement of Bank staff with a higher level of
commercial lending expertise might have led to a suitable arrangement, thus
reducing Government losses.
6.03     With the possible exception of the HTS subproject, the Bank
supervision of the project was satisfactory. Supervision missions were
performed regularly by Bank staff. It would perhaps been advantageous to
have at least one mission during 1985 to observe the completion efforts
that were underway. In March 1986, the mission that reported the project
completion was at the site to supervise the implementation of the
Telecommunications component.

VII. Economic Re-evaluation
7.01    The project analyzed at the time of appraisal comprised a hotel
program of over 700 rooms, the development of other tourist facilities,
such as restaurants, shops, handicrafts, and their operator services, and
associated infrastructure and public sector services. The original
evaluation was carried out in three stages. First, a rate of return on the
hotel investment program alone was calculated. For this part of the
economic evaluation, net benefits were defined as visitor expenditures in
hotels less the costs of building and operating the hotels. Secone,
incremental visitor expentitures outside hotels and the cost of providing
the corresponding services were added to the benefit and cost streams.
Third, public expenditures were added. This included the infrastructure
works and the various sub-components of Technical Assistance. For the
latter, costs were added, but no additions were made to project benefits.
These analyses yielded rates of return of 21.9Z, 24.1?, and 192
respectively.
7.02   The economic reevaluation was carried out following the same
methodology used at appraisal (see Annex 1). The ex-post analysis was based
on data provided by the IHT from five hotels selected from the thirteen
located in Teguciagalpa, San Pedro Sula and the Bay Islands. Investment
costs were for all credits approved including the credit for the HTS
equipment. The resulting ex-post economic rates of return were 40.1Z, 39.4?
and 21.92 respectively (See tables 3-5). With respect to the hotel
investments, these results indicate that important benefits were gained as
a result of the more limited renovation outlays, compared with the
originally anticipated construction costs. Investments i.& non-hotel
services also proved to have economic merit. The project overall, as
analyzed with the public investments which include the approximately 137.4?
cost overrun incurred by the Roatan Airport sub-component, still managed to
achieve a very high rate of return, primarily because of the level of
economic viability of the hotel and non-hotel investments. Overall, the
project is expected to be successful. Based on the calculations of the
Borrower, the financial rates of return for the individual subprojects were
also high, ranging from 11.9? to 95.02.
VIII. Conclusions
8.01    The size and complexity of the project, as determined by the
Appraisal Report, was in step with the capacity and potential of Honduran
tourism industry at the time of its original conception. Unfortunately, tLe
unforseen trend of regional political instability led to the downgrading of
what was intended to be the major impetus to the growth of the tourist
industry. Primarily as a result of the regional political scene, tourism in
Honduras decreased. In 1977, there were approximately 181,113 foreign
visitors. By 1985, the arrivals of foreign nationals had actually dropped
to 154,599. These figures increased slightly by 1986, reaching 170,599.
8.02     In the long-run, the Honduras tourism industry does have
potential. At the point when external factors cease to hinder its ability
to expand, it would appear that Honduras, as a result of this project, has

fostered the level of institutional fomentation necessary to support the
development of the tourism sector. Thus, with respect to the project
objective (see para 2.03) of institutional strengthening, the project was
successful. However, neither the objective of diversifying of the sources
of foreign exchange earnings, nor that of generating employment and incomes
was achieved as envisaged due to the overall decline in tourism.
Nevertheless, employment and incomes were greater with the project than
they would have been without it.
8.03    The actual implementation of the project was quite satisfactory.
With the exception of the line of credit which was reduced, all components
were executed as originally planned. Additionally, a telecommunications
component was added to the works envisaged in the Appraisal Report. The
major implementation issues, aside from the fact that the line of credit
was not fully utilized because of lack of demand, were the construction-
cost overrun of the Roatan Airport works and a high default rate on
credits, principally due to an ecuipment loan for the Hotel Tegucigalpa
Sheraton which was never compljted. The former would suggest that the Bank
should place more emphasis on reviewing the accuracy of futuxe cost
estimates so as to avoid high cost overruns similar to that which occurred
in this project component. Regarding the Sheraton, the management of CONADI
should have been strengthened. A more active involvement on the part of the
Bank, with appropriate staffing, might have also lead to better results.
8.04     Though the demand for the hotel line of credit fell well below the
appraisal-anticipated level, the economic viability of the component still
managed to surpass the original expectations. The flexibility provided by
the line of credit proved to be the saving grace of the project by allowing
expenditures to adjust to the demand. It would appear that the success of
this component was due primarily to the low renovation expenditures which
yielded similar benefits as the more expensive, newly construct(d rooms.
This low-cost alternative should be taken into consideration if the Bank,
at some point in the future, were to again consider financing investments
in the tourism sector.
