FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:               Republic of Niger
Beneficiary:            Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MTPU)
Amount:                 SDR 21.9 Million (US$23.6 Million)
Terms:                  Standard
Project Description:    The proposed project would help Government to establish
a preventive periodic road maintenance program and set
up a permanent training program for employees of the
Directorate of Public Works (DTP) of MTPU. The
project would provide for: (a) pavement strengthening
and resealing of 374 km of the existing bituminous
network; (b) establishment of a Road Management Unit
(RMU) in DTP; and (c) construction and equipping of a
training school for DTP's employees, and technical
assistance to help design and implement a training
program. The project would also provide vehicles and
equipment for traffic counting, classrooms and work-
shops. Benefits would accrue in the form of vehicle-
operating cost savings and savings in road maintenance
costs. There are no technical risks. Possible risk
relates to the general fiscal crisis and its impact on
the adequacy of maintenance funds, but measures have
been introduced into the project to monitor this
risk.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
PEPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER FOR
A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1,        I suumit the following report and recommendation or a proposed
development credit for the equivalent of SDR 21.9 million (US$23.6 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms to the Republic of Niger to help finance a
proposed Fourth Highway Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report entitled "Economic Memorandum:  Niger" was distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 13, 1976. An economic mission visited Niger
in June 1982, and the main findings of the mission are incorporated in the
following paragraphs. Annex I contains updated Country data.
Background
3.        With its 1.27 million km2 of land, Niger is about 2.5 times the
size of France. Niger is a landlocked country, and its closest access to the
sea is about 600 km from Niger's southern border. Nearly 90 percent of the
total population is concentrated in a thin band along the southern border.
Only 12 percent of the land is considered arable, and only 2.5 percent is
actually under cultivation. Rainfall is limited (350-750 mm) and often
irregular, and soil fertility is low and declining. The total population
was estimated at 5.3 million in 1980 and is growing at about 2.8 percent per
annum. Per capita income was estimated at US$330 in 1980. Niger's social
indicators are among the lowest in the world. Life expectancy at birth, which
is only 43 years, is low even by African standards. The adult literacy rate
is only 8 percent and the primary enrollment ratio only 23 percent.
4.        Niger belongs to the West African Monetary Union which provides its
members with a common currency (the CFA Franc) fully convertible into French
Francs. The full convertibility of the CFA Franc and the liberal foreign
trade policies pursued by the Monetary Union members kept the Nigerien economy
very open in the past.  This openness was further strengthened by the very
strong trade links that have always existed between Niger and its neighbors,
particularly Nigeria. Another particularly important characteristic of the
Monetary Union is the strong discipline imposed o.er monetary and fiscal
policies of the member countries, in return for the guaranteed convertibility
of the currency. As is generally the case in open economies, excessive credit
expansion quickly leads to increased imports, balance of payments deficits
and a loss in foreign reserves. This being recognized by the Union member
countries, their common Central Bank was empowered with strong controls over
the domestic credit ceilings.
I/  This section is substantially unchanged from the President's Report
for the Water Supply Project (Report No. P-3285-NIR, November 15, 1982).



- 2 -
5.        Like other Sahelian economies, Niger's is dominated by subsistence
agricultural activities with millet and sorghum occupying 80 percent of the
cultivated area. The discovery of large uranium deposits in the late sixties
and their development, accelerated by the world oil crisis of the mid-seventies,
propelled the mining sector into an important position in Niger's economy.
The sector is now providing nearly 70 percent of Niger's total export earnings
and an important share of the government revenues.
Economic Achievements in the Seventies
o.        During the past decade Niger went from a period of despair to a
period of almost unlimited hope in the future.  Between 1970 and 1975 NJiger
experienced one of the severest and longest droughts of its history. Its
livestock herd was decimated, and food production declined by nearly 60 per-
cent. At the height of the drought in 1974/75, Niger registered a food grain
deficit of nearly one million tons. Real per capita GDP declined at an
average annual rate of 0.5 percent. On the expenditure side, per capita con-
sumption declined by 6 percent per annum although gross domestic investment
grew at a modest annual rate of 3.2 percent with the help of increasing
foreign aid. Uranium production and export began as early as 1971 and the
impact of the sector on the national economy grew m)derately in the first
half of the seventies as prices were stable.
7.        During the second half of the decade Niger's fcrtune changed
dramatically. More favorable climatic conditions allowed an accelerated
recovery of the agricuiltural sector. With intensive government programs the
Nigerien livestock herd was rapidly reconstituted.  Food production steadily
increased and by 1979 Niger was once again self-sufficient and even managed to
show a substantial surplus. Nigerien agriculture has indeed performed excep-
tionally well for a Sahelian country. In spite of having half the per capita
arable land of the neighboring countries, a poorer soil fertility and less
water resources, Niger's per capita food production has consistently been
superior to its neighbors'. By 1977, uranium exports accounted for 53 percent
of total exports of goods and non-factor services, and that share increased to
70 percent at the end of the decade. As prices and quantities exported
increased rapidly Niger's total export receipts increased from CFAF 11.9
billion in 1975 to CFAF 85 billion in 1979. The contribution of the sector
to public revenues followed the same trend. The share of uranium in total
government revenues steadily increased from 18.3 percent in 1975 to an all
time high of 41.6 percent in 1979. Government uranium revenues grew from
CFAF 4.1 billion to CFAF 24.6 billion in the same period. As a result of the
good performance of these two sectors, real CDP grew at an average annual rate
of 7.2 percent. On the expenditure side per capita consumption grew at an
annual rate of 4.5 percent and gross domestic investment at an average rate of
6.7 percent.
The Eighties and the Uranium Crisis
8.        The decade of the eighties started with serious signs pointing to
a long lasting crisis of the uranium sector. UJranium export earnings stagnated
at around CFAF 95 billion in the last three years, and government revenues
sharply declined from CFAF 24.6 billion in 1979 to CFAF 12.5 billion in 1982.



- 3 -
9.        During the same three years agricultural sector performance has
also been mediocre. Unfavorable climatic conditions forced Niger once again
to supplement its food production by increasing quantities of grain imports.
Food grain deficits in 1981 and 1982 were estimated at about 100,000 tons per
year. For the first time since 1975 real GDP has stagnated in 1982.
10.       Unfortunately this serious slowdown in economic activity was not
followed by an equal slowdown in Niger's public expenditures. The lack of
clear signals from the uranium market experts left the Nigerien authorities
uncertain about the future of the sector. It was not until 1982 that they
initiated action to adapt to their changed export and revenue prospects.
During this period the government continued to implement an ambitious Five-
Year Development Plan by increasingly relying on foreign borrowing to finance
the public investment expenditures.
Public Finance
11.       Throughout the 70's the Government demonstrated considerable
restraint in expanding its current expenditure. This was even true during
the uranium boom when current expenditures were always covered by non-
uranium revenues. However, during the uranium boom the Covernment pursued
an aggressive investment policy, which continued into the recession in the
uranium sector. Public investment steadily increased from 34.2 billion CFAF
in 1976/77 to 77.8 billion FCFA in 1980/81.
12.       During the same time the overall Government deficit increased from
5.5 billion CFAF (10 percent of total government revenues including grants) to
32 billion CFAF (31 percent of total revenues). An increasing reliance on
borrowing to finance its investment has led to a severe debt burden which the
Government will have to face for some years to come. The Government will have
to allocate nearly 25 percent of its total revenues to service its debt in
1982/83.
Balance of Payments
13.       In spite of the rapid increase  in export earnings from uranium
between 1977 and 1981, Niger's balance of payments continued to be charac-
terized by large current account deficits which increased from about US$170
million to USS360 million.  Until 1981, the net capital inflow from borrowing
and from the parallel rapid growth in foreign aid (para. 18), allowed Niger to
continue to accumulate substantial foreign reserves despite the increasing
trade deficit. By 1982, though, the continuing stagnation of exports and
rapidly increasing debt service payments are expected to cause a decline in
reserves, which could reach about USS50 million, a reduction by half. The
pessimistic outlook for uranium exports could lead to further weakening of the
balance of payments situation in the next few years if corrective measures are
not taken.  Also, under the rules of the West African Monetary Union, Niger
will soon face restrictive monetary and fiscal limits to correct its balance
of paynents situation.



- 4 -
14.       The rinancing of this deficit (and service of prior debt) caused
total public and public-guaranteed debt from abroad to increase from US$269
million in 1977 to US$915 million in 1982. Niearly 46 percent of the increase
occurred in the year 1980. The service on this debt increased dramatically
from 1JS$9 million to US$63 million in the period, reflecting the substantial
change in the structure of the debt, as commercial borrowing, which accounted
for only 2.5 percent of debt outstanding in 1977, increased its share to 29
percent at the end of 1981. The public debt service ratio to total exports of
goods and services increased from 3.8 percent in 1977 to 12 percent in 1981
and is estimated to have reached 17 percent in 1982. This ratio is expected
to continue to increase rapidly in the next two years.
Development Planning
15.       The Five-Year Development Plan, 1979-1983, was conceived at the
peek of the uranium boom and under the assumption that the boom would last
for at least the duration of the Plan. This assumption combined with a
firm commitment to a maximum development effort led to a highly ambitious
investment target for the plan period.
16.       The basic objectives of the Plan were:  (a) the modernization of
agriculture and livestozk production; (b) a high rate of economic growth
spurred by investments in mining, industry, transportation and communications;
(c) human resources development; and (d) a gradual reduction of regional
disparities in income. Limited absorptive capacity and difficulties in
project preparation caused primarily by manpower constraints in some sectors
have led to large cost overruns and a severe distortion in the structure of
the public investment expenditure during the first three years of the Plan.
In 1980, for example, more than 63 percent of public investment was outside
directly productive sectors. An ex ante evaluation of Niger's five-year plan
(1979-1983), designed urder the basic assumption of a continued rapid growth
of the uranium sector, would have concluded that the emphasis given to invest-
ment in social, economic and administrative infrastructure was justified by
the severe scarcity of this infrastructure which was a constraint to future
economic and social development. However, as the uranium sector did not live
up to expectations and the public investment program continued to be imple-
mented by relying more and more on foreign borrowing the financial situation
of the Covernment has become extremely vulnerable and the accumulated debt
threatens to jeopardize future economic and social development of Niger.
17.       After the deterioration of the financial situation in 1980 and 1981,
the Government was forced to slow down its investment expenditure in 1982 and
is considering the preparation of an interim plan for the next two or three
years aimed at consolidating the economic and financial situation. In April
1982, the 1ead of State informed the people that Niger will have to adjust to
its new financial situation and has called for the definition of a "Consolida-
tion" program aimed at safeguarding the most essential of the investment
program and strengthening the financial situation of the Government.



-5-
Foreign Aid
18.       Official development assistance to Niger more than doubled between
1977 and 1981. Excluding food aid, this assistance increased from about
US$115 million in 1977 to an all time high of US$240 million in 1981. Most of
the aid to Niger is provided by six donors. France and the Federal Republic
of Germany contributions represented more than a third of total aid inflows.
These countries are followed in order of importance by IDA, the F.E.D., Canada
and U.S.A.  Between 1977 and 1981, rural development claimed the largest share
(33 percent) of the total aid, followed by industry and mining (18 percent)
transport and telecommunication (16 percent) and education (11 percent).
Niger's Future Development Prospects
19.       Niger's future economic and social development will be severely
constrained, at least in the medium term, by its underdeveloped humar. re-
sources. A serious effort in the development of human resources will be
needed for a long time to come. Primary eJucation will have to be expanded
as rapidly as feasible until it becomes universal, and professional and
vocational training designed and developed to meet the growing needs of
the Nigerien economy. However, the increasing scarcity of public revenues
will require original solutions to the financing of such human resources
development.
2o.      WIith the continued pessimistic outlook for the uranium sector in
the 1980's, Niger once again will have to rely primarily on its limited
agricultural resources as its leading sector. Hot7ever, the future of its
agriculture is uncertain. Past increases in production were achieved through
more intensive use of better soils and greater use of marginal lands. Con-
tinuation of these practices could severely reduce soil fertility over time.
The maintenance of food self-sufficiency in the eighties and beyond can only
be achievec' through gradual improvements in yields on lands that are already
under cult-Lvation. Civen past low levels of investment in human resources,
the severe financial constraint on their future development and finally the
limit'd state of the existing agricultural technology suited to Niger's
conditions, the needeed improvements will be very difficult to achieve without
a major and continuing support from the international community. Also,
support for greater use of modern agricultural inputs, the development of
small scale irrigation schemes, and applied research will be crucial to the
V         future development of Niger's agriculture.
21.       In short, Niger's future economic and social development could
*         only be achieved through greater efforts in human resources and agricultural
development. In addition to the major constraints enumerated above, Niger
will have to face the problem of re-financing the large foreign debt inherited
during the past few years. The Nigerien authorities are now aware of the need
for adjustments to safeguard Niger's potential economic growth in the future.
However, the necessary adjustments could only be feasible with increased
'oreign technical and financial assistance. Under the growing financial
constraint the Government will be finding it increasingly difficult to meet



- 6 -
counterpart financing commitments and project design will in the future have
to pay even more attention to this constraint. Given a resource situation
with little promise for the next five to ten years, the extremely low level of
development and the largely unmet basic needs of the population, there will be
a need for concessional flows, for local as well as foreign exchange costs.
PART II - WORLD BANK OPERATIONS IN fTIC.ER
22.       Twenty-two IDA credits, including two supplementary credits, have
so far been approved for Niger totalling US$186.6 million.  Annex II contains
a summary statement of these credits as of March 31, 1983 and notes on the
execution of current projects. Bank Group lending has covered transport,
telecommunication, education, rural and industrial development.  Eight credits
have been in the rural sector (drought relief, rural development, forestry,
irrigation and livestock), and five in roads (of which two are ongoing),
mainly aimed at upgrading the main and feeder road networks. Niger's perfor-
mance in project implementation and disbursement has in general been quite
satisfactory particularly in light of the environmental, institutional and
managerial constraints within the country.
23.       Bank Group activities in Niger emphasize macroeconomic dialogue,
technical assistance and institutional development, both separately and in
conjunction with lending. We are at present supporting the Covernment's
economic and financial consolidation effort by means of advice on policy
issues and options. A technical assistance project, currently under pz,para-
tion, is aimed at addressing key elements of short term fiscal improvement as
well as offering longer term assistance to strengthen planning and financial
management. Lending emphasizes productive investment, institutional develop-
ment and effective policy and project implementation. In agriculture, the
severity of natural constraints and the present state of technical knowledge
make development slow and difficult. However, experience with ongoing projects
have demonstrated that potential does exist. Here, Bank Group lending has
supported projects to increase production, gradual development of irrigation
potential, provision of services to pastoralists and crop-livestock integra-
tion. Future lending in the sector will continue these directions, whiln
seeking especially to improve technical packages, lower irrigation costs and
introduce smaller-scale grassroots initiated development projects. Other
sectors that will continue to be the focus of Bank Group operations will be
human resources (health and education), water supply, industry, energy and
transportation. In this latter sector, the emphasis would continue to be on
feeder roads and maintenance.



- 7 -
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
24.       The main modern modes of transportation in Niger are road and air.
The backbone of the road network is the east-west road axis which links the
Mali border to Lake Chad and serves major economic areas and urban centers,
and the north-south axis which links the uranium mining area in the north with
the rest of the country. Distance to ocean ports is considerable and trans-
port costs loom large in external trade flows.  There are three main
import/export outlets: (a) the Nigeria route, 1,450 km from Zinder to Lagos;
(b) the Benin route, 1,100 km from Niamey to Cotonou; and (c) the Togo route,
1,350 km from Niamey to Lome. The bulk of freight traffic goes via Benin.
25.       Air transport in Niger is centered around the international airport
of Niamey, which is the closest to Europe of the Sub-Saharan airports and is
an important transit stop. It generates significant revenues from landing
fees. An IDA credit in 1974 helped finance the modernization and extension of
the airport. There are also four small regional airports at Agadez, Tahoua,
Haradi and Zinder.
B. The Road Transport Sub-Sector
The Network
26.       Niger's classified road network is  8,500 km of which 2,910 km are
paved, 3,130 km are good engineered laterite and the remainder are earth roads
and tracks. There are also some 12,000 km of unclassified earth roads in
agricultural areas and tracks in desert areas not under regular maintenance.
Niger ranks fourth among the six Sahelian countries in terms of total length
of classified roads, but due to the vast desert area it ranks last in terms of
population density (1.5 km/1,000 inhab.) and density of network (6.3 km/l,000
km2). The network is concentrated in the south where most of the population
lives, while the uninhabited areas in the north of the country are only
sparsely served. Niger's terrain is mostly flat or undulating and presents no
major physical barriers to land transport.
Highway Administration
.
27.       The Directorate of Pub'.ic Works (ITP) in the M4inistry of '-ublic
Works and Housing (MITPU) has overall responsibility for the administration,
design, construction and maintenance of the road system. While DTP's overall
staffing situation is adequate, managerial and middle-level staff are limited
in availability, and there are still three expatriate staff in DTP headquarters.
The Government is addressing this problem and, initially, the Third Highways
Project (Credit 612-NIR) financed a training program for DTP personnel.
Experience under that project revealed the need for a continuing training
program, and the proposed project will assist DTP to etablish a training
center (para. 39).



28.       Construction and periodic maintenance of paved roads are carried
out by contract under the supervision of consulting engineers, or of DTP.
Major externally financed construction projects are usually executed by
foreign firms. Routine road maintenance is carried out by DTP's six regional
services supported by headquarters services and the Equipment Department (DM),
which was subs'antially reorganized and reequipped under Cr. 128-NIR in 1968.
Other projects financed by the Association have built up sufficient capacity
for carrying out periodic maintenance on the laterite and feeder road networks,
and for routine maintenance of the paved network. Some sections of the paved
road network, however, have now reached the age where resealing and/or overlay-
ing are required. A program of preventive periodic maintenance for paved
roads would be introduced under the proposed project which would finance most
urgently needed resealing and/or strengthening works on parts of the network.
29.       With increasing emphasis being given to road maintenance (p3ra. 30),
adequate management of maintenance operations has become an increasing concern.
To address this issue, a Road Management Unit would be set up with the help of
the proposed project (para. 3?) to program road maintenance works.
Planning
30.       While the Government's past transport policy was aimed mainly at
upgrading the main east-west road link and at the construction of the north-
south link from the mining areas to the southwest, present objectives are more
diverse. The paved network is sufficient in relation to existing traffic
levels, and further expansion is expected to be limited to the progressive
upgrading of regional roads connecting major agricultural areas to urban
centers. The feeder road network will need to be expanded to better support
the Government's agricultural programs. As noted above, maintenance will take
on increasing importance. Niger has a relatively good record in this area,
but in coming years the needs for road maintenance are expected to rapidly
increase: a large part of the paved network was built in the early 1970's and
is now beginning to deteriorate as a result of aging and increased traffic
volumes--road traffic increased by some 13.5 percent p.a. during the 1970's in
the wake of the uranium boom and accelerating urbanization. As a result
Government policy is increasingly geared to the maintenance factor--present
objectives specify road maintenance as a priority of the country's consolida-
tion program and efforts point to strengthening the national maintenance
capability.
31.       Prior IDA projects have supported this trend and the proposed
project will continue to do so. Of the five previous IDA-financed projects in
the road sector, one (Credit 886-NIR, ongoing) supports and expands the feeder
road network, and one has contributed to the construction of roads to complete
the linking of major urban centers and mining areas to the main paved network
(Credit 55-NIR). Three projects (Credits 128-NIR, 231-NIR, and 612-NIR
ongoing) have supported maintenance and the buildup of a national maintenance
capability. The proposed project would continue this effort in a difficult
economic phase and a period of rapidly escalating maintenance requirements.



The completed projects have been suc-cessfully executed. A combined Project
Performance Audit Report for Credits 128-NIR and 231-NIR was issued in November
1977. It notes that the projects were reasonable successes, and that the
Government's positive attitude contributed significantly to this outcome. The
projects resulted in the improvement of DTP's routine maintenance operations
and in the elimination of a backlog of deferred maintenance. Implementation
of the two ongoing projects (Credit 886-NIR and 612-IIR) has been smooth,
although the regravelling component of the latter project is expected to fall
short of its target because of the difficult fiscal situation of the Govern-
ment. Nonetheless, the overall economic rate of return for that project was
recently estimated at 20 percent, compared to 17 percent estimated at appraisal.
*       The feeder road prcject (886-NIR) is proceeding as planned, and some road
sections have now stood two wet seasons without damage. The institutional
aspect of the project-creation of a feeder roads section in DTP and training
of staff-has been particularly successful.
Financing
32.       Highway expenditures are financed from three sources:  the national
budget provides funds for administration and routine maintenance of national
roads; and National Investment Fund finances minor road improvements and
periodic maintenance works; foreign aid (mainly FAC, FED, USAID and IDA) goes
to new road construction and periodic maintenance. Road expenditures over the
1979-82 period totalled CFAF 53.5 billion (USS157 million), of which CFAF 47
bil'ion (US$138 million) or 79 percent for investment (25 percent of the
investment budget) and the rest for maintenance.
33.       Until 1980 Niger was able to provide adequate funds for road
maintenance. However, since that time funds allocated to- road maintenance
have fallen short of needs, reflecting general fiscal difficulties following
the decline in uranium revenues. The situation will become critical in the
next few years when road maintenance requirements are expected to increase
sharply as a result of the aging of the paved roads built during the 1970s.
It is estimated that road maintenance expenditures will need to rise from the
CFAF 1.8 billion spent in 1982/83 to an average of about $4.4 billion per year
during the 1983/86 period to fully meet maintenance requirements. Following
recent substantial increases in fuel taxes (averaging 80 percent) total
revenues from road user charges are likely to exceed these expenditure levels,
but other budgetary expenditure requirements preclude the Government from
applying all road user revenues to road maintenance. In the future, the
Government intends to maintain road user revenues at a level at least equal to
the total cost of road maintenance (Section 4.05(a) of the Credit Agreement).
*        The proposed project will finance urgently required periodic maintenance of
paved roads, leaving an estimated CFAF 5.7 billion of routine and periodic
maintenance of gravel roads, routine maintenance of paved roads and associated
administrative costs for the period 1983-86 to be financed outside the project.
nnder these circumstances, the Government has agreed to an allocation of CFAF
1.7 billion in its budget for FY83/84, which should be adequate to meet
maintenance requirements for that year. In subsequent years, it would attempt
to maintain this amount, adjusted for inflation, as a minimum allocation.



- 10 -
The feasibility of this objective would be reviewed annually by the Government
and IDA in the light of the financial situation of the country. Likewise, the
highway investment program would be reviewed to ensure that it does not
prejudice the maintenance budget in case of budgetary constraints (Sections
4.05 and 4.06 of the Credit Agreement).
The Road Transport Industry
34.       The growth of mining and continued urbanization have strongly                      u
stimulated the trucking industry. Public freight transport is now handled by
well over 300 transporters, most of them located in Niamey. The largest of
these is the SocietE Nationale des Transports Nigeriens (SNTN), a well
managed and efficient transport company with 49 percent Government ownership.
The company owns a fleet of more than 1,000 units. There is little direct
goverment intervention in road transport operations and official tariffs are
only indicative, except for oil products and goods carried on the Niamey-Benin
route; tariffs for domestic traffic are usually negotiated on a case by case
basis. In 1981, actual tariffs ranged between CFAF 23-34 per ton/km, only
slightly higher than on the coast. Strong competition among truckers and the
absence of a rigid tariff regulation has the benefit that most of the savings
in vehicle operating costs resulting from road improvements are passed on to
producers and consumzenrs.
PART IV - THE. PROJECT
35.       The project w;s prepared during implementation of the Third Highway
Project (Cr. 612-NIR) and was appraised by an IDA mission to Niger in October
1981. Negotiations were held in Washington in April 1983; the Nliger delegation
was led by His Excellency Houmouni Yacouba, Minister of Public Works and
Housing. A report entitled "Niger Fourth Highway Project - Staff Appraisal
Report" No. 4017-NIR is being circulated separately. A Credit and Project
Summary appears at the beginning of this report, and a supplementary project
data sheet is provided in Annex III. The roads involved are shown on tfap
16335.
Project Description
36.    The main objectives of the proposed project are to:  (a) develop a long
term program of preventive periodic maintenance for paved roads, and begin its
implementation; (b) set up a Road tlanagement Unit (RIMT) to monitor and program
road maintenance and investment works; and (c) establish a permanent training
center for DTP employees. To this end, the project would provide for: (a)
strengthening and/or resurfacing of 374 km of the existing bituminous network
including supervision; (b) technical assistance to establish RMU; (c) construc-
tion and equipping of a training school for DTP's employees, and technical
assistance to operate the school over a three-year period; (d) the supply of



- 11 -
traffic counting, pavement roughness measuring and line marking equipment,
road maintenance equipment and spare parts as well as vehicles and other
equipment.
37.       Road Maintenance Program.  The project would help establish pro-
cedures and develop programs to effectively manage the existing paved road
network on the basis of a pavement evaluation and indicative planning exercise
carried out by BCEOM in 1980.  This would be  IIU 's starting point for devel-
oping a long term rolling maintenance program. As part of such a program,
the project would undertake urgently needed strengthening and resealing works
on 374 km of roads as identified during the pavement evaluation exercise.
38.       Road Management Unit.  Forty man-months of technical assistance
would be provided to set up a road management unit and establisb operational
procedures for it. The unit would monitor the road network and program
maintenance and investment works according to traffic demand and road wear.
The RMU would also monitor and manage the nation's bridge resources assuring
their structural integrity and programming their timely maintenance. Oualified
local counterparts would be appointed to the expatriate engineer and technician
to be employed by RMU.
39.       Training.  The proposed project would establish a permanent training
center and provide teaching, office and workshop equipment and furniture,
technical assistance and operating funds for three years of operation of the
center. The project would also provide some earth-moving machinery and
vehicles to the training center. In addition, the Equipment Department would
transfer mobile equipment to the center (Credit Agreement, Section 3.08).
Spare parts to rehabilitate equipment to be transferred will be provided under
the project. The Government has made available a site of 15 ha near Niamey
Airport for the training center. The site is suitable and provides a number
of different rock and soil types, as well as surface drainage features for
training of equipment operators and other civil engineering tradesmen.
40.       DTP, aided by training consultants provided under the Third Highway
Project, has prepared a detailed two-year training program which provides for
courses for about 1,240 students in 23 trades or occupations. The project
would provide approximately 150 man months of technical assistance to set up
and operate the training center over a period of three years, covering the
following posts:  Director of the Training Center, Instructor in Administra-
tion, Instructor in Civil Engineering, Instructor in Mechanical Engineering,
and Instructor in Equipment Use.
41.       Under the training component in the Third Highway Project, a train-
ing expert was provided by the French Bureau Central des Etudes d'Outre-Mer
(BCEOM), who has been responsible for preparation of the training component
of the proposed project and for development of the architect's brief for
construction of the center. Due to BCEOM's close association with the pre-
paration of the training component and the need for continuity between the two



- 12 -
projects, BCEOM will be retained for the provision of technical assistance to
the training center. During the third project, five Nigerien employees of the
Directorate of Public Works have been trained as instructors and it is intended
that they will be the counterparts to the proposed technical assistance
team.
Project Cost and Financing
42.       The total cost of the project including contingencies is estimated
ac USS32.1 million equivalent, or US$24.8 million net of taxes, of which
US$17.8 million (55 percent) represents the estimated foreign cost. A break-
down of project costs is given in the Credit and Project Summary.  Estimates
of the cost of strengthening, resurfacing, building and road construction are
based on the prices taken from recent bids submitted in Niger for similar
work. Operating costs fer the training center have been estimated by BCEOM,
based on costs of training under the Third Highway Project. The cost of
traffic-counting equipment has been obtained by inquiries of potential
suppliers. Supervision of civil works is estimated at 8 percent of the value
of the works supervised; technical assistance costs are based on current
man-month rates in the existing BCEOM contract. The billing rate for technical
assistance is expected to average TISS8,500 equivalent per man-month net of
tax. Of this amount USS2,300 equivalent account for housing and subsistence.
Other costs - local office and local travel expenses, etc. - will average
about USS1,960 equivalent per month. Physical contingencies have been in-
cluded at a rate of 10 percent. Price inflation has been calculated on the
basis of the following annual rates: 1983, 8.0 percent; 1984, 7.5 percent;
1985, 7.0 percent and 6 percent thereafter. The proposed IDA credit of
US$23.6 million equivalent would finance 95 percent of total project cost
net of taxes (100 percent of foreign and 83 percent of local costs). The
Government would finance 5 percent of the net of tax project costs as well
as taxes.
Project Implementation
43.        Responsibility for project implementation would rest with DTP.
Contracts would be supervised by consulting engineers on behalf of DTP's
engineer for new works. The teams responsible for the training center and the
Road Mlanagement Unit will report to the Director of Public Works. The center
would become an integral part of DTP. DTP would assume over-all responsi-
bilitv for the equipment for traffic counting and pavement roughness measure-
ments and the coordination of the related research and studies.
Procurement                                                                                 V
44.       Roa.1 strengthening and resurfacing would be executed through con-
tracts awarded following international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with lUorld Bank guidelines. In the case of the contract for the building of
the training center (USS1.8 million), a local preference of 7-1/2 percent
would apply. Road maintenance equipment not obtained by transfer from DM,
as well as vehicles and workshop equipment (USS66O,OnO) will be purchased



- 13 -
by ICB. Other equipment for the training center and for traffic counting,
pavement marking and roughness measurement (llS$230,000) would be purchased
by local shopping. The services of consultants would be obtained in accord-
ance with IDA Guidelines.
Disbursement
45.       The IDA Credit would be disburseJ as follows:
-    74 percent of total expenditures for road resealing and
strengthening works (US$15,000,000);
-    50 percent of total expenditures for building construction
(US$850,000);
-    100 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local expendi-
tures for equipment and vehicles for the Road Management Unit and
the Training Center (US$900,000);
-    85 percent of total expenditures for technical assistance and
consulting services (US$4,400,000); and
-    unallocated USS2,450,000.
46.       While withdrawal applications have been handled competently in the
past, payments to suppliers have been slow. The Government has therefore
agreed to forward to the Association all requests for withdrawal of funds from
the credit within 45 days, and to make its own payments within 90 days of
receipt of an invoice (Section 4.02 of the Credit Agreement). In order to
ensure speed and flexibility in meeting day-to-day expenses of the training
center, the Covernment will establish, prior to effectiveness, two project
accounts - a project account A of CFAF 9 million and a project account B with
an initial deposit of CFAF 3 million drawn from project account A (Sections
3.02 and 5.01(a),(b), Credit Agreement).
47.       As another condition of credit effectiveness, Government would be
required to show that it has inscribed at least CFAF 1,0C0 million in the
1983/84 budget to meet its contribution to the cost of the first year of the
project (Section 5.01(c) of the Credit Agreement).
Project Benefits and Risks
48.       Resurfacing and strengthening works will further prevent deteriora-
tion of the paved network and reduce vehicle operating costs and postpone
reconstruction. This component has an estimated economic rate of return of
43 percent. Sensitivity tests show that the average rate of return would not
go below 26 percent. A major unquantifiable benefit of the project would be
its institutional impact-strengthening the planning and management capability
of DTP and establishing the training function on a permanent basis. These
would result in better investment programming and would benefit the preparation
and execution of further projects in the sector.



- 14 -
49.       Risk pertains to the provision of adequate budget funds for road
maintenance over and above the periodic maintenance provided under this
project. Annual minimum allocations to maintenance have been agreed upon.
In addition, their feasibi'lity will be reviewed annually with the Government
in the light of its yearly budget situation and constraints. Likewise, the
investment program in the sector will be reviewed with a view tn giving
priority to maintenance over new construction in case of budgetary constraints.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTRORITY
50.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Niger
and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
51.       Special conditions of the project are noted in Section III of Annex III.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECO?IMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
