MEMORANDUM TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Niger
Fourth Hithwav Proiect (Credit 1394-NIR)
Attache' i8 the "Project Completion Report on Niger-- Fourth Highway
Project (Credit 1394-NIR)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office. Part 1I
contains the Borrower's comments. The Credit (SDR21.9 million of June 1983) was
to assist implementation of a road maintenance program and to create a staff
training establishment in the Ministry of Public Works and Urbanism. The project
was identified in December 1977 and became effective in February 1984, more than
six years later. Cofinancing Was not sought and the credit amount was reduced
at the last minute.
The PCR gives a candid, meticulous and elegant account of how the
project unfolded.   Particular attention is focussed on weaknesses of IDA's
performance; specifically in preparation (economic justification and financing
of the Zinder-Agadez Road), and In lack of coordination with other potential
lenders. Apparently, the lessons have been useful in the design of subsequent
projects.
The addition of road works, slow procurement, and local fund
shortages caused delays and the project was completed in June 1991, two and half
years behind schedule. However, all project objectives were fully realized.
Both a road maintenance capacity and a training center were successfully
established. Nevertheless, both institutions have deteriorated due to staff
turnover and insufficient financial support by the Goyernment. Overall, the
project is rated as satisfactory, its sustainability as uncertain, and its
institutional impact as substantial.
No audit is planned.

x.           Ihe lack of cooper-ion among divisions responsible for project doumentauon which was
evident during the preparation of this Project should not be encounted in the future, as the Bank re-

1.    Niger is a landlocked country with a resultant high cost of transport. Most of the population I
cnentated along its soutiern border where the rainfall is generaly sufficit for some agricutural
producton and livestock, although a severe and long drout took place from 1970-75. A uraim boom
started in the mid 1970's but eased during the early 1980's. Uranihm proved windfall reves which
were largely uned over to the Fonds National d'nvesissemet (FNI) for the development of the
agricultural sector, and improvement of basic infastucture and soal development.
2.    While the Govenment's pa  ansport policy was aimed mainly at expanding and upgrading the
major trunk roads in the south of the country, its goas by mid 1970's were broadened. Ihey inced:
(a)    completion of linking the major urbn centes and mining areas to the main paved road
network;
(b)    consolidation of th exitng fce account capability of the Ministre des Travaux Publics
et de l'Urbanisme (MIPU) for the mantena    of the earth roads network;
(c)   esblishment of an adequate capability witin the MTPU for e preparation, suprvision
and execution of periodic maintenance works on the paved road network;
(d)   extension of the feeder roads system in a    where nrul deveopmet projet are being
(e)      nizaon of the fleet of Air Niger, the domestic air line;
(M    deveopment of the training cacity of the  MTPU; and
(g)   support of the development of a local constction industry trugh highway ptojec.

3.    The Bank supported the Govenment In the realization of thes goals. The Third Highway Project
and the Feeder Road Project addressed goals (b), (d), (f) and (g), while the Fourth Highway Ptoject
chiefly addressed goals (c) and (f). As reards (a), Air Niger was eventuaily liquidated under the Public
Enterprise Sector Adjusnt Ptogram.
4.    IDA lending for highways in Niger began over 25 years ago. The First Highway Project
provided for the cxnstucdon of 60 km of lateit roads in grWodu producing areas. Ihe Highway
Mantenance Project provided for a phased re-organzaon of the road maintenan  and equipment
serices, aning and dimination of the bacidog of ddered maintenne. The Second Highway Project
financed the construction of 140 km of roads prqeared under the previous ptojec.
S.    Te Third Highway Projet (Credit612-NIR, US$6million, 1976) with co-fincing from othes,
included equipmet technical assitance and training of to DirAon des Tra=axu Publics (DTP) in the
MTPU for regaveling and routine maintenance; road constuction; and a suvey of the domesti;
consruBon industy. The Feeder Road Project (Crdit 886-NIR, US$10 million 1979) consIed of a
three year program of improvement, consucon a4  sequmnt             of about 1000 miles of
feeder roads. This project included the creation of a feeder road techical secdon in th DTP, as well
as training and technical assistan.

9.    An attWmpt was made in Decembr 1977 to idenfy the Fourth Highway Ptoject but the mission
concluded wiat on-going sudies for taning, maintnance, road works and tranart be completed f-st
bd;oi9 the scope of the prwposed project could be detemined. These studies were being finnced by
other donors aceve in the Nigeren Tasport Sector. As noted in para. 6, ddiond  studies were also
carried out under the Tird Highway Project o prepar oCponets for the next Project.  he most
important study was a survey of the entire network with the peparion of a master plan from which a
proga  of perioc maitnce would be developed. A study of the domesdt construction idustry was
also carried out under the Tlird Highway Project.
10.   The identification mision of May 1980 made good progres in identifying a Fourth Hgway
Project. ITe scope of the project and the related issues were dearly spelled out in a ProJect Brie dated
August 29, 1980. The mission polnted out that prvious projects had concentrated on latedie road
rebilittion and biminou road constucdon, and noted that in the light of trffic gowth I was w
time to plan the approach to periodic     , and upgrding and s trenof the 1800 km
paved networ. To complemntm the pgmam,. the msion al80              posibl tecid a and
fnanWal auistace to the domesdc contcon industy, and a    e  fdft to epand Waining of DTP
personnel Initiad under earlier projects.
11.   In Octobr 1980, a preparon mission fd  tat a first draft of the paved road study had just
been completed but that a contract for the stdy of the domestic consructn industry had only just been
signed. Accding to the pre-p      mission of May 1981, the latter study ro ed massive
ehn    assistanc to a contactor's advisory bureau, and the establishmet of eight new specaized
compani for surface _Qabnnt, emulsion produo  and eartworks. Tli study faied to gal the
conide, and hence ifomain, from the largest  d healthiet privaht conacor in Niger.
Futeme, the Govem    which had been involved in the ownehip of a lag 'Soci  Mixte
company, but had     d     withdrawn, was rductat to discu  the repot or Is policy towards the
domestic constuctio   dusre. In view o£f th Governmens attiud to the study, MDA did noDing
*aru under the Project to assist th loea iWd&y othert   incorrate measur  to eue the
maximum of local co tacr participation'.
12.   The Projec Brif also noted hat in view of t    congestion in urb  areas, and hgher speeds
in rural ae, the  was a nod to esablish a naonal road safty oncil for the education of the
motoring and pedestio public, and to set up a uni within DTIP to be resposible fr line making and

received, the componen would be dropped. The component was presumably dropped as there was no
mention of the safety issue in the SAR.
13.   Tem pre-appraisal mission of October 1981 was designated an appraisa on the Msion's reu
to headquarters becase of the advanced stage of preparation which enabled the staff to proed with the
drafting of a Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). Tbe Issues had been wenl identfied earlier in the Projen
Brief so that the Issues Paper covfred fol w-up matter such as retoactive financing for the proposed
training center to expedite Its completion and thus provide more time for training during project
execution5. The Decision Memorandum noted that Ge ernmiet had just advised M1A that it did not want
WechnicsI assistance CTA) to assist the DTP to stregLs its capability'. Senior Management later made
acceptance of TA by the Governmn a condition for going ahead widi the Project'.
14.   At the Yellow Cover Review stage, Ceral Project staff who had been involved in project
preparation, wte that they fully  ported this exceptionally well prepared and well justified projecL
Niger provides one of the most succwssfil examples of Bank involvement in highway mantenae
instiion building, and tils project si^ould culmiae in a highly professional management systm
fousing on timely preventative maintenanoe with a major expansion of paved road periodic 
activities executed dtrough    ors6.
15.   At the time the project was appraised in> October 1981, the staff xpected to negodate the Credit
In August 1982. HoweveR, negotations were repeatedy postponed to Apri 1983. Four main plem
appear to have accounted for thds delay. First, at th recomm a     of tie Education Division, th
desig of the CPTP was modified to reduce cost and to mae it usable for trainn Goverment peonne
outside of MTPU. Seoondly, the preparation of the Rlo and Reom        of the Psident RP)
was held up for reaons not given in the fles. Thirdly. the amount of the IDA allocation for the project
was reduced ffom US$35 million to US$24 million bwcase of a shortae of DA funds, accorting to
what th Nigeriens were told at the 1983 AnnualMeetoe. Fouthly, there was uncinty a to
whether any co-dont fincing would be vailable which vould of course affect the size of tle Credit,
as well as concen over a slow down in economic acivity IA Ngw and  in Goveament revenues.
Despie last mine effort, MDA was unable to identify a co-donr.

17.             -.  Project execution got off to a fast start because the process of selecting
conraors and consultan to carry out the Project was started during the long delay in negodations.
Thus by the end of 1983, ten4ers bad been ealled for the resurfacing works, and proposs for supervision
of these works bad been received; TOR had been drafted for the RMU consultant and Goverment had
asked for Bank assistance in drawing up a short list of consultans; and the Government was prequalifying
firms to build the CPTP, and had selected training consultants.
18.   By the fail of 1984, resurfacing works were proceeding satisfactorily under competent and tight
control of the consultants, a contract had been signed with a consultant for the RMU and the team
mobilized, and a local contractor had been selected to build the CPTP. By the fall of 1985, the
resurfacing works had been successfully completed and thb remaining works were progressing well. By
the end of 1987, the training center had been completed and training consultants had been fully mobilized.
A year later, the agreed program of planned proventaive periodic maintence had been completed. The
main problems during the later stage of the project was the provision of less then agreed on anmal
allocaions for road maitenance provided by the Government. By mid 1990, the project was noted as
"basicatly completed' but with some minor wo:ks stfill underway. These were completed by mid 1991.
The planned and actua project timetable is shown in Table B of Part m.
19.   PE=        . Procurement under the Project which involved conactng of works and services,
and tie purchase of equipment, was generally satisfactory and in line with Bank guidelines, although it
was slow in the later stages of execution.
20.    Bbu. The estimated and actual dim       shown in Table C (i) in Pan m.
The finul disbuement was made on April 26, 1991, when the Credit was fully disbursed.
Disbursements were roughly on or ahead of schedule during the first 3 yeas of project execution but fell
behind .a the later yeas because of slow proment and the additional works (par 22). The closing
date was xtended twice to June 30, 1991. A problem, still unresolved, is the uncoveed balace in the
specW account wNIch amounts to some CFAF 100 million (about SDR 250,000). ITese finds are frozen

29. The Bank recommended that dhe Government should therefore call a meeting of the donors to
seek their ageemen  to financing a redesigned project and to use evental savings to hep meet the
maintenace bill. The Bank offered to help prepare for such a meeti  and to pardcipat in it. As a
reult of the discussions it was agreed ta i) The President would stop bid evaluation and inform the
donors that alternative designs of the road would be examined; Ui) the  MTPU would undertake a study
of the road with a view to lowering its desip standards, dte Bank would asist the TPU and if
necsary, would fina   the study under the Fourth Highway Project; and fii) when the study was
finished the Govermnment would call a meeting of the donors, in which tho Bank would participat and
discuss the conclusion of the st.Jll.
30.   On January 18, 198S, the European Economic Community (EEC) telexed the Banlk tha after
lengy appraisal and fiacial negotiaions with the European Development Fund (EI)F), the Afican
Development Bank (AfDB) and certain Arab Funds, tedn  arnments had been completed and
works were about to begin. The EEC noted that the Bank's position on the projeca had not been raised
with it, and tha the mater constiued a concret example of the necesity to improve coordination
between the two insttions. In a mendum to the RVP dated Jany 24, 198S, the staf set out the
backgound to the Bank's position. Six different financing agencies had appraised the projecL All agreed
that it was eownomically fasible and loans had been neoited and dped with all six. For everyoe
to admit that ts was a mitae would be difficult. Furthermore, Nigr did not warn to lose the financing
it had secured. Bids had been received for the first lots and they were about 20% below the engines
estmate. The staff pointed out that the trafic figures on which the feasibilit had been based did not
appear credible but that a case could be made for the fist secon from Zinder to Taout
31.   The Bank replied to the EEC on January 2S, that it had Just become aware of the deg standards
of the Zinder-Agadez road as a reut of analysis carried out by a public iwn ezmn review mssion in
October 1984. The situaton posed difficult questions for the Bank, but it de d t  the best thinj to
do was to advise all conerned of its preliminary findings. The review was undetake a part of an
adjustent progrm for Niger, the need for whi drived from    ngng   cirn       .  As a
conseqnce, odwse reviews sometmes i        projects which, while suitable when started, are no
long  consistent with chnged resource availability and priarites. Th  Bank had Immediately informed
the Govrnme of its views, and at a meedng with the Preiden of Niger in December, had agreed tha
Niger would organize a confece of the co-facers fot mutual consuations on the ies conceing
the road.
32.   Despite the aretmet between the Bak and the Government to defer the start of work until a
study was avalble, (para. 29), tb* Govment shorly thereaf  reconsidered its poio_  In late
January 1985 a tntatve agment was reach  In Nmay bewen the Govement and the Bank to
allow the Government to pZoceed with te construcdon of the first se of the Zinder-Aadez road,
as well a t  need to undertake firther studies to establish, firs, the vibi  of any ubsen sections,
and second, the         requirements of the count's totoad netWOk2.
33.   Shody thereatr, the proposed dono  mooetg was canceled foUowing a rues from th donors
to prepare a document on which a meting could be held. During the vist of the RVP, the Govermen

conceded that the Zinder-Agadez road may not be the right thing to do under present eircumsta  of
the country. However, the Government h&d made a strong political com _itmt to the project over the
past few years, and it had s6licited a number of donors to support the project. Now the Govement
found itself in the awkward position of having to go back to tell them that the project Was no longer In
the pipeline. Under the circumstances, it was agreed that the Bank would not object to the construction
of the 140 bn Zinder-Tanout road. Bids for the remaning sections would be called with a disclaimer
that they may not be built. The Government would launch an economic stdy of the Tanout-Agadez
sections. The Bank would prepare the TOR and a short list of consultants. When the study was
completed, the Government and the Bank would seek a common position to present to the donors at a
subsequent donors meeting.
34.   In letters sent out in May 1985, the Bank carefully explained its proposals to the various co-
donors involved in the project. Nevertheless, despite the above agreemet with the Govenment, the
Bank's Resident Mission indicated in a telex dated May 10 tiat the Government was stll committed to
the construction of the whole road. In a later telex dated October 18, 1985 the Mission pointed out that
the Govenmen obviously wanted to construct the whole road and will do everythng to achieve its
objectives. The Mission noted dtt the acrimonious debate over the road would coninue to handicap
progress in preparing the Stuctural Adjustment Credit. The Mission also asked how the Bak could
convince the Government that the road should remain u ished in the midle of the desert, and
wondered if 'we would all look somewhat ludicrous in that sluaton'.
35.   At a meezng of the co-donos in ledda held on November 26-27, 1985, the Bank again raised
its concern over the very low economic rate of reun (ERR) for the Tanout-Agadez section, and that it
could only reach an acceptable level if a new urmnium mine was created. However, dte present market
sihuion did not warrt the opening of a new mine unil 1990. The feasiility of this part of the road
could be re-examined if firm commitments were obtained to expand uraium production. The Bank
therefore suggested that the Arab Funds which were to fince the last section, reallocate their funds
towards the road maint ce program. Nevertheless, the co-doors concluded that they would proceed
with the completion of the project road. Despite this rejection, the Bank efor did lead to some
lowering of desip standards and thus cost savings in constucdng the road as noted below.
36.   The Proces Verba of negotiations fr the Structural Adjustment Credit (December 13-19, 1985)
included a provision for limitng the size of the Zinder-Agadez project, by which te Govermet
committed itself to restrict the width of the road from Tanout to Agadez to 6 m. and t invest no more
than CFAF 12 bilLion over FY86-88. Tle Bank aed that the whole road might evenualy be
constructed and the excess fnding by donors ove cmst of phaus I could be utilized to start constuction
of phas 2, subject to prior constations with those don. By end 1987, all of th road but a 130 km
middle stretch had been completed. In 1988, a donors meeting, which the Bank did not atend, was
convened to secure the complemntay financing required to complete the remaning 70 km of road. The
meedng was succefy concluded. The Bank fount no reason at the time to oppose compleion of his
uneconomic project, sice the remaig unpaved portion was the centr secdon, ths an analysis of
beneficial traffic diversion from altern   Itneraries would have compared most of the beeft
calculated for the whole road againt a low marginal nvtmt. With hihdsWt, the Bank did little more
tman save face under its lending conditionality; once it conceded the principle that Zinder-Agades could
be paved, ullA implementation of the project was inevitable. It might have been better if th Assocdaon

had stayed out of the issue, not only because it harmed relations between the Government and the
Association, but also because it encouraged the Government to pursue similarly uneconomical investments
on the assumption that the Absociation would eventally give in.
37.   Economic Pma        . The Project ro'd consttute the backbone of the national network and
are among the most heavily travelled. The economic evauation at appraisal had anticipated traffic would
continue to grow at a fast pace (in a 5.5 to 8.5% range depending on sections) under the influence of the
uranium boom, contributing to fster deterioration of aging roads. Much greater periodic maintece
was anticipated for which the Project provided fimding. The economic analysis at appraisal found the
threeyear program well justified, with an Economic Rate of Return ( ) of about 43%. Benefit were
to come from reduction of vehicle operating costs and avoidance of costy road reconstruction with the
Project. The economic revaluation was conducted along similar premises by the RMU under IMA
guidance, using this time the HDM IIm model and the road data base developed under the Projec. The
revised ERR of about 32% is lower than the apprai  ERR but still quite ssfctory. The lower
performance may be explained by the lower traffic growth rate (with a few exceptions) reflectig the
sharp economic dowurn of the Nigerien economy from 1984 onward. Comparability of ex-ante and
ex-post ERRs, however, may not be perfect, since different models were used in their cmputation.
Basic assumptions and results are shown in Table G.

39. The files indicate that the issues involving the preparation of the Project were thoroughly
reviewed and the Project was carefully formulated by the project staff. Also efrts were made by the
staff to obtain sound technical advice from Frech Technical istitom    which were closely involved with
the Nigerian highway sub-sector.
40.   Supevsion of the Project by IMA was very thorough. Project staff made ecepdonal effort to
asist the MTPU with advice and assimce on i) the use of the Highway Design Model in the RMUU; ii)
the develpment of the tning center; and iil the operation of te worsops and equipmet
. IDA also provided frequent financial and economic assistance on budgetary manes and
the audits, and in  dting and fnacin additiona road works under the Project which wer cad
out with splus fuds. The staff recommended many changes in project details thou     is life to
ensure that project goals wer achieved.
41.   Project staff frequedy sought the asistan  of he Education Division as regrds the desig of
the tinn center. As this field is ute separ fom civil  in   , the close cooperation between
the Transportation oand Education Divisions is to be commended, although it did coibute to some delay
in prepaing the project (pa   15). Ihe Project demons tha a multi-compoent project can be
su lly excted, if the project is wll prepared, closly moniored by IDA and suevised by
competet consuls.

42.   Tho Projet was idetifiod in October 1979 but not prented until May 1983, a period of about
three and a half yes. The m  taken to ppare the Project was long and IDA's peromance on this
aspect was less than satisfacry. Tbis is particularly so since there was nothng Uns   in the Project
sCOpO which consted of a contnuation of road works, tecncal assistace and training tha had been
initaed under previ   project para. 5). There appears to have been sveral fats contuti   to
the dday. One was the failure to include sufficient funds in the preceding project for the preparation of
a follow-on project. Conversely some of the studies such as for the construcdon idustry, might have
been defered to a follow-on project. Ihere did not seem to be any utgency on this matter as two
domestic finms were already active in the highway field. Tis compont was evenually omitted from
tie Project, probably for that reason.
43.   However, perhaps the most serious cause of the delays was the lack of cooperaton between the
county program and project units of the Bank. The RRP, which was the responsibility of the country
program division, was not prepared in time, and no organized effort had been made to idetify co-donors
with the result was that no co-donors participated in the Projet (par 15). The fies rather vidy reflect
the *ustrations of projec staff with this stae of afir14.
44    Tho repeated delays n negotatons which arose over the design of the CP77, uncainty as to
the amount of the prposed credit and availability of co-financing, and the slow preon of project
documents (pa. 15) ilustate the problems which can aise when responsibflity for project prepartion
is divied among two or mo divisions. This situaon confirms the       of at let one aspet
Of the r   ionof the Banlk caTried out in 1987. One of the purposes of reorganizing dth Bak wa
to place responsibility for project prarion and programming under the dire  control of a single
division, with opeaional responsibiliy delegated to one staff member, the project task manager.
45.   A fina factor in causing processing ddays is tha when project praation tk  seve  yaus,
it is likely to be overake by events. Thus in Niger, chann prorites, th dedine in Goverment
revenus in the early 1980's, and th reducton in fthe siz of th acrt allocation  lasmIinue
chaes in the project spe. Thus a key project component, the Niamey-Say Road, was so suddedy
rmved from the Project, ta there was apparently nD tme to revis the map in the RIP and the SAR
on which this road b cleary shown as part of the Project for upgrding to paved standar.
46.   Accring to the Project Brief dated Novembet 1, 1982, the alocation for the Project was
retuced folowing the IDA reviw, at about the same dme as  g ad were scdieod. lbe cut at

47.   Ihe Ban's beated response to the financig of the Zinder-Apadz Road (pam. 27-36) seems
to indicate a lack of coordinatonwith other donors (para. 43 and 44). Acoording to a notice in the fies
from the OPEC Fund dated Mach 12, 1984, it had signed an agreement with the Govenmet to finance
the southem part of the Zinder-Agadez road and th Government's inteti  to complee the road was
clear. Thus, project prepration had been underway for some time. In view of the urgen need for co-
donor hands for the Project, the unavafilabsity of which resulted in a cutback in its scope jut before
negotias, it would appear    the Association had not made a concerte efort to aVoach the donor
community, and in fact it did not seem to be awa  of the significance of the proposed foreign fiacn
by four other donors of such a larp and uneconomic project as the Zinder-Agadez road. To be fair, at
the me the Project was being prepared, the Govment's budgetary problem  were only just surfacing.

48.   Overall, the Borrower pefored well In excufting tie civil wors under the Project. As noted
(para. 19), procurement was handled in a generaly satisto  manner, however, because of severe
budgetary constraints, the Government was frequenly in arreas in paying conracts and consultants
the local curency component, especially in the later years of project execution.   efaill operation of
the traning center was considerably delayed becau of the Govarmens failure to legslate the necessary
statut which woudd pvide fhndig for supplies and staff (para. 25). Cosiderable pressure had to be
mntained on the Govement by IDA to carry out audits of the project accounts as called for under the
Credit agreement.  his led to supesion of the use of St_ateet of Expenditure (SOE) procedur  firom
September 1990 until February 1991. However, once received, the audits indcated tha procedures ad
control were geneally adequat. The late audit report did point out ta financial collapse of a
Governme  owned Developmet Bank, whee a specia  account had ben opened a May 1987 to
fcltate projdct execution, resulted in frozen deposits esmated at CFAP 118 millin equivalnt wih no
immediate prospect of reovery. At the beginning of the Project, the Goverment wa unwilling to grant
I ta-free status. Laer, however, the Govenment revised its posion and confrred ta-fr  status on
the Project whh necessited some revisions in the proportions of the work financed by IDA.

In the raionhip occurd over the Issu of the Zdr-Agadz road on which donor hiading agreem
had been signed and the Govemen was about to stat work, when IDA questioned its economic
jusification. While th Assocation was obviousy right in ralsing the    , its ming could not have
been worse. Th Govemens prestg was on the line over this rgion  projoct, to which It was
heavily ommitted boti dometcaly and abroad.
50.   Despite a major effort Involving top Bank and Govement officials, IDA was not able to
persuade the Govenmen to revise its poson. It would appea t  IDA was most belated in raidsg
the issue at a dme when i was almost imposle fr the Gov   _ to gracuy wihdraw. IDA's
failure to take up this mat  at an earlIer stae when It would have beenmuch easier to itvene, must
be noted as a blunder, as was its doggd pursuit of the issue when k wa obvioudy a lost camus.
Incentaly, the Associaton seemed to ignore the advice of its Resident Mision which rpeatodly tried

54.   As most of tie scheduled actions could be exeued at costs lower dm foecast, due i pardtdar
to the appreciation of the US Dollar agais the local currey, a decidson was made to use the credi

Authorities in chae of the road network to select a priority    progm. Above all, IDA's
