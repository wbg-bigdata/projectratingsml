IENORANDIM AND FECOHHENDUION OF TUE PR$SIDENT OF TER
INTEUNATIONAL BANR FOR RRCONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TEM EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA FOR A
NATIONAL SEED AND QUARANTINE PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$14 million is submitted for
approval. The loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace,
at standard variable interest rate. The loan is to strengthen the seed
sub-sector and the Plant Quarantine Service.
2.        Background.  Reliable provision of good quality seed of improved
varieties is crucial for continued growth of Nigerian agriculture. The
Government in 1975 established the National Seed Service (NSS) which has
made some progress in producing improved seed. Other agencies involvee in
seed production include the Bank financed Agricultural Development Projects
(ADPs), State Seed Multiplication Units (SSMUs) and some private companies.
The current total production of such commercial seed of different crops
from public sector agencies is estimated to be about 13,500 tons, enough to
plant only a small proportion of total cultivated area ranging between 0.1X
(millet) to 5S (rice). The private sector, which concentrates on the much
more profitable hybrid maize seed, produces about 1,200 tons per annum,
enough to plant about 32 of the maize area. Thus, substantial increases
over present level of use can be foreseen if the quality of seed and
appropriateness of variety could be improved.
3.        Recent research in Nigeria has led to the release of improved
varieties of several crops, e.g. maize, rice, soybean, cassava. However,
Nigeria is unable to fully benefit from these developments as the many
public sector agencies involved in seed related activities, operate without
a clearly defined strategy or coordination; the relative roles are poorly
defined; and key operations suffer from inadequate funding. The pricing
policies of these agencies are not conducive to the growth of the private
sector. Legal framework, mechanisms for quality improvement and
certification are not in place, resulting in production of poor quality
seed at all stages of multiplication.
4.        The Plant Quarantine Service (PQS) of Nigeria has the responsi-
bility to minimize the risk of inadvertent introduction of pests and
pathogens; provide seed health inspection service and assist to meet
quarantine requirements of importing countries. However, due to weak
organization and management, lack of well-trained experienced staff, and
inadequate and erratic funding by the Government, this service is run-down
and unable to perform the key functions adequately.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The seed industry in Nigeria
is at a critical stage. The publ'c sector agencies require a clear
articulation of their long-term roles and responsibilities and the private
seed sector needs a favorable institutional and policy environment for
future growth. The Bank's support would help to achieve these changes.
Similarly, Bank's assistance would rationalize PQS activities and reorient



resources on areas presenting the highest risks in a reliable and timely
fashion.
6.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project aims to increase the
availability of quality seed of appropriate varieties through policy reform
including market oriented pricing of seed, seed legislation, and effective
certification and quality control arrangements. It would rationalize the
roles of seed industry institutions and encourage greater private sector
participation. The PQS would be strengthened and its work programs
prioritized to enable it to effectively provide essential services.
7.        Proiect Description.  The organization and management of the
seed industry would be improved through:  (i) defining the medium-term seed
sector policy framework; (ii) enactment of seed legislation; (iii)
establishment of a National Seed Council (NSC); (iv) rationalization of
roles and responsibilities of NSS, ADPs, and Farmers' Agricultural Supply
Companies (PASCOMs) aimed at minimizing their direct involvement in seed
production and distribution, and introduction of sound commercial practices
including cost recovery; the emphasis of NSS's role would be on the
promotion of the seed sub-sector, provision of technical support to ensure
adoption of improved seed by farmers, coordination of breeder and
foundation seed supply, seed certification, seed quality control, and human
resource development for the seed industry; (v) encouragement of the
private sector participation through policy changes, access for private
seed enterprises to breeder and foundation seed of publicly bred varieties,
freedom to develop their own research capability, freedom to sell
truthfully labelled seed and assistanc3 to a few "pioneer" seed
entrepreneurs in establishing small-scale seed enterprises and supporting
others in preparing proposals for possible financing by lending
institutions. The project also provides for the: (i) upgrading and
rehabilitation of facilities for the most vital stages of breeder and
foundation seed production processing and storage; and (ii) technical
assistance in policy formulation, and seed industry development. In the
case of PQS, changes in organization and management would be introduced and
its activities would be focussed on areas presenting the highest risks.
This would require selective upgrading of facilities for pre- and post-
entry quarantine operations. The technical know-how and management
capability of the PQS staff would be enhanced through training and
technical assistance. The project would strengthen export inspection and
certification services provided by PQS to facilitate international
acceptance of Nigeria's current and future agricultural exports.
8.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$20.6 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$11.5 million (56? of
total cost). A breakdown of costs and financing are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. Three maps of Nigeria are also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7763-UNI, dated October 23, 1989, is being
distributed separately.

9.        Actions.  At negotiations IBRD obtained assurances from FGN
thats (i) By December 31, 1992, all foundation seed handled by the NSS
would be produced through contracts with private seed growers and seed
farms owned by NSS would be phased outt (ii) By January 31, 1993, the
feasibility of making Seed Production Section of NSS, a fully autonomous
operation vith private sector participation would be investigated; (iii)
Private sector seed enterprises would have access to breeder and foundation
seed of publicly bred varieties and would be free to import seed for use in
the development of new varieties and/or seed production; (iv) Criteria for
selection of up to 10 'pioneer* private small-scale seed enterprises to be
assisted under the project would be developed by the NSS, and agreed with
the Bank; this assistance, to be paid back in full by the participants,
would not be in the nature of a credit component, and funds recovered from
investors would be utilized for promoting the seed industry; (v) By
September 30, 1993, a fully autonomous seed certification service would be
established; (vi) Working capital to finance breeder and foundation seed
operations and reserve stock funds would be maintained in two separate bank
accounts to be administered by NSS; (vii) Introduction of the second and
third stages of the pricing policy for foundation and certified seed would
be implemented by the public sector agencies by December 31, 1991 and
December 31, 1992 respectively; and (viii) The second and third stage
increases in the seed certification charges would be implemented by
December 31, 1992 and December 31, 1995, respectively. Conditions of Loan
Effectiveness would be: (i) PQS would review and rationalize the number of
sapport staff to be consistent with the workload of the service and
prepare a staff development plan to update technical qualification of staff
involved in enforcement of quarantine regulations; (ii) FMG would pay one
half of their first year's contribution in advance into the respective
accounts of the NSS and the PQS; (iii) The first stage of the pricing
policy for seed handled by the public sector agencies would be implemented
to recover seed procurement prices paid to contract growers and the
processing costs incurred by the participating public sector agencies; (iv)
The first stage of certification charges would be introduced to recover at
least 25S of direct operational costs of providing this service; and (v)
Separate special bank accounts would be operated for revenues from seed
certification services, foundation seed sales and quarantine services.
Additionally, some of the coiditions of disbursement would be:  (i) against
the research category, the NSS and the National Root Crops Research
Institute would enter into an agreement with a suitably qualified
institution for the development of rapid seed yam multipication techniques;
(ii) against PQS Stage II category, PQS would enter into arrangements with
reputable Nigerian and/or foreign organizations to permit them to test and.
screen certain categories of imported materials for diseases, pests and
weeds subject to PQS standards and monitoring before commencing the second
stage rehabilitation of the Pre-entry Technical Support Services; and viii)
against PQS Stage II, the performance and volume of work undertaken by the
first set of Pre-entry Inspection Station and Export Certification Units
would be reviewed after they have been in operation for at least one year,
before establishing additional Centers/Units during the second stage
rehabilitation of the Port Inspectorate Services.
10.       Proiect Benefits.  The project would enhance the role of the
public sector in providing technical support and undertaking regulatory



-4-
functions. It would also result in increased participatior by the private
sector in seed production and marketing. The introduction of cost-
efficient seed pricing and management practices by tl,e public sector
agencies would reduce dependence on Government subventione. Availability
of good quality seed would result in increased crop production. especially
by saml1holders.  The main benefits of the PQS component would be to
minim-.ze potential threat to Nigerian agriculture from inadvertently
introduced pests, diseases and noxious weeds; enhanced support to crop
improvement and breeding programs through timely and speedy c-arance of
exotic germplasm; s-'pport to the emerging seed industry by fa litating the
Importation of seed% of improved varieties for local selection and
adaptation; and assistance to exporters of agricultural produce in meeting
the phytosanitary requirements of importing countries.
11.        i_sks. A delay in implementation of policy-related actions for
the seed component could reduce the effectiveness of the much needed
coordination between Research Institutes, NSS, ADPs and PASCOMs and also
inhibit a strong response from the private sector. This risk is notable by
the need for coordinated action in major seed producing states to sustain
the new policy framework.  The Government's commitment to speedy
implementation of policy changes and need for effective coordination would
be reinforced through the creation of the National Seed Council (NSC) and
adoption of the seed sector policy statement. In parallel, during the
preparation phase, the NSS has developed a broad consensus behind the
policy reforms and this process is to be continued through the proposed
national workshops and the activities of the NSC. In-addition, the Bank's
own agreements with the individual states also reflect these policy
objectives. To minimize funding constraints, the Bank's disbursements are
being focussed on the crucial operations of breeder and foundation seed
production. Furthermore, to enhance the medium-term sustainability of the
ISS. it is proposed that operational expenses be recovered through
introduction of user fees.
12.       The main risk with the quarantine component is the unprepared-
ness of the PQS staff to effectively manage a service based on the concept
of biological risk assessment. This risk would be minimized by
comprehensive in-country and overseas training program for PQS staff. The
technical assistance support to PQS would help build up management capacity
and update operational procedures.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
