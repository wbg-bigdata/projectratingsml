3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The original objective of the US$1.5 million project was to assist Kosovo in developing: (i) capacity for a
commercially sustainable exchange of power with the regional system, and optimizing utilization of
existing generation capacity through economic dispatch; and (ii) a framework for attracting private sector
investment in the energy sector.

The project forms a part of the series of technical assistance (ESTAP-I and II completed, and ESTAP-III
ongoing) supported by the Bank in Kosovo. This series reflects the basic understandings reached in 1999
with donors asking the Bank to focus on long-term strategy for the development of the energy sector,
thereby complementing donors' assistance for reconstruction and rehabilitation of energy sector
infrastructure. The ESTAP-I focused on diagnosis of the sectoral issues and opportunities, identified
Kosovo's integration with the Southeast Europe region as a strategic initiative and helped the authorities to
develop a strategy for Kosovo's energy sector. The ESTAP-II was thus designed to initiate actions towards
Kosovo's entry into the evolving Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE) and attracting private
sector investment into its energy sector. The ESTAP-II paved the way for both the ongoing ESTAP-III for
institutional and capacity building in the energy and mining sector as well as the proposed Lignite Power
Technical Assistance Project for facilitating private sector investments into lignite mining and power
generation.

The objective was clearly stated, well defined, important to the country's economic development, and
realistic in scale and scope. It was also timely, appropriate, and responsive to the needs of the Borrower,
especially considering that the electricity, lignite and district heating sectors had suffered from conflict
damage, loss of mobile equipment, and lack of maintenance and poor management dating back to before the
conflict of 1998-99. Whereas other donor assistance consisted of mostly physical investments, the project
took a broader view over a longer timeframe meant to provide good orientation in the energy sector and
also to address the issue of lack of information for decision making. The project also aimed to help Kosovo
integrate well into the regional market agenda driven by the ECSEE.

The project was consistent with the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for Kosovo (R99-178)
which was endorsed by the Executive Directors on October 7, 1999, and the TSS (R 24275-KOS) which
was endorsed by the Executive Directors on July 25, 2002. The overall objective was to support
sustainability of the reconstruction and recovery program. The Bank aimed to maximize the impact of the
limited resources it could make available, by selective use of grant funds to focus on poverty alleviation
and limited budget support, and an extensive program of analytical work. The Bank would continue its
donor coordination role. The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) had
asked the Bank to assist in putting the energy sector on a sustainable path.

The project design was fairly straightforward, and the activities and their projected execution were clearly
defined. It envisioned that Kosovo would benefit from this assistance in four ways: (i) detailed feasibility
report for the proposed transmission interconnection would help it to prepare a bankable project and seek
financing for this investment and strengthen further evolution of regional electricity market; (ii) study of the
terms of the electricity exchange would help Kosovo to prepare for future negotiations and thereby
contribute to reducing the costs to Kosovo of the power exchange; (iii) preparation of a project report for a
dispatch center would help to mobilize financing for this critical investment required to optimize utilization
of its generating capacity and management of its system; and (iv) assist in creating an enabling environment
for attracting private sector investments.

3.2 Revised Objective:
Not applicable

3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of the following three components identified on the basis of the results of ESTAP-I
Energy Sector Study (December, 2002) and discussions with the Recipient. The components were related
to achieving the project's objective.

Component I. Regional Interconnection Component (US$0.85 million)

The feasibility study report to be prepared under this component consisted of two phases:

First phase: technical and economic comparison of all proposed interconnection alternatives and
recommendations for the decision making authorities in Kosovo and Albania regarding the selection of the
preferred variant of 400 kV interconnection line.

Second phase: the full feasibility study including: (a) determination of potential energy exchanges between
Kosovo and Albania; (b) the line impact in improving energy exchange capabilities in Southeast Europe
(SEE); (c) functional/preliminary design and engineering of the line and substations; (d) detailed quantity
and cost estimate; (e) economic and financial analysis of the project; (f) detailed implementation strategy
for interconnection and sample agreements for construction and operation; (g) preparation of the
topographic survey and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports; and (h) providing to the Power
Company of Kosovo (KEK) the software used and training in its use.

Component II. Dispatch Center (US$0.25 million)

This component was aimed at developing documentation to establish a new dispatch center, Kosovo
Control System (KCS), with a wide range of modern SCADA/EMS facilities, plus an Emergency Kosovo
Control System (EKCS). The main documents to be prepared by the consultant included: (a)
Supplementary Feasibility Study; (b) Technical Bid Documents; and (c) an EIA.

The principal driving factors for establishing a KCS were: (a) the need for KEK to be able to manage its
high voltage power network and to dispatch generation in real-time; (ii) UNMIK's commitment for KEK to
become a full member of the Union for Coordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) Synchronous
Zone; and (c) UNMIK's commitment to establish a Transmission System Operator (TSO) for the KEK
power system.

Component III. Private Sector Participation Policy (US$0.35 million)

The main task of the consultants was to review the existing policy, legislative, regulatory, and institutional
framework governing private investment in Kosovo with the aim of identifying bottlenecks from the
perspective of foreign private investment in the energy sector, suggest alternatives and recommended
actions to address the issues identified through the review.

3.4 Revised Components:
Not Applicable

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) reviewed the project for quality at entry and rated it highly



                                                      - 3 -

satisfactory. The ICR deems the project as well conceived. As mentioned in the earlier section, the project
objective was consistent with the TSS for Kosovo, and met the critical needs of the country's energy sector.
Since UNMIK had the administrative capacity, the quality of project design was adequate to meet the
project's overriding objective. During preparation of the project, major risk factors and lessons learned
from the Bank's other technical assistance projects were considered and incorporated into the project
design. The project design envisioned extensive participation of key stakeholders, such as the UNMIK
(Energy Office in particular), Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), and KEK, and they all participated in the
project preparation. Assurance was given to UNMIK and the Provisional Institutions of Self Government
(PISG) by the Government of Albania concerning its participation and support in carrying out the
feasibility study for the transmission line.

During project preparation, the following alternative project designs were considered:

· One of the alternatives for use of the proposed Grant was to finance physical rehabilitation but this
option was rejected since the available money (US$ 1.5 million) was too small relative to the total
requirements to have much of an impact.

· Several areas such as energy policy, taxation on oil and gas (which is leading to distortion in fuel choices
for heating), sector restructuring, preparation of a distribution master plan, power plant efficiency, energy
savings in district heating, rehabilitation of coal mines and reclamation of dump areas of mines, plan for
fighting coal mine fire, renewable energy potential, were considered as candidates for technical assistance.
However to get the "biggest impact of the development dollars" technical assistance was focused on
optimization of resources on a regional basis. A 400 kV interconnection between Kosovo and Albania
would not only benefit these two systems but also strengthen the regional electricity market. Therefore the
choice was for a technical assistance program that would help create necessary technical, commercial, and
institutional capacity in the utility to foster evolution of the regional electricity market and help optimize
utilization of resources available to the constituent systems of the region.

· The recommended option was to provide technical assistance to prepare a detailed feasibility report for a
400 kV interconnection between Kosovo and Albania; develop optimal terms of power trading with
neighboring systems; establish a dispatch center in Kosovo; and assist in preparing a framework for
attracting private investment.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Satisfactory. The outcome of the project objective is satisfactory, as demonstrated by the following:

Component I: Feasibility Study for the Kosovo B (Kosovo) - Kashar (Albania) 400 KV Regional
Transmission Interconnection

Simulations of different scenarios of annual operation of Kosovo and Albanian power system were
performed based on the forecast generation patterns, load conditions, and transmission system
configuration for the period 2010-2020. The main conclusion of the simulations was that joint operation
would enable both power systems to lower their annual generation costs over the study period. Without the
new 400 kV interconnection line, the transmission network would be unable to achieve the technical
requirements (transfer capabilities) in order to realize the expected economic energy exchanges (and
benefits) between the Kosovo and Albania power systems.




                                                        - 4 -

Analysis of the adequacy of the composite interconnected transmission system showed that: (i) the new
interconnection line would enhance the reliability of the regional interconnected system (neighboring
countries), thereby reinforcing the regional networks; (ii) there would be additional benefits in terms of
significant reduction of expected transmission losses and increase of electricity wheeling along the study
period not only for Kosovo and Albanian power systems, but for the entire SEE region; and (iii) due to
introduction of the new line, it would be possible to mitigate some congestion problems on the regional
interconnected transmission system.

Component II: Detailed Project Report for a Dispatch Center

The consultant reviewed the condition and suitability for possible reuse of KEK's installed SCADA system
and concluded that no equipment could be economically reused. The main subsystems that will be required
for the development of the KCS include: (i) Control centre hardware and software; (ii) Remote Terminal
Units (RTUs) and associated Substation Adaptation Works in high voltage substations and major
generating plants; (iii) A multipurpose telecommunications network; (iv) Standby power supplies in
substations and in the control centre. An Emergency Kosovo Control System is also envisaged.

The consultant also provided details on costing and organization, which were helpful in complementing the
work on KEK restructuring, especially with respect to setting up of an independent TSO.

Component III: Private Investment Framework for the Energy Sector

The consultant identified, and made recommendations to manage the key risks associated with different
forms of private sector participation in Kosovo's energy sector. The consultant also identified the changes
and additions required in respect of specific policy, legal, regulatory and institutional issues relating to
Kosovo's energy sector. This was followed by a set of proposals (including drafting instructions) intended
to assist Kosovo to strengthen its legal, regulatory and institutional framework so as to increase private
sector participation in the energy sector.

To anchor the discussions arising from the analysis, the consultant used, for illustrative purposes,
UNMIK's plans for the construction of a new lignite mine mouth power plant in Kosovo within the next
five years (the "proposed lignite power project"). The consultant prepared a draft conceptual timeline for
key steps for the proposed lignite power project, along with an initial list of the project documents and other
instruments that will be required for implementation. Most of the recommendations, however, are relevant
to foreign investment in any sector in Kosovo.

The sector work undertaken by the consultant was only diagnostic. Further specific work on the
implementation of the consultant's recommendations is to be taken up under the proposed Lignite Power
Technical Assistance Project.

(iii)    Environmental Impact Assessment Report

The Supplementary Feasibility Study and the Environmental Impact Assessment carried out by the
consultant were satisfactory. The Technical Bid Documents would need to be updated to include
requirements of transmission grid codes and new market rules which are currently being developed by the
TSO.

Component III: Private Investment Framework for the Energy Sector

The consultants prepared a satisfactory report on the assessment of the Policy, Legal, Regulatory and
Institutional Frameworks and recommendation for improving them for Private Sector Participation in the
Energy Sector in Kosovo.

Based on the outcome and benefits of the above studies and reports as explained in Section 4.1, the
achievements of all the components are thus rated Satisfactory.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not applicable

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Substantial. The project contributed to substantial institutional development impact.

    l The components I and II on regional interconnection and dispatch center contributed to the
         restructuring of KEK, especially in the establishment of the TSO. TSO capacity building is
         continuing under the ESTAP-III with EAR support.
    l The component III on the review of policy, legal and regulatory frameworks enabled the MEM,
         KTA, ERO and ICMM to clarify their roles and responsibilities for attracting private sector and
         identified the areas for further institutional development, part of which are ongoing under
         ESTAP-III and some will be taken up further under the proposed Lignite Power Technical
         Assistance Project.
    l The project, besides bringing together UNMIK/KTA, MEM, ERO and ICMM to coordinate
         efforts on strengthening the energy sector, helped MEM in dealing with sector and policy issues,
         which was borne out in MEM's efforts at finalizing the energy sector strategy during 2004-05.
         Several KEK counterpart experts involved in the studies opted to join MEM when it was formed in
         2004, which has been beneficial.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome



                                                        - 6 -

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
(i) Loss of energy sector data. A major handicap faced by the consultants was that, most of the energy
sector data for Kosovo was lost during the war. One of the accomplishments of the project was to retrieve
and reassemble the historical data, and present them in an orderly way.

(ii) Delay in reaching consensus among Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro and Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW) regarding the feasibility study for the transmission line delayed the project
implementation. The delay of about one year in the engagement of consultants for the feasibility study was
due to: (a) difference of opinion among these countries on line routing; and (b) an additional review of the
alternatives routes (triggered by a revised study of 400 kV transmission interconnection between
Albania-Montenegro). Finally the Bank and UNMIK had to intervene to help consensus building in this
regard.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Unstinted support from UNMIK in pushing the agenda for long-term energy sector strategies, as well as in
resolving differences among Kosovo, Albania, Montenegro and KfW regarding the feasibility study on
transmission line, played a major role in the successful outcome of the project.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Not applicable

5.4 Costs and financing:
The actual total project cost was US$1.4 million, compared to the estimated cost of US$1.5 million
envisaged in the PAD. The lower cost was due to fluctuation in the exchange rate between Euro and US$.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
    l The government has established a Transmission System Operator (TSO) as a subsidiary to KEK
         initially, which will be made independent eventually. KEK and the TSO are exploring financing for
         the new transmission interconnection between Kosovo and Albania and the development of the
         Kosovo Network Control System whose feasibility studies and bidding documents were prepared
         by Components I and II of this project.

    l The Bank's follow on TA Project (ESTAP-III) is pursuing institutional building for the TSO
         through the development of grid code and transmission policy, and for the Energy Regulatory
         Office through tariff framework development.

    l The review of the policy, legal, regulatory and institutional framework for private sector
         participation in Kosovo's energy sector was reflected in the energy sector strategy finalized in
         2005. This has provided the impetus for long-term development of the sector.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
See Section 6.1.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Satisfactory. The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was
satisfactory. The identification process focused on critical gaps and opportunities for interventions in the



                                                     - 7 -

energy sector of Kosovo. The project design was consistent with the Borrower's development priorities and
the TSS. During appraisal, the Bank assessed the project's risks and benefits. The Bank had a consistently
good working relationship with the Borrower during preparation and appraisal. The Bank also promoted
extensive participation of key stakeholders during this period and the project team payed a key role in
facilitating coordination of the sector with other donors. In addition, the Bank also took into account all
major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic and institutional, including procurement and
financial management.

7.2 Supervision:
Satisfactory. The performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory. Sufficient
budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately supervised and closely
monitored. Review teams included task team leader, social scientist, mining specialist, energy legal counsel
and power engineer. Back-to-Office Reports were regularly prepared and transmitted. The Project Status
Reports (PSRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of achievement of
development objective and project implementation. The Bank paid sufficient attention to the project's likely
development impact. The quality of advice, and the follow-up on agreed actions were of a high standard.

The Bank's relationship with the Borrower, UNMIK, PISG, KTA, KEK, European Agency for
Reconstruction (EAR), KfW and consultants was very cordial and productive. The staff worked closely
with them, and took a consultative and participatory approach on all its activities, especially on reviewing
and commenting on the studies. It conducted joint meetings with the donors and clients, which helped in
mobilizing support for smooth implementation. The Bank made it a point to update even those donors who
were not working directly on the sector.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Satisfactory. Overall, the Bank performance was satisfactory during project preparation, appraisal and
implementation.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Since Kosovo is not yet a member of the World Bank, the UNMIK remains the official and legal
counterpart for channeling Bank funds for developmental activities in Kosovo, which are provided on
grant basis. Implementation responsibitiy is shared betweek UNMIK agencies (e.g. KTA) and the PISG
(e.g. MEM). The reference to borrower is thus made to both UNMIK and PISG as applicable.

Satisfactory. The UNMIK's performance in the preparation of the project was satisfactory. The UNMIK
displayed the required level of commitment to the objective of the project and adequately covered all major
aspects, including stakeholder commitment. The staff of UNMIK worked closely with the Bank's project
team with full cooperation and commitment.

UNMIK, KTA, Supervisory Board and the senior management of KEK were fully involved in the
finalization, and presentation to the civic society and to the donor community, of the findings and the
recommendations of the consultants engaged for the energy sector study. A "Green Paper", which was a
precursor to the energy strategy and policy note was issued for public consultation.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Satisfactory. The government's (KTA, but also MEM from 2004 onwards) implementation performance
was satisfactory. They consistently maintained their commitment throughout the implementation even
under a complex political environment. They were very responsive and proactive to follow-up on the



                                                      - 8 -

recommendations of the studies and implement them. In particular, after the creation of the Ministry of
Energy and Mining in 2004, the government performance and coordination among UNMIK and PISG
agencies involved in project implementation improved significantly. UNMIK and PISG coordinated very
well to overcome difficult political and technical issues that emerged in the selection of alternatives for
transmission interconnection between Kosovo-Albania-Montenegro.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Satisfactory. The performance of KTA was satisfactory. It was responsible for the selection of the
consultants in accordance with the Bank guidelines, supervision of their work, evaluation of results of the
technical assistance, disbursements and preparation of follow-up actions. It provided proactive follow-up
to mitigate implementation bottlenecks. It was well organized and effective in dealing with procurement,
disbursement, progress reports, and in maintaining proper records of the project. MEM, which played a
substantive role in the implementation of the project, worked closely with KTA. It was also receptive to the
Bank's advice, and collaborated well with the Bank and the donors with respect to meeting deadlines.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory. The overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

        l While carrying out studies of this kind, it is important to have a realistic timeframe for
             reviewing the numerous draft reports; back and forth exchange of views among the
             consultants, the Bank, and the Borrower; and for incorporating the comments.

        l Regular consultation with the donors, participation of all donor agencies right from the early
             stages of project preparation, and establishing coordination mechanism are essential for the
             successful implementation of a project in Kosovo.

        l It is important for the Bank to mobilize the required inter-disciplinary skills. For example, the
             involvement of the Bank's mining specialists in the project was useful in resolving mining
             issues and also in developing the framework for private sector participation.

        l In post-conflict situations such as in Kosovo, it is essential to focus more on capacity building,
             right from the beginning of the project.
