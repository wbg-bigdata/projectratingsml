MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A PROVINCIAL HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$101.4 million to help finance a project aimed at rationalizing
health sector spending and improving the efficiency of health care delivery through transforming hospitals
into autonomous entities in the public sector. The proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard interest
rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace.
2.    Background. In 1989, Argentina embarked on an ambitious structural reform program to reverse a
long period of economic stagnation. The program, which has been remarkable both in its scope and its
implementation speed, has improved tax structure and administration, privatized public enterprises, reformed
public administration, and reduced public employment. These measures, together with trade liberalization
and a fixed exchange rate, have created a solid base for development. Sustaining growth and extending its
benefits, however, will require consolidation of macroeconomics reforms and greater emphasis on human
resource development. Since reform in the social sectors has lagged behind economic adjustment, the poor
have suffered disproportionately from the country's past disarray. Health indicators are less satisfactory
than the spending levels would predict. With per capita outlays for health services above US$400 ( i.e.,
health spending is rapidly approaching 10 percent of GDP), expenditures are well above those of middle-
income countries such as Chile (US$250) and Costa Rica (US$160). Yet, both these countries have infant
mortality rates--16 and 14 per 1,000 live births, respectively-lower than Argentina's 25 per 1,000.
Furthermore, a prolonged period of declining fertility and increased life expectancy has resulted in an aging
population, associated with a higher prevalence of chronic and degenerative diseases, such as vascular
diseases, cancer, and traumas, which already account for 63 percent of all deaths. The transitional
epidemiological profile (i.e., high incidence of infectious diseases and increased prevalence of chronic
diseases) magnifies the level and complexity of future demands on the system.
3.    The structure of the health finance and delivery systems reflects the complexity of the federal
structure and the historic presence of unions in the management of welfare programs. The three sub-sectors-
-public, quasi-public health insurance funds and private-constitute an intricate structure. The public sector
accounts for about one-third of sector financing and 60 percent of the sector's installed capacity, and covers
the uninsured and under-insured (i.e., 32 percent of the total population). Over the past decade, most public
facilities have been decentralized to the provinces and municipalities. The federal Ministry of Health and
Social Action (MSAS) remains, in theory, the policy-making, normative and regulatory authority. However,
there is no clear-cut division of authority between the MSAS, provincial health ministries (MSPs) and
municipal authorities. This results in complicated administrative and budget structures and weak policy-
making. Furthermore, most public hospitals are old and inadequately maintained, have obsolete equipment,
and are poorly managed. Internal inefficiencies are amplified by the lack of decision-making capacity and
poor accountability of hospital directors. The occupational health insurance funds (Obras Sociales-OSs)
account for 60 percent of sector financing and provide services to over half the population, mostly under
contract with the private sector. There are over 300 OSs, and they vary widely in size, financial stability and
benefits provided. Membership is compulsory for most workers, who are automatically assigned to a fund.
OSs are funded by a 10.5 percent wage tax. Financing also involves federal budget transfers, provincial
contributions and hidden subsidies through "free" assistance in public hospitals. Since individuals involved
with OSs are required to contribute substantial co-payments, poorer beneficiaries increasingly resort to public



sector institutions. It is estimated that one-third of public hospital discharges involve OS beneficiaries, and
that fees from OSs are collected in less than 20 percent of eligible cases. The private sector consists of
financial intermediaries and providers. The sector, which accounts for over 40 percent of hospital admissions
and a third of outpatient visits, has expanded rapidly in recent years as a result of skillfi4 marketing, growth
of OSs, and consumer dissatisfaction with a decaying public sector. Most private sector services are
provided under contracts with OSs and private insurance plans, which cover about three million people.
4.    The health sector's long-term viability is threatened by a combination of factors that are principally
associated with: (a) demographic dynamics--as the prevalence of chronic diseases increases, hospitals will
experience a growing demand for high-cost services; (b) inefficient allocation of public funds, resulting
primarily from (i) weak accountability of the provinces in the use of federal transfers, (ii) the intricate
structure of the sector with its multiple stakeholders and a flawed health insurance system; (iii) the link
between the financing and service deSivery roles of the public sector; and (c) serious production inefficiencies
of public hospitals related to poor management and deteriorated facilities. Without action on reform in the
areas of policy, regulation, and public hospitals, the sector's medium-term outlook is one of escalating costs
and equity erosion.
5.    In the past two years, legislation has been drafted and/or passed to reform two critical areas of the
sector. First, Executive Decree 578 of 1993 establishes the basis for the reform of public hospitals and the
legal foundation for their transformation into independent trusts. As of March 1995, 18 provinces and the
MCBA (Municipality of Buenos Aires) had officially endorsed the decree. Second, a law was proposed in
1992 for an in-depth reform of the OS system that would have opened affiliation and improved regulation.
The proposal was defeated in Congress, following strong opposition from the unions. Executive Decree 9 of
1993 restored a limited number of the initiatives and introduced competition by allowing consumer choice.
In reference to the reform of public hospitals, the Government's aim is to initiate activities in the Greater
Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (GBA) and the Province of Mendoza (POM). The GBA has a
population of about 11 million, about one-third of Argentina's population. It consists of the Municipality of
Buenos Aires (MCBA), with 3 million inhabitants and the peri-urban area (Conurbano), divided into 19
counties belonging to the Province of Buenos Aires (PBA), with a population of 8 million. The public sector
owns and manages about 50 percent of the hospital beds in the Metropolitan area. Hospital capacity is more
concentrated in the city, where national referral specialized hospitals are located. However, only 40 percent
of the citys hospital discharges are MCBA residents. The Province of Mendoza (POM) has a population of
1.4 million and slightly better health indicators than the national average. In the past five years, the POM has
been a pioneer in the design and implementation of reforms in the health sector.
6.    Government Strategy. The Government has linked the success of the adjustment program to the
rationalization of social spending. In the health sector, a number of initiatives have been introduced to
increase equity and efficiency. First, the Government has taken some steps, albeit limited, to reform the
health insurance system. Second, the decentralization of services to provinces and municipalities has been
practically completed. Third, new regulations have opened the way for competition in the pharmaceutical
market. Fourth, the Government, with Bank's support, is commnitted to maternal and child health
improvement. Fifth, as mentioned earlier, Executive Decree 578/93 of 1993 establishes the basis for the
reform of public hospitals. The Government's commitment to reform in the health sector is hindered,
however, by the complexity and heterogeneity of the sector and its problems, the overall lack of strong
technical leadership, and the resistance to change from politically powerful groups. However, strong
commitment to change and technical capacity can be identified at the level of individuals in the MSAS,
provincial ministries, and hospitals. Appropriately, the Government has embraced a strategic approach to



health sector reform that is gradual, participatory, and based on the implementation of pilot and
demonstration experiences. The Government has prepared a Letter of Sectoral Policy stating the main
elements of its reform proposals, including the establishment of autonomous public hospitals (HFPAs).
Although the legal basis for HPAs has been established, its actual implementation depends on updating the
managerial model and systems of public hospitals in Argentina. Lack of full implementation of the HPA
model since Executive Decree 578/93 of 1993 was passed has demonstrated that setting the appropriate legal
environment is a necessary condition but it is far from being a sufficient one.
7.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS), discussed by the
Board on May 4, 1995, strongly supports the Government's ambitious reform program and focuses on:
(a) consolidating reforms; (b) reducing poverty and supporting human resource development; and
(c) rebuilding the deteriorated infrastructure base. In the social sectors, the Bank's assistance to support
targeted efforts on poverty is complemented by broader efforts to improve the quality of human resource
investments. As a first stage of Bank assistance in poverty alleviation, the ongoing Matermal and Child
Health and Nutrifion Project (Ln. 3643-AR) is targeting poor mothers and young children in the urban
poverty belts and the underdeveloped northern provinces. A follow-up operation would provide similar
support to other provinces. The Bank is also preparing a Social Protection Project to assist in the design and
coordination of efforts in poverty alleviation. To complement these efforts and to achieve improvements in
the quality of investments, the proposed project and related Health Sector Financing Study and Health
Insurance Reform Project under preparation would support the reform of the inefficiently run social health
insurance system (OSs), in order to provide minimum health benefits to its members. While the proposed
project would address reform through gradual and attainable changes in the delivery and contracting of
services and in the regulation of private health insurance, the Health Sector Financing Study and proposed
Health Insurance Reform Project would set the stage for politically sensitive reforms of the Obras Sociales
system. The proposed project underpins a Government priority, complements the objectives of other Bank-
financed projects and sector work, and as such is fully consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy
(CAS) for Argentina.
8.    Project Objectives. The proposed project addresses the Government's sectoral policy goal of
rationalizing sector spending by strengthening policy-making and improving efficiency in service delivery. To
this end, the proposed project takes a two-pronged approach that integrates the Government's gradual
strategic approach with sector reform. First, it would strengthen policy-making capacity of the MSAS and
the MSPs (see also para. 3) and assist them in the actual implementation of specific changes to the incentive
environment in which public hospitals operate. Second, it would improve the capacity of the MSPs to
deliver health services by pilot-testing actual implementation of the HPAs through different alternatives of
managerial models for the transformation of public hospitals into HPAs. To achieve these goals, the
proposed project would carry out: (a) a limited number of operationally-oriented studies and systems to
improve the incentive environment in which public hospitals operate; (b) the pilot implementation of HPAs in
the MCBA and in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Mendoza; and (c) the nationwide dissemination of
reform initiatives emerging from (a) and (b).
9.    Based on the Government strategy presented to the Bank in the Policy Letter, the findings and
recommendations of the studies (Component 1) and the experience gained in the implementation of the first
phase of institutional strengthening in eligible hospitals (Component II), the Government would prepare an
Action Plan to be presented to the Bank during the Mid-Term Review and to be implemented during the
second half of project implementation. That plan would include, at a minimum, the actual (legal and in
practice) transformation of at least one eligible hospital in each eligible province into an HPA and actions to



-4 -
be taken to implement the recommendations of each of the studies under component I. Satisfactory progress
in the implementation of the action plan would be a condition of disbursement for investments, other than the
Management Information System (MIS), for the second phase of the last three hospitals in the respective
eligible jurisdictions.
10.   Project Description. The proposed project would consist of the following three components and
related activities:
Component I: Formulation of Policy Reform (6 percent of total project costs) would help
establish the basis and provide critical tools to advance sector reform. The studies are designed to
help fulflll the following objectives: (a) improve the sector's allocative efficiency; (b) improve the
targeting of public subsidies; and (c) compensate for market failures in health insurance and service
delivery. They would involve: (i) upgrading the national information system on sector resources,
epidemiological information and the productivity of service delivery; (ii) defining priority services to
be financed by government subsidies; (iii) designing a strategy to separate the financing and service
delivery functions for the public sector; (iv) designing and pilot testing a public hospital
reimbursement system at the provincial level; (v) designing a strategy to reform provincial OSs;
(vi) designing a system to identify beneficiaries under various insurance schemes; and (vii) designing
and implementing a regulatory framework for private health insurance and private health care
providers. An additional set of studies would focus on developing investment and project proposals
(e.g., expansion of the HPA initiative nationwide, reform of health insurance, AIDS control, and Mid-
Term and project-impact evaluation studies) for which Bank funding is likely to be requested in the
short- or medium-term. Finally, a study would analyze the relevant legislation and institutional
framework for hospital waste management. Under this component, the proposed project would
finance consulting services and training and workshops.
Component II: Pilot Imnplementation of Independent Trust Hospitals (89 percent of total
project costs) would help transform the organization and management of 15 hospitals (out of 300
nationwide) in three jurisdictions (Municipality of Buenos Aires--MCBA, Province of Buenos Aires--
PBA and Province of Mendoza--POM) to improve internal efficiency and guide their transformation
into HPAs. The estimated number of eligible hospitals to be included in the project responds to:
(i) the preliminary identification of those hospitals that would be eligible under the defined eligibility
criteria; (ii) the minimum number that is considered to be effective in attaining the desired
demonstration effect in Argentina; and (iii) the minimum number considered to test alternative
organizational models before deciding which of them could be replicated nationwide. To this end, the
project would support the following activities in the eligible hospitals: (a) institutional development
with a focus on organization and management and hospital waste disposal; (b) implementing a
hospital management information system (MIS); and (c) removing major bottlenecks for efficiency
improvement through physical plant and equipment investments, conditioned upon measurable
improvements in organization and management (with a ceiling per hospital of US$4.2 million for civil
works and US$2.1 mnillion for equipment). Under this component, the proposed project would
finance civil works and medical equipment, computer hardware and software applications, and
consulting services.
Component mI: Dissemination of Reform Initiatives (5 percent of total project costs) would
help disseminate the findings and experiences of the first two components nationwide and strengthen
the technical and management capacity of sector professionals. To this end, the project would



support: (a) training and workshops to increase the awareness and knowledge of sector reform
nationwide, disseminate the findings of the studies of Component L and transfer the experience and
knowledge drawn from the implementation of Component II; and (b) a limited number of
international scholarships in the areas of hospital management, public health, and health economics.
Funding for dissemination would be primarily directed to staff of provincial ministries and hospitals.
An agreement (assistance agreement) would be signed between the MSAS and the entity requesting
support. Under this component, the proposed project would finance training and workshops and
consulting services.
11.   Project Cost and Financing. The proposed project would be carried out over five years. The total
project cost is estimated at US$144.7 million equivalent, including taxes (US$23.7 million equivalent). The
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$82.21 million, or about 57 percent of total project cost. The
proposed loan of US$101.4 million would finance 70 percent of total project cost. It would cover US$70.9
million or 98 percent of foreign exchange expenditures, and US$30.1 million or 63 percent of estimated local
expenditures. The Government would finance US$43.3 million equivalent, or 30 percent of total project
cost.
12.   Project preparation has been financed with an advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of
US$1,150,000 dated June 22, 1994, and amended on May 19, 1995. To facilitate timely project
implementation the Government would establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, a Special Account denominated in US Dollars with an authorized allocation of
US$4.0 million attheBanco de laNaci6n. An initial deposit of US$1.0 millionwould be made and thefull
arnount of the authorized allocation would be released when disbursements reach a level of US$10 million.
Up to US$2.0 million (about 2 percent of total Bank financing) will be made available in retroactive financing
for expenditures incurred up to 12 months prior to loan signing.
13.   Project hnplementation. The MSAS would be responsible for project implementation. An MSAS
resolution of September 1994 created the project preparation unit, i.e., Unidad de Coordinaci6n del
Proyecto de Reforma del Sector Salud. Project execution responsibilities would be vested in a national
project implementation unit, i.e., UnidadEjecutiva Central (UEC), consisting of about 16 higher-level staff.
In addition, PBA, MCBA and POM would create jurisdictional implementation units, i.e., Unidades
EjecutorasProvinciales (UEPs), consisting of about four higher-level staff, to assist in the implementation of
Component II. The UEC's mandate would include: (a) carrying out Components I and Im; (b) providing
technical and administrative support to the UEPs in carrying out Component II; (c) coordinating with and
overseeing all relevant entities involved in project implementation at the national and jurisdictional levels;
(d) monitoring and evaluation; and (e) reporting to the Bank. The UEPs' mandate focuses on the upgrading
of physical plant under Component IL with the administrative and technical support of the UEC.
Considering the critical nature of strong leadership in the implementation of reform in each eligible hospital, it
will be a condition of disbursement for each eligible hospital that the respective hospital director has
experience and qualifications acceptable to the MSAS through the PIU.
14.   The proceeds of the loan allocated for upgrading of physical plant and equipment under Component
II would be on-lent from the national Government (Ministerio de Economiay Obrasy Servicios Pzublicos de
laNaci6n-MOE) to the three participating jurisdictions (i.e., PBA, MCBA, and POM). Thesejurisdictions
would repay the proceeds of the loan to the MOE under the same terms and conditions as the Bank Loan.
To this effect, a subsidiary loan agreement would be signed between the national MOE, the MSAS and each
eligible jurisdiction. The eligible jurisdictions have signed a Commitment Letter with the MSAS expressing



- 6 -
their willingness to participate in the project. Under Component II, other provinces could be eligible for
financing to replace any of the three eligible jurisdictions already identified, in case of violation of the
subsidiary loan agreement. The preparation unit has prepared an Implementation Manual to guide and
monitor implementation. The Government and the Bank have agreed on a critical set of actions and
monitoring indicators (Project Implementation Plan--PIP). During implementation, the Government and the
Bank would hold Annual and Mid-Term Reviews to assess, inter alia, overall implementation progress,
compliance with legal covenants, and the adequacy of available and programmed financing. Annual audits
would be carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The project's closing date would be
June 30, 2001.
15.   Project Sustainability. The proposed project would entail minimal incremental recurrent costs.
Administrative costs related to the management of UEC and UEPs (e.g., secretarial support, rent and
utilities, maintenance of office equipment and office supplies) represent less than 5 percent of total project
cost and will be funded by the Government. Personnel cost is not recurrent, since the UEC and UEPs consist
of consultants under short-term or medium-term contracts and these units are expected to be dismantled at
the end of implementation. Project sustainability, however, is heavily dependent on the political will and the
technical ability to incorporate the findings and recommendations of the studies (Component 1) and the
lessons learned from the pilot experiences (Component II) into broader sector reform efforts.
16.   Bank Experience and Lessons Learned. The project design builds on relevant operations financed
by the Bank Group over the past decade. Successful implementation is closely associated with: linldng the
definition of project objectives and scope to a clear policy framework; obtaining strong and pervasive
government commitment; designing simple projects with focused and modest objectives; and linking the
financing of critical investments to the implementation of policy and/or institutional reform. However, in
particular in middle-income countries, special attention should be paid to ensure that simplicity is consistent
with the need to address the most relevant sector issues, which are usually exceedingly complex in the area of
health sector reform. These lessons have been incorporated into the project.
17.   Key Issues and Actions. Prior to negotiations, (a) the Government prepared: (i) a Letter of
Sectoral Policy stating its Health Sector Strategy and the main elements of its reform proposals and
(ii) a final version of the Implementation Manual; (b) Commitment Letters were signed between the MSAS
and each of the three jurisdictions participating in Component It; (c) the Government informed the Bank
about its intention to continue with the cost-sharing agreement with UNDP (signed in June 1995, in the
context of the PPF) to manage the contracting of consultant services; and (d) the Ministry of Economy
(MOE) submitted a proposal for ensuring the timely availability of counterpart funds during implementation.
18.   During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that: (a) an action plan, for the
MSAS and for each eligible province, would be prepared no later than December 31, 1998 and the
implementation of such plan finalized no later than nine months before the completion date; (b) the maximum
amount allocated to civil works and equipment will not exceed US$6.3 million per hospital and the first
phase of investments will not exceed 40% of the investment assigned to the respective hospital; (c) the annual
amounts of counterpart funding would be made available for each of the five years of project implementation;
(d) failure of performance by any of the three participating jurisdictions under their respective subsidiary loan
agreement would be sufficient cause for suspension of disbursements in any of such jurisdictions, and other
provinces could then be included; (e) no later than the Mid-Term Review of the project, the Government
would present to the Bank a plan to transfer UEC and UEP responsibilities and activities to MSAS and
respective jurisdictions; (f) the Government would carry out the project in accordance with the



Implementation Manual and within the parameters of the Project Implementation Plan; (g) a plan would be
developed as an altemative to the UNDP-MSAS cost-sharing agreement for the second half of project
implementation; (h) the Government, through the UEC, would submit to the Bank quarterly progress reports
no later than 30 days after the end of every quarter of each year, and the last quarterly report of each calendar
year would include an assessment of overall implementation progress over the past year; (i) a draft budget
proposal for the folUowing year would be submitted to the Bank no later than June 30 of each year and an
officially approved budget for the following year no later than 30 days after its approval by the Congress; and
(j) annual reviews should take place no later than July 31 each year, and a Mid-Term Review should take
place no later than July 31, 1998. During negotiations, the Bank and the Government agreed on the Project
Implementation Plan.
19.   Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that: (a) the MSAS-UNDP agreement (para. 17) has
been amended to allow for the UNDP to support the MSAS in the management of all contracts for
consultant services to be financed by the project; (b) the UEC has been created and is adequately staffed, and
the coordinator has been appointed; (c) the Implementation Manual has been approved by the MSAS; and
(d) all actions satisfactory to the Bank have been taken by the Government in order to permit procurement of
goods and services financed by the Bank Loan in accordance with Bank procedures. Conditions of
disbursement would be that: (a) for expenditures for civil works and equipment under Component II for
the first two hospitals in each eligible jurisdiction, for the first phase (up to 400/o of the investments assigned
to the respective hospital), the completion of a satisfactory investment plan; and for the remaining balance,
reasonable progress in the implementation of institutional development activities; (b) in addition to (a) above,
for expenditures on civil works and equipment for the second phase of investments under Component II for
the last three hospitals in each eligible jurisdiction, the submission to the Bank of the action plan referred to in
para. 9 and satisfactory advance in its implementation during the second half of project implementation.;
(c) for each eligible jurisdiction under Component II, the subsidiary loan agreement would have been signed
between the Federal Government, represented by the MOE and the MSAS, and the respective jurisdiction;
(d) for expenditures for information systems, the submission of a master policy framework, acceptable to the
Bank, to guide all MIS investments; (e) for expenditures for each of the three participating jurisdictions under
Component II, the UEP has been created and is adequately staffed and the coordinator has been appointed;
(f) for expenditures for each of the three participating jurisdictions under Component II, the corresponding
parts of the Implementation Manual has been approved by the respective jurisdictions; and (g) for
expenditures for each eligible hospital under Component II, the respective hospital has a director with
experience and technical and managerial qualifications satisfactory to the MSAS (through the UEC).
20.   Poverty Category. The proposed project specifically targets poverty by increasing the efficiency and
quality of services of public hospitals, which are primarily used by the poor, and by helping to reduce the
pervasive subsidy of the OSs and the private sector by improving patient identification and billing systems in
public hospitals.
21.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project would improve medical waste disposal systems in
the 15 pilot hospitals under Component If. The current environmental rating of the project is "B". Under
Component I, the project includes a study to review relevant legislation and institutional framework on
medical waste management. Under Component IL, management of medical waste is included as part of the
institutional development of the 15 pilot hospitals.
22.   Program Objective Categories. Within the broad category of human resource development, the
project's objectives are to promote more effective health policies and to reduce poverty.



- 8 -
23.   Participatory Approach. During project preparation, special attention was given to ensure the
support of key stakeholders, particularly of the provincial governments (and the MCBA), the MOE and
professional associations. In this respect, the project preparation team consisted of representatives from the
national and jurisdictional level and the MOE. Special attention was given to ensure support of the MOE.
Moreover, during appraisal, the Buenos Aires Medical Association endorsed the proposed project.
24.   Expected Benefits. The main benefit of the proposed project would be to help the Government
implement its objective of rationalizing sector spending by strengthening policy-making and improving
service-delivery capacity. First, by strengthening policy-making through definition of specific short- and
medium-term strategies and actions aimed at furthering sector reform (Component 1), the proposed project
would set the stage and would provide the technical tools for an in-depth transformation of the sector.
Second, by supporting the institutional development of 15 pilot public hospitals and guiding their
transformation into HPAs, the proposed project would establish a new and more efficient delivery model to
be replicated nationwide. Improving public hospitals' management through their transformation into
independent trusts is a priority for the reform of the Argentine Health Sector. Such transfornation will
introduce the required incentives to significantly improve productive efficiency in the public hospitals, which
constitute about 80% of public health expenditures in the country. The project will, inter alia, increase cost-
recovery, allow for more flexibility in the utilization of resources by hospital managers, reduce unnecessary
utilization of hospital beds, and increase their productivity. At the same time, the change of the managerial
model for the public hospitals will allow for a complete public-private integration in the provision of health
services in the Argentine Republic in the near future.
25.   Risks and Safeguards. The two principal risks of the proposed project are: a lack of future
political commitment to reform in the health sector, and project implementation demands outstripping the
managerial capacity of the MSAS, the Provincial Ministries, and the MCBA Health Secretariat. Political
commitment is particularly difficult to gauge in the case of Argentina's health care sector, given the number
and variety of interest groups involved (e.g., national and provincial governments, unions, professional
associations and private sector institutions). While it is not possible to guarantee support for the project by
all stakeholders, risks related to the political sustainability of the project have been minimized by: the
attention given during preparation to securing the support of key stakeholders, particularly of the provincial
governments (and MCBA), the MOE and some professional associations; and by a project design which is
not overly ambitious, has pilot and demonstration features and, through specific and operational studies,
focuses on gradually building the sector's knowledge base for reform. With regard to the project's demands
outstripping the MSAS's managerial capacity, the risk would be minimized by: (i) full-time project units
(UEC and UEPs) that have successfully managed preparation and are familiar with the Bank's guidelines,
following the administration of an advance from the PPF; and (ui) annual and Mid-Term Reviews to assess
implementation progress and adjust the pace and scope of implementation as needed.
