I INTRODUCTION
The city of Jinzhou is the center of economv, culture and transportation in the west
part of Liaoning Province. WVitlh economv growth and the rising standards of living, the
demand for water supply in the city increases dramnatically and the available water supply
system is f?r from being able to meet the requirements. On account of pollution sources
and the polluted Xiaoling River, ground water at shallow depths in the urban areas is gen-
erally polluted, intensifying the lack of water supplies in the city, and seriously hindering
the developmnent of economy and the raising of living standards in Jinzhou. In order to
solve this problem, the Ji.nzhou People's Government has decided to construct a new water
supply from liuduan to Baduan on the right hand side bank of the Daling River, where
large quantities of good quality water are available. To further ensure the maintenance of
the good quality of the water in that area, the government has also decided to curb the
pollution caused by the sewage of the Jincheng Paper Mill, Which is located in the upper
reaches of the water supply river.
The two above- mentioned projects are the sub- projects of the No. 2 World Bank
Loan Project for urban reconstruction programme of cities in Liaoning province. Based on
the document reference (86) NE 003 and the relevant requirements of WB, and entrust-
ed by tl.-: Office for City Reconstruction Programnme of Jinzhou Municipality, Chinese
Research Academy of Environmental Sciences undertook the task of compiling an EIA
re port for the two projects.
Since the two projects are closely related to each other, a unified EIA report is sensi-
ble. However, the unique features of each project are described separately in the
report.

3 OBJECITVE OF ETA AND TARGET FOR ENVTRONMENT
PROTECTION
3. 1 Objective of EIA
Forecast and analysis will be made of the iTnpact on the enviromnent of Jinzhou city
and around the project sites as caused by the construction of the new water supply and the
curbing of the pollution by sewage from Jincheng Paper Mill. A feasibility study will be
made for site selection, technology used and measures to curb pollution for the two pro-
jects. Suggestions will be made regarding further improvement and protection of environ-
ment and scientific basis will be provided for decision-making organizations.
3. 2 Target for Environment Protection
Basnd on the objectives of the two construction project and the geographic locations
of sites, the major subjects for environment protection are ground water resources and
surface water resources.
3. 2. 1 Target for Curbing Pollution Sources
In order to prevent the quality of the water in Daling River and the ground water in
the lower reaches of the river from being poUuted, it is necessary tQ put under control the

i
quantity of polluutants discharged from the major pollution sources along the Daling River.
The majot polluting source in the lower reaches of Dating River is Jincheng Paper Mill. It
is therefore required that the discharge quantity of COD shall not exceed 61 tfd, of SS
48t/d after 1995 and that by 2000 the disclarge of CODcoshould-be less than 7t/d.
3. 2. 2 Target for Water Quality of Daling River
Daling River serves as a flood-relief channel, water supply for both agriculture and
industry, and a complementary water supply for ground water in the river sector area.
The near-term target (1995) for water quality is that the quality of water in river sec-
tions below the Jincheng Paper Mill shall be improved significantly. The mid-term target
(2000) is that the water quality should be further improved to the extent that the soluble
COD1, CODc, should reach Class III standard in river sections below the Paper Mill and
that the quality of water penetrating into the complementary sector should reach Grade 2
requirement for water supply protection. The long-term target is that water quality in riv-
er sections below the Paper Mill should reach standard Clas m, GB 3838-88, enabling
Daing River to supplement gtound water sources and remain in good ecological sea envi-
ronment conditions.
4  OVERVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT IN CONSTRUCnION
AREA
4. 1 Natural Environment
4. 1. 1 Geogtrphic Location
Te city of Jinzhou is situated in the west part of Liaoning provice, east longitude
120"42'-122"37', north latitude 40°48'-42-07', borderd in the east with Shenyang
and Panjing and in the north with Fuxin and Jinxi, and in the south with the Liaodong
Bay of the Bohai Sea. Downtown Jinzhou is situated at east longitude 121'08', north
latidude 41-08' with an area of 10,300km2. Jincheng Paper Mill is located at Jincheng
Town, 25 km to the northeast of the urban area on the left side of Daling River, i. e.,
eat longitude 121'20'1 north latidude 41110'. The geological survey area for the new
4



water supply project is delimited by E 121'13'1 '-- 121'28'18", N .Ps'O!' 3P'?--
41"10'00". See Fig. 1 - 3 for geographic locations of Jinzhou and the sites for the two
projects.
4. 1. 2 Wcather and Climate
Jinzhou features a north temperate zone, semi-humid, trade wind type, continental e-
climate. The main characteristics of its climate are cold winter, hot summer, distinction
among the four seasons, big difference in temperature between day and night, and un-
even rainfall. Average yearly temperature is 9..I1C, with max temperature of. 37. 3tC
and min of minus 24. 7C.
Jinzhou's spring features strong wind and rare rain, quick warming, large quantity
of evaporation of water, and susceptibiLity to draugt. In mid-March, soil starts to thaw
and in nmid April most areas no longer have frost. The spring sees the highest wind speed
of the vear, the average speed being 5m/s, in May wind speed decreases. Summer has
high temperature and much rain, the average temperature being 20 C from June to Au-
gust, the average temperature of July, the hottest month of the year, over 241C. In
June 1972 Jinzhou experienced its highest ever temperature, 41. 8g. The average air
huniidity of July and August reaches 80%, the highest of the year. Rainfal in summer
is 360- 430mm, constituting over two thirds of the total rainfall of the year. Rainfall is
the greatest in July, 150-200mm on the average. Autumn is warm and scarce of rain
with sunny days. Temperature drops sharply in this season. The average temperature in
September is around 18C, but by the end of the month there will be frost. The rainfall
of this season is 80-120mm, only 15% to 19% of the total amount of the year. Au-

4. 1. 3 Topography
Generally speaking, the city of Jinzhou lies in an area which slopes from northwest
to southeast. The urban areas are surrounded in south, east and north by hills. The city
is 20-70m above sea level. To the northwest borders of the sector areas of Daling River
and Xiaoling River, are hills whose absolute height is 20-lOOm. The hinterland of these
sectors are alluvial plains, tilting from northweat to southeast at a slope of 0. 9%0 with an
absolute height of 10-24m. The coastal area features solonchak soil and marshes.
4. 1. 4 Surface Water System
Daling and Xiaoling Rivers are the two mnajor rivers running through the area under
environment impact assesment.
Rising in Yaolugou, Jianchang, Daling River runs through Chaoyang, Beipiao,
Yixian County, and Jinxian County, covering a distance of 403kn, before it enters the
Bohai Sea. The area of the reaches upwards from the hydrological station of Jinxian
County amounts 23, 048km2. The annual flow of the Daling River was 1.540 million m2
between 1961 and 1987. The river contains much sand, the average sand content being
13. 8kg/m3and the highest content 90. 3kg/m3. With large quantities of organic Materials
washed into the river from the soil on the banks and the discharge of sewage from both in-
dustry (especially from the Jincheng Paper Mill) and living quarters, Dalng River suf-
fers from severe pollution, and its water quality falls short of the GB 3838-88V stan-
dards.
The 206 km long Xiaoling River rises from the Kala mountain at Chaoyang. It has
two branches; Nuer River and Baiyigu River, which are 136 km and 30 km long respec-
tively. The total area of their reaches is 5, 480km2, of which 4,444. 6km2 lies in the re-
gion in question. After passing through the Taihe District of Jinzhou and Niangniang
Place Town of Jinxian County, Xiaoling River runs into the Bohai Sea. The average
flow of the river per year is 330 million mlbetween 1961 and 1987. On account of the
discharge of sewage from the industrial and residential areas of the city, Xiaoliang River
is severely polluted and its water quality falls short of GB3838-88V standards. See Fag.
4 for the distribution of surface water systems of Jinzhou.
4.1.5  Geological Environment
6



The EL area lies in weat slopes in the concave reaches of the Lower Liao River,
where, since Cainozoic, the earth crust sank and the deposits fromed the tertiary system
of stratum. Beneath this stratum is granite of the Yanshan Period and atratum o" the
Great Wall ststem of the Early Proterozoic period.
The Pre- fourth Period stratum  Its nain contents are conglomerate quartz- and
manganese powder-containing sandstone, shale and limestone. They are found mainly in
the western hilly land of the EIA area.
The granite of the Yanshan period is intrusion rock-cropping up in the northern hilly
land.
The early tertiary system stratum of the Cenozoic era: The cornposition revealed by
drilling is grey sandstone, conglomerate, multi- colour sandstone, mudstone featured by
poor adhesiveness. This stratum is mainly found underneath the plain in the southeast.
The Fourth Period stratum: This stratum in the EIA area is relatively mature with a
thickness of up to 10 to 80 meters. A detailed description of the geological features of this
stratum is given below.
1) The mid-Pleistocene (Q2) slope diluvium: found mainly in slopes and valleys of
the hilly land. Its main contents are brown red and brown yellow sub-clay and sand
mixed gravel. Generally, its thickness is less than lOm. The alluviation is found in the
plain comprising brown subclay in the upper layer and gravel, pebble and sand in the
lower part with a thickness of 10 to 30m.
2) The early Pleistocene (Q3)  Slope diluvium is found in hilly land consisting of
brown powder-like subsand, subclay, and thin layers of sand and gravel. The thickness
is normally less than 10 meters. The alluviatiaion is distributed in the plain comprising
brown clay in the upper layer and sand gravel in the lower layer with a thickness of 20 to
40 m.
3) The Holocene(Q4): It is scattered in the surface of the plain with alluviation as
main content. It comprises subsand, fine sand, and grey muddy subsand and subclay in
the base with a thickness less than 10 m.
4. 1. 6   Hydrologic and Geologic Environment
The ground water in the EIA area exists mainly in the water-containing layer of
sand, gravel and pebble of the fourth svstem. The ground water features relatively stable

distribution, abundant quantity and excellent quality. The thickness increases gradually
from northwest to southeast, the structure transforms from a single layer to a double lay-
er, and the hydraulic nature from underground current to pressurized water. Thbe under-
ground stream runs from northeast to southwest on the west bank of the Daling River,
and from northwest to southeast on the east bank of Daling River. Water-containing lay-
ers in the ETA area can be divided into three categories in terms of their characteristics and
hydraulic nature.
Single layer underground current-light pressurized water containing layer: Such a
layer usually is covered by a 3 to 1Om thick clay. Only in the river bed of Daling River
beyond Liuduan and in the ancient river beds can one find such water layers without clay
covering. The water layer is composed of gravel and pebble of early and nid Pleistocene
with a thickness of 20 to 50m and the maximum thickness of up to 60m. The groudwater
table is 3 to 5m deep and in Liuduan 5 to 8m deep. The ground here has a good Perme-
ability with a permeability coefficient of 150 to 250m/d, an influence radius of 300 to
500m. A single well can produce 5, 000 tons of water per day or even more than that. In
Liuduan, daily output reaches 10,000 to 20,000 t per day. The water is of gooa quali-
ty, being low mineralized, heavy calsium carbonate or calsium magnesium carbonate
tvpe water with mineralization less than 0. 5g/1.
Double layer pressurized water at shaUow and great depths: These layers are dis-
tributed mainly in the southeast part of the ETA area. The shallow water layers are topped
with a 10 to 25 m thick layer of clay. The water containing layer comprises pebble,
gravel and sand with a thickness of 20 to 30 m and permeability coefficient of 100 to 150
mn per day. A single well produces 5,000 to 10,000 tons of water per day.
The underlying layers carry pressurized water and the water separating layer is atS to
10 m layer of clay and subclay at a depth of 40 to 50 meters. The water-containing lay-
ers are formed by gravels and pebbles 20 to 40 meters in thickness with an osmotic roeffi-
cicnt of 5 to 4 0 m/d. Normally a single -vell can produce 1, 000 to 3,000 tons of water
per day.
In the hillv area, the crevices of the bed rock contains karst water and the slope dilu-
vial laycrs have small voids. The water containing-layers are buried at great depths and
are not stable, or water-rich. They are lateral feed sources for water containing layers in
the EIA area.
8



The principal feeding sources for groundwater in the EIA area are infiltration of
rivers, precipitation and permeability while the secondary sources are lateral run-off and
back infiltration from irrigation. The groundwater table is 9 to 12 meters. and flouws to
south, southeast.
The hydraulic slope is 0. 5%4-1. 2%.The drain of ground water is mnainly by me-
chanical vertical extraction and secondarily by horizontal flow discharge. Dynamic
changes win be controUed bv climate and rmnual extraction.
4:1. 7 Maritime Environment
The sea areas of Jinzhou are situated at the top of the Liaodong Bay, beginning at
the estuary of Daling River (Erdaohc in Jinxian County and ending at the mouth of Lao-
he River in Tianqiao Town with a coastline of 94. 2km.
The sea areas of Jinzhou feature high altitutes, shallow waters with low transparen-
cy. The lowest water temperature in winter is minus 2 deg c and the highest water tem-
perature in summer is 27 deg c. In spring, water temperature rises and there is a signifi-
cant temperature difference. The avcrage water temperatute over the year is 15. 7 deg c.
In early December waters along thc coast begin to freeze and start to melt in March next
ycar. The average salinity is 29. 7 % , which is significantly influenced by heat radiation
from the continent.
Liaodong Bay has complex motion of tides, which are different from north to south.
irregular half-day tide occurs in the north from Daling River and Xiaoling River to
Ciangshansi of Xingcheng, and high tide height difference is 1. 5 m; the southern part of
the Bay is from Changsbansi of Xingcheng to Tianlongsi of Suizhong. Basically speaking,
tide current in Liaodong Bay flows along the coast to the northeaset and southwest. Near
Hulu Iland, the high tide flows towards the northeast and the .ebb flows to southwest
Near Xinlitun in the sector land of Daling River and Xiaoling River, the high tide goes
northeast and the ebb southwest. The speed of the flow is 1. 2 knots (0. 62 mWs).
The biological features of the sea areas of Jinzhou are not distinct. The sea water is
fertile enough for marine life to lay eggs. grow and live. In the sea area there are 30
genera of phytoplankton. The community structure is the diatom genus. Superior species
include chain algae, round algae, bone algae. There are 16 categories of zooplanktons
which may be subdivided into 51 species. Superior species include flexible foot. strong

arrowworm and nociluCa. Bigger zooplankt3ns are rhopilema esoulents and stomopholus
nomurai.
Demersal life in off-shore areas of Jinzhou (sea waters within isobath of 10m) is
mainly echinoderms moUuses and arthrupods. In the sector sea areas near Dating and Xi-
aoling Rivers live several kinds of clans.
Swimnuing. life in liaodong Bay includes (according to survey made between 1983
and 1984) 106 species of fish, 3 speces of prawns and 2 species of cephalopod. Major
speies of fish are small yellow croakerns, hair-tails, blue-spot threadfins, rays, yeUow
crucian carp and perches Prawns include Chinese prawns, mantis shrimps and white
prawns. Cephalopad includes cuttlefish.
4.1. 8 Vegeation Environment
Jinzhou lies in a narrow strip of land, which in terms of vegetation, falls into the
pan-arctic vegetation zone, the sub-zone of Sino-Japan forest plants, north China re-
gion, north China plain and sub-mountainous zone. As there is a distinct difference in
temperature between north and south, a significant diference in rainfall over the year and
a variety of topography, there exist a great number of vegeuation forms in the area of
Jinzhou. In te northwest hill areas there are tree major formns of vegetation; coniferous
trues, broadleaf trees, bushes and -grass. The southeast coast features pasLure and marsh
vegetations. The site of the two project salt and alkali psure land. In the lower reaches
of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers, where there are narshes and land covered with water,
marsh and water vegetation prevails. Marsh vegcetion includes reads and fragrant catta
and water vegetation includes duckweods and lotus
4. 2 Social Environment

Jincheng Town is under the jurisdiction of Jinxian County. The town has a built-up
area of 2km2 with a population of 22,000.
Opposite to Jincheng Town is Daling River Town, the seat of the County Govern-
ment of Jinxian. Daling River Town has a built-up area of 6kcm2 and a population of
30, 000.
Near the pressure station, the water distribution station and along the water supply
pipes are 9 villages with 910 households totaling 3,640 persons.
4. 2. 2 Social and Economic Status
Jinzhou is a coastal industrial city with powerful industrial infrastructure and a com-
plete range of trades. Its main industries include petro-chernics, netallurgy and nachine-
building, textile, paper naking, electric power, building material, medicine and elec-
tronics. In 1990, the total output value of industry was 8. 7 billion yuan RMB.
The only industry in lincheng Town is paper nmaking besides service industries.
However, Daling River Town has a number of enterprise engaged ir, paper mnaking, pro-
duction of chemical fertilizer and machine building.
Jinzhou also boasts a prosperous agriculture, anu is an important producer of grain,
vegetable oil, cash crops, fruit, and aquatic product in Liaoning province. There are al-
together 360, 000 hectares of arable land. Major crops are corn, gaoliang, soy beans,
cotton, peanuts, and rice. In 1990, the total output value of agriculture was 2. 4 billion
yuan-RMB.
The EIA area in the sectors of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers is about 831km2. Major
crops are corn, gaoliang, rice. In the coastal area in the south, there are 4,700 hectares
of artificially-bred prawn ponds!
Jinzhou is the hub of transportation linking northeast China and north China. There
are well built networks of railways, highways, ports and airports. Eight railways meet at
Jinzhou. The port of Jinzhou is Class 1 port for overseas trade with berths for ten thou-
sand ton and upwards bulk cargo ships, crude oil tankers, and finished product tankers.
The airport of Jinzhou is fit for operation of medium-sized aircraft. [DD service is avail-
able, enabling communication with over 182 cities abroad. The economic development

urban area comprise flat land with easy transportation and enjoy proferential policies.
They have already become a window opening to the outside world.
Jinzhou has developed its infrastructure at fast speeds. At present there are seven
waterworks all using groundwater and producing 266, 500 tons of water per day, of
which 6 tons are supplied to Jinxi every day. In the urban area the total length of water-
pipes is 762 km. Every household uses tap water. The average water consumption is 162
litres per person per day in urban areas. For each output value of 10,000 yuan, 359 tons
of water are consumed. The total length of sewage pipes is 211. 3 km, benefiting 75%
households. No sewage treatment facilities are available. Sewage from living quarters and
factories is all discharged into Xiaoling River. Daily discharge is 220, 000 tons. The bulk.
of the sewage of Jincheng Town and Dalinghe Town (5, DOOt/d) is discharged into the ir-
rigation ditches of Daling River. The sewage of Jinxian Chemical Fertilizer Factory and
the Paper Mill (24, OOOt|d) is discharged into Daling River.
5 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF THE CONSTRUCITON PRO-
JECI
5. 1 Nature of the Construction Project
5. 1. 1 Nature of the Project for Constructing a New Waterworks for Jinzhou
At present there are 7 waterworks at Jinzhou. The Bozi and Suifeng waterworks are
located in the alluvial sectors of Daling River and Xiaoling River respecuvely. The water
sources for the remaining 5 waterworks are rivers being supplied by sballow groundwater.
llmc total water supply capacity of the municipality is 265,600 tons per day. The capaci-
ty of the five waterworks in hte urban area is 66,500 tons per day. The pollution causeed
by factories and the pollution of Xiaoling River once had a severe effect on three of the
five waterworks that draw water from the Xiaoling River. The pollution is of seasonal
nature. It mnakes the already poor water supply even worse in the urban area of Jinzhou.
Due to the requirement for industrial development and population growth in the urban
area and especially in the development zones, the need for water supply will increase
greatly. Water supply has become the governing factor for development. Water shortage
12



is predicted to be 100,000 tons per day in 1995 and 200,000 tons per day in 2,000.
Since Xiaoling River and ground water are polluted and the river does not have enough
water for supply to a new waterworks, it is out of the question to build a large water-
works by the side of Xiaoling River. According to the "Report on the study of a Model of
Groundwater in Sectors of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers" approved by the Comnittee of
Geological Mineral Depots Reserves of Liaoning Province, there are rich and good quality
groundwater resources in the alluvial sectors of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers 15 to 25 km
away from the urban area. Of the extractable capacity of 1. 36 nillion rns/d, 200, 000
m3/d can be extracted in addition to the volume being used. The present water works pro-
ject is aimed at daily extraction of 100,000 ms, to fill in the gap caused by the polluted
water sources.
5. 1. 2 Nature of the Project for Curbing the Pollution Caused by Sewage from Jincheng
Paper Mill
This paper mnill polution control project includes projects for using pulp to make ad-
hesives, recovering paper making white water and reprocessing reed dust to make artificial
carbon.
The main puspose of the project is to reduce the pollution load on the lower reaches
of Daling River, and protect groundwater resources in the sectors between Daling and Xi-
aoling Rivers.
The groundwater in sectors between Daling and Xiaoling Rivers is now not only the
water supply base for Jinzhou, but also an important water supply for Jinxi and Panjin.
The quality of water has a close bearing on the health of the people and the development
of the economy of Jinzhou,Jinxi and Panjin. The industrial sewage from Jincheng Paper
Mill flows in the ditch on the east bank of Daling River and meets Daling River at Sanhe
village. In sections beyond Zhaojiawobo, Daling River supplies water horizontally to
groundwater layers. Downwards from Zhaojiawobo Daling supplies groundwater layers
vertically by percolation. In normal cases, sewage from the paper mill goes to groundwa-
ter layers through the sewage ditches by means of free infiltration. W9hen there is a signif-
icant flood in the water abundance period, the meeting point of the sewage ditch and Dal-
ing River is moved upwards to the section beyond Zhaojiawobo, and the sewage of the pa-
per mill flows into Daling River, which mnay go to water layers horizontally.

Jincheng Paper Mill is the main source of pollution for Daling River. The mill pro-
duces more than 95 Yo of the pollution load discharged into Daling Rever. In the Xibaqian
section of the lower reaches of the polluted Daling River the maximum COD content
reached 273 mg/l in 1991. Severe damages have been caused to the river ecology and the
maritime environment.
The above-mentioned facts show that the control of the pollution caused by Jincheng
Paper will is a key project for protecting the groundwater resources of Daling and Xiaol-
ing Rivers, improving water quality of Daling River and protecting the maritire environ-
ment off thie estuary of Daling River.

5. 2. 3. 1 Discharge and control of pollutants in the sewage from the new waterworks in
service
The new waterworks does not produce any sewage or waste Ws du?tlg its operathxL.
However, leakage may occur from a small. number of equipment and sewage may be pro-
duced from cleaning the ground.and from the living quarters. Equipment leakage is esti-
mated to be 0. 5-1. 0 t/d, water for cleaning the ground 0. 5 t/d, and sewage from living
quarters 1. 5 t/d, See Table 5-1 for details.
Sewage produced from processes of water drawing, pressurising and distributing and
from the living quarters will flow into one channel and, after going through the humfian
waste treatment reservoir, will be discharged into the nearby ditches and ponds.

lion, smoke and soot filtering equipment will be ;ltted at the chimneys of the boiler house, to ensure
that the discharge of black smoke and powder dust meets the requirements specified by Liaoning
province. To minimize accidents in the Cl feeding room, operating procedures shall be strictly ob-
served, training of operators and maintenance of equipment enhanced. Furthermore, alarms, monl-
tors, leakage treatment devices and ventiliators will be fitted.
5.2.3.3  Noise
The pump house and the boiler facilities are major noise sources. In order to reduce noise, a
shock-danping cusion will be installed in the foundation of the pumps, telescopic shock-damping con-
nectors will be fitted to both the inlet and the outlet of the pumps and noise-absorbing windows and
doors will be fitted in the watch room.
Round the various pump houses in the pressure station, the water distribution works and other fa-
cilities, trees and grass will be planted to absorb noise and beautify the environment.
5. 2. 4 Discharge and Control of PoUutants during the Construction of the New Water-

5. 3 Overview of the Project to Curb Pollution Caused by Jincheng Paper
Mill
5. 3. 1 Present Status of Production and Sewage Discharge of Jincheng Paper Mill
In making the pulp, li     n   Mil_
boiled hinte iot ios ot   d    giuumauite,    t    .goesjotbem    Waste liquid is
drained from the bottom of the drainer to the underground sewage pipe while the pulp is
first screened by a centrifugal pulp screen and then goes to the Bellmner bleacher for
bleaching. The use of a drainer consumes a lot of water and therefore the solid content in
waste liquid is less than 3% making it very difficult to recover and reprocess. The solids
are discharged together with sewage. The sewage produced during making the pulp is the
main source of pollution of the Daling River. Daily discharge of pulp sewage is 32,184 t.
The pulp is transmitted from the pulp rnaking shop to the paper making shop. After
proceses like draining, beating, mixing, deslagging and screening, the pulp is sent the
mill where it is turned into paper. During these processes, thick white water is all recov-
cred for further use while thin white water is sent to the pulp shop for draining and part of
it is discharged into the Daling River. Daily discharge reaches 32,938 t.

According to statistics, BOD consitutes 25 to 35 % of COD and when the yearly dis-
charge of COD is 65,624 tons, that of BOD is between 16,405 and 22,968. 4 tons. See
Table 5-7 for discharge percentages of COD and SS in pulp and paper making processes.
From the table, it can be seen that COD and SS pollutants are mainly produced during
pulp making when 96. 2%  of the total COD and 6B. 7%  of the total SS quantities are
produced.

5. 3. 2. 2 Energy Consumption for the Project to Curb Water Pollution Cused by
Jincheng Paper Mill
This project requires additional electric power of 1083. 1 kwh/h. The present elec-
tric load of the paper mill is 14795. 2 kwh/h and the total power required in the future
will be 15878. 7 kwh/h. The thermo power plant in the mill now has the capability to
supply to a load of 19,899 kwh/h and there will be enough power and to spare for this
project
Thi project needs additional quantity of steam of 19 t/h, and the present steam con-
sumption in the mill is 122 t/h in winter, totalling 141 t/h in the future. But the present
power plant in the mill produces 259 t/h of steam, which is much more than enough for
future requirement. In sum, the project does not require any additional energy producing
facilities to set up.

See Fig. 5- 2 for the process of curbing sewage from pulp making.  Dulp is diwsharged-
in jet at full pressure from the steam boiler into the store container. Waste gas heats the
water for drainingby passing through the exchanger. Pulp is -umped from the store con-
tainer to the deslagger where heavy matterA such as metal are removed, then,passing the      < -S
intermediate pulp reservoir, goes to Section 1 double net draine.In this place the pulp's
concentration is increased from 3. 5%4 at the inlet to 2534 at the outlet. Solids and resid-
ual acids are removed from the pulp to become what is called thicred sluion, part of
which is sent back to the store container to dilute the pulp and balance of wiiich is sent to
the evaporating station to be condensed as adhesive. The pulp from the Section 1 double-
net drainer goes on to the Section 2 double-net drainer and after draining the pulp is sent
to a screen, and the thin red solution is sent to the store container while the surplus in dis-
charged into the sewage pipe.
By using the above-mentioned proces, the residual acids ante of the drained pulp
is reduced from 4, 000 ppm in the store container to 65 ppm. The total recovery ratio of
solids is 69. 28%. 3034 of the solids, however, will not be recovered. This is maily

due to the limited demands of tLe market for adhesives. With the increase of the demand,
the recovery ratio of solids in the thick red solution shall be raised to over 95%, which
will be the target of the second phase project.
Adhesive Production line
The solids becomes adhesive when the sulfite pulp red solution containing 10. 4% of
solids condenses into a solution containing 50 to 51% of solids. To produce 150,000 tors
of adhesive per year requires to evaporate 1734.18 tons of water per day (72. 25 t/h).
If a simple evaporating facility is used to turn such a huge amount of water into vapor,
the amount of energy needed would be surprisingly high. The forced circulation, long
tubular or planar cavity multi-function evaporator now in use in China produces severe
scaling during the evaporating proces by heat. The main content of the scale is magne-
sium sulfate, which is not soluble in acid or alkali . hence very difficult to get rid of, re-
ducing the efficiency of evaporating process and increasing energy consumption.
For this project, the paper mill is going to use a horizontal jet film, vacuum evapo-
rator manufactured by AQVA-CHEN company in the US. The evaporator is being used
by six factories,which make sulfite pulp. In 1989 the Guangzhou Paper Mill bought a
400m2 jet film vacuum evaporator that evaporates 37. 3 tons of water per hour and pro-
duces one tone of vapor for every 4. 25 tons of water evaporated. Besides the advantages
of the average falling-film evaporator, this facility contains the thick red solution outside
the pipe while passing the vapor inside the pipe and features a powerful jet that prevents
scaing and mnakes it easy to clean the equipment.
It is planned to use a row of five-section, four-function evaporators with an effec-
tive area of 800m2 and an total area of 4, 000m2. One of the functions is cyclic
cleaning.
The type of evaporator will be finalized after an investption is made abroad.
Specification of the adhesive:
Specific weight: 1. 27/20C, pH6-7, solid content: 51%
Sulphonic acid: 8. 98%, CaO<0. 5%, MgO 4-5%
Sulphur<4 %
The evaporator station needs a floor area of 1. 500m2.

It is required to purify 30,000 tons of white watcr from the paper mill. Each year

4,600 tons of fiber and 800 tons of talcum can be recovered.
At present there are four paper making workshops: No. 1, 2, 3 workshops make
printing paper and No. 4 workshop makes white decoration paper. See the table below for
dischargcd amount of white water.
The SS in the white water from the paper making workshops mainly coritains fiber
and talcum filler. The daily loss of fiber is measured to be 13. 52 t, and the yearly loss is
up to 4,600 tons, approximately 4. 5%o.
The real consumption of talcum filler is shown in the following table.
Each year 8000. 2 tons of talcum are lost with the discharged sewage.
The following method is used to treat the white water from paper making.
In the past multi-disk, double-drum, air-suspension and slant plate recoverers were
often used to recover pulp fiber from the white water, but these methods all failed to puri-
fy the white water, letting 70%Y of SS in white water go with sewage.
See Fig. 5-3 for white water treatment flow.
For this project, it is planned to use a homo-directional slant plate settling tank
patent desinged by Changsha Design Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry. The e-
quipment under consideration features slant plate reversal current which does not block
the pulp and the capability of water purification to 0 to 30ppzn. The flow chart of the
process is shown in Fig. 5- 3
The white water from the papernaking workshops flow into the catching tank, and
then is pumped to the purifier-separator, from which it flows to the static mixer. After
being mixed with 3/10000 Alum solution, the water goes to the presettling vessel,
where, blocked by the stabilizing plate, the regulating box and the-regulating wall, white
water allows part of its fiber and talcum to slowly settle to the pulp exit funnel. After this
primary settling process, the white water passes the settling tank and flows to the slant
plate settler for further settling. NVater is used regularly to wash the slant plate to prevent
pulp blocking the flow channel. Pulp and talcum are settled again to the pulp exit funnel
and the purified water overflows from the top and is sent through the recycling pipe back
to the pulp workshop for further use. Pulp material and talcum are sent back to paper-
making workshops for redistribution or to be filtered by the belt drainer into pulp cakes
with concentrations of 25 % and upwards, which can be sold to other paper mills.

Discharge amount of dust-laden reed chips
Thie production of each ton of pulp requires 2. 257 tons of reed. 6 %/0 of reed is lDst
in cutting and screening. The total amount of reed chips is 101 ,320X 2. 257X 6V' =
13.720 t/a, which contains 7. 69%  water, and 15. 48%  dust, and has a unit volume
weight of 81. 25kg/M3 (free piled).
Output of artificial Charcoal
It is found from tests that one ton of Charcoal can be produced for every 3. 5 tons of
reed chips. Yearly output of artificial Charcoal is 4,000 tons.
Method of production
At prcsent all the rced chips are dumped into the Daling River and the SS in the reed
chips constitutes 32. 4 i;; of the total. Therefore, it is imperative to reprocess these reed
chips if SS content in the sewage is to be reduced.
Reed chips from the round screen and dust separater are colected and then transport-
ed to the material barn, from which they are distributed to the spiral extruder-former.
The extruder-former press the reed chips into the form of bars, which are sent to carbide
furnaces. After 5 to 7 hours the temperature in the furnace rises to 360 to 400 deg c; and
reed chips are being carbonized at this temperature for 4 to 6 hours and then become arti-
ficial Carbon. See lFig. 5-4.

The total manning for. both administration and operation is 173 persons, including
the original 20 workers from the draining workshop; and therefore the actual additional
manning is only 153 persons, among whom 9 persons are engaged in adminstratior, 128
persons in production and 16 in maintenanoe.
5. 3. 5  AnmtItv  to the Project for Curbing Water Pbf   . .fmd   11
Besides the project mentioned above, there are several alternative projects which are
technically feasible in controlling the water pollution caused by Jincheng Paper Mill.
5. 3. 5.1  Renovation off            _ii1
In developed countries most paper mills have replaced acid pulping with sulphate
pulping, which features a great advantage o; easiness in recovering waste solution to al-
most 95Y%. However, additional facilities are required for extraction, evaporation, com-
bustion, dust collection, and multi bleaching. To renovate an acid pulping paper mil inma
a sulphate pulping paper mill requires almost the same amount of funds as needed by the
construction of a brand new paper mill. So this alternative is prohibitively expensive.
5. 3. 5.2                  t          __
This alternative calls for chemical flocculation-bio-chernical tseatment of sewage of
the paper mill. It is technically feasible. The funds needed for the project can be ex-
pressed in the following functions
G=190. 45XS""'XQO-ss
Where:
G- funds required for the sewage treatment works                10' yuan
S- capacity of the sewage treatment works                      ktid
Q- removed amount of COD                                       kt/a
The calculated fund for this alternative is 123 million yuan RMB.

GQ-investment                  10 yuan
The operating cost for this alternative is found through calculation to be 2 4. 7 million
yuan/year. Considering the present status of China and the economic capability of
Jincheng Paper Mil:, this alternative requires large quantities of funds for capital con-
struction and a high operation cost and therefore it is unaffordable.
5. 3. S. 3 Blocking the sewage flow
In order to protect the groundwater in the sector area of Daling and Xiaoling rivers
in the lower reaches to Jincheng Paper Mill, sewage from the mill may be blocked and di-
verted to the river reaches 35 km downward from the paper mill by using civersion pipes
of 1. 0 m in diameter. This alternative would require an investment of 35 mil!ion
yuan.
Although this alternative can protect the groundwater in the sector area, it fails to
reduce the poUution load on the lower reaches of Daling River and the coastal waters.
From the pointview of ecology protection for the river and the sea, it is not a good alter-
native because, in addition of failing to protect the overall water environment. it involves
quite a large quantitv of funds.
After the above analysis of alternat,ives, it is concluded that the first mnentioned pro-
ject is the most feasible both economically and technically for controlling water pollution
caused by Jincheng Paper Mill.
6 EIA FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OF DALING RIVER
6. 1 Scope of Assessmcnt
The new waterworks of Jinzhou is located on the right hand side bank of Daling River be-
tween Liuduan and Zhutuozi. Daling River has no direct hydraulic relation to the ground-
water in this area, but its water quality can still threaten the water quality of water
sources.

ETis EIA relates to the present status of water of Dating River between Zhangji3bao
and the estuary of Daling to the sea, covering a distance of 80 km.
6. 2 Standards and Factors for Assessment
The assessment of the present status of river water is made in accordance with Stan-
dard GB3838-88 Category V.
Based on the pollutant discharge along Daling River, pollution for four kinds of pol-
lutants are selected for EIA, namely, COD, SS, oils and volatile phenol.
6. 3 Present Status of Pollution of Daling River and Its Assessment
6. 3. 1 Miethod of Assessment
The assessment method involves the use of the findings from regular surveys and
measures conducted by the Environment Survey Station of Jinzhou at the two sections at
Zhangjiabao and Xibaqian betveen 1983 and 1991, and the pollution indices for the dry
season, full water season and medium water level season. lbe following equation is
used:
C.
C..
Where:- I    pollution index of a certain pollutant
C- measured value of that pollutant (mg/I)
C,- standard limit of that pollutant (mg/1)
6. 3. 2 E:A Findings
Findings of status survey and assessment are contained in Tables 6-1( atiuto 6-6.
From these tables it can be seen that:
(1 ) The pass percent of oils in the river was 98%. In the dry season in 1990. only
in the Zhangjiabao section did the measured value surpass the limit by a factor of 0. 15.
Mhis is because the radial flow of the river in that season was extremely small.
(2) The pass percent of volatile phenol was 98%. Only in the medium water level
season in 1983 in the Xib3qian section did the measured value exceed the limit by a factor
35



of 0. 84.
(3) For COD, the situation was verv severe. It was not uncommon that the mea-
sured values exceeded the limit several times or even several dozens of times. COD, is the
worst for aU its values surpassed the limit. The out of bound ratio of CODMvalues was
88. 4 5/% in Zhangjiabao section and 100% in Xibaqian section, which was higher than
that mesured at Zhangjiabao. This was caused by the discharge of sewage into river by
Jincheng Paper Mill.
(4) The measured SS values were extremely high, the content of SS was found be-
tween 179 and 37,932 mg/l. As little ground is covered with vegetation and much water
and soil are washed away in the reaches of Daling river, the river contains large quanti-
ties of sand, which decrease from fuU water season to mnedium water level season to dry
season.
The COD value of Daling River exceeds significantly the limit set by the standard for
the quality of Category V water and this is closely related to the high content of SS in the
water. The Environment Protection Science Research Institute of Jinzhou has made a spe-
cial study of the interrelation between COD and SS of Daling River, which has proved
that the 95% COD and the 70%D COD,bare both absorbed in SS. Therefore. a supple-
mentary assessment was made of the soluble COD value after removal of SS absorption
and the results are shown in Tables 6-7 and 6-8. From the tabled results one can see that
after deduction of SS absorption, the COD=  value was still well beyond th. limit. The
out-of-bound ratio was 17% in Zhangjiabao and 31 % in Xibaqian. However, after de-
duction of SS absorption, the COD. value dropped significantly and according to the EIA
there were two limit surpassings in Zhangjiabao in full water season, one limit crossing
respectively in full water season and medium water level season, two crossings in dry sea-
son in Xibaqiaon section. All these crossings were within a factor of 1.
The high content of SS in Daling River is caused by the severe loss of water and soil
in the upper reaches. The washed-away water and soil carry large quantity of organic
natters into the Daling River. This is the main cause for the severe COD pollution at
2hangjiabao in the upper reaches section of Jincheng during the full water season.

6. 4. 1 Prediction Model for Water Quality of Daling Rlver
Daling River runs transversely across the west part of Liaoning province. Much wa-
ter and soil are washed away into the river in the upper reaches of Daling. In rainy sea-
son the water in the river rises frantically, and carries large quantities of sand. According
to the information obtained by observation and messurement, the average annual sand
content in the river has exceeded 1 Okg/mr in the past years, ranking first in China's sandy
river. Therefore, in setting up a model for water quality assessment and in considering
the general law governing river pollution, focus is laid on the impact of mud and sand on
water quality.
According to the mass conservation law, the following basic equation is
established:
a c    ac    ac '    aRIl _i an2   I                   (6-1)
a i    z    a,    a       ag i      7T7
Where: C- concentration of pollutant En river water
V- average current velocity in the cross section of the river
M- discreet coefficient
B,- concentration of suspended mobile mud and sand
02-conccntration of pushed mobile mud and sand
R- hydraulic radit;s of river cross section
n,-concentration of oollutant obsorbed on the surface of pushed mobile mud
and sand
n2-  concentration of pollutant absorbed on the surface of settled mobile mud
and sand
n3-concentration of pollutant absorbed on the surface of mud grains on the
river bed
Based on the actual conditions. the following assumptions are made regarding the
above equation:
a. The quantity of pushed mobile mud and sand is far less than that of suspended
mobile mud and sand, hence- i, =Oz
45



b. The quantitv of a pollutant absorbed by river bed mud is in direct proportion to
that by suspended mud and sand, that is, n3=b3n,
c. The quantity of a pollutant absorbed by suspended mobile mud and sand is in di-
rect proportion to the concentration of that pollutant as resolved in the river, that
is, nl=b,c
Thus, the above equation can be transformed into the following:
a .  _=, a c + A a 2c                    6
where:  = 1 + O1b1 +   bA
Since both the new waterworks facilities and the Jincheng Paper Mill are located in
the rnid and lower reaches of the Daling River, where the river is wide and shallow and
suffers from a great number of pollution sources, the above equation is solved numnerical-
ly by implicit differential method. The detailed proces of solution are skipped in this re-
port because there is not enough space in here.
The block diagram of calculation is shown in Fig. 6-1.
The implicit differential proceeds as follows: discrelize equation (2) and the follow-
ing matrix is obtained:

6. 4. 2. 1 Flow rate
Daling River has characteristics typical of rivers in north China. The change of sea-
sons has a significant impact on the flow of the river. Flow varies much over different
seasons of the year. Statistics of river flow are nade for different seasons for the Daling
Rivcr by the Hydrology Station of Jinxian County. The data supplied by Jinxian Hcydrol-
ogy Station are shown in Table 6-9.

It should be noted that there is diversion ditch in the irrigation network of Jinxian
County 500 rnetcrs in the lower reaches to Jinxian yIvdrology Station (upper rzaches to
the sewage discharge outlet of Jincheng Paper Mill). Water is channelled to the irrigation
network of Jinxian between mid April and mid September every year. The average quan-
tity of channelled water is 64. 4 million tons per vear, i. e. . 4. 87r1n/s. During the early
months of water drawing the quantity of channeled water is relatively greater than in the

According to relavant data. in sections upwards from ZhaoJiawopu of Jinxian, the
average water supply of Dating River to the underground is 11 .862mI/d - kn-; the aver-
age supply of Daling Rivcr to groundwater between Zhangjiabao and Zhaojiawopu is 4. 39
m3/s; aftar the new waterworks is commissioned. with the increase in the extracted water
quantity,  Daling  River will increase  its supply  to  groundwater  layers  to
23,286mV/d * km, i. e. . 8. 62m2/s, up 96% from precommissioning days.

6. 4. 2. 3 Statistics of pollution sources
Jincheng Paper Mill is the greatest source of pollution in the lower reaches of Daling
River. Everyday, it discharges over 60, 000 tons of paper-makin, sewage in addition to
large quantities of red water with chemical oxygen demand (COD) as high as 2963. 8
mg/l and masses of suspended matters. Table 6-13 shows the difference in discharged
quantities of pollutants before and after the completion of the project to control water pol-
lution caused by the paper mill.

The chemical oxygen demand of the sewage from Jincheng Paper Mill can be divided
into soluble and non-soluble components. The soluble component is the COD after screen-
ing the suspended matters. Before the control project. the yearly discharge of COD of the
paper mill is 65,624 tons, of which 46,593 tons per vear are soluble, constituting 71%
of the total; after the completion of the project, the discharged COD will be reduced to

6. 4. 2. 4 Verification of water quality maodel for Daling River
In order to verify the water quality model for Daling River and ensure the accuracy
of the simulation and prediction of water quality, the following calculation is done on the
water quality model.
Replace the relevant terms in the prediction model for water quality with values of
water quality and pollution measured from April 19 to 20 in the dry season in 1991. and
verify the equation. The results are shown in the following table.

From the results of verification, it can be seen that in terms of total chemical oxygen
demand, soluble COD, and absorbed COD, the water quality model has a prediction ac-
curacy of 73% and upwards for Xibaqian cross section and over 72% for Zhangjiabao
section, which is good enough for predicting water quality within a quite large section of
a one dimensional river.

completion of the project for controlling the pollution caused by Jincheng Paper Mill,
At present, Jincheng Paper Mill discharges large quantities of sewage and pollutants.
The results of water quality simulation using the model described in § 6. 4. 1 indicate a
high level of pollution in Daling River (See Tables 6-15,6-16). 'The highest COD
concentration in dry season is 117. 3 mg/h. This is because in dry season the flow of Dal-
ing River drops sharply while the discharge of sewage by Jincheng Paper Mill is in large
quanity. In full water season, mud and sand and suspended matters increase in quantity
-due to powerful washing by the river, and therefore the background value of COD be-
comes sLightly larger tan of the medium water level season. The simulated value of COD
in full water season is 76. 7mg/l, the highest of all seasons, and the value of medium
water level season is 50. 4mg/l.
After the completion of the project for renovating the paper mill, the yearly dis-
charge of sewage from the paper mill is 12. 113 million tons, only 51% of the pre-pro-
,ect period; the total COD is 20,637 t/a, 32% of pre-project value. From the prediction
one can see that both sewage and pollutant discharge will drop sharply and the pollution of
water in Daling River will decrease significantly. The -prediction indicates that in dry sea-
son the maximum COD is 60. 9mg/l, 48% lower than the present value. Thit shows the
great benefit the control project will bring. The highest concentration in full water season
is 39. 8mg/i, also 48% lower than the pre-project value. As there is less water in the
river in nedium water level season than in fiu water season, the diluting capability of the
river in the medium season is relatively weak and the concentration of suspended matters
and pollutants is relatively higher. The highest COD value is therefore 48. 0mg/I, 4. 8%
lower than the pre-project value.
6. 4. 3. 2 Analysis of the Prediction of Soluble CODw4 for Daling River
When the river is supplying water to the underground layers of earth, the soluble
components in the water (including soluble components separated from suspended matters)
may enter water-containing layers by permeation, but mxst of the elements carried by
suspended matters cannot permeate into the water-containing layers From the viewpoint
of groundwater supply, the soluble components of COD%b in the water of Daling River
can affect the quality of groundwater by permeation while the non-soluble CODum carried
by suspended matters has almost no effect on the quality of groundwater. Therefore, the
prediction of the pollution by soluble COD# before and after the completion of the pollu-
55



tion control project for Jincheng Paper Mill and the project of constructing a new water-
works is of great importance for protecting the groundwater resources in the sectors of
Daling and Xiaoling Rivers.
Table 6-14 to 6-16 give the simulation results for total CODM,at cross sections in
the lower reaches to the meeting point of Daling River and the sewage ditch of Jincheng
Paper Mill as well as the simulation results for soluble COD1and non-soluble CODn.
Simulation findings show that in the dry season of a medium water level year the
highest soluble CODun. content in the water in cross sections in the lower reaches of D.i.ng
River will drop from 36. 4mg/l before the completion of the two projects to 18. 9mg/l af-
ter the completion of the two projects, when the water quality of Daling River will im-
prove greatly in the dry season thanks to the positive effects.brought about by the pollu-
tion control project for Jincheng Paper Mill. After the completion of the new water.
works, the flow rate of the river in its lower reaches will decrease on account of the in-
creased water supply to groundwater layers, thus adversely affecting the water quality of
the river. However, this adverse effect is much smaller than the positive effect mentioned
above.
In the medium water season of a medium water year, the highest soluble COD>,,, val-
ue drops from 15. 8mg/l before the two projects to 14. 9mg/l after the completion of the
two projects. There is a decrease of 5. 7 /o. In full water season in medium water year,
after the completion of the two projects, the highest soluble CODu content in the lower
reach cross sections of Dating will be 12. 3mg/l, 48. 3%a lower than the highest. content
23. 8mg/l before the completion of the two projects.
In sum, the completion of the two projects will greatly improve the water quality of
Daling River.
6. .1. *l Stramegy of Preventing and Controlling Water Polution of Daling River
The prevention and control of water pollution of Daling Rive. should include the
preservation of the specific functions of each section of the river and protective measures
should be taken in an appropriate nmanner with regard to the different functions of Lhe riv-
er sections: the main target is to protect and improve the water quality of Dling River and
the groundwater resources. Regional planning should bt combined with planning based on
river reachle.s protection of eco,lngical environment with control of pollution. environ-
recycled paDer                      56                    ecoeg'v and enmimumenn



ment protection projects with scientific research and moritoring, and near term planning
with long term programmer, thus protecting the water quality of Daling River and the en-
vironinent surrounding it.
In the upper reaches of Daling River, work should be focused on the preservation of
ecology and the prevention of loss of water and soil while the control of pollution sources
should be enhanced. The background value of pollutants in the lower reaches of Daling
River, CODm, for example, is relatively high because the river contains large quantity of
rmd and sand which have high capability of absorbing poUutant. This is an important
feature regarding the change in water quality of Daling River. The control of mud and
sand in Daling River is art important part of the project to control the water pollution of
Daling River.
In the lower reaches of Daling River, focus should be on the prevention and control
of industrial pollution. In this area, sources of pollution are located at Jincheng Town
and Dalinghe Town. The Jincheng Paper Mill in Jincheng Town is the principal pollution
source for the Daling River. The sewage discharge from that paper mill constitutes 70 %
of the total from Jinzhou. In ternm of pollutants (COD) discharged , the paper mill pro-
duced 97. 1% of the total of the city. Therefore, the most iperative target in control-
ling the pollution of Daling River is to control the sewage discharge from Jincheng Paper
MM.
The above analysis indictes that the strategy of preventing and controlling the water
pollution of Daling River should take into account both the preservation of ecology and
the control of pollution sources. Based on the specific conditions in the Jinzhou reaches of
Daling River, plans for pre-venting and controlling water pollution shall be implemented
in three phases, near term, mid term and long term.
Near term1 This is the first project for controlling water pollution caused by
Jincheng Paper Mill The project starts with the renovation of the pulping technology, in-
volves the use of the red pulping water to make adhesive, the recovery of white water and
the use of reed chips to make artificial Charcoal. After the completion of this project, the
paper mill will reduce its discharge of COD, by 44.987 tons, suspended matters by
34,422 t-, and sewage by 30, 000m, enabling the city to reduce its discharge of COD into
Daling River by 66. 5% and sewage by 31. 2%. This project plays an important role in
improving the water quality of Daling River, protecting the new waterworks at Liuduan
57



and improve the quality of the coastal waters. It will brlng huge benefits to the environ-
mnent. Tbe project is scheduled to complete by the end of 1994 and the total fund required
for capital construction is 56. 55 million yuan.
Mid term: This is the second project for controlling water pollution cused by
Jincheng Paper Mill. The targets of the project Include the continuation of recovering the
red water for comprehensive use and the construction of a bio-chemical sewage treatnent
station at the paper mill. After the completion of this project, the discharge of sewage
from the mill wiil be up to the standards. The total fund required for the project is 40
million yuan.
In addition, sewage control projects will also be implernented for Jinxian Paper Mill
and Jwnxian Chemical Fertilizer Factory. The objective is that the sewage from these two
places shall be tread up to standards before it is discharged. The fund needed by the pro-
jet is 15 million yuan.
In addition, sewage control projects will also be implemented for Jinxian Paper ;1ill
and Jinxian Chemical Fertilizer Factory. The objective is that the sewage from these two
places shall be treated up to standards before it is discharged. The fund needed by the pro-
ject is 15 million yuan.
After the cornpletion of these mid-term projects, the discharge of COD into Daling
River will be reduced by 17,300 t/a, and the discharge of COD from the entire city will
be down 92. 1%.
Long-term project: This is the Dalinghe Town Sewage Treatment Station project.
Tte station is rated as Class I station which is able to treat 60,000m2/d of sewage. The
project involves an investment of 20 million yuan.
Water and earth conservation project for Daling River reaches: In order to th.or-
oughly improve the water quality of Daling River, it is necesary to carry out the project
for conservation of water and earth at roaling River reaches, which aius at reducing the
amount of soil and sand washed away by the river and the organic matters carried with
the soil and sand. The project for water and soil conservation at the Daling River reaches
will have to be organized by the relevant local governments and coordinated by authorities
at higher levels. Water and soil conservation is a long-term task requiring a lot of persis-
tance. Tne whole project needs a fund of about 600 million yuan.

7 ASSESSMENT OF UNDERGROUND WATER ENVIRONMENT
7. 1 Scope of Assessment
Scope of Assessment of underground water includes the valley plain of Daling River
and Nuer River in the urban district of linzhou City with an area of lOlkrn2 and the fresh
water zone in the niddle and upper part of the Daling and Xiaollng Rivers fan limited in
the front edge by the salt water boundary where the water source is located, covering an
area of 911k1n2. The hills and valleys outside this area the salt water distribution area in
the front edge of the river fan are not assessed.
7. 2 Assessment of Present Status of Underground Water Environment
7. 2. 1 Status of Underground Water Resources
7. 2. 1. 1 Underground water reserves and its changing conditions
7. 2. 1. 1. 1 Underground water in Xiaoling River Valley
Underground water in the urban district of Jinzhou City is mainly stored in the val-
ley flat and stream terrace on the banks of the Xiaoling River and Daught River, cover-
ing an area of I Olkm2. The water-bearing stratum is mainly a gritstone formation with a
thickness of 4-12m. Above it is sandy clay and sandy soil with a thickness of 2-3m
and below it is base rock. Underground water is stored at a depth of 4-8m. Water Sup-
ply of a single well is normally 1. 000-3, ,OOOm/d. Water-bearing stratums in the hill,
valley and slope area are thin and unstable, containing very small amount of water. Wa-
ter supply of a single well ir. this area is less than 500'-100m/d. having no value for
providing central water supply.-
Underground water is replenished mainly by seeping rain water and river water and
also by underground water runoff from upper river valley. Seeping irrigation water and
city sewage water provide little replenishment. Underground water in this area is mainly
extracted by nanual recovery with a small amount flowing out in the form of under-
ground water runoff.

7. 2. 1. 1. 2 Underground water in Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan
This area can be dividud into two subareas according to different underground water
storage conditions and hydraulic nature:
Ground water-bearing area: It is located at the top of the Daling and Xiaoling Rivers
fan and the whole Xiaoling River fan, covering an area of 400km. Te water-bearing
stratum is made up of gritstones deposited in the early and midddle Pleistocene with a thick-
ness of 30-60m, increasing gradually from northwest to southeast. It is covered at the
top by sandy clay and silty sandy soil formation with a thickness of 3-1Om. The aque-
ous stratum in the river valley flat is directly exposed. The aqueous stratum has a good
water permeability. Water supply of a single well is normally 3,000-10D,000m3/d and
reaches 10, 000-20, 000m3/d at maximum. Underground water is stored at a depth of 3
-8m.
Double-layer water-bearing area: It is located in the middle of the Daling River
fan, covering an area of 410km2 and containing a shadow and a deep aqueous stratum.
'The shadow aqueous stratum is composed of deposited gritslones of the early Pleistooene
and has a thickness of 20-40m, the top plate of the water separation s;tatum being lo-
catod at a depth of 10'-20m. Water supply of a singlet well is 5,000-10O,OOOms/d.
The deep aqueous stratum is made up of gritstones of the middle and late Pleistocene and
has a thickness of 20-60m. The top plate of the water separation stratum is located at a
depth of 50-80m and made up of clay of thc middle Pleistocene with a thickness of a-
15m. Water supply of a single well from this stratum is 1. 000-5.  OOOm/d. The shad-
ow and deep stratums have a similar water head and water depth is normally 3--5m.
The new water supplies project is located between Liuduan and 7hutuo, in the tran-
sitional zone of ground water and double-layer water. The hydrogeological structure is
shown in Fig 7-1.
7. 2. 1. 2 Underground water\ supply resource
Underground water suppply resource is calculated by adding amounts of various sup-
plies based on balanced verification of water supplies. Tbe amounts of the following water
supplies in typical years ae calculated respectively: penetrated rain water supply, pene-
trated river water supply, penetrated irrigation water supply, penetrated sewage water
supply and undeground water current supply. The supply resource is represented by the
total amount of various supplies.

7. 2. 1. 2. 5 Calculation of penetrated sewage water quantity
It is calculated using annual amount of sewage discliarge and a penetration factor
which is 0. 15-0. 20. Calculation results are summarized in Table 7-1.
It can be seen from the calculation results that underground water supply resource
(average in many years) amounts to 514, 503, 800 m3/d, Xiaoling River valley ac-
counting for 56. 756, 400 ml/ a and Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan for
457,747,400m3/a with a supply modulus of 560,000m'/a.  kin2.
7. 2. 1. 3 Underground water recovery resource
Underground water recovery resource is calculated and assessed on the principle that
suplus supply will make up for short supply and advantage of the regulating capability of
the water-bearing stratum will be taken.
The average thickness of the aqueous stratum in the Xiaoling River Valley plain is
small, only 7. 85m. The storage resource is 158,570, OOOM3 when it is calculated with a
supply factor of 0. 20.. As the aqueous stratum has a small regulating capacity and most
of the present water sources recover underground water on a continuous basis, the
amount of supply is less than the amount of recovery in dry years. To ensure normal re-
covery, water stored in the aqueous stratum will be extracted, thus causing drop in water
level. When calualtion is made on the basis of three successive dry years, to keep dynam-
ic water levcl of extraction wells within the rnax. permissible drop, it is desirable to take
average underground water supply resource as the recovery resource, i. e, the recovery
resource would be 56,600,000m3/a (155,000ms/d).
The underground water recovery resource in the Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan is
calculated by using an established mathematical model of water quantity. The recovery

According to the environmental problems that appear after completion of the water
source and requirements for estimation of impact of Daling River water on the water
quality of the Liuduan Wate Source, principles for the assessmnt are estabLished as fol-
lows 2
7. 3. 1. 1 As the underground water quantity model (finite difference value simulation)
for the Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan is set up for estimation of ten average years (P=
50%) and three semi-dry years (p = 80%), the estiration of impact of Daling River
Water on the water quality of the Liuduan Water Source is also for a period of 13
years.
7. 3. 1. 2 For the estimation of impact on water quality of the Liuduan Water Source,
based on the actual data, each as the pollution factors obtained from analysis of the Dal-
ing River water and the degree of non-compliance of single factor content, COD and
CjHsOH are selected as the estimated factors of water quality of the Liuduan Water
Source.
7. 3. 1. 3 According to the equilibrium domain of node No. 317, the supply quantity of
Boundary 1 (ground-water area) and the initial concentration of the estimated factors in
the Liuduan Water Source section obtained when the underground water quatity model for
the Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan is set up, the supply quantity in Boundary I (node
No. 317) and the coucentiation of the estimated factors (to be calculated), estimation is
Tade with linear relationship.
7. 3. 1. 4 When estimating impact on water quality of the Liuduan Water Source, water
quality in mediumyear (P=50%) and semi-dry year (P=80%) is estimated according
to the water quality in dry, full water and medium water seasons.
7. 3. 1. 5   Eetiration and assesswent should be made of impact on existing water
sources, suction well failure area and ecological environrment.
7. 3. 1. 6 The area where Fe and F content in the underground water of Daling and Xi-
aoling Rivers fan exceeds standard is mrainly located to the south of the southern fan, out-
sid the impact of the Liuduan Water Source. As it has no impact on water- quality, it will
not be assessed.
7. 3. 1. 7 When the water quatity model for the Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan is set
up, the southern salt water-fresh water boundary is established with a positive slope.
Therefore .o environmental problens will be caused by penetration of sea water. This

Bw4ed on the supply of river water to underground water in lBoundary 1 of equilibri-
um domain in node No. 317 and the average initial concentration of the estimated factors
(COD and C6HsOH) in the Liuduan Water Source section determined when the water
quactity model for the Daling and XiaoLing Rivers fan is set up, the supply quantity in
Boundary I of equilibrium donain in node No. 317 (see Fig. 7-6 for its location) in the
dry. full water ani medum water seasons in me&um water years (P=50%) and semi-
dry years (P=80%) caleulated according to requirements for the prediction of impact on
water quality of the water source when Recovery Plan I is inputted into the water quan-
tity and concentration of the factor for water quality estimation, the foflowing, water
quality estimation equation is established with a linear relationship.

Where Qi is the supply (m3/d) from Boundary I determined when the equilibrium
donain in node No. 317 in i season, is predicted;
Q.e( is the supply (m3/d) frotn Boundary I determined when the model for
the equilibrium domain in node No. 317 in i season is set up;
C.() is the initial concentration (mg/I) of the esfimated factor in i season in
the water source section:

stable valley being 0. 83 mg/I. All peaks (high concentration) appear in the medium
water seasons, ranging from 1. 13 to 1. 31 mg/I, stable peak being 0. 25 mg/l. Stable
COD concentration in dry seasons is 0. 103, ranging from 0. 93 to 1. 10 mg/I. COD
concentrations in the three seasons in 10th year (medium water year) are estimated to be
1. 03, 0. 83 and 1. 22 mg/l with an increase in concentration of 0. 53, 0. 36 and
0. 59 mg/l. Concentrations in 13th year (semi-dry year) are estimated to 1. 10, 0. 87
and 1.31 mg/I for the three seasons, with an increase in concentration of 0. 60, 0. 40
and 0. 68 mg/I respectively.
It can be seen from the shape of the estimated CJHsOH concentration curve that val-
leys and peaks also appear in full water season and medium water season respectively.
Valleys change from 0. 0018 to 0. 002 mg/I, stable valley being 0. 0019 mg/I. Peaks
are in the range of 0. 0023- 0. 0027 mg/I, stable peak being 0. 0025 mg/l Stable
CgHsOH concentration in the dry senson is 0. 0023 mgjI, changing from 0. 0020 to
0. 0024. As estimated in the medium water year, C.H.OH concentration in 10th year are
0. 0023, 0. 0019 and 0. 0025 mg/l respectively for the ftree seasons, with an increase
of 0. 0013, 0. 0009 and 0. 0012 mg/l. As estimated in the dry year, concentrations in
the three seasons in 13th year are 0. 0024, 0. 0020 and 0. 0027 with an increase of
0. 0013, 0. 001 and 0. 0014 mg/I respectively.
The water quaiity esmation results for the liuduan Water Source section show that
the estimated COD concentrations in the three seasons in mdiuum water years and semi-
dry years do not excoeed the standard, while the estimated C4HOH concentrations do not
exceod the standard in full water seasons, but slightly exceed the standard in dry and
medium water seaso  by 0. 0001-0. OD06 mg/l It is therefore concluded that the D31-
ing River water has little impact on the underground water quality.
7. 3. 2. 2 Assessment of impact of depth-dropping field on existing water soures, suc-
tion wells and ecological environment
Recovery Plan is made according to the Report on Daling and Xiaoling Rivers Fan
Underground Water Quantity Model Study as follows: industrial recovery is set at
760, 000 m3/d, agricultural recovery at 600, 000 mS/d, i. e. recovery resource is set at
77
recycled paDer                                         ruhwg and neminmmet



1,360,000 m3/d. See the fcllowing table for details.
When the Recovery Plan is inputted into the underground water quantity model for
the Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan, it can be seen from the results of ten-year water lev-
cl prediction based on mcdium watcr year (P= 50 Yo) that dynamic watcr lcvcl will be-
come stable after 2-5 years of water recovery and dynamic water level at the center of
existing water sources will change as shown in Table 7-9. At the end of three successive
dry years, water level will drop by 0. 5-0. 3 m along the banks of Daling River and by
0. 3-1. 2 m in other areas, compared with that in the medhum water year.
It can be seen from the above table that depth drop for the existing water sources at
the end of the second medium water year is normally 1. 93-3. 48 m and 4. 82 m (Sui-
fl .ng water source) at maximum. Thus impact on existing water sources is small.
According to the results of the ten-year water level prediction based on medium wa-
ter year (P=50 0), suction well failure area (at a depth great than 8 m) is mnainly in
Wangjialou, Jincheng Town sections and in the southwestern sections of Liuduan-
Xinzhuangzi and Wuqi (see fig. 7-8 for details). The total suction well failure area is
62. 1 kM2, 31. 0 km2 in the area west of the Daling River and 21. 8 kin2 in the Liuduan-
Xinzhuangzi sectiqn. At the end of 13th year, the suction well failure areas in the
Wangialou and Jincheng sections will join together, covering an area of 35. 9 kmn. Suc-
tion well failure sections southwest of the Liuduan-Xinzhuangzi, Bozi and Wuqi sections
wil also connect together, covering an area of 84. 3 knm (see Fig. 7-9 for details). Suc-
tion well failure area is shown in Table 7-10. It should be pointed out here that connec-
tion of suction well failure areas only occurs in 3rd successive dry year (P=80%o). Wa-
ter level in the whole area wiU rise in full water year, reducing the failure area to that in
medium water year.
Whether the ecological environment will change in the suction well failure area is an
environmental problem of common concern. This question can be answered by actual in-
vestigation. Rainfall in 1989 was only 418 r-mm and suction well failure occurred in May
and June in WangiiawopuOXi nzhuangziULiuduan. Bozi, Yaotur and other villages. But no
trees or crops were found withered due to water level dropping to below 8 m. indicating
that the ecological environment in the suction well failure area is nornmal.
The unsatuated section in the Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan is mainly composed of
sandy clay and sandy soil with a thickness of 3-8 m. As the capillary elevation height of

the sandy clay is 3. 0-3. Sm as indicated in Table 7-11, provided that underground wa-

(submerged depth-capillary height). This section is almost in a saturated state. As the
optimal penetration depth of rain water in sandy clay is 6 m, rain water is sure to pene-
trate to the depth of the capillary elevation section. When it rains, water will move
downward from the surface. When there is no rain, it will go up to the surface (unsatu-

7. 3. 3  Prediction of Impact of the Project of Curbing Water Pollution Caused by
Jincheng Paper Mill on Underground Water
After the project of curbing water pollution caused by the Jincheng Paper Mill is
completed, the river water environment below Jincheng section will be improved. As the
escape caned will be flooded in full water season, the pollutants in the canel will affect
water quality of the Liuduan Water Source. So concentrations of COD and CjisOH in
underground water in full water seaon are predicted, while their concentration in the dry
and medium water season will remain unchanged.
Equation for the prediction of impact of Daling River water on water quality of the
Liuduan Water Source section is as follows
c1= Q. C.1                             (7-2)
C _ Q.C.(.)
Q.(.)
C(i  =    * C.                        (7-3)
Where C,(,)-the predicted concentration (mg/1) in i season based on the river
watcr pollution level after the curbing water potlution preject is completed;
a  -     the average correction factor (determined according to poUutant
flux reduction rate).
Other symbols are the same as those in equation (7-1).

tion (3). Predicted concentrations in dry and medium water seasons remain unchanged.
Prediction results are given in Table 7-12 and Fig. 7-10.
It can be seen from the shape of COD concentration curve for Liuduan Water Source
water quality prediction that valleys range between 0. 40 and 0. 45 mg/l wlth a stable
valley at 0. 43 mg/I. Compared with the COD concentration valleys for the presenat wa;r
quality prediction, the increase ranges between -0. 36 and -0. 42 mg/I, increase in stable
valley being -0. 40 mg/I.
COD and Ci-sOH simulation results show that after the curbing water poUution pro-
ject of Jincheng Paper Mill is carried out, COD concetration in the water of the water
source will be reduced by 0. 4 mg/l in full water season and there is no impact in dry and
medium water seasons. After the curbing project is carried out, no impact will be pro-
duced on CQHsOH content in the water of the water source.
7. 4 Determination and Protection of Water Source Protection Area
Liuduan Water Source protection area is deternined according to the area of depth
dropping field and the planned recovery of underground water in Liuduan at
10,000 r3m/d which is determined using water quantity model for the Daling and Xiaol-
ing Rivers fan (see Fig. 7-11 for details).
The protection area covers an area of 4. 9 km2. In this area, river section in Bound-
ary 1 is 1i,141 m long. Protection recommnendations are as follows:
7. 4. 1  Trees should be planted all over the water source protection area. No garbage or
poisonous materials are allowed to be stored there. ht is strictly prohibited to use
sewage water to irrigate farm land.
7. 4. 2   It is strictly prohibited to discharge sewage water to the river banks of Boundary
1 in the water source protection area. Existing pollution sources should be con-
trolled and sewage water should be discharged according to national discharge
standards.
7. 4. 3  ln the river section between the hills where Daling River panes to noed No.
316, sewage water should also be discharged according to national discharge
standards.

water monitoring network should be set up and dynamic water level and quality
monitoring should be strengthened for the purpose of guiding rational recovery
of underground water.
7. 5 Conclu3ions for the Assessment of Underground Water
From assessment of Xiaoling and Nuer River valley plain in the urban district of
Jinzhou City and underground water environment in Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan
where the water source will be built, we have drawn conclusions as follows:
7. 5. 1  Thbe assessed area has underground water resource of 515,000,000 m3/a,
57,000,000 m3/a in Xiaoling River valley and 458, 000, 000 m3/a in Daling
and Xiaoling Rivers fan. Underground water recovery resource amounts to
577, 000,000 m3/a,  of  which   489,000,000-   527,000,000 m'/a
(1,340,000-1,440,000 m3/d) in Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan, central
recovery  accounting for 840,000 m3'/d and distributed recovery  for
500,000-600,000 mJ/d.
7.5. 2  Underground water in Daling River fan and part of Xiaoling River fan is up to
the drinking water quality standard. Single-item non-compliance area is mainly
located in the middle and front edge of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers fan where Fe
content exceeds standard 1-10 times. Two-item non-compliance area is located
in Xiaoling River valley plain and the front edge of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers
fan where Fe and F- content exceeds standard 1-5 times. Underground water,
in Xiaoling River valley is seriously polluted, oil content along the river and
COD and SOW in part of the section near the river exceed standard. The above-
mentioned non-compliance areas are far from te downstream of underground
water flow to the suggested water source and therefore will not affect the water
source.
7. 5. 3  It can be seen from the prediction results of impact of river water on the water
quality of the water source that the impact of river water on the water quality of
the water source is small. Prediction results of underground water level dropping
in existing water sources show that little impact will be produced on existing wa-
ter sources.

7. 5. 4 Prediction results of depth dropping field extension in Liuduan Water Source
show that suction well failure area after three successive dry year wiU be larger
than that in medium water year, but it will reduce and restore to the medium
water year level after fuUl water year has come. No change in ecological envi-
ronment will take place in the suction well failure area.
7. 5. 5 The water source protection area Is determined according to the predicted results
of the water quantity model. It Is neesary to strengthen the water environmen-
tal protection work in the protected area, so as to ensure the nornul exploitation
of water sources

8. 1 Scope of Assessment
Bohai is a half-closed sea bay. Iiaodong Bay is situated in its north, the shores are
bounded by Jinxi, Jinzhou. Panjin, Yinkou and Dalian areas. Daling River enters into
Liaodong Bay somewhere near north latitude 45-52' ,east longitude 121-35' , the water
depth of the sea area near the river mouth is 2-4m, belonging to sea areas of a shallow
sea. The scope of this aessment is on the sea areas bounding the river mouth of Daling
River.
8. 2 Standards and Factors for Assessment
In Liaodong Bay, in particu!'r, on the beaches close to Xiaoling River mouth, there
are many artificial breeding farms for raising prawns. therfore, lhc_uudard of fii-kind

and Jinxian. Due to the drainage of organic matter brought from soil erosion, industrial
polluted water and living polluted water, the river water carries a great amount of poUut-
ing matter into the sea. Jincheng Paper Mill is one of the Important pollution sources a-
long the river. After the start of the pdlutibri-WIeF t?e&tlent p?Bjeet, Snd eOSideftlin

As seen from Table 8-2 and Table 8-3, during the full-water period of Daling Riv-
er, due to the increase in rate-of-flow of river water, the polluting matter brought along
increases, the COD value of the sea area near river mouth increases relatively, the COD
pollution index is higher than 1, reaching 2. 35, the COD density of seawater exceeds the
standard. During the dry period, as the river water rate-of-flow decreases, the COD den-
sity of seawater decreases correspondingly, the pollution indexes are all lower than 1. the
COD indexes of sea area near the river mouth all reach seawater standard of the first
kind.

The computation of Liaodoa Bay sea area tidal currents and polluting mattc  diffusion is
rade using the ADI (alternating direction implicit ) method established by J. J.
Leenaertse, to find the numerical solution of the continuity equation, momentum equa-
tion and diffusion equation of the sea area.
The genemal form of momentum equation and continuity equation for shallow sea
tidal current may be written as:
a u 4         .uU+   ai+1vaU=F_  1 ap +  1 ar,           (8-1)

In the computation the step-length of differential network is 100 m. step-length of
time is 480s. Since in Liaodong Bay the half-day tide is irregular, so it is treated as a
full-day tide. 24 hours make up a computation period. The computation is shown in

The diffusion equation is also solved using the ADI method, adopting the same alternating
network coordinate system as in the tidal current numerical value computation. For flow
speed and water level, the tidal current value and tidal positional value outputted from the
7-th computation period in the tidal current computation are used.
8. 5. 2 Prediction of Impact of the Project on Sea Area Environment
After the start of the pollution-water treatment project of Jincheng Paper Mill, the
quantity of COD into sea in full-water period from Daling River decreased to 221,866. 3
kg/d. Considering that the impact of Daling River in full and dry periods on seawater
quality is typical, so a diffusion numerical model is used to conduct the present state mod-
elling and prediction computation of seawater quality in full water and dry periods. The
comparison of water quality in sea area near the river mouth after the start of the
Jincheng Paper Mill pollution water treatment is shown in Table 8-4.
As seen from Table 8- 4, during the full water period and dry period, after the start
of the Jincheng Paper Mill pollution water treatment project, the water quality of sea area
near Daling River mouth is improved. The inprovement of water quality is more evident
during the fuU water period critical to seawater breeding.

For assessment of the present state of atmospheric environrnent the single factor pol-
lution index method, excess standard rate computation method and combined index
method are adopted. The single factor pollution index method is presented as follows:
I = Ci/Co
where: I- pollution index
Cl- monitoring value
CO- standard value
The expression of excess standard rate computation method is as follows:
recycled oaper                     98                    "le! wtit enxir.i.-,



m=Xl0          TNXIODo,
Where: m-  average excess standard rate in a day
Xl-  number of average excess standards in a day
n- total number of average values in a day
X2- number of excess standards at any one time
me-  excess standard rate at any one time
The expression of combined index method is as follows:
I =  ;(Co)    1z  C.
Co    IL,  Co
Ihe meaning of symbols in the expression is the same as before.
The result of monitoring and assessment of the present state of atmopharic environ-
ment is shown in Table 9-2, 9-3 and 9-4. The assessment results show, that Sulphuric
dioxide pollution in Jincheng Mill and the surrounding atmospheric environment is not se-
rious, the average pollution index value in a day is 0. 04-0. 20, the maximum pollution
index at one time is 0. 009-  0. 52. Nitrogen oxide density at monitoring points is low.
The total suspension particle pollution is obvious, the average pollution index in a day is
0. 6-7. 57, manimum pollution index at one time is 0. 24-5-. 25, the average excess
standard rate in a dry reaches 90%/, excess standard points are numerous and it is the
principal polluting matter in atmospheric environment of the said area. Its source not only
comes from Mill production, but also from the dust in the main comunication lines. Both
the combined pollution index (Table 9-5) computation and the classification of atmo-
spheric environment quality (Table 9-6) show, a single T. S. P would put the atmospher-
ic quality of the said area into a warning state, into a leveL of intermediate pnllution.

9. 1. 4. 1 Analysis of impact of construction prooess on atmospheric environment
The Jincheng Paper Mill Treatment Project and the Jinzhou Water Supplies Removal
and Reconstruction Project was a great amount of construction machinery and transporta-

fore in the construction process various pollution matters polluting the atmosphere wiLl be
produced, besides, the vehicles and machinery in construction will raise considerable
dust. Sand and stones laid in open areas, and the dug-out earth and stones will also raise
dust under the action of the wind. The pollution matter on atmosphere wlU posibly be
S02,NO., CO, dust etc.
Due to te lack of materials about the construction process, the present assessment
on the impact on atmOspheric environment during constuncion process is madc in only
qualitative description terms.
The construction area in pollution treatment of Jincheng Paper Mill is confined with-
in the boundaries of the old mill, during construction process, the pollution matters on at-
mosphere are.drained off disorderly, the principal pollution matters are S0, CO released
by transportation vehicles, and dust raisd by them, as well as the combustion gas pro-
duced by construction machinery. The above-said pollution matters are produced in con-
struction process in qeurral. Since the construction takes place inside the boundaries of the
mill,it will not yield impact on outside atmophere.
The construction in the water supplies project includes the foundation structures,
well-drilling and digging and laying of water network pipelines, the construction is con-
fined to points and lines, all of them are situated in open-air agricultural areas, there-
fore, the construction process is considered to yield certain impact on the surrounding at-
mospheric envirorment but not very serious.
9. 1. 4. 2   Analysis of the impact of the construction  project on atmospheric
environment
The statistical materials of wind speed, wind-direction frequency for five continuous
years provided by local neteorological station and a pollution coefficient in a certain di-
recon defined as the ratio of a wind-direction frequency in certain direction to the wind
speed of tat direcion, are used to describe the paible degree of poUution in the down-
stream wind direction, the statistical results are shown in Table 9-5. lag 9-5 sham'
that the still-wind frequency is 15. 2 Y%, the dominant wind direction is SSW, the direc-
tion second to the dominant one is NNW and N. The statistical result of pollution coeffi-
cient frequency also reflects the fact that, the pollution coefficients in the dominant wind

direction and in the direction second to the dominant one are much higher than those in
other directions. The rose chart of wind direction in that area and rose chart of pollution
coefficients are shown in Fig 9-2.
The drainage of atmospheric pollution matters in the project is characterised by the
fact that, the charcoal stoves work all the year round, while the coal-burning boilers of
the watcr distribution plant only work for warmth during winters and the coal burning is
relatively slight, therefore, in the atmospheric poUution diffusion computation only the
naximum falling to ground pollution density and its corresponding distance are consid-
ered, and a computation model from the GB3840-83 "Technical Principles and Method
for Formulating Drainage Standards in Local Atmospheric Pollution Matters" is selected.
The 30-minute maximum ground density in down stream wind direction of an isolated
srnoke funnel is computed by the following formula:

The drainage of the atmospheric pollution matters in the three principal construction
projects are shown in Table 9-8 and Table 9-9.
According to the research materials in Tany environmental assessment reports of the
Jinzhou area, the diffusion parameters of atmosphere a l , 2, y4.and Y2 are identical with
the recommended values of GB384 0-83, therefore, in the computation the recommnended
values of national standard are adopted.
Computing a partial derivative of wind speed from the nmximum failing to ground
density and setting it to be zero ( aC/aU =0), an expression for average wind speed
U0 at the exit of the smoke funnel is mnade:
Uo = {Ko[P( ' +        1!)-l]/dHf)"
a2
Fitting Uo into the corresponding value at a height of 10 meters from the ground, we get
the critical wind speed, it is also called the dangerous wind speed. Substituting the critical
wind speed into the formules for maxnmum falling to ground density C.. and the corre-
sponding distance X,.. to get the maximum value among all density values, we get the ab-
solute maximum density. The computed result of dangerous wind speed is 1. 4 m/s. Con-
sidering the principal pollution matter in the atmospheric pollution source of the present
project. the absolute maximum falling to ground densities and correspponding distances
for SOz, 112S, T. S. P and CO are computed. They are shown in Table 9-10.

sity with the standard values it is evident, the impact of the three atmospheric pollution
sources on atmospheric environznent is very slight, we consider that there will be no im-
pact on atmospheric environment after the two projects are completed.
9. 1. 5 Suggestions on Control Measures in Atnuspheric Pollution
There are three principal atmospheric pollution sources in the water source removal
and reconstruction project and the Jincheng Paper Mill curbing poUution treatment pro-
ject. In the water source project two coal-burning boilers are added, in the curbing pollu-
tion water treatment project a charcoal stove for producing artificial charcoals is added. In
accordance with related regulations the boilers are selected from finalized products suiting
the atmospheric protection requirement, the installed dust remover should meet the re-
quirement on boiler smoke drainage as set down in the DB91-GO--89 "Drainage Standard
on Polluted Water and Waste Gas of Liaoning Province". In boiler operation, manage-
ment should be strengthened, the dust removing facilities should work normally. The
charcoal stove is a thermo-mechanical facilities which carbonizes the carbon-containing
grasses and wooden materials to produce carbon raterials with a high heat value, the car-
bonizing process is a process that makes the mnaterial to volatilise combustible organic mat-
ters in a certain temperature in a reduced environment ( inadequate oxygen ) and dry-
distill a large amount of carbon. Therefore, this prooess requires that the waste gas
drainage is completed wholly by natural draft of the smoke funnel. Considering the great
amount of waste gas, the stress of preventing atmospheric poUution should be laid on rais-
ing the height of the smoke funnel under the condition that charcoal stove operation is not
affected, so that -smoke and gas can diffuse into a higher space.

9. 2. 1 Scope of Assesment
Since the Jincheng Mill curbing water pollution treatment project will be built 50 m
deep inside the mill, and there will be noise reduction measures for the main project facili-
ties, and the new and old building structures will be separated , the irnpact of noise of this
project on surrounding environment will not be considered , therefore , the scope of as-

sessment on project noise will not be defined.
In the present assessment the scope of assessment on noise impact is taken to be the
space within the straightline distance between the water source project pressure-pumping
station building , the water distribution p1ant pumping building and the nearest population
points.
9. 2. 2 The Standards for Assessment
For the noise assessment in water source purnping station the population area stan-
dard of the GB3096-82 n Noise Standard of Urban Districts Environment " is selected.
The water distribution plant is situated about 200m in the south side of the communication
truniline --the National Highway 102, so for the assessment the standard for the sides of
communication trunkline is selected.
9. 2. 3 Assessmnent of the Present Status of Noise Environment

moods the standard by 3dB(A), and the night time noise of 3' point exceeds the standard
by 1dB(A), the noise of other points is lower than the standard value, therefore, the

Table 9-13 shows that the pumping station noise exceeds the National Standard, the
noise comes mainly from the large water pumps. The noise in area of water distribution
plant and that between this plant an.d the National Highway 102 confornrs to the require-
ment of the standard. The impact of comnunication noise from the National Highwa.
102 on the surrounding enviromnental area is relatively great.
9. 2. 4 Anldysis of Impact of the Project on Environmental Noise
9. 2. 4. 1 Analysis of impact of the construction project on environmental noise
The water source pumping station and the water distribution plant are cor
be a point source respectively, the noise strength are 77dB(A) and 55dB(A

ly. The computation of noise attenuation along the straightlinc distanee between the
pumping station which exceeds the standard and the ncarest population area is conducted
and the lowest protection distance is determined. Thc computation formula is
L, = 1 - 20lugr - 8
where: L,-noise level attenuated when r distance is neached dB(A)
L-noise level of a point source, dB(A)
r-distance to a predicted point sour,c (m)
The pumping station is lOOm away from the neasest populatiors asea, the computa-
tion result indicates that the noise level of the pumping station as attenuated at the nearest
population area is 29dB(A). When the night time equivalent level at population are is
taken as 40 dB(A), the computation result on the lowest protection distance is 28. 2m, i.
e. on the straightline distance 28. 2m outside the wall of the pumping station. The values
of equivalent noise level can meet the standard requirement.
9. 2. 4. 2 Analysis of impact of construction process on surrounding environmental
noise
During the construction of the water source project, the construction machinery and
transportation vehicles will produce noise, the above two kinds of noise appear in the
form of point source and line source, respectively. The noise strength produced by vehi-
cles is related not only to the strength of the source, but also to the distance between the

puted according to the city noise standard. Computation results are shown in Table
*       9-~g15.
Table 9-15 computation shows that the car siren will bring greater impact to the sur-
rounding environment, especially within a distance of 50m, but in view of the fact that
the geographical positions of the two construction sites of water source project are in the
countryside and the out skirts of the city with a small population, the noise imapct during
the construction period is considered to be small.
Since materials describing the impact of construction mnachinery noise in construction
sites are lacking, the impact of it is not considered in the present assement, but we think
it will not exert a great impact in noise to the surrounding environment.
9. 2. 5 Nolse Prevention Measures
T he project noise mainly comes from the machinery of the pumping station and the
pumping room of the water distribution plant. To prevent noise, in treating noise source
on the one hand, low-noise facilities should be used, shock-reduction cushion on large
machinery foundation should be laid, stretching/contracting joins for shock reduction
should be installed in water pump entrance and exit, in the doors and windows of duty-
rooms double-window panes should be installed for sound insulation. In treating noise
propagation on the other hand. planting broadleaf arbor trees inside and outside the
pumping station and water distribution plant walls should be considesed in order to make a
sound insulation screen.
During the construction process, when the transportation cars run through the popu-
lated areas, the speed should be lowered and sirening should be prohibited to reduce imn-
pact of communication noise on the population as far as poesible.

10. 1. 1 Analysis of the Impact of the Water Source Removal and Reconstruction Pro-
ject on the Economic Development and the Living Quality of the People In
Jlnzhou City
The present water-supply system of Jinzhou is already far from meeting the require-
ments,especially as the economy develops and the people's living standard rises, the re-
quired amount of city water rapidly increases,so the water source removal and recon-
struction project becomes more and more urgent, it affects the economic development and
the raising of living standard in Jinzhou city.
The present state and prediction of water usage,water drainage and industrial output
of the exploited area and the urban area of Jinzhou are shown in Table 10-1.
As seen from the table,the quantity of water used by the industry is 161,O000m' per
day,the industrial output is 4,950,000,000 yuan. According to the prediction,in 1995.
the water used by the industry will increase to 247,000 m' per day,the industrial output
will increase to 6,540,000,003 yuan, water used by the industry will increase
86, DOOm3 every day. If living water is added .it is predicted that the water deficit per day
will reach 98,900m'.
If new water source is not constructed in Jinzhou before 1995, and besides,the wa-
ter source is more polluted, a serious water deficit will come about, which certainly will
affect the industrial development. Some new and big industrial projects will not be able to
start due to the restiection caused by the water deficit. Thus the economnic development of
Jinzhou will be restrained, and the strategic plan of economic development of Jinzhou in
1995 will be hard to realize.
Ihe water source removal and reconstruction project is very important as viewed
from the rising living standard of the people. The present state and predietion of living
water usage in the urban area and exploited area is shown in Table 10-2.
From the table it is seen,the average amount of water used per day per man 162
litres in 1990. In 1995,the predicted average amount of water used per day per man will
reach 180 litres,the population will also raise from 569,000 in 1990 to 629,000. Rapid
increase of living water usage require the construction of new water source and the raising

of water supply per day, to meet the constant increase in people's living.
Summarising the above,we see that the water source removal and reconstruction is
important both from the viewpoint of industrial development and the rising living standard
of the people. Its construction will provide adequate water supply to Jinzhou City and the
industry will rapidly develop on this basis, people's living standard will be raised continu-
ously.
10. 1. 2  Analysis of the Impact of WatCr Source Removal and Reconstruction Project on
Employment Problem
After putting into production in 1995, the water source removal and reconstruction
project not only will promote economic development and the rising living standard, but
will also provide to the society more employment opportunities.
After putting into production ,i, will add 87 employees.among them 9 are adminis-
trative personnel, 51 are pumping station employees, 36 are Damu Water Distribution
Plant employees.
The social benefit brought by the water source removal and reconstruction project is
enormous. Especially after its putting into production, broad employment opportunities for
the society will be brovght about due to the rapid development of industry.
The calculated industrial output after its putting into ptoduction basing on the num-
ber of employees and workers and the labour productivity of 1990 shows that in 1995 ,the
number of employees and workers in the urban area of Jinzhou will reach 453,200 ,an
increase of 110,000 in comparison to that of 1990. Considering the progress of science
and technology, up to 1995, the employees and workers will increase at least 55,000 due
to the direct and indirect impact of the project and the average increase of employees and
workers is over 10,000 every year,so that rate of unemployment will decrease obvious-
ly. In general,the project will directly or indirectly provide more employment opportuni-
ties for the citizens of 3   .z.ah_
1. 3  The Impact of Water Source Project on The Dminage
Load of Jinzhou City and the Measures



10. 1. 3. 1 The impact of the water source project on drainage system of Jinzhou City
and the corresponding measures.
After putting into production in 1995, the water source project will greatly increase
the load of the Jinzhou drainage system. At present ,there exist serious problems in the ur-
ban area drainage systeni, water-logging appears when torrential rain comes. The stan-
dard of the city's trunk canals is low,the drainage capacity is small, water-collecting fe-
cilities are distributed irrationally ,and the draining capability is poor. Now the municipal
government is reconstructing the drainage network,and the reconstruction network will be
completed before 1995,which will increase the drainage system capacity.
A prediction is mnade in the amount of industrial water in use and the amount of wa-
ter drained in Jinzhou urban area on the 1990 basis with due consideration to structural
adjustment of industrial products ,technological reform and technical progres factors. The
predicted results are shown in Tables 10-S3 and 10-4.
From the tables it is seen that in 1990 the drainage of industrial water in Jinzh  ur-
ban area per day is 136,900m3,the total drainage is 218,000m3 per day . It is predicted
that in 1995 drainage of industrial water is 210.000m3 per day,the total drainage is
289,839ms per day,therefore,in 1995 the amount of drainage will increace 71,839ms
per day. In the table the predicted drainage of the two pollution exits,Houwuli and Chang-
tunhe,is smaller than the present drainage, this is caused by the combined effect of prod-
uct structural adjustment and technological reform in the nearby factories.
The plan of drainage and pollution water treatment of Jinzhou Cty is shown in the
attached figure.
At present the drainage network of Jinzhou can only reach drainage capacity stan-
dard of p= 0. 25'-0. 5 year, therefore, for the drainage capacity to reach a standard of
P= 1-2 year to meet the requirement in water source removal and reconstrucion project
and the sudden torrential rain draining,two projects,the. building of stop-flow ditch in
Renmin Street and reconstruction of covered ditch in Shiyin Street,will be conducted,the
total funding for the projects is 9,010,000 yuan RMB.
After its putting into production in 1995,the urban area will be divided into Shiyin
drainage area(Shizhen west eXit), Renrin drainage area (Qunyi exit) ,Weidong drainage

area( Weidong Road exit) , Wuli drainage area(Wuli exit)and Jinfang pollution exit,
First Chemnical Plantexit, Xiaobagu pollution exit, Changtunhe exit, Nuerhe exit, and
Baigouhe exit. The drainage capacity of the drainage areas and pollution exits is shown in
Table 10-4.
As seen from the table, the capacity of water drainage of the reconstructed water
drainage network greatly exceeds the pollution water drainage of the pollution exits. The
flow capacity at Weidonglu exit drainpipe reaches 1,382,400m3 per day,while that of
Houwangli exitis as high as 2, 592, ODOm3 ,all exceed the pollution draining amount. The
poUution water drained from the First Chemical Plant exit, Lingchuanxi Plant exit and the
First Medical Plant exit do not enter into the city drainage network, they are drained di-
rectly into Xiaolinghe.
Tberefore,after putting into production of the water source project, although the
amount of pollution water greatly increases, the reconstnucted pollution water network is
capable of receiving it, the reconstruction plan of Jinzhou Drainage network wholly meets
the requirement of the constructed water sources.
10. 1. 3. 2 The impact of water source project on Jinzhou City pollation Load and the
corresponding mreares.
After putting into production of the water source project,the total amount of water
used and drained in Jinzhou will greatly increase. The drainage of pollution will increase
correspondingly. A prediction is made on drainage of principal pollution matters with due
consideration to the factors of industrial reform, technical progress and product structural
adjustment. The predicted results are shown in Table 10-5.
As seen from  the table, up to 1995. the total drainage of COD will reach
38,471. 56kg/d,the drainage amount increases 11,958. 5kg/d, the change rate is 31Yo;
total drainage of oils will be 1,863. 5kg/d, the increase is 52. 72kg/d,the change rate is
2. 82%; the drainage of volatile phenol will be 102. 43kg/d, the increase is
64. 197kg/d, the change rate is 63. 46%. The drainage of COD and volatile phenol is
relatively great,but pollution from oils is relatively slight.
In order to reduce the amount of pollution matters in the drained polluted water
Jinzhou City adopts the following measures.

The water drainage plan of Jinzhou exploited area is that the area is divided into two
areas with the pollution water treatment field at the center; the Gaoqiao, Tianqiao North
and the beach tourist recuperative areaz is the first pollution water drainage system ,and the
Port area,Tianqiao and Wangjiawopu is the second pollution water drainage system. In
the near-term plan a 30,000m3/d pollution water treatment field will be constructed,in
the long-term plan a 100, 000 m'/d treatment field will be constructed.
The drained pollution water of the whole area will be treated by the said treatment

fields,and will be drained off after reaching the standard. It will not pollute the nearby
surface water iground water and the sea area.
10.1. 4  Anmlyus and Objt of Impact of the Used Land of the Water Source Projet
The used land of the water source project includes the land used for water-fetching,
pumping station and transportation pipelines, water distribution plant and water distribu-
tion pipes. The pumping station occupies 2. 2 hectares of land and is situaed in thz north
side of the Baduandongbu village road(farmnand) ,the transportation pipeline does not run
through the village and needs no removal of residences. The water distribution plant will
be built in the north side of Damu distribution plant, the construction occupies 2. 2
hectares of land.
The perranently requisitioned land of the pumping station and water distribution
plant will change the purpose of land use permanently, causing a minor change in the e-
cological environment of the surrounding area. For example,the plantation area will de-
crease, noise influerce of plant will ernerge,the resting ground for wild animals and in-
sects will decrease.
The construction of the transportation pipeline will change the earth layers ,the earth
fertility will decrease,the cultural produce of the next year will be affected. At the same
time,the construction will affect the tillage of cultures.
In sum,the land used for water source project will exert a negative influence on sur-
rounding environment,affecting the economnic benefit of the nearly farmers, therefore,
during the project a certain fund will be used for compensation,at the same time,af-
forestation will be conducted in the two requisitioned areas to reduce environmental ef-
fects and to gradually recover agricultural production along the transportation pipeline
area. Expenses for various land usage are shown in Table 10-8.

10. 2. 1 Assessmrnent Analysis of the Secondary Pollution Caused by the Use of Glutinous
Agent
To protect the water source of Daling Rirer ,the waste water drained from production
in the present project iS to be used in a eombined way. Ir pulp making a multi-section re-
verse washing by double- network pulp- washing machine will replace the present pulp-
*   washing method by washing pond. In the recorery of thick red liquid for producing gluti-
nous agent, it is planned to produce 50.000 tons of glutinous agent yearly.
The glutinous agent produced in the pollution water treatment project of Jincheng
Mill is mainly sold to the zinc production plant,etc in lluludao for nodulizing iron ores.
The glutinous agent contains a certain quantity of sulpnuric salts like magnesium disul-
phate, Hydrogen disulphate etc. These salts enter the furnace with ore nodules for baking
and smelting, in the process of smelting and burning a certain quantity of S02 gas in pro-
duced; accounting for a yearly production of 150,00; tons of glutinous agent, and a
recorery of 2,178. 38 ton/d of thick red liquid,the burning process of glutinous agent
will produce 6. 97 ton/d of SOz. (SOz is accounted to be 0. 32 % of the thick red liquid),
i.e. 2,544t/d.
2,178. 38X0. 32%=6. 97t/d,or 2.5-1-4t/a
When the glutinous agent is used in zinc plant (byproduct sulphuric acid), the
SO2 produced in the baking proces and that produced in the baking process of fine zinc
ores will be used to produce sulphuric acid.so it will not yield secondary pollution.
129



When the gultinous agent is used in plants not adopting recovery of SO2, the plan;,
should increase S02 treating facilities, otherwise secondary pollution will take place.
10. 2. 2- The Impact of the Treatment Project on Natural lAndscape of Daling River
Although Daling River is a river with a foul water ,the landsepae in arews beyond
Jincheng is not disagreeable. When the pollution water from Jincheng Mill enters, due to
the great amount of suspension particles,reed crumbs and the blackish waste water that
nmixes. into the river,the surface of the river is spread with reed crumbs, fluffy matters,
the color of the river water becomes mixed in black and yellow,causing a very disagree-
able appearance. On the left side of river beach,the pollution drainage canal of Jincheng
Mill Shed an odous from suspension particles and the residual S02,it is nauseating espe-
cially in the rainy hot weather.
After the start of the treatment project ,on the surface of Daling River there are no
more crumbs,the suspending flaffy matter in river water becomes slight with the recovery
of filres,and the water colour approaches that of upstream, the odous of the beach also
greatly disappear. In gereral,after the start of the project,the landscape of Daling River
greatly improves.
10. 2. 3  Analysis of Impact of the Treatment Project on Employment Problem
After the start of the treatrnent project, Daling River pollution is not only alleviated
and certain economic benefit created ;the employment problem of personnel is also solved.
For full utilization of production waste water, four workshops are to be built in
Jincheng Mill: workshop for recovery of thick red liquid; workshop for glutinous agent;
workshop for recovery of white water and workshop for artificial charcoal. An increase
of 150 people for employment. So after the start of the treatment employment problem for
153 people will be solved, which alleviates the pressure of social labour force.

Source Project
The impact of the project on the society, economy and environment is broad. Table
11-1 gives an environmental impact matrix of the project. In the matrix, the upper right
of diagonal represents the level of environmental impact.the positive and negative signs
represent positive and negative impact respectively, the number represents the grade of im-
pact, 4 indicates "very big" .3-"Relatively big", 2-"normal", 1-"slight". The lower part
of the matrix represents the kind of "impact" ,ST-short term,LT-long term,R-reversible,
IR-irreversible, L-small scope, W-big scope ,and A-negligible.
The positive impact of the water source project on social economy and environment
is very great, the main aspects are supply of unpolluteddrinking water to the city people,
so their health will not be harmed by water pollution,provision of potential or direct eco-
nomic and social benefits,such as the supply of water resources by the new water source
to economic and social development, provision of employment opportunities directly or
indirectly to the people,etc. After putting into production of the project.it brings a nega-
tive impact on ground surface water and underground water. Palliating measures should
be adopted to the above negative impacts. It should be noted also,that due to the supply
increase the water load and pollution load of the city's drainage system will increase, cor-
responding plan and adjustment measures should be adopted to prevent the emergence of a
series of new environmental problems.
11- 1. 1  Environmental Palliating ].-asures and Economic Assesment
The social and ecmornic benefit of the water source project is long-term and great,
but during its construction and after its putting into production it necessarily exerts a cer-
tain negative impact on surrounding environment.
During construction ,the building of suction wells, pumping stations, water distribu-
tion plant,the installment of transportation pipelines and the transportation of raw materi-
als will partially change the soil structure,a part of plantation cover will be damaged.
During construction, the living pollution water of personnel, the smoke and gas a
coal burning boiler and the noise of pumping station will exert certain influence on the
surrounding water and atmospheric environment and environmental noise. But the above
said pollution rmatter produced bv this proe.s is verv small.and it is far away from the

rcsidential area in the farm fields, therefore, the impact on surrounding environment is
not great.
in normal operation of the project, the underground water level decreases due to the
drawing of a great amount of ground water ,so the pressure wels of the surrounding area
will no more function in the years of medium water level 0p=50%;) ,thc area of pressure
weUs that loses function- will be 62. lkrn2,for a continuous three-year arid period (P=
80%3 the area that loses function will reach 84. 3kM2. At present,in the two villages of.
the area, Xinzhuangzi and Jianye tap-water facility has been set up ,so there will be no
influence on the living of the population. Also ,since the area is mainly composed of gluti-
nous soil,andsand and stone soil,the lowering of underground water will not cause change
in ecological environment of plantation cover.
It is necessary to emphasise the fact that due to the construction of water source pro-
ject,besides increasing water supply to Jinzhou urban and exploited areas, the water and
pollution loads of the city's drainage system also increase correspondingly ,see Table 11 -2.
Te palliating measures adopted to control,eliminate and compensate the above-said
influence on environment and the needed funds are shown in Table 11-3;
The increase of pollution load and the increase of the amount of pollution water not
only increase the funding for the pollution water field to be built , but also increase
1.1,800,000 yuan of operation cost every year (not including depreciation) of the pollu-
tion water treatmentfield to be built.
11. 1. 2  Assessment of Economric Benefits
After the project operation reaches designed capable city,a profit of 5,859,000
yuan will be gained every year,the fund repayment p.riod is 7. 2 years. The principal in--
dicators of water-supply income,tax,profit,etc are shown in Table 11-4.
As seen from the sensitive analysis of the project, when the factors of the item's
funding,water-supply price, operation cost,production load,etc,are within the variation
limnit of 10% ,the internal profit rate of funding is higher than 8%,indicating that the fi-
nancial hazard-proving capability is relatively strong.
In addition,after completion of the project, the industrial water-supply of Jinzhou
will be guaranteed.so the indirect economic benefit is enormous. Accounting for a con-

sumption of 205 tons of water per 10,000 yuan output and if industrial consumption oc-
cupies 60%  of the water supply, the increased production value every year wil be
1, D68,000,000 yuan accounting for a 20% profit tax rate, the profit tax will increase
214,000,000 yuan,and accounting for a contribution rate of 8% to the above-said fi-
nancial income by water-supply profession,the net industrial profit produced every year
will be 17,000,000 yuan.
It is thus seen that the benefit of the project is obvious.
11. 1. 3 Comparison of Environment Palilating Expenses to Econonmc Benefits
Due to the fact that the project will yield a certain negative effect on the environ-
ment,in the present section the economnic benefits are compared to the environmental pol-
liating espenses to evaluate the total benefit of the project. The direct economnic benefit
brought about by the project is calculated on the basis of 20 years. the profit produced is:
585. 91X(20-7. 2)=75,000,000 yuan;the tax is 9,510,000 yuan;for indirect eco-
nomic benefit, 17,090, 000 yuan/year is taken as a basis. It is 341,800,000 yuan. In
the 20-year depreciation period the total economic benefit is 426,310,400 yuan.
Table 11-5 gives a comparison result of project's economic benefit to the environ-
mental palliating expenses in a period of 20 years.
As seen from Table 11-5 the econonic benefit produced by the project can comnpen-
sate the expenses of environmental palliations.
Combining the enviromnental,econonidc and social benefits, it is deemed that the
project is reasonable and feasible.
11. 2 Assessment of Environmental and Economic Benefits of Jincheng Pa-
per Mill Pollution Treatment Project
The influence matrix of the Jincheng Mill treatment project is show in Table 11-6.
11. 2. 1 Assment of Environmental Benefit
The Jincheng Mill pollution water treatment project is a critical environmental pro-
tection project ftat protects round water resources of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers, in-
proves the water quality of Daling River,protects the water area of Daling River and the
ecological environment of the sea. It has obvious environmental benefits.

11. 2. 1. 1 After Completion of the project, the drainage amount of poUution water from
Jincheng Mill decreases 49%, COD  decreases 68.55%, SS decreases
81. 2 Y% ,thev are shown in Table 11-7  and 11-8
Due to the great decrease of pollution load in downstream of Dalingbe, the environ-
ment of Dalinghe downstream area is obviously improved. The prediction of change in
water quality in downstream Xibaqian section is shown irTable 11-9.
Table 11-7 showns that in normal water period COD density is increased, this is due
to the fact that Dalinghe water penetrates into underground water in a great quantity, so
the stream flow of ground surface water greatly decreases, and the density of pollution
matter increases correspondingly.
11. 2. 1. 2 After completion of the project, the pollution water and the water quality in
downstream underground water of Dalinghe convergence is improved. Becans; the water
source is situated at Liuduan upstream of the river mouth where pollution water enters, in
the upstream section the Dalinghe water supplies to the underground water only horizon-
tally, so in both medium water and dry periods there will be no influence on the water
source. During full water period, when the flood causes the pollution water convergence
with Dalinghe to go upstream, up to that beyond Zliaojiawopu section, the pollution wa-
ter mixes with Dalinghe horizontal underwater supply. After completion of the project,
during full water period, the COD density of underground water in the water source will
decrease 0. 12 mg/I. compared to that before the completion of the project. and density of
C6H5OH will decrease 0. 0003mg/l.
In generel, the improvement in water quality of Liuduan water source after the
completion of the project is not great.
11. 2. 1. 3 After completion of the project due to the big decrease of pollution matters
drained from Dalinghe into Liaodong Bay, the ecological environment of the sea is well
protected. The change of water quality in sea area hear Dalinghe entrance is shown in

drained into Dalinghe greatly decrease, the color of pollution water becomes pale, which
obviously improves the natural landscape of Dalinghe, and at the same time, the strange
odour produced by the silt-up organic matter on the beach (especielly near the pollution
draining ditch) greatly alleviates.
-1 1. 2. 1. 5 The proem of production of artificial charcoal in the project will yield a cer-
tain quantity of smoke and gas, since their quantity is relatively small, the influence on
surrounding atmospheric environment is not great.
11. 2. 2 Asessmcnt of Economic Benefits
Through the measures of technological reform reequipment, closed-cricuit circula-
tion and combined utilization etc. , the pollution water treatment.project of Jincheng Mill
changes harm into henefit, changes wastes into values, and fundamentally controls the
drainage of poUution water and th' principal pollution matters of the mill.
'he project will produce glutinous agent 150, 000 tons, artificial charcoal 4,000
tons yearLy; recover paper- making white water 10,200, 000 tons, paper pulp fibre
4,600 tons. and talcum powder 8,000 tons yearly. The economic benifit is impressive.
The analysis of various economic indicators is shown in Table 11-11.
As seen from the table, the scope of the project is big, funding is great, in a certain
period after its putting into production, the loans from domestic and foreign countries
must be repaid, a temporary econmic burden will be laid on the mill. As the loans are
gradually repaid, its econornic benefit emerges more and more. After normal aperation,
the project will gain a profit of 7,751,000 yuan yearly, the period of fund recovery is
15 years

EnviriornenLil mnanagement is a measune to solve environmental problems. and to
coordinate the relation between social economic development and the environment. The
following management rules are put forward basing on the characteristics of the water
source removal and reconstruction project and Jincheng Paper Mill pollution water treat-
ment project.
Conmmunication management rules during construction
Many transportation vehicles are used during the construction of the two projects,
the vehicle sirens must be strictly controlled. Night traffic is prohibited. The vehicle noise
should be reduced to a mimnimum.
Asphall innapcnent rules during contruction:
Asphalt is used in great quantities during construction, it sheds harmful gas and
smoke when heated. therefore the use of asphalt should be strictly coiitrolled, the heating
position should be selected rationallu to bring the least harm to the population.
Boiler management rules
Adhering to the principle of the "three simultaneities" in the project construction and
enviroment facility, the boilers built in the water so irce project must be equipped with
suitable equipment for elimination of smoke and dust, the height of smoke funnel must
meet the requirements. The normal operation of smoke and dust elimination equipment
must be guaranteed.
Management rules for Chloride workshop and the use of Chlorine gas
The training of personnel on the post of Chloride gas employment must be strength-
ened, those not qualified must not be allowed to attend. There should be strict prevention
measures against leak of Chlorine gas. The safetv of working personnel must be ensured.
there should be warning equipment and method of elimination leaks.
Training rules
I o raise the level of environmental management and vocational standard of environ-
mental protection, thd working personnel must be trained regularly, the sense of environ-
mental safetv must be raised. The personnel conducting environmental monitoring must
participate in a regular quality check, to ensure the reliability of monitored data.
Management rules for the I three simultaneities" of environmental protection of the

project
The control of fund usage during the "three simultaneities" construction period of
environmental protection must be strengthened. Work must be checked. At least one
check every month, the records must be closely examined, probliems encountered in the
checks must be reported in time and corrected in time.
Management rules of environment in construction sites
Tne surrounding environrment of the construction sites must be protected during con-
struction to prevent the damage to natural environment, prevent and alleviate the pollu-
tion of dust, pollution water, wastes, noise, shock, etc of construction to the surround-
ings and population areas. Before completion of the construction the damages caused to
the environment during construction must be repaired and recovered.
Environmental monitoring and reporting rules In project operation period
To ensure the quality of the new water source, not only strict environmental moni-
toring rules are needed besides, if pollution accident appears or extraordinary condition
emerges, timely report must be made to the responsible departments to adopt effective mea-
sures.
The construction of the water source project lays a burden to the task of externel en-
vironmental monitoring, special duty monitoring personnel must be added.
In the Jincheng Mill treatment.project additional monitoring personnel must be added
to the original staffing of the monitoring station.
12. 2 The Monitoring System and the Content of Monitoring
The positioning of monitoring points is an importart link in monitoring, the opsitions
of monitoring points is directly related to the amount of information of the invirornment
quality and the accuracy of the information. The determination of monitoring points re-
flects the environmental quality in the two projects. In accordance with this it is suggested
to establish. The monitoring points in the following areas.
12. 2. 1  Mlonitoring Points and Systems of the Water Source Project
On the rightside shore of Zhaojiawopu section is Dalinghe establish three observation
145



wellsof 20m, 40m, 65m depth (1,2.3 of Fig 12-1 ) to continuously monitor the
change of water quality of the underground water-supply. If abnoimality is discovered,
report in due time. This monitoring will be carried out by environmental department of
1iZe project.
12. 2. 2  Monitoring Points and System of the Jincheng PoUution Water Treatmcnt Pro-
12. 2. 2. 1 Monitoring of pollution drainage exit
Monitoring points are established in Jincheng Mill pollution drainage ditch exit (4 of
Fig 12-1), (The pollution water ditch under the bridge). Routine check wiU be done ev-
eryday. A continuous monitor will be conducted every season, the sampling interval is 2
hours. It should be well arrange in accordance with labour and equipment, for a eontinu-
ous moritoring of 24 hours. The task will be earried out by Jincheng Paper Mill.
12.2.2. 2  Dalinghe monitoring
Routine monitoring points (6 of Fig 12-1) will be established in Zhaojiawopu, to
conduct monitoring during dry, medium and full water periods. It is suggested that the
task be carried out by municipal environmental moritoring department.
12. 2. 2. 3 A monitoring point will be established in the pollution drainage ditch at
Thaojiawopu (5 of Fig 12-1). 3-5 sampling points may be established according to the
width of the river. At least 5 sampling should be made in one monitoring. The task wil
be carried out by Jincheng Paper Mill. The positions of the above-said points are shown
in Fig 12-1.
12. 2. 3 Items of Monitoring
The water source project is used for supplying living water to the people, so the reg-
ular items of tap water must be monitored, at the same time, it is necessary to monitor
the waste water pollution drained by Jincheng Mill treatment project, the items for moni-
toring are CODw,CODo, oils, phenols. The monitored itemns of Jincheng treatmnent pro-
ject are COD,,, CODa oils, phenols, pH, quanitity of blow.

12. 3 Monitoring Instruments and the Condition for Conducting Work
The following analytic insuments are needed for carrying out the above-said task2
1/10, 000 balance, electric stove, spectro-photometer, electric conductici insider, pH
meter, 751 spectro-photometer and regular gLass utensils.
The fullowing eonditions for work must be ensured. There should be environmental
department, laboratory, instrument room, in the laboratory there are ventilation and op-
eration tables.
12. 4 Environmental Management Organs
To ensure the task of the above-said environmental management, in the water
sourc project full-time duty environment protection organ should be estblished, the en-
vironmental protection organ in Jincheng Mill should be strengthened further.
13 MEASURES ADOPTED FOR POLLEMION TREATMENT
UNDER EXTRAORDTNARY CIRUMSTANCES AND SUGGES-
TIONS
13. 1 Accidental Drainage from Jincheng Pollution Water Treatment Pro-
ject and the Adopted Measures
13. 1. 1 AccIdenlal Drainage of Pulp-naking Thick Red Liquids and the Measures for
Treatment
The main content of treating the pulp-making waste liquid is to recover the thick red
liquid to produce glutinous agent. According to the engineering analysis, after completion
of the pulp-making waste liquid treatment project, the total amount of thick red, liquid
treated per day is 2,178. 38 tons, the design adopts an imnported spray-film vacuum e-
vaporator. Since the maintenance requirement for the evaporator is hign, the condition of
thich red liquid evaporation process is poor, if due to some cause the evaporator stopc or
works abnormally, the thick red liquid may be drained off without treatment, the great

amount of pollution matters thus drained will cause serious pollution accident.
In accordance with the practical circumstances of the plant, it is impossible to add a
standby evaporation facility, so the following measures are suggested.
13. 1. 1. 1 In order to prevent a short-term accidental drainage of thick red liquid, it is
suggested to add a thick red liquid storage pond for accident. The effective volume of the
pond should not be smaller than that for a drainage amount of 12 hours . V/hen tempo-
rary accident occurs in the production of glutinous agent, the thick red liquid is poured n-
to the accident pond, and be treated after production returns to normal.
13. 1. 1. 2 If the glutinous agent can not be recovered after 12 hours, the whole pro-
duction work of the pulp-making workshop should be stopped.
13. 1. 2 Abnormal Drainage of Artificial Charcoal Project and Recovery of White Water
and the Suggesions for Treatment
For recovery of white water in the present project a slant-plate sinker is used. Since
the treatment technology is simple, if nanagement is strcnthened and the operation rules
a: seriously observed, there should not be serious accidents.
If trouble occurs in the reed-crumb recovery equipment of charcoal production, it
will cause an accidental drainage containing dust and reed curmbs, therefore, on the basis
of strengthening the management of reed-crumb recovery equipment, paralel standby e-
quipment should be added, storage volume should be increased so as to prevent accidental
drainage.
13. 2    The Possible Emergence of Accidental Drainage from  Chlorine
Adding Process in the Water Source Poroject Water Distribution
Field ana its Treatment Measures
The newly-built Danmu Water Distribution Plant in water source project consumes
100kg/d of sterilised Chlorine gas, normally, 4. 17 kg of Chlorine gas is added per hour.
149



In normal circumstances, a tiny amount of leakage is allowable in the Chlorine equip-
ment, for the Chlorine shop a forced ventilation is employed, and since the leakage is ex-
tremely slight, in normal circumstances the tiny amount of Chlorine in the drained atmo-
sphere should not caus obvious effect to the environment.
The Chlorine adding equipment operates continuously for long periods, and if the
operation and naintenance of the equipment is incorrect, accidental leakage of the equip-
ment will emerge, and if it is not discovered and corrected in time, a large amount of
Chlorine gas will be drained into the atmosphere, shedding influence on the atmspheric
enviroment and causing serious pollution accident.
In accordance with the Chlarine technology, the following measure are suggested.
13. 2. 1 In order to discover Chlorine gas leakage timely, and control the anount of
leakage to a minimal scope, Chlorine leakage warning measures in the Chlorine
ps storage of Chlorine workshop should be adopted.
13. 2. 2 All-enclosed forced ventlation should be instaled In Chlosrine workshop to en-
sure that all the leaked Chlorine gas enters Chlorine gps treatment equipment
through wind- induction system, to prevent an uncontrollable area source
drainage.
13. 2. 3  Adopt a highly effective treatment of absorption of Chlorine gas by lkali, to
- ensure an effective treatment of high density Chlorine gas of accidental
drainae, and ensure a drainage after reaching the standard.
14 CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
14. 1 The deposited fan areas of Dalinghe and Xiaolinghe of Jinzhou con-
tain abundant underground water resources. The underground water
of the said area is not only the whole water supply source of Jinzhou
urban area, but also one of the water sources for Panjin and Jinxi
150
rescycId DaDer                                         nhjimiiCif1fti.m



cities. The underground water of the said area occupies an extremely
important position for the three cities, and Jinzhou in particular.
Protection and rational-exploitation of underground water of the said
area is an important problem concerning the econornic development
and people's health of Jinzhou, Panjin as well as Jinxi.
14. 2  Dalinghe and Xiaolinghe are two main rivers flowing through the de-
posited fan area of Dalinghe and Xiaolinghe. Due to the fact that all
the industrial waste water and living pollution water of Jinzhou urban
area drains into them, the volatile phenols, petroleum oils and
CODE,,quantity has exceeded the GB3838-88V standards. The soil
erosion at upstream of Dalinghe is great, the organic matter brought
by it causes the river water CODm, exceed the standard (Category V
of GB3838-88) and when waste water of Zincheng Mill enters into
it, the water quality of Dalinghe downstream becomes worst, during
the seven-year dry period from 1985 to 1991 the average amount of
CODm,,reached 143 mg/i and up, exceeding the standard 13. 3 times.
Under its infulence the chemieal oxygon demand in sea area near the
river mouth was as high as 7 mg/l, exceeding the third category sea
water national standard (5 mg/l).
14. 3  40% of underground water supply in fan area of Dalinghe and Xiaol-
inghe comes from Dalinghe and Xiaolinghe. The pollution of the two
rivers has already caused an impact on the fan area underground wa-
ter. In the urban area along the Xiaolinghe river bank (irncluding
Nuerhe) to the west of the fan area and the banks downstream as well
as the irragation area, the underground water in shallow layers is al-
ready polluted by petroleum oils, CODm., etc. Seasonal stop of water
151



supply has emerged in some part of urgan area water source due to
this pollution. Before the solution of Xiaolinghe pollution, it is not
suitable to build new drinking water source in the said areas. Al-
though the broad central area of the fan area and the east area are
threatened by Dalinghe pollution, because the glutinous soil water-
separation layer is relatively thick, the quality of undergrourd water
at prcsent is still good. The suggested new water source is situated in
the central part of the said area, and since the F,Fe excess standard
area (which is harmed by nonartificial pollution, such as geological
conditions, etc) is situated in the downstream of the suggested new
water source and is far away from the deeping-sinking funnel after
the exploitation of the new water source, so the excess standard area
will not cause influence to the newly built water source.
14. 4 Jincheng Mill is the principal pollution source of Jinzhou section of
Dalinghe the pollution load occupies 95% and up of pollution load
drained to the river by Jinzhou City. Having cortrolled the pollution
load of Jinzhou Mill. The pollution load of Jinzhou City to Dalinghe
is basically controlled. After completion of the Jincheng Mill treat-
ment project, the CODcv drainage amount of the Mill will decrease to
20,637 t/a from the present 65,624 t/a, a cut of 68. 55%, so the
CODc, drainage to Dalinghe by the city reduces 66. 5 %; the SS re-
duces to 7,963 t/a from the present 42,386 t/a, a cut of 81. 21%;
the pollution water drainage reduces to 33,185 t/a from the present
65,122 t/a, a cut of 49%, so the drainage of the city to Dalinghe
reduces 31. 2%. The Jincheng Mill treatment project is extaemely
important in Jinzhou City PoLlution Control Plan and The Dalinghe
Pollution Treatment Plan.

14. 5 The Jincheng Mill treatment project starts from the technological re-
form of pulp-making. Changes wastes to values, utilization is con-
ducted in a combined way, water is economised by circulation, and a
two-section reverse-flow washing by double- net pulp- w;ning ma-
chine is adopted, spray-film vacuum evaporator is used, the technol
ogy is advanced and relialle, the predicted results of the project is
thus ensured.
14. 6  After completion of the Jincheng Mill treatment project, the down-
stream water quality of Dalinghe is obviously improved. Computer
imitation results show that during medium water years, the
CODm. average highest quantity in dry period downstream will reduce
48 Y in comparison to that before completion of the project, in medi-
urm water period, it will reduce 5. 7 %o , in full water period it will
reduce 48. 3%. At the same time. the water quality of sea area near
Dalinghe River mouth will improve, in full water period COD"" val-
ue will reach 4. 39 mg/I. reducing 27. 4% compaFed to that before
reform, the underground water quality also will improve. The water
qudity of dry and medium water periods in the suggested water source
will not change much. After completion of Jincheng. Mill treatment
project, the water quality of water source removal and reconstruction
project is guaranteed reliably.
14. 7 The Jincheng Mill treatment project will bring a certain negative im-
pact to the surrounding environment. This is the noise and dust
caused by transportation vehicies during construction and the tail gas-
es produced by artificial charcoals. But the impact is short-term and
153



of smell-scope.
14. 8  The water source removal and reconstruction project is conducted to
meet the requirements in Jinzhou's economical, socicl development
and the rising standard of people's living. After completion of the
project, it will promotc the development of Jinzhou economy. In the
depreciation period of 20 years, the computed economic benefit, af-
ter reduction of expenses for environmental palliation, will at least be
120,000,000 yuar. The living water for the people will rise to
180 1/man * d from the present 16. 2 I/man * d, which directly
raises the quality of people's living. The completion of the project not
only provides to the society employment opportunities, but also,
since it will provids necesscry conditions for social development, it
will indirectly create employment opportunities for the society. In
sum, the water source project has a great economic and social bene-
fit.
14. 9  According to the calculation of capillary rise height and the best sup-
ply depth of the riverstream and the many years investigation of eco-
logical environment of the present water source, after the completion
of the water source project, it is considered that the project will not
yield obvious impact on the surrounding ecological environment.
14. 10 After the completion of the water source project, together with the
impact of other water sources, it is posible that the pressure wells in
a certain part of area will lose effect, during the dry period in medi-
um water years, the area that loses effect will be 31 ki2, during
drought period for three continuous years, the area will reach 84. 3

kim2. So it is suggested that the construtLCion uinits zind deprtments
concerned shoull considier the water problem o' users Vwho have not
vet installed tap water (lig deep weli or install tap water).
14. 1 1  After completion oi the water SOLirce project. due to the increase in
upstream supply of Daliinghe which causcs a decrease in downstream
water. th  pollultioll matter densitv in river waler will rise:. which
will offset the cI'fect of the Jincheng Mfill project in a certain degree,
but the impact is not big.
14. 12   After completion of *he water source project. the imount of used
water greetly increases in thc urban and expoited arcas, the amount
of citv pollution water and the pollution load also rise, if the con-
struction of pollution project is not taken urgentiv, the water quali-
ty of urban area of Xiaolinghe as well as the do-wnstream section
and the irrigation area will become worst, which will cause serious
pollution to the underground water in the west fan area. even will
cause more water supplv stops from the present water sources. So,
it is herebv suggested that the Jinzhou City Government, besides us-
ing the founding provided bv the World Bank for the water source
project and the Jinzhou treatment project, should collect funds to
carrv out the "Plan for Pollution Control of Water Sotirce Protec-
tion Project in the Fan Area of Jinzhou Linghe Fan Area", in order
to prote ct the water sourcc.
14. 13  During the water source project the constuction work and the envi-
ronmental management work in operational period should be
strengthened, so as to control various local pollution sources. The
155



monitoring work on waterhead source ( boundary of first category)
should be well conducted according to the monitoring wells defined
in the present report. and it is also suggested that environmental de-
partments take Dalinghe Zhaojiawopu section into the scope of rou-
tine monitoring to conduct routine monitoring.

With the growth of the economy and the improvement of the living standards of the
people, the demand for fresh water in urban areas increases continuously. However, due
to industrial pollution, the groundwater in shallow layers are all polluted so severely that
there of the urban water supplies have been forced to stop supplying drinking water s-
sonally. The shortage of water in urban areas is thus more intensified than ever before,
and the economnic development is severely hindered in Jinzhou.
During the convening of the 9th and 10th People's Congresses of the 'Municipality,
the congress representatives put forward 8 proposals on questions concerning water supr'v
and water pollution of Jinzhou. Based on the requirement of these proposals, the munici-
pal government took a series of measures to ease the intensity of the existing problems.
However, we are still facing serious problems of water pollution and water shortage in
our city. It is predicted that by 1995 there will be a shortage of 100,000m'/d of water
and a shortage of 200, 000m3/d by 2000.
According to the report approved by the Committee of Geology and Mineral Reserves
of Liaonrig Province, abundant, high quality groundwater resources exist in th- alluvial
sectors of Daling River and Xiaoling River 15 to 25 km from the urban arear of Jinzhou.
To develop and protect the groundwater resources in the sectors of Daling and Xiaoiing
Rivers is a task of great importance at present and in the nany years to come.
Bseld on the above facts and for the purpose of meeting the demands of the people in
their livelihood of Jinzhou and ensuring the successful operation of our economy, the
Standing Committee of the People's Congress shows concern for and gives support to the
projects of building new water supplies for Jinzhou and controlling water pollution caused
by Jincheng Paper Mill. We agree that the government should make quick endeavours to
solve :he problems of water shortage and water pollutioia, which are the two factors limit-
ing the Living standards and the ewnomic construction of this city.

We welcome and support the projects that the People's Government of Jinzhou plans
to carry out for constructing new water supplies and controlling water pollution caused by
Jincheng Paper Mill.
In recent years, the economy of out city has developed at relatively fast speeds p
however another three water supplies in our city are forced to stop supplying water, thus
gratly impairing the raising of the living standards and the growth of the economy in this
city. Ihe Municipal Political Consultative Committee, on rmany occasions over the past
years, called for attention to problems of industrial pollution and shortage of water, and
submitted to the government propoals urging it to solve the problem of water shortage
and pollution for our city.
In the spirit of responsibility for the, people, the Jinzhou Municipal Government
started preparatory work several years ago for the new water supply project and conducted
investigations on the control of water poUution of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers. The Re-
port on the Study of Model for Groundwarer in Sectors of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers ap-
proved by the Committee of Geology and Mineral Reserves provides reliable scientific
grounds for starting the project of constructing new water supplies.
Government departments have given an overall and detailed consideration to the con-
struction of new water supplies, especially to the problem of protecting the water sources
and planned to solve simultaneously the problem of water pollution of Daling River
caused by Jincheng Paper Mill threatening the future water supply. Hence, the water
quality of the new supply will be protected and more benefits will result from the
project
The projects of building new water supplies and controlling water pollution caused by
Jincheng Paper Mill will be funded with loans from World Band. We are grateful to WB
for its support. We hope that the Jinzhou Municipal Government will make good use of
te funds, ensure the quality of the projects and bring benefits to the people.

A BACKGROUNrD
1 The Alluvial Sectors of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers at Jinzhou Lie in an
Area of 1200km2
In these sectors there are extremely abundand groundwater resources with an ex-
tractable capacity of 1 . 36 million m1 per day. The groundwater in this area is not only a
water supply to meet all the demands of the urban area of Jinzhou, but also functions as
one of the main water sources for another two cities i. e. . Panjin and Jinxi. At present,
Jinzhou draws from this area 1. 02 million m3/d of water for people's livelihood, indu .:rv
and agriculture, while .Jinxi draws 30, 00m3/d for livelihood and industry. To meet the
increasing demand for water, the three above-nentioned cities will have to draw from
those sectors 230, OOOm3/d more. Therefore the groundwater in that area is of extremely
great importance to the three cities, and to Jinzhou above all. The protection of ground-
water resources in that area has a close bearing to the economic development and people's
health of Jinzhou, Panjin and Jinxi.
2 Quality of Groundwater in the Sectors of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers
Assessment was made of the quality of groundwater in the sectors according to Hy-
giene Standards for Dringking Water (GB5749-85). Factors not included in the Stan-
dards were assessed according to water qulity standards for GB3338-88 II surface water
which can be used as drinkable water.. Guroundwater secEors may be divided into the fol-
lowing sections.
2. 1   Fullv Standard Section Where Groundwater Meets All the Standards
for Drinking Water
This section lies in the sector of Daling River and in part of the sector in the upper
reaches of Xiaoling River. Groundwater in this section features good physical properties,
colourlessness, and is colourless tasteless, transparent and free from suspended matters,
with water temperatures ranging from 7 to 12 deg c. Mineralization is less than 1 gil,
chemical type is heavv carbonate, pH7-8. 5. Overall hardness is 200 to 300mg/1.
There is no toxic element like Cu, Pb, Hg, Cr, CN. The content of Fe is between 0. 03
162



and 0. 3 mg/I. Fis less 1 mg/J, As less than 0. 06mg/1, Zn 0. 2 to 0. 3 mg/l. Col-
libacilus content is less than 3/1. This shows that the groundwater in this section fully
meets the standards for drinking water.
T'he Jinzhou Municipal Government plans to build new water supplies within this
section.
2. 2 Single Factor Out-of-bound Section
This section lies to the south of section 1 from the central part of sectors of Daling
and Xiaoling Rivers to Xinzhuangzi, Jianye and Yanjia. Mineralization of water there is
less than Ig/l and the water is of heavy carbonate fresh water type. All specifications of
the water, except Fe content, meet the standards of drinking water. The average Fe con-
tent is 0. 5 to 3 mg/A, exceeding the standard by a factor of 0. 7 to 9.
2.3   Two or More Factors Out- of- bound Section
This section lies in the valley of XiaoLing River and the front areas of sectors of Dal-
ing and Xiaoling Rivers, including the embankment of Xiaoling River, the irrigation area
of Jianye, Dayou, and Baqian. Dayou and Baqian embed heavy corbonate fresh water
with F and Fe exceeding the limits Fe content is 2 to 6 mg/I, one to five times more
than the standards allow. The cause for this is the hydrologic and geological feature of
that area, not human pollution. However, groundwater in the embankment of Xiaoling
River and the Jianye irrigation area is severely polluted, petroliumn content in the water
exceeds the limits and is as high as 0. 6 to 0. 9 mg/l in certain locations.
CODw and SOr2 contents in the groundwater near the river exceeds the limits with
the former ranging between 4 and 5 mg/l and the latter up to 250--450mg/l. The pollu-
tion of the groundwater in the embankment of Xiaoling River and in the Jianye irrigation
area is caused by the supply from the heavily polluted Xiaoling River to groundwater lay-
ers and the irrigation area. The 7 existing water supplies of Jinzhou are all located in this
section. Of them Hepaxinzi, Nanshan and Nuerhe water supplies suffered from seasonal
such severe pollution that they had to stop supplying water. Suifeng and Bozi water sup-

pies located in the irrigation area of Xiaoling River still have quite good water quality;
but they are under the threat of the sewage supplied to the irrigation area.
3 Pollution of Surface Water in Sectors of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers
40%  of the supply to the groundwater layers in sectors of Daling and XiaoLing
Rivers is from the infiltration of the two rivers. The water quality of the two rivers,
whether good or bad, has a direct impact on the quality of the groundwater in the
sectors.
Water quality survey and measures over past yesrs show that Daling and Xiaoling
Rivers are severely polluted.
Tables 1 and 2 contain the results of surveying the two rivers in the past years.
Hejiaxinzi in Table 1 is the cross section of Xiaoling River before it enters the urban
area. The Tieluqiao and Taoci are two sections of the river passing through the urban
area. Baigu is a crcss section after the river leaves the urban area but before it enters the
irrigation area. Xishulin is a section in the lower reaches of the river. Water quality in
the upper reaches is excellent. Before the river enters the urban area its water quality
reaches the standard GB3838-88 Class I. During the dry season, after Xiaoling River
has passed the urban area, its water is badly polluted with volatile phenol, petrolium par-
ticles, CODm. contents all exceeding the specifications of GB3838-88 Clams V for water
quality. Volatile phenol exceeds Class V spec by a factor of 46, COD, by 2. 4 times and
petrolium particles by 1. 2 times. Special attention should be drawn to the fact that Xiaol-
ing River enters the irrigation area from the lower reaches to the Baigu crcss section and
the supply of the irrigation area to groundwater layers is polluting the shallow groundwa-
ter layers with petrolium, and has become a threat to Suifeng and Bozi water supplies.
Thangjiabao 6cros section listed in Table 2 is located at the top of the sector of Daling
River, which is the source for the horizontal supply to groundwater layers in Daling Riv-
er sector. Xibaqian is the surveyed section of the river after the sewage from Jincheng
Paper Mill flows into the river. The main pollutants in Daling River is CODM, which in-
creases in quantity at Zhangjiabao cross section in the upper reaches with the increase in
river flow. This is caused by the organic matters carried by the water and soil washed into

the river. In full water season, CODm, poUlution is severe at this cross section, and ex-
ceeds the limits for Cla  V surface water by a factor of 19. After passing Jineheng Paper
Mill in full water season, Daling River has a CODmcontent which exceeds Class V limits
by a factor of 25. 5. Over 70% of the CODM.content in Daling river is absorbed on the
suspended matters.
4 Location of Pollution Sources in Sectors of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers
The pollution sources in the sectors of Daling and Xiaoling Rivers are located in the
urban area of Jinzhou, Jincheng Town and Dalinghe Town. However, pollution sources
are concentrated in Jinzhou urban area, Jincheng Town and Dalinghe Town.
4. 1 Location of Pollution Sources of Xiaoling River and Discharge of Pol-
lutants
Moct of the industrial pollution sources of Xiaoling River are located in the north-
west, west and southeat parts of the urban area. The remaining industrial pollution
sources (including those of neighbour-hood and private enterprises) are scattered here and
there in the city. Sewage from factories and sewage from living quarters run through the
same pipes, ditches and river branches. They enter Xiaoling River at 15 places. In
1990, the urban area discharged 218, 000 m3/d into Xiaoling River, including 81, 000
m3/d from living quarters and 137, 000m3/d from factories. The total urban area dis-
charged 14,190 t/a of COD<>, 755 t/a of petrolium, 20. 27 t/a of volatile phenol. See
Table 3 for details.
There are 15 major pollution sources, of which 9 are most outstanding: Nuerhe Pa-
per Mill, Jinzhou Oil Refinery, Jinzhou Iron Alloy Factory, Jinzhou Chemical Works,
Jinzhou Printing and Dying Mill, Jinzhou Petro-Chemical Factory, Jinzhou Locamotive
Factory, No. 1 Jinzhou Pharmacertical Factory and Jinzhou Chemical Pharmacertical
Factory.

4. 2   Location of Pollution Sources of Daling River and Discharge of Pollu-
tants
The pollution sources of Dalinghe River are located in Jincheng Town and Dalinghe
Town. The Jincheng Paper MIIU in Jincheng Town is the principal source of polltution of
Daling River. Table 4 lists the quantities of sewage and pollutants discharged.
The quantity of sewage discharged from Jincheng Paper Mill constitutes 70% of the
total quantity discharged by Jinzhou into Daling River and the discharge of pollutants
(COD<) constitutes 97. 1 %. Therefore, once the discharge of pollutants from Jincheng
Paper Mill is controlled, the discharge of pollutants from Jinzhou City into Daling River
will als> be controlled.

5 Prediction of Discharge of Sewage from Urban Area of Jinzhou
Prediction of the discharge fo sewage from the urban area of Jinzhou is nade based
on the programme for the development of economy, society and population of that area.
Table 5 shows the results of prediction.

2000        120               278               389
The discharge of sewage from the urban area will increase from 218.000m3/d in
1990 to 313.OOOM3/d in 1995. of which 26.000 m3/d is contributed by the economic.
development zone of Jinzhou. By the year 2000, the discharge of sewage from the urban
area of Jinzhou will reach 389,000 m/d, of which 85,000 m3/d is discharged from the
economic development zone of Jinzhou.

6 Objectives of the Pollution Control Programme
A systematic control will be exercised over Daling River and its pollution so as to
protect the new water supplies to be contructed and other water resources. Comprehensive
control will be exercised on the pollution of Xiaoling River and the urban area to protect
the unpoUuted water resources from getting poUuted and enable the already polluted water
r^sources to remurn to its clean status. Those are the basic objectives of the progra.nme.
To improve the ecologic environment of the river is also one of the objectives of the pro-
gramne.
6. 1 Qbjective for Controlling Water Quality of Daling River

rigation season, before the river is diverted into the irrigation channels, water quality
(especially petro content) shall reach GB 3838-88 Class IV standard to prevent or reduce
the pollution of water sources in Suifeng, Bozi and live}ihood water supplies during irriga-
tion.
6. 2. 2 Mid-term Water Quality Objective
Water quality in urban sections shall reach Class TV standard to meet the require-
ments for tourism and recreation in urban areas; in the irrigation season, water quality
shal reach Class III standard before the river is diveted into the irrigation area to protect
water resources in the sectors of Xiaoling River.
6. 2. 3 Long-term Objective
Water quaLity in urban area shall reach Class III standard and meet the requirements
for swimming.
7 Projects for Implementing the Pollution Control Programme
7. 1 Projects for Controlling the Pollution of Daling River
7. 1. 1 Near-term Projects
This is the first-phase project for controlling water pollution caused by Jincheng Pa-
per Mill. The project starts with the renovation of pulping technology and involves the use
of red pulping water to make adhesives, the recoverv of White water in paper naking and
the use of reed chips to make artificial charcoal. After completion of the project, the dis-
172



charge of CODL,from the mill will be reduced by 44,987 t, SS by 3.1,422 t, and sewage
by 30, 000 m3. Thus the city will reduce its discharge of COD into Daling River by
66.5 %, and sewage by 31. 2 %, and the project will play an important role in improving the
water quality of the river, protecting the water supply in Liuduan and improving the
quality of off shore waters. Huge benefits on the environment are expected. The project
will be completed by the end of 199 j. The fund for capital construction totals 56. 55 mil-
lion yuan.
7. .l 2 Mld-terni Project
7.1. 2. 1  This is the second-phase project for controlling water pollution caused by
Jincheng Paper Mill. The project involves the continuation of recovery and use of the red
water and the setting up of a sewage bio-chemical treatment station for the entire mill.
After completion of the project, sewage dicharged from the mill will reach the relevant
standards. The funds required by the project total 40 millon yuan.
7. 1. 2. 2 Projects for controlling water pollution caused by Jirnxan Paper Mill and Jinx-
ian Chernical Fertilizer Factory. After treatment, sewage discharge will reach the rele-
vant stundards. Funds required for these projects are 15 million yuan.
After completion of these mid-term projects, the quantity of COD discharged in Dal-
ing River will be reduced by 17,300 t/a or by 92. 1 Y as compared to the present COD
discharge into Dalirig River by the entire city.
7. 1. 3 Long-term Projects
7. 1. 3. 1 Sewage treatment works project at Daling River Tbwn. This works will be
able to treat 60, 000 In3 of sewage per day and hence rank as Class I sewage treatment
works. The project requires 20 million yuan of funds.
7. l. 3. 2   Project to preserve water and soil in DaLing River reaches. To thoroughly im-
prove the water qualitv of Daling River, it is necessary to preserve water and soil in the
river reaches, -so that the quantity of mud and sand and the organic matters carried by
them can be reduced in the river. The project for preserving water and soil of Daling
reaches calls for the organzation by governments at all levels and the coordination of

lIron Alloy Factory, Jinzhou Chermical Factory, Jinzhou Petro- Chemical Factory,
Jinzhou Locamative Maintenance Works and Jinzhou Chekal Pharmaceutical Factory.
These factories will take appropriate measures such as techni4krenovation, comprehen-
sive use of materials and construction of sewage treatmen worksN\o ensure that the dis-
charge of the treated sewage will meet the relevant standards. Contro,of pollution caused
by Jinzhou Iron Alloy Factory using chrome slags for iron making and btinzhou Chemi-
cal Factory sewage will be implemented at the earliest possible date. These projects require
a total fund of 46. 5 million yuan. The results will oe reduction of pollutants like COD,
petroleum, phenol by 2600 t/a, that is, over 25% of the discharge of industrial pollu-
tants of the entire city.
7. 2. 1. 2 Construction of the Oxidation Reservoir
A one million cubic meter Class III Oxidation Reservoir will be constructed to ensure
that the petroleum content in the irrigation water reaches Class IV standard to protect wa-
ter resources at Suifeng, and Bozi. In the dry season (guarantee ratio 90 % ), water will
be kept in the reservoir for 68 hours petroleum content will be reduced by 50% to 70%.
This project requires a fund of 17 million yuan.
7. 2. 2  Mlid-term Project
