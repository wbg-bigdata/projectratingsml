3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The primary objective of the Third Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP III) was to complete ongoing
irrigation development and rehabilitation works begun under the Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project
(AP-II) and thus realize the potential for increasing agricultural productivity and rural incomes in two
economically backward regions of Andhra Pradesh (AP). Other objectives were to: (i) pilot implementation
of management reforms to improve public irrigation performance by facilitating beneficiary participation in
the operation and maintenance (O&M) of major irrigation schemes, and upgrade Government of Andhra
Pradesh (GoAP) capacity to improve irrigation services and command area management; (ii)
retrospectively mitigate the adverse impacts of land acquisition under AP-II, and proactively provide
economic rehabilitation for those families still to be affected by completion of Srisailam Right Bank Canal
(SRBC) and Sri Ram Sagar Project (SRSP) works; (iii) ensure the safety and sustainability of three dams
supplying water to the project areas; (iv) implement a mandated regional program of environmental
improvements, safeguards and natural resource conservation; and (v) improve GoAP monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) capability for large externally-aided irrigation projects. The objectives were mostly
stated in general terms without defined impacts, focused on technical considerations and would have been
best described as outputs to achieve an objective of increased agricultural production with the goal of
increased rural incomes. Nevertheless, the objectives were in line with the Bank's 1995 country assistance
strategy (CAS) for India, which was to support Government of India (GoI) efforts to: (a) support for state
level policy and institutional reforms; (b) increasing the role of beneficiaries in project implementation; and
(c) strengthening the effectiveness of government interventions to support the environment, and human
resource and infrastructure development.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The mid-term review (MTR) mission considered that the objectives were still appropriate.

3.3 Original Components:
The project had six components: (a) Irrigation Development and Rehabilitation Works (US$ 346
million, 80% of base costs) to complete the irrigation network and feeder roads for 65,000 Hectare (ha) of
the SRBC subproject, and rehabilitate 253,000 ha of the SRSP subproject's irrigation system; (b)
Agricultural Support Services (US$ 11 million, 2.5% of base costs) to foster agricultural diversification
and productivity through irrigation agronomy research and improved command area extension services, and
to improve irrigation services by participatory irrigation management through the establishment of Water
User Associations (WUAs), having three sub-components namely: (i) Irrigation Agronomy Program; (ii)
WUA Promotion Program; and (iii) Farmer Training Program; (c) Resettlement and Rehabilitation
(R&R) program (US$ 22 million, 5% of base costs) to mitigate adverse social impacts of land
acquisition for irrigation works of AP-III and balance of AP-II works; (d) Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) (US$ 32 million, 7.5% of base costs) to support a GoI mandated regional program of
environmental safeguards and nature conservation in subproject districts; (e) Dam Rehabilitation and
Safety Assurance (US$ 20 million, 4.5% of base costs) to maintain the structural and mechanical
integrity of three dams serving the subproject areas and prevent the failure of Srisailam dam spillway; and
(f) Project Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 2.5 million, 0.5% of base costs) to strengthen Irrigation &
Command Area Development Department (I&CADD's) Project Preparation and Monitoring Unit. The
components were reasonably related to achieving the objectives and were within the capacities of the
implementing agencies. Had the project been prepared within a logical framework the number of
components could have been reduced and the outputs logically linked to clearly focused objectives. Despite
this limitation, lessons learned from First Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP-I), Second Andhra
Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP-II) and the National Water Management Projects were satisfactorily taken

account of in the project design and activities were included relating to new GoI environmental and
private-sector-led development policies. The main lessons learned from earlier irrigation projects in AP
were: (i) design weaknesses concerning, particularly, inadequate R&R of project-affected persons (PAPs),
lack of consultation/participation with farmer beneficiaries and with agricultural support services, and the
need for the canal system to deliver water to each individual farm (Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) para.
1.17); and (ii) implementation problems concerning land acquisition, procurement difficulties, counterpart
funding shortages, limited logistic resources, construction quality control, monitoring and evaluation. The
agricultural support, participatory irrigation management, environmental management and dam safety
components were all essential to maintain sustainability of the irrigation assets created under AP-II and
AP-III.

3.4 Revised Components:
Project components were not revised but, at the mid-term review, six additional canal rehabilitation works
in SRSP were added at the request of GoAP. These were considered by the Bank to be within the project
design and scope. Some EMP targets were revised downwards due to difficulties in the identification of
suitable land for reforestation. During the project extended period of 18 months, additional infrastructural
works were included in project colonies and resettlement villages.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project objectives were consistent with the GoAP and GoI development policies and with the Bank
CAS, took account of the changes in State policies concerning the formation of Water User Associations,
GoI policies on environmental and natural resource management, and the Bank's safeguard policies on dam
safety, R&R and environment. However, the project design is somewhat muddled with respect to one of the
secondary objectives of piloting implementation of management reforms to improve public irrigation
performance (see 3.1) and there was no separate component or sub-component to meet this objective of
promoting participatory irrigation management and upgrading GoAP capacity to improve systems
management. Instead this was submerged within the Agricultural Support Services component. For all of
the other objectives there were clearly defined components or sub-components which facilitated project
implementation and management. Nevertheless, the project built on the experience learned in AP-I and
AP-II by including participatory irrigation management, agricultural support services, R&R of PAPs,
environmental management, dam safety, quality control of civil works and performance-based monitoring.
The technical aspects related to the civil works and R&R are considered satisfactory and there was a strong
sense of ownership of the project on the part of I&CADD. The decision to line all canals in SRBC down to
those with a capacity of 28 liters per second (l/s) was sensible for improving sustainability of smaller
canals, which are the responsibility of water-users to maintain. However, the quality of preparation of the
EMP and agricultural support services components was less than satisfactory. There was lack of
preparation of a strategy on how these components would be implemented, and specific annex on these
components were not provided in the SAR. The linkage of the agriculture support component with the
Department of Agriculture (DoA) was not detailed, nor was any detail provided on how the significant
agricultural production gains anticipated in the economic analysis would be achieved or monitored. The
project conformed to OP 4.01: Environmental Assessment, OP 4.36: Forest, OP 4.37: Safety of Dams and
OD 4.30: Involuntary Settlement. Overall, and on balance, quality at entry is considered satisfactory.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Overall, project development objectives have been achieved. The project has realized its primary objective
to complete ongoing irrigation development and scheme rehabilitation works begun under AP-II. In SRSP,
all the planned scheme rehabilitation works have been completed, resulting in improved water supply in

253,000 ha area, increase in food grain production from 369,823 t/year to 518,081 t/year and increase in
net income for 1.1 ha farm from 33% to 69%. In SRBC, the planned irrigation development works have
been completed, resulting in providing irrigation infrastructure facilities in 65,000 ha area. At closing
irrigation under SRBC had not commenced. However, since then 44,000 ha area has been provided with
irrigation water in August 2004, in Kharif (monsoon) season and thus increase in food production and net
farm income is expected from 2005 (details in Annex 1). Other objectives under the project have also been
largely realized. In SRSP, WUAs are effectively involved in O&M and management of irrigation in about
253,000 ha area, 2,039 project affected persons (PAPs) have been provided with economic rehabilitation,
EMP (including catchment area treatment in 8,149 ha and compensatory afforestation in 271 ha) has been
successfully implemented; the safety of Sriram Sagar Dam and Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) have been
secured, and M&E capabilities in the project staff have been improved. In SRBC, 2,664 ha land was
acquired and compensation paid, 2,107 project affected persons (PAPs) have been provided with economic
rehabilitation, EMP (including catchment area treatment in 5,344 ha and compensatory afforestation in 885
ha) has been successfully implemented; the safety of Srisailam Dam has been secured, and M&E
capabilities in the project staff have been improved (details in Annex 1). On balance, the overall outcome is
satisfactory.

4.2 Outputs by components:
The overall rating is satisfactory based on the following assessment of the project components (refer to
Annex 1 for the SAR project-end targets and the actual achievements).

4.2.1 Irrigation Development and Rehabilitation: Satisfactory. At project closing, the objective of
completing works begun under AP-II and the planned works under AP-III has been achieved fully in SRSP
and about 95% in SRBC. In SRSP, the activities to be completed related to the rehabilitation of the main
canal and the distribution system down to sub minors. All of these activities were completed and this has
increased the capacity of the main canal from about 156 cubic meter per second (m3/s) before
rehabilitation and improvement to about 260 m3/s. Additional rehabilitation works costing about Rs. 150
million ($ 3.11 million) and improvements to infrastructure in project colonies have also been completed.
Over 50 km of new feeder roads have been built and 30 km of roads carried over from AP-II have been
completed. The sub-component for construction of SRSP is rated highly satisfactory. In SRBC, all the
planned works have been completed except the farm level micro-distribution network. The works already
completed in SRBC include the main canal, distributaries and minors covering the command area of 65,000
ha., Gorakullu bypass, 2 km long Owk tunnel and Owk balancing reservoir, and all the six spillway gates
at Owk reservoir. Construction of the above micro network system, costing about Rs. 438 million ($8.94
million), have already been initiated. As these works are of a scattered nature, completion of all the micro
networks is expected by January 2005. GoAP is fully committed to complete these works with its own
funds and necessary provision has been made for this in the State budget. Not withstanding the delay in
completion of the physical works, 44,000 ha out of the 64,000 in SRBC are now being irrigated during the
Karif (monsoon) season 2004. Overall, the SRBC sub-component is rated as satisfactory. Construction
Quality Assurance: Four central material testing laboratories for quality control, four field laboratories and
a mobile field laboratory have been upgraded/established in the subproject areas and 210 engineering staff
have been trained in quality control. Quality audit guidelines and an `OK card' system introduced during
project preparation have been maintained throughout the project. These have enabled excellent construction
quality monitoring and control, resulting in good standards of construction. Construction quality assurance
was highly satisfactory.

4.2.2 Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R): The objective of mitigating the adverse impact of land
acquisition (LA) undertaken during AP-II and supporting people affected by LA during AP-III in their
economic rehabilitation has been met. LA is completed in 2,981 ha and compensation paid for the lands


                                                     - 4 -

required for the project. All the 4,146 project-affected persons (PAPs) had been provided with productive
assets to help regain economic loss. The assets are being maintained by PAPs and deriving regular flow of
income. All the 362 infrastructure works, including the new works in the extended period, in resettlement
villages have been completed. This output is satisfactory.

4.2.3 Agricultural Support Services (ASS): Overall performance is considered satisfactory in view of the
good performance of the research and demonstrations program undertaken by Acharya N.G. Ranga
Agricultural University (ANGRAU), the achievement of farmer training targets and satisfactory
performance of the WUA promotion program. The expectations of the Irrigation Agronomy sub-component
have been largely achieved and the sub-component is rated satisfactory. The program was well managed
by ANGRAU throughout. A total of 2,782 research trials and 1,054 small and large-scale demonstrations
were undertaken, and a broad range of agronomic and water management technologies developed.
However, in the case of SRBC, where no canal water was released during the project, the results have
limited relevance, arising from trials conducted under a typical well irrigation, where water-flows are small
and individually controlled.

Upgrading of extension services and farmer training was satisfactory.            Under the Farmer Training
Program, an overall program to train 84,000 farmers in irrigated crop agronomy and improved water
management was proposed. Up to March 2001, some 35,800 farmers, or 43% of the SAR target, were
trained in irrigated crop agronomy and improved water management. Subsequently, to avoid duplication,
this program was absorbed into the Agriculture Intensification Program of the Bank financed ongoing
Andhra Pradesh Economic Restructuring Project (APERP) where it has continued satisfactorily and has
been further expanded. Three farmer-training centers (FTC) were planned for construction under the
project, and it was also planned to equip these and the existing FTC serving the project command areas.
GoAP did not construct the proposed new training centers and no equipment was procured. Nevertheless,
although centers were not strengthened as envisaged, there has been significant achievement in training a
large number of farmers, and an impact assessment indicated a positive response from participating
farmers and improved knowledge uptake. The Water and Land Management Training and Research
Institute (WALAMTARI) Farmer and Staff Training subcomponent was unsatisfactory. This part of the
sub-component was to strengthen WALAMTARI central and field facilities and to implement a major
training program for staff of both Irrigation and Agriculture Departments and for Water User Associations
(WUA) members. While farmer training targets were largely achieved, performance in terms of staff
training was poor.

The Water Users Association Promotion Program was highly satisfactory in SRSP. Political commitment
for participatory irrigation management resulted in the enacting of the AP Farmers Management of
Irrigation Systems (FMIS) Act in April, 1997 before AP-III became effective. Elections for WUAs were
held statewide in June 1997 and for Distributory Committees (DCs) in November 1997. As a result 294
WUAs and 22 DCs were formed throughout the SRSP command in 1997, and are expected to be formed in
SRBC also shortly. Capacity building and fostering of WUAs and DCs in SRSP have been supported since
August 1997 through APERP. Comprehensive training modules have been developed by WALAMTARI in
association with an NGO associated with I&CADD. WUAs and DCs have already played an extremely
important role in equitable distribution of water, resolution of disputes and maintenance of lower level
canals. The impact of this in SRSP has been quite impressive. The following major achievements have been
realized from the sub-component: (i) equity in water service delivery, resulting in a significant increase in
irrigated area; (ii) resolution of disputes through community participation; (iii) increase in agricultural
production and farm incomes; (iv) improved relationships between I&CADD officials and farmers. As a
consequence of this component, agricultural production and productivity have significantly increased in



                                                    - 5 -

SRSP, considerably above appraisal expectations. For example, food grain production increased by
518,081 ton per year (t/year) (369,823 t/year were estimated at appraisal) (see Annex 1). Following
delivery of water to SRBC, increases in agricultural production and productivity will be substantial and are
likely to be higher than appraisal estimates (Annex 1).

4.2.4 Environmental Management Plan (EMP): Despite a lack of an EMP strategy at the start of the
project, significant achievements were made during project duration and EMP targets were mostly achieved
(see Annex 1). For the Health and the Groundwater Departments, SAR targets were revised upwards,
which were achieved. The Groundwater Department integrated the works into routine departmental works
and budget; and completed an additional assessment of groundwater quality, integrated into parallel GoAP
water programs. The works by the Health Department helped reduction in waterborne diseases and
elimination of malaria in the command area. The Fisheries Department achieved the SAR targets. Targets
for the Agriculture Department and the AP Forestry Development Corporation were achieved. For the
Department of Forests, a large catchment area treatment work was added to the SAR targets and most of
the revised targets were achieved, while works such as establishment of a bird sanctuary were deleted. The
quality of the works by the Forest Department is good, and the department used funds available from other
GoAP programs to supplement the eco-restoration, the catchment area treatment and the deer park works.
Reduced targets for I&CADD and the Project Preparation and Monitoring Unit (PPMU) included only
environmental training, which remained incomplete. Environmental monitoring units were not established.
Over all, the output of the environmental management plan component was satisfactory.

4.2.5 Dam Rehabilitation and Safety Assurance: The objective of ensuring the safety and sustainability of
the three dams has almost been achieved. The safety of the Srisailam spillway bucket has been achieved
following the completion of the main protection work downstream of the dam in 2003. Re-routing of a main
road, presently in progress and expected to be completed by February 2005, will permit operation of the
two end spillway gates, which have not been operated due to fear of erosion of the existing road. This will
enable the operation of all twelve gates in case of emergency, thereby restoring the spillway capacity to
38,400 m3/s. The low level sluice gates at Sriramasagar (SRS) dam and Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) are
covered with deep silt deposits and it has not been found practicable nor feasible to remove the silt, clear
the grooves and make the gates operational. The tunnels from the gates may have to be plugged and sealed
permanently, as was mentioned in the SAR. Other safety works at SRS dam and LMD have been
completed. A study to re-estimate the probable maximum flood (PMF) for Srisailam dam has been
completed, for LMD has begun, and for SRS dam, GoAP plans to take similar study with the state funds.
At all three dams, considerable additional work, mostly recommended by dam safety review panels, has
been completed. The output of the dam rehabilitation and safety assurance component was satisfactory.

4.2.6 Project Monitoring and Evaluation: The Project Preparation and Monitoring Unit (PPMU)
functioned satisfactorily providing timely information and reports. However, insufficient attention was
given to independent project impact assessment and evaluation. The base-line survey, inordinately delayed
and not completed until 2003, was based on secondary sources of data for a single season (2001/02)
instead of surveying farmers within and outside the project command areas, limiting its usefulness for final
project impact assessment. According to the SAR, one external M&E agency for each subproject should
have been in place by October 1, 1997 for objective monitoring and for periodically evaluating the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) implementation. By the MTR mission (July 2000) these agencies had not
been contracted and finally they were contracted in March 2002 for SRSP and August 2003 for SRBC.
However, these agencies submitted their evaluation reports on RAP implementation for both the
sub-projects. Though it is mentioned in the SAR (para. 4.13) that an official of the rank of Chief Engineer
would be in charge of the PPMU, in practice most of the time persons at the level of Superintending
Engineer held the position. This however, did not impede the functioning of the PPMU, as the head of the


                                                    - 6 -

PPMU was directly responsible to the Secretary (Projects) of I&CADD. The coordination function of the
PPMU was facilitated through the formation of a State level Coordination Committee, specifically formed
for AP-III, which, in the initial years, met monthly. The over all output of this component was satisfactory.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The framework for economic analysis at ICR follows the methodology used at SAR. The Economic Rate
of Returns (ERRs) at project closure is 14.7%, which are lower than 24% estimated at appraisal because:
(i) crop yields being realized at credit closing are in most cases lower than were assumed at appraisal, this
has been somewhat off set by the re-estimation of the without-project yield which are higher than that
estimated at appraisal; (ii) the forecasted parity price for the dominant crop (paddy) is about 18% lower at
the end of project implementation than at the time of appraisal; (iii) the increases in cropping intensities are
(slightly) less than what was predicted at appraisal (respectively 93% and 96% in SRBC and SRSP); and
(iv) the delay in completing the physical works for SRBC has delayed the achievement of project benefits.
The results are summarized below (refer to Annex 3 for details):

                                      SRBC                      SRSP                Whole Project

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Following the SAR approach, financial analysis was limited to reassessing farm level incremental net
income due to the project for SRSP and SRBC commands separately. Analysis of farm incomes suggests
that in SRBC, net income due to project registered 392% increase over Without Project (WOP) situation.
In SRSP, net income due to project recorded 69% increase over WOP situation. Incremental annual net
farm income with the project ranged from Rs. 6,735 in SRSP (for 1.1ha farm) to Rs. 34,552 in SRBC (for
1.8 ha farm). Large increase is achieved in food grains production, 44% more than estimated production
levels in SAR. Production level of cotton was less by 25% and oilseeds by 50% as compared to SAR. The
results expressed in 2004 prices are shown below (see Annex 3 for details):

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The over all institutional development impact was modest. The project has been instrumental in introducing
WUAs in AP. During project implementation, GoAP introduced a statewide policy for the establishment of
WUAs, Distributary and Project Committees (DCs and PCs) and for turning-over the O&M of irrigation
schemes to farmers. The opportunity provided through the AP Farmers Management of Irrigation Systems


                                                      - 7 -

Act, 1997 to form higher-level committees at project level has not yet been realized and is required to be
done as a priority to achieve effective participation of user organizations in irrigation service management
at the scheme level. The R&R and EMP components were implemented to a large part through self-help
groups and village-level committees formed both under the project as well as through GoAP rural income
support and community forest management programs. This has further contributed to the expansion of
economic roles, especially for women, and to the diversification of sources of income. Coordination
between ANGRAU and I&CADD is reported to have improved in the project, but it remains to be seen
whether this will be sustained.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Two consecutive years of drought in 2002 and 2003 delayed release of water throughout the 65,000 ha
command of SRBC thereby delaying the project impact. Delays in finalizing the survey and design of
microdistribution networks in SRBC by project staff and inexperience of local contractors, resulting in
under-quoting, limited the completion of the micro-distribution system. Following inordinate delays in
finalizing the gate designs, the completion of Owk spillway was further delayed by the failure of the gate
contractor to fulfill his contract, necessitating re-tendering of the contract.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
For the first three years of the project there were considerable delays in the release of funds for land
acquisition, payment to contractors, procurement and posting of staff in R&R units, which slowed
implementation. Frequent senior staff changes led to a lack of concerted effort to deal with emerging
problems in the early years. The continued commitment of GoAP to participatory irrigation management
had a positive impact.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
There was very slow progress in the first three years of the project on land acquisition (partly due to delay
in release of funds) and making land available to contractors and award of construction contracts. The
formation of WUAs in SRBC during the project would have facilitated consultation with and participation
of farmers in the implementation of irrigation works; it would also have enhanced their willingness to
operate and maintain the infrastructure created and to change their cropping practices to increase
agricultural production and farm incomes. Delayed sanction for training buildings and equipment, and the
lack of canal water supply in SRBC, limited the relevance of the agriculture research and demonstration
outputs.

5.4 Costs and financing:
The project costs at appraisal were US$ 477.43 million (Rs. 18.9 billion). Following a change in
SDR-dollar rate, and in rupee-dollar rate (from Rs. 35.84 per US dollar at appraisal to Rs. 45 at project
closure), the project costs at closure were US$ 421.87 million (Rs. 21.9 billion). Thus, while in current
dollar the project costs have decreased, in current rupees, actual project costs has increased by about 9.5%
(from Rs. 18.9 billion at appraisal to Rs. 21.9 billion at closure). This is largely due to increased costs of
irrigation works at SRSP (in total Rs. 11,347.9 m, 55% of total project costs up from the appraisal
estimate of Rs. 8,092.9 m). The amount spent to safeguard the spillway at Srisailam dam was much less
(Rs. 785 m less) than estimated at appraisal but the costs of other civil works for irrigation and dams have
increased. There were savings compared to SAR estimates on ASS (Rs. 296 m) due to work being done
under other projects and on EMP (Rs. 844 m) due to reduced quantities of work. The costs of canal works
average about Rs. 115,000 per hectare (about US$ 2,900/ha) for SRBC and about Rs. 31,600/ha (about
US$800/ha) for SRSP. If all components are included, the total costs become Rs. 132,000/ha (US$
3,300/ha) and Rs. 50,000/ha (US$ 1,200/ha), respectively. At the request of the borrower an estimated



                                                       - 8 -

saving of US$ 45 million from original Loan amount of US$ 175 million was cancelled in January 2003
while extending the project period till July 31, 2004. Finally, about 92% of the Credit/Loan had been
disbursed.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is likely. Post AP-III the key elements for sustainability are in place, viz.: (i) an
appropriate institutional framework, in particular to involve water user organizations in the irrigation
systems management; (ii) irrigation water is priced at a level to cover full O&M costs; and (iii) funds
recovered from water fee collection are transferred back to the irrigation system. Had the water charges
recovery been around 90%, sustainability could have been rated as highly satisfactory. However, since
water fee recovery rates have averaged around 30 ­ 40% statewide over the last four years sustainability is
rated only as likely. The current water charges of about Rs. 500/ha (among the highest in the country), if
fully recovered, are enough to meet annual O&M needs. Under the AP Farmers Management of Irrigation
Systems Act, 1997, GoAP is committed to constitute WUAs, DCs and Project Committees (PCs) in all
irrigation schemes in the State and to involve them in irrigation system management. Under this Act,
WUAs and DCs were elected in all schemes in 1997. As the Act stipulates elections every five years,
re-elections of WUAs have taken place in SRSP, and WUAs are planned to be constituted shortly in
SRBC. DCs and PCs also are to be constituted shortly in both the SRSP and SRBC commands. As per the
Government policy, water charges collected from the irrigation schemes are now transferred back to the
irrigation systems (and about 50% of that is transferred to the WUAs to undertake O&M). In addition
GoAP is also providing budgetary support for O&M in the State budget every year, although this is not
sufficient to meet full O&M needs (budget support in the current fiscal year and collections will cover
about 50% of the O&M costs). However, GoAP, has also agreed to improve the recovery of water charges,
and effectively involve the WUAs in collection of water charges, and has agreed in the interim, to provide
budgetary support to meet any shortfalls in O&M in SRSP and SRBC. Irrigation has also become a high
priority sector for the new Government as evidenced by the increase in budget allocations for capital works
in the current budget. Hence, it is likely that adequate resources would be allocated to maintain the
infrastructure created under the project.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Formation of WUAs in SRBC for O&M should be undertaken as soon as practicable and the
micro-network construction completed. Before bringing the system into operation, it is necessary to remove
deposits of silt and debris and vegetation from the canals and make minor repairs to the works, parts of
which have been completed and lying unused for several years. SRSP has been in operation for many years
and the budget allocated for O&M in 2004/5 is about Rs. 500/ha (about US$ 11/ha) which is adequate to
meet the full O&M needs. The WUAs that have been constituted in the SRSP area are responsible for
O&M below the minor canals. DCs and PC (Planned to be elected shortly) are responsible for the O&M of
canals above minor levels, and also for liaison with I&CADD.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Satisfactory. The Bank provided valuable assistance to the Borrower and implementing agency through
frequent missions over three years. Apart from ensuring that the project was consistent with National and
State priorities and the Bank CAS, dialogue resulted in the incorporation of lessons learned in other
Bank-funded irrigation projects in AP being incorporated in the project design. However, the agricultural
component design was weak and emphasis should have been placed on developing stronger linkages with



                                                    - 9 -

DoA field extension staff.

7.2 Supervision:
Highly satisfactory. Continuity of Bank staff and consultants, and of GoAP project staff, resulted in a
very good working relationship between staff of the Bank, GoAP and implementing agencies being
maintained throughout the project. In total 16 supervision missions and an MTR mission visited the project
to provide good advice and assistance with implementation. MTR mission brought in sharp focus the need
to improve the implementation progress, in particular, on dam safety works, land acquisition, timely release
of fund, and regular progress monitoring at the level of Secretary to I&CADD. Consequently Bank
supervision played an important role in assisting the Borrower and implementing agencies in keeping the
project on track. The closing date of the loan was extended to permit completion of outstanding works. The
Bank agreed to the inclusion of additional works for dam safety, irrigation rehabilitation and improvements
at staff colonies in the project. The Bank contributed to the enforcement of good quality control measures
in construction works. Successive supervision missions contributed to improving the financial management
system and to ensuring that all legal covenants were complied with. General and technical supervision
support for agricultural support services was appropriate and was especially appreciated by ANGRAU;
despite the small component size (and lack of disbursement importance), supervision consistently provided
strong agricultural inputs. A responsible approach was taken in ensuring cost-effective integration between
AP-III and the APERP, which includes an irrigation component for support to WUAs. Supervision
missions emphasized the importance of strengthening WUAs and DCs, and in forming a PC in SRSP, to
ensure sustainable operations and management of the subproject.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Satisfactory

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower appropriately designed the project to enhance agricultural productivity and incomes from
irrigated agriculture. A long process of consultation with the various participating agencies and with the
consultants and Bank preparation missions was satisfactorily undertaken, although detailed preparation of
the EMP and agriculture component was less than satisfactory.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
There was in the early years of the project very slow release of funds by GoAP, which delayed land
acquisition and payments to contractors and thus implementation progress. Flow of fund problems
persisted in the case of the Forestry Department and delayed tree plantings and advances pending with the
Department continued to be an issue raised by successive supervision missions. Flow of funds from the
state government to the other participating agencies was not a problem in the latter years. The project was
implemented by the I&CADD with the assistance of nine participating agencies and two NGOs. Most
attention by the Borrower was given to the rehabilitation of the SRSP and construction of SRBC. Other
components were not given the same attention. For the implementation of the R&R component, the
Borrower created land acquisition and R&R units in each subproject and engaged NGOs to facilitate the
implementation process. However, long delays in the appointment of staff slowed implementation.
Borrower support and coordination of the ANGRAU sub-component was excellent but less effective in the
cases of DoA and especially WALAMTARI.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
The implementation performance in the first three years was unsatisfactory due to significant delays in land
acquisition, awarding of contracts and canal closures. I&CADD commendably turned the project around in
early 2000 and achieved substantial completion of the project works to a generally good standard within the


                                                   - 10 -

extended project period. However, despite being advised by the Bank supervision mission in November
2003 about the need for WUAs in SRBC, I&CADD has not made any progress on this. There was
abnormal delay in awarding contracts for consultants for survey and design of the micro-irrigation network.
Rural roads were completed as planned by the Roads and Buildings Department. The I&CADD
successfully coordinated the activities of nine participating agencies, although problems continued with
respect to agriculture support and attention to independent impact assessment was less than desirable.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

8. Lessons Learned

l Enabling policies and institutional changes are key for improved irrigation service delivery: the
    project strategy of improving irrigation service delivery through completing / improving irrigation
    infrastructure in combination with formation of WUAs within the project area was substantially
    enhanced through state level policy and institutional changes in the irrigation sector, through
    enactment of AP FMIS Act, 1997.
l Involvement of project beneficiaries groups is key to create ownership of project interventions
    and their sustainability: the project has shown that effective and early involvement of beneficiary
    groups (WUAs, DCs, self help groups, community forest management groups and agriculture support
    groups) greatly enhanced the capacity of the beneficiaries to absorb project supported changes and
    capture the benefits. This results in a more responsible O&M of infrastructure created in the project
    and in ensuring equitable and improved management of irrigation service / other resources on
    sustainable basis.
l Longer term support to WUAs is required for the capacity building and their sustainability. The
    project's experience shows that WUAs need at least four to five years of financial and technical
    support to be capable to operate, manage and maintain even minor and sub-minor canals.
l Early identification and close monitoring of key project activities (such as land acquisition, R&R,
    award of key consultancies and works and release of funds) are critical for timely completion of the
    project.
l Complementing irrigation improvement with strong agriculture support services from project
    inception is key to maximize project benefits and promote sustainability. The importance of
    agricultural development should therefore be reflected in project design and cost allocations.
l Simplification of procurement processes within the government is key to timely award and
    completion of project activities. More efficient procurement organization and procedures are needed to
    avoid serious delays in project implementation. Formal training in procurement will also help in
    attaining this.
l Timely implementation of land acquisition and R&R is a prerequisite for scheduled completion of
    project. This becomes easier if a policy and institutional structure for R&R activities exists within the
    implementing agency.
l Effective coordination between I&CADD and DoA is critical for improving the performance of
    irrigated agriculture. Project staff of both these departments should be trained together, not separately,
    for the management of water. Farmer group visits to see and learn from the experience of successfully
    operating WUAs is a very valuable form of training, often producing a better impact than other more
    formal training methods.

* At closing irrigation under SRBC had not commenced. However, since then 44,000 ha has been brought under
irrigation in August 2004 Kharif (monsoon) season. Consequently GoAP has planned to form WUAs in 65,000 ha
area in SRBC and start collection of water charges during 2005.

**The DCs in SRSP and WUAs/DCs in SRBC are planned to be formed during 2005.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

Project Benefits and Rate of Return Estimated in SAR:

1.       Project economic analysis in SAR focused on quantifying benefits from irrigation and feeder road
program following standard methodology. Incremental agricultural production benefits are derived from
increased cropping intensity, shifts in cropping pattern, and enhanced crop productivity following improved
agricultural support services in the rehabilitated/ modernized/ completed irrigation schemes in the project
area. Incremental benefits from feeder roads comprised economic savings in vehicle operating costs and
travel time.

2.       Economic analysis was carried out for a project life of 30 years separately for (i) three commands
of the sub-project areas namely SRBC, above LMD and below LMD in SRSP; (ii) SRSP as a whole and
(iii) over all project. Import/export parity prices are estimated for the internationally traded farm
commodities and inputs. The project analysis was done for 30-year period at 1995 prices using a Standard
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.9 for farm inputs and commodities that are not traded internationally and an
opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Among the project costs, SRSP R&R expenditure, dam safety
investments for Srisailam dam spillway and environmental management related costs were excluded in the
economic analysis.

3.       For financial analysis, crop budgets were formulated for field crops and horticulture crops
separately for SRSP and SRBC command areas. Representative farm sizes namely 1.1 ha for SRSP and
1.8 ha for SRBC command areas were considered for evaluating the farm level financial impacts.

4.       The estimated Economic Rate of Returns (ERR) was as follows: overall project, 24%; SRBC,
13.7%, SRSP-above LMD 35.8%; SRSP-below LMD 30.9%; and SRSP as a whole 33.7%. Component
returns are high relative to overall project ERR since the later includes all overhead costs not directly
attributable to any specific component.

ICR Estimation Methodology:

5.       Estimation of costs and benefits for the ICR followed similar approach adopted in the SAR to the
extent feasible. The project benefits are assessed for two sub-project areas namely SRSP and SRBC. For
ICR estimations, SRSP is considered as a whole due to non-availability of comprehensive benchmark
survey as well as monitoring and impact assessment databases covering above and below LMD commands
within SRSP. Non-availability of comprehensive benchmark survey as well as monitoring and impact
assessment databases proved to be a constraint in quantifying the incremental benefits arising from various
project interventions. The agreement for benchmark survey was concluded in August 1999, fieldwork
carried out in 2000 and the final report was delivered only in March 2003.

6.       Expected benefits from upgraded rural roads are also included in the project benefits. The
analysis was done at 2004 prices. Full details are provided in the Financial and Economic Analysis
Working Paper (See Annex 7). For financial analysis, crop budgets are formulated using the data from
multiple sources that include the SAR, PPMU studies, field visits, supervision mission reports and
published data from the Government of Andhra Pradesh and India. Besides, the cost of cultivation of
principal crops scheme run by ANGARU covering the sub-project command districts like Karimnagar,
Warrangal and Nizamabad for SRSP and Kurnool for SRBC was also utilized for formulating crop
budgets with and without project.

SRSP:
7.        The targeted area in this sub-project command is 253,000 ha. Incremental benefits arise from
increase in irrigated area, cropping intensity, crop productivity and crop diversification. For ICR
estimations, Karimnagar district was selected which has 86% of the SRSP command area. Out of 57
mandals in this district, 35 mandals are having area in the SRSP command out of which, 16 mandals are
fully coming within the SRSP command. Using the secondary data from published sources for these 16
mandals, cropping intensity, crop productivity and cropping pattern are estimated for `with project (WP)'
situation. In Karimnagar district, 22 mandals are located outside the SRSP command area, which do not
have any significant surface irrigation sources. Using the secondary data from published sources for these
22 mandals, cropping intensity, crop productivity and cropping pattern are estimated for `without project
(WOP)' situation.

Returns for the investment in SRSP are estimated using the scheme model, which is represented by the
average farm model size of 1.1 ha. The ICR-estimated changes in crop area, crop yield and net income
between with and without project situations (Table.1) are used to assess the incremental benefits due to the
project.

SRBC:
8.        The targeted area in this sub-project command is 65,000 ha. Incremental benefits arise from
increase in irrigated area, cropping intensity, crop productivity and crop diversification. For ICR
estimations, Kurnool district was selected which has 100% of the SRBC command area. In Kurnool
district, 10 mandals are having area in the SRBC command out of which, five mandals are having
maximum number of villages within the SRSP command. These five mandals cover 90% of the SRBC
command area. Using the secondary data from published sources for these five mandals, cropping intensity,
crop productivity and cropping pattern are estimated for `without project' situation since no water has been
provided for irrigation till now in this project. For with project situation, cropping pattern, cropping
intensity, crop productivity and crop diversification are assessed based on ICR mission's field visits and
discussions.

Returns for the investment in SRBC are estimated using the scheme model, which is represented by the
average farm model size of 1.8 ha. The ICR-estimated changes in crop area, crop yield and net income
between with and without project situations (Table 2) are used to assess the incremental benefits due to the
project.

Feeder Roads:

9.       The project achieved 223.9 km of feeder roads in both SRSP and SRBC command areas, which
includes 122.8 km of roads carried over from AP-II and 101.1 km of new roads. Expected benefits from
feeder roads include better access to market for farm inputs and outputs; savings in vehicle operating costs



                                                   - 22 -

and travel time by the road users; and many other intangible benefits like improved health, education and
communication. But, no systematic survey has been done to assess in detail the benefits generated by these
feeder roads. Only SAR estimates are available and that too limited to savings in operating costs and travel
time and value of incremental load from time saved which comes to Rs. 0.207 and 0.227 million per km per
year at 1995 prices for SRBC and SRSP command areas respectively. This was estimated at 2004 prices
by using the deflators based on which economic benefits from the investment in roads are estimated and
added to the economic analysis of SRSP, SRBC and overall project.

Economic Returns:

10.      The re-estimated ERR in SAR for the whole project was 24% with a Net Present Value (NPV) of
Rs. 18,098 m at 12% discount rate at 2004 prices (Table.3). At ICR, the ERR has come down to 14.7%.
This significant reduction is due to the following reasons: WOP crop yields assumed in SAR in most of the
cases is lower than the current yield levels WOP; crop yields realized now in the project areas in most of
the cases are lower than SAR assumed crop yields with the project; irrigated area benefits due to project
delayed in SRSP and yet to be realized in SRBC; cropping intensity observed in the project area is lower
than SAR assumed cropping intensities with project; and finally, the parity price for dominant crop namely
paddy used in SAR is based on the world price forecast for 2000-05 which is 18% higher than the
projected world price in 2004.

Following the SAR methodology, economic analysis is done for SRSP and SRBC separately and for the
project as a whole (Table.4). The ERRs of the sub-projects varied from 11.5% for SRBC to 18.2% for
SRSP. ICR estimated costs and benefits are lower for both SRSP and SRBC as compared to that of SAR
for the reasons outlined below.

Reasons for lower economic returns:

11.       In case of SRSP, the ICR estimated increase in irrigated area, cropping intensity, crop
productivity and crop diversification widely varied from the SAR estimations. Cumulative benefited area
with improved irrigation water supply lagged behind the schedule of SAR. SAR estimated that the irrigated
area would be progressively achieved starting from 1997/98 and reaching 100% in 2000/01. But irrigation
benefits started in 1998/99 and the targeted command of 253,000 ha has become fully irrigable only in
2003/04. Cropping intensity in the SRSP command is estimated at 145% as compared to 151% assumed in
SAR(Cropping intensity is the weighted average of above and below LMD command area cropping
intensities from SAR using respective command areas as weights). Except rabi maize, crop productivity
levels of other crops is observed to be less by 3% to 40% as compared to the SAR projected yield levels.
Rabi maize recorded 11% higher yield than that of SAR project yield level. Under `without project'
situation also, crop productivities are higher than the SAR assumed levels except in case of cotton and rabi
groundnut which recorded lower yield levels. Crop diversification with high value crops like chillies is
limited to 2% of the area.

In case of SRBC, the ICR estimated increase in irrigated area, cropping intensity, crop productivity and
crop diversification varied from the SAR estimations. Cumulative benefited area with improved water
supply totally lagged behind the schedule of SAR. SAR estimated that the irrigated area would be
progressively achieved starting from 1998/99 and reaching 100% in 2002/03. But irrigation benefits are
expected to start only in 2004/05 (GoAP in its latest comments has conveyed to the Bank that water has
been released in SRBC sub project in August 2004 providing irrigation to about 44,000 ha area) and the
targeted command of 65,000 ha is expected to become fully irrigable only in 2005/06. Cropping intensity in
the SRBC command is estimated at 150% as compared to 162% assumed in SAR. Except rabi groundnut
and rabi chickpea, crop productivity levels of other crops is observed to be less by 6% to 40% as compared
to the SAR projected yield levels. Rabi chickpea has 33% higher yield potential than that of SAR project
yield level. Under `without project' situation also, crop productivities are higher than the SAR assumed
levels except in case of kharif sorghum, cotton and rabi sorghum which recorded lower yield levels. Crop
diversification with high value crops like chillies is limited to 10% of the area.

Financial Returns:

12.      Following SAR approach, financial analysis was limited to the reassessing of farm level
incremental net income due to project for SRSP and SRBC commands separately. Analysis of farm
incomes suggests that in SRBC, net income due to project registered 392% increase over WOP situation. In
SRSP, net income due to project recorded 69% increase over WOP situation. Incremental annual net farm
income with the project ranged from Rs. 6,735 in SRSP (for 1.1ha farm) to Rs. 34,552 in SRBC (for 1.8
ha farm). For the reasons explained above, financial farm incomes are lower than the SAR estimated levels.

Large increase is achieved in food grains production, 44% more than estimated production levels in SAR.
Production level of cotton was less by 25% and oilseeds by 50% as compared to SAR. Crop diversification
has not picked up as expected and paddy still dominates the cropping pattern especially in SRSP command
area. High value crops like chilies are grown in 2% to 10% of the area. Increased employment is observed,
but incremental employment is marginally less by 10% as compared to the SAR estimated levels. A total of
2,66,111 farm families are directly benefited by the project excluding landless agriculture labor households
located in the project area.

       Sub-sector                                 Irrigation

        1.0 Background:

The State of A.P. comprises three regions namely Coastal, Telangana and Rayalaseema, and the economy
of Andhra Pradesh is predominantly agrarian; agriculture is the prime mover and hub of all economy
related sectors. To alleviate the sufferings of the people in the state in general, and those in the drought
prone areas, in particular, the Rayalaseema and Telangana Regions are chosen for providing irrigation
benefits under two sub Projects viz; Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) scheme and Srirama Sagar
Project (SRSP) scheme under Second A.P Irrigation Project (AP-II), which was conceived and
implemented with World Bank Assistance (Cr.No 1665-IN/Ln No 2952-IN) to improve the income in the
rural areas by way of increased agricultural Production. The World Bank support for AP-II consisted of
IDA Credit of US $ 127.50 M and IBRD Loan of US $ 131.0 M. The AP-II was closed on June 30,1994
with a physical achievement of 30%. Most of the reasons for Second A.P Irrigation Project poor
implementation progress arose from delays in land acquisition, procurement difficulties and litigations,
staff changes, counter part fundings shortages and limited logistic resources.

The Third Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP-III) was formulated as a follow on project to complete
the balance works in Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project and thus realize the potential for increasing
agricultural productivity and rural income in two economically backward regions of the state of Andhra
Pradesh. The AP-III became effective on July 3, 1997 and was originally scheduled to close on January 31,
2003. The project was subsequently extended to July 31, 2004 to complete all the planned works under
AP-III. The financial pattern of the project is IBRD loan US $ 175 M, IDA credit US $ 150.00 M and
GoAP share of US $ 156.26 M. However, an amount of US $ 45 M of IBRD loan was cancelled as a
result of the gains accruing from foreign exchange variations and savings resulted due to changes in the
components targets. In rupee terms the revised cost of the project is Rs. 21905.74 M (as against the
original estimated cost of Rs. 18897.83 M).

        2.0 Design:

As AP-III was a follow on project to complete the A.P-II, it is built on the experiences of the AP-II.
However, in several aspects, it goes beyond the AP-II. Its focus on participatory irrigation management,
agriculture support services, resettlement and rehabilitation of PAPs as well as reservoir oustees of AP-II
and the two dams, environment management plan, dam safety and performance based implementation
monitoring, make it a multi sectoral project.

The design of AP-III was based on the lessons learned from AP-II. The main objectives of the A.P-III was
to complete the on going irrigation development and scheme rehabilitation works started in AP-II and thus
realize the full potential for increasing agricultural productivity and rural incomes in two economically
backward regions of A.P.



                                                    - 33 -

The other objectives of the project were to: (i) Pilot implementation of management reforms to improve
public irrigation performance by facilitating beneficiary participation in the operation and maintenance of
irrigation schemes, (ii) retrospectively mitigate the adverse impacts of LA under AP-II and proactively
provide economic rehabilitation for those families still to be affected due to completion of SRBC works,
(iii) ensure the safety and sustainability of three dams ie., Srisailam Dam (NSRSP), Sriram Sagar Dam
(SRS dam) and LMD supplying the water to the project area, (iv) implement a mandated regional
programme of environment improvements, safeguards and natural resources conservation, and (v) improve
GOAPs monitoring and evaluation capability for large externally aided irrigation projects.

VI. Project Monitoring and Evaluation:

Strengthening of PPMU through provision of office equipment, vehicles and incremental staff.

         3.0 Implementation:

The AP-III was planned to be completed in a duration of five and half years ie., from July 1997 to January,
2003. However, the project implementation faced several problems during the initial four years. These
problems were: (i) non-adhereing to strict canal closures periods compatible to working seasons due to
delayed monsoon/failure of the monsoon sequel to this the rehabilitation works in SRSP main canals ie,
mostly lining could not be taken up as per schedule, (ii) vagaries of nature like untimely rains or


                                                      - 35 -

un-seasonal floods, (iii) slow progress in land acquisition, and (iv) delays in award of civil works contracts.


These initial impediments have caused a set back of two to three working seasons. However, after initial
setback the progress picked up. The performance of the project was reviewed at the time of mid term
review and revised targets were fixed. To overcome the initial set back with a view to complete all the
planned works under AP-III and also to achieve the desired objectives, the extension of the project was
sought in 2002 which was favourably considered by the bank and the project period is extended by 18
months ie., from closing date of originally contemplated from Jan, 2003 to July, 2004.

         4.0 Achievement of Objectives:

(i) Irrigation development and rehabilitation works:

SRBC:
All the left over works of AP-II and planned works under AP-III (except the farm level micro-distribution
networks) have been completed. As regards the farm level micro-distribution networks, costing about Rs.
438million ($ 9 million) and divided in 8 works contracts packages, works in 5 packages are at various
stages of implementation. In the remaining 3 packages (costing about Rs.182 million i.e. US $ 3.5 millions)
the contracts were later terminated by GOAP due to lack of progress by the contractors, and the GOAP has
initiated the process of re-awarding these works. GOAP is committed to complete these works using the
state funds and has accordingly made adequate budget provision for the year 2004-05
SRSP:
All the planned ongoing 27 packages as well as 5 additional packages relating to the rehabilitation of
kakatiya canal and distribution network have been completed. A well equipped quality control laboratory
system was setup by establishing 6 laboratories (at Sriram Sagar Dam, Lower Manair Dam, Hanamkonda,
Jagitial, Peddapalli and Huzurabad) and 210 engineering personnel were imparted "hands on training" on
quality control/assurance aspects at the National Council of Cement and Building Materials, Hyderabad. In
addition, state of the art portable electronic density testing devices were procured for rapid on-site
determination of the earth work compaction parameters. Construction of the new feeder roads, as
envisaged, has also been completed.

(ii) The third objective of the Project was to retrospectively mitigate the adverse impact of LA under AP-II.
The R&R policy aimed at improving, or at least restoring, the living standards of PAPs by providing along
with irrigation benefits, an assistance frame work for replacement of lost assets and economic rehabilitation
activities. The process of LA is complete in both the sub-projects. Overall more than 95% of the activities
have been completed.

(iii) The construction related dam safety works on the Sriramsagar and Lower Manair dams have been fully
completed. As regards the dam safety works in Srisailam Dam, about 92% of the completion level has been
achieved, works are continuing at site and the GOAP is committed to complete at the earliest the balance
works using state funds.

(iv) The environment management plan (EMP) was implemented through the departments like Andhra
Pradesh State Forest Department (APSFD), Andhra Pradesh Finance Development Corporation (APFDC),
DOA, Dept. of Fisheries, Health. Ground Water Department (GWD) and WALAMTARI. Targets
assigned to them were achieved except in case of WALAMTARI which could not complete the required
number of training programmes.




                                                     - 36 -

(v) The PPMU was made fully operational with the required in-house human resource capacity and system
support. Four wings were established to undertake monitoring and evaluation of engineering works, R&R,
EMP and accounts.

        5.0 Project Impact:

The primary objective of the project was to complete the ongoing irrigation development and scheme
rehabilitation works taken up under the AP-II covering SRBC and SRS sub-projects. The overall
development objectives of the project have been achieved.

As planned for the SRBC project, an irrigation potential of 65,000 ha has been created, with the completion
of the A.P II spill over portions of the main canal, super passage structures @ km 35.48, massive
Gorakallu bypass siphon, Owk reservoir and the distributory network except micro network. SRBC
command can still receive water even without micro distribution network. However GOAP is committed to
complete these works with state funds within six months and necessary provisions has been made for this in
the state budget. Under SRSP, rehabilitation of 2,53,000 ha of irrigation system has been completed in all
respects. It needs to be mentioned that prior to rehabilitation, discharge of upto a maximum of 5,500 cusecs
only could be passed through Kakatiya canal. Consequent to rehabilitation, 7,900 cusecs water was passed
through Kakatiya canal during October, 2002 and 9,000 cusecs during August, 2003 and delivered to the
distribution system for irrigation. Besides the rehabilitation works have also contributed to a drastic
reduction in costs of the maintenance and have also contributed to improved irrigation service under SRS
sub-project command. Further the project interventions, including the involvement of WUAs in irrigation
management have also resulted in more optimal use of water, increase in the cropped area and cropping
intensity, growth in the productivity of principal crops and net farm incomes.

1. The WUAs and DCs constituted under the act were/are involved in planning, budget regulating and
opting the use of water in the SRSP command. The impact of the function of WUAs was clearly visible
with improvement in the supply of water to the tail reaches, declaiming the disputes among farmers over
the water sharing, improved vigilance over public irrigation works, improved relation between the farmers
and irrigation staff rising trend in the water rate collections, and O & M of the systems.

2. The strategy of having an independent unit of R&R had the desired impact. The resettlement activities
under the AP-III Project did not involve physical displacement of families. However a vast majority of the
PAPs and their major children displaced under AP-II were supported under this project. They enjoyed
higher income and improved standard of living, on account of the productive utilization of the grant
provided under the programme. The studies conducted by the external monitoring agencies have also
indicated that the PAPs under the programme experienced a significant improvement in their economic
status. The completion of infrastructure facilities works in resettlement villages also resulted in
improvement in the basic amenities such as road connectivity, water supply, schools, electricity etc.

3. The safety and sustainability of the dams supplying water to the project area. Is ensured with the
completion of dam safety studies and works except the second stage plunge pool protection works of
Srisailam Dam.

4. As regards the environmental improvements, safeguards and natural resource conservation, the potential
negative environmental impact of the project had been largely mitigated through eco-restoration and
compensatory aforestation programs. The works taken up under catchment area treatment programme led
to improvement in vegetative cover in the catchment area and foreshores and all along canal banks which
appears to have minimized soil erosion. The implementation of environmental health programs had resulted


                                                      - 37 -

in a decline in the water and vector borne diseases. The studies conducted on water quality indicated no
appreciable deterioration in ground water table and also helped in removing the water logging conditions in
some villages of SRS command. The fisheries development activities had contributed to ecological balance
in a small way.

5. The establishment of the PPMU had the desired impact of providing the project management with
comprehensive information as financial and physical dimensions of the project, the performance outcomes
of different components and emerging concerns form time to time. The PPMU has facilitating in
co-ordination of the implementing agencies and their periodic review and supervision by GOAP and the
Bank supervision missions. The Unit also played a very important role in facilitating reimbursement of the
expenditures by the World Bank.


    6.0 Sustainability:


The sustainability of the AP-III project and its outcomes are most likely for the following reasons:

The policy, water pricing and the institutional frame work are already in place to ensure the sustainability
of the investments made on the rehabilitation/creation of irrigation infrastructure under AP-III. Andhra
Pradesh has rate of irrigation water charges of about Rs. 500/- per ha, which if recovered fully, is enough
to meet the annual O & M needs. In addition, under A.P. Farmers Management Irrigation System
Act-1997, the Government is committed to constitute WUAs, DCs and PCs in all the irrigation schemes in
the state and involve them in the irrigation system management. Under this Act, WUAs and DCs were
elected in all the irrigation schemes in the State in 1997. After the expiry of five years tenure of the above
mentioned WUAs and DCs, elections of about 70% WUAs have already been completed and balance are to
be completed shortly. Thus, involvement of such WUAs, DCs and PCs will further ensure the sustainability
of investments. Under the Government policy, the water charges collected from the irrigation schemes are
being transferred back to the irrigation system and about 50% of that is transferred to the WUAs to under
take the annual O & M thereby contributing to the sustainability of the irrigations systems. Due to the
severe drought being faced by the State during the last 4 years, the recovery of water charges has been low.
However, the Government is committed to improve the recovery of water charges and also to make good
the short fall through budgetary support to ensure that the O & M needs of the irrigation systems are met.
The WUAs in SRSP are already constituted and DCs/PCs in SRSP and also WUAs, DCs and PCs in
SRBC are planned to be elected at the earliest under the A.P Farmers Management Irrigation System
Act-1997. In view of the above the sustainability of the AP-III Project is most likely.

There is a stronger political commitment to the development of the farm sector in general, and the irrigation
sector in particular, at the present juncture than before. The over riding importance given to the irrigation
sector could result not only in the completion of the balance works of the project, such as the micro
irrigation network, but could also ensure release of water to the SRBC.

The annual O&M budget required for the SRSP and the SRBC would be the minimum during the next 5 to
10 years.

Institutional arrangements in SRSP are firmly in place and will ensure the sustainability of project benefits.
The WUAs and the DCs in SRSP have had the experience of maintaining the minor canal system very
efficiently, besides managing the distribution of water, and the elections of the WUAs and DCs in SRBC
are planned to be completed soon.




                                                     - 38 -

The safety of Srisailam, SRSP and LMD dams are assured with the efforts made during the project period.
The completion of down stream protection works, strengthening of earthen dams at vulnerable reaches and
provision of additional instrumentation support enhance the safety of the dam structures.
The monitoring of water levels, water quality and the soils in the command areas do not suggest any major
problems arising out of water logging, deterioration in water quality and adverse impact on the soil
complex. However, the monitoring would be continued in both the sub-project commands.

The shift in the governments priorities in favour of agriculture would ensure support to the related
extension and agricultural services and corresponding growth in agriculture and incomes.

The on farm trials and demonstrations and training of farmers in the two command areas have created a
positive cascading impact on the agricultural practices, and to consolidate the gains made under the project,
training by the concerned departments would continue to facilitate decimation of the knowledge gained to a
larger segment with continuous discussions between the departments. Further, restoration of Command
Area Development Authority (CADA) services, integration of good agricultural practices, Integrated Pest
Management (IPM) and supply of good quality seeds and ensuring minimization of price risks would be
included as part of the package.

To ensure the sustainability of EMP works undertaken in the catchment area, canal banks, avenues,
agro-forestry zones their maintenance will be taken care of, by the forest department /other line department.

The benefits from R&R package appear to be sustainable. The active youth and the NGOs who had
participated in the rehabilitation process could be expected to support the PAPs in the maintenance of
assets. The assured flow of income experienced by the PAPs could also be expected to prevent asset
dispossession.


         7.0 Borrower's Performance:


The performance of the borrower i.e., the state can be termed as satisfactory so far as the implementation
of the project is concerned. The implementing agencies have risen to the need of the project despite the
initial set backs. A brief on various aspects is given below:

The major achievement of the project is the successful completion of almost all the planned works under the
AP-III and also, initiation of irrigation management reforms. Pursuant to the Andhra Pradesh Farmer's
Management Irrigation System Act of 1997, the entire command area of SRSP was brought under the
management of WUAs.

In preparation to the project implementation, the GOAP undertook a series of steps. These include:


l conversion of two O&M circles into construction circles and distribution of O&M tasks among all the
     five construction circles under SRSP;
l conduct of elections to all the WUAs and DCs prior to the launch of the project;
l completion of socio-economic survey and identification of PAPs for the implementation of Retroactive
     Action Plan (ReAP);
l preparation of O&M manual for post project operations;
l constitution of water charges review committee;
l constitution of dam safety review panel;
l formation of state coordination committee; and



                                                     - 39 -

l advance completion of investigations and designs.


The financial progress was rather slow at the beginning of the project. Ending June 2004, Rs. 20,137.32 M
were spent against the revised cost of Rs. 21904.86 M, this being 92%. The percentage achievement is
expected to reach the figure of 95% by end of July 2004, once all the pending liabilities are cleared. Thus it
can be concluded that the financial progress was satisfactory.

Implementation Performance
Since AP-III, is a major irrigation project, the GOAP had coordinated the project, developed policies and
techniques and carried out major procurement and logistics planning, sanctioning / flow of funds.
Sanctioning and flow of funds to the implementing agencies by the GOAP faced certain initial delays.
However, very soon, a series of steps were taken by the government to bring the project back on the track.
All legal covenants in accordance with the agreement were complied with.

Project expenditures were audited as per standard GOI procedures. The accounts were audited by the
Controller and Auditor General of India (CAGI).

Perfomance of Implementation agencies
The first four years of the project implementation was slower than planned due to start up delays resulting
from delays in: (i) land acquisition; (ii) release of counter part funds and budget allocations; (iii) award of
contracts; (iv) canal closure; (v) mobilization of machinery and labour by the contractors; and (vi)
commencement of works due to seasonal agricultural conditions. Thus, by December, 1999, only 25% of
the physical and financial progress was recorded as against 45% project period. However, by mid-term
review in May 2000, the project was back on track and the review mission was satisfied with the improved
pace. After the mid term, the implementing agencies took a number of steps to accelerate the pace of
implementation including facilitating sub-contracts in the SRSP. These positive initiatives worked well and
project implementation and disbursements continued to pickup pace. Sizeable increases were noted in
expenditures and the implementation teams performed well. However, because of the initial delays, the
project could not be completed within the agreed time schedule (January, 2003) and was extended up to
July, 2004. Closer monitoring and supervision and frequent reviews by the project management has
resulted in the completion of most of the works (except micro-irrigation network in SRBC).


    8.0 Bank's Performance:

The quality of the Bank's supervision was highly satisfactory. The World Bank supervision missions have
been taking place at regular intervals. The project implementation benefited from a high degree of
continuity in responsibilities both from the Bank and the Govt. During the entire implementation period, the
core Bank task team remained unchanged. The GOAP's implementing agencies remained same through out
the project period, although there were changes in the team leadership. However, the changes did not affect
project implementation. These factors contributed to a smooth supervision experience and improved follow
up and timely action on implementation issues. Sixteen formal supervision missions took place at the rate
of two per year, but supervision was virtually continuous as part of the Bank team was based in Delhi and
the task manager and selected staff visited project sites between formal supervision missions. The members
of the supervision missions, being renowned experts in different areas, provided high quality technical and
managerial advice on several issues, including dam safety. The Bank missions have played the role of a
facilitator and a partner in development, rather than the regulatory agency, which has had a healthy impact
on the implementing agencies.

A very good working relationship was established and continued through out the entire project period
among Bank Staff, the GOAP and its implementing agencies. The supervision missions played a supportive
role in the development of participatory irrigation development policy. The technical advice and support
provided by the successive Missions contributed to the identification and resolution of several
implementation issues.

        9.0 Lessons Learned:

Several lessons flow from the implementation of Third AP Irrigation Project. The Key lessons learned from
the project relate to

l Improved and advance reservoir operational planning is necessary for the successful rehabilitation of
    irrigation schemes. GOAP should formulate strategy for the release of NSRSP water, to ensure water
    supply to SRBC.
l It is desirable to take up procurement of civil works after completing the land acquisition and detailed
    investigations.
l Combining of micro irrigation works with distributory works in a single package would facilitate
    completion of these works together.
l Simplification of procurement process in the state is key to timely completion of works and to avoid
    cost and time over run.
l Enabling policy and institutional changes facilitate transformation of irrigation sector.
l Involvement of project beneficiaries groups is key to create ownership of project interventions and their
    sustainability.
l Good quality arrangement and mechanization is key to quality construction of infrastructure.
l In order to ensure the effectiveness of the R & R program, it is essential that the activities are properly
    timed and taken up soon after the acquisition of land / displacement.

  covered all the aspects very clearly and succinctly and agree with overall observations, suggestions and
  ratings of the Project. However we have some observations as given below:

 1. Subsequent to the visit of Supervision / ICR Mission in July 2004, water has been released in
     SRBC Project in August 2004, providing irrigation to about 44,000 ha.
 2. In respect to the Rehabilitation and Resettlement in SRBC Project, all the schemes which were
     shown pending during the mission visit, have now been implemented.
