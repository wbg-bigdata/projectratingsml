agricultural diversification and productivity through irrigation agronomy
research and improved command area extension services, and to improve
irrigation services by participatory irrigation management through the
project-wide establishment of Water User Associations (WUAs); (c)
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Program (5.0% of total base costs) to
mitigate adverse social impacts of land acquisition for irrigation works
resulting primarily from AP II works; (d) Environmental Management Plan



ii
(7.5% of total base costs) to implement a GOI mandated regional program of
environmental safeguards and conservation in sub-project districts; (e) Dram
Safety Assurance Works (5.0% of total base costs) to ensure the safety and
structural sustainability of the three dams serving the sub-project areas; and
(f) Project Monitoring and Evaluation (0.5% of total base costs).
Project Benefits:    The project would reduce production variability in the sub-project areas and
enable an increase in their production of high value cash crops estimated at
about US$140 million per annum (in 1995 constant prices). Irrigated
production would generate over 105,000 farm jobs and generate employment
in the transport, marketing and processing of farm produce. The incremental
farm income generated at full development is estimated to raise the income
of small farmers owning less than 2 ha (who comprise about 70-80% of
farming families) above the current Andhra Pradesh "Poverty Line"
threshold. The environmental investments would also generate salable
timber while the feeder road program would generate economic benefits due
to improved village access and time savings. The piloting of irrigation
management reforms and beneficiary participation modalities is expected to
result in replicable innovations throughout the public irrigation sector and
contribute to improving its efficiency and performance. The dam safety
component involving two major multi-purpose dams would not only ensure
sub-project irrigation sustainability but also irrigation and hydroelectric
production in the Krishna and Godavari river basins within Andhra Pradesh.
Project Risks:       Government commitment to the project and its irrigation reform objectives is
strong and already well-demonstrated. GOAP has ensured O&M cost
recovery by an unprecedented increase in statewide irrigation water charges
and is proceeding with a statewide program of participatory irrigation
management by promoting the establishment of WUAs on all major
irrigation schemes. There are, however, several ubiquitous risks which have
been addressed through the project design. Firstly, implementation agency
motivation risks arising out of a preference for construction work and lack of
interest in operations and maintenance (O&M) have been addressed by
organizational separation of construction contract management from O&M
responsibilities, and spreading responsibility for the agricultural support,
social and environmental components. Secondly, works implementation
capacity and delay risks are mitigated by safeguards in project design which
include a project Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget process, strict
procurement processing requirements, improved contract management
procedures and strengthened quality assurance arrangements and training.
Thirdly, beneficiary response and water availability risks are difficult to
eliminate by controlled mitigation measures.  Public information and
consultation has been extensive and it is assumed that social and political
pressures may be brought to bear on recalcitrant irrigators by farmers who
are to receive reliable water supplies for the first time.  Financial
sustainability risks are to be monitored by a standing GOAP Water Charges
Review Committee.

INDIA
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. The National Context
Agricultural Development and Poverty
1.01   Agriculture and its allied activities is still a key sector in India's economy, contributing
about 32% of the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 69% of employment in 1991. Due to
population growth, the average size of operational agricultural holdings has dropped from 2.7
hectares (ha) in 1960/61 to 1.7 ha in 1985/86. Thus increasing land productivity is the main
challenge to overcoming population growth and maintaining rural income. Bank research indicates
that rural economic growth in India has a salutary effect on poverty alleviation as the bulk of the
consumption gains to poor people since about 1970 are attributed to the direct and indirect impacts
of agricultural growth. Higher yields helped reduce absolute poverty through induced wage effects,
employment and own-farm productivity.
Irrigation Development and Management
1.02   The net irrigated area has grown to about 45.1 million (M) ha in 1989/90, and represents
about 32.4% of the net sown area of India. Only about 36% of the net area (15.9 M ha) is irrigated
by public canal systems, while private tubewells, tanks and shallow wells account for the remainder.
At least three-fourths of India's agricultural growth since 1947 stems from the synergy of fertilizers,
improved crop varieties and irrigation. While irrigated cereal yields are over twice those of rainfed
cereals. their average yield is about one third below the all Asia cereal average.
1.03   Public canal system performance has been below its potential, and significant problems need
to be addressed to maintain its past contribution: completion of state irrigation projects is
increasingly delayed; the gap between the planned cropping intensity and area actually irrigated has
widened; and the economic returns to project investment have been disappointing. The public
irrigation sub-sector has weaknesses in most areas of implementation and management: resource
planning is weak, water distribution is unreliable and often inequitable, maintenance is insufficient to
sustain existing infrastructure, institutions require strengthening, and in most states, construction
quality and cost recovery are inadequate. Until the early 1950s, revenues from water charges
exceeded government expenditures for operations and management (O&M) plus interest imputed on
investment. By 1989, current expenditures on O&M for public canal schemes exceeded revenues
from water charges by an amount equivalent to 2.1% of the current agricultural contribution to GDP.
Development and Irrigation Lending Strategy
1.04   Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The Bank's country assistance strategy for India--
reviewed by the Board on June 20, 1995 and September 5, 1996 respectively--supports GOI efforts
to provide an enabling environment for efficient private sector-led growth while strengthening the
effectiveness of government interventions in areas where it complements the private sector--poverty
alleviation, environment, human resource and infrastructure development.  Reducing poverty,



2
developing the private sector, improving environmental protection and natural resource conservation,
strengthening institutions, increasing the role of beneficiaries and Non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOs) in project design and implementation are all important elements of the CAS. Since
agricultural growth bolsters the rural poor (para. 1.02), national and state agricultural policy reform
are important instruments of the CAS. State fiscal reform is a focus of the CAS: hence Bank-
supported state investment projects should be consistent with state fiscal and financial capabilities.
1.05   India Irrigation Lending Strategy. In line with India's 1987 National Water Policy, the
Bank's irrigation sector strategy (India Irrigation Sector Review, Report No. 9518-IN, June 27, 1991)
identified sector reforms in four priority action areas. These areas are: (a) strengthening of river basin
planning and environmental monitoring capabilities; (b) increase of O&M works expenditure and water
charges, and re-prioritization of capital expenditure to favor scheme rehabilitation and completion of
ongoing works over new projects; (c) improvement of canal management and water distribution
performance; and (d) adoption of management and organizational reforms to strengthen state Irrigation
Department management accountability for irrigation services, and fostering of beneficiary
participation in scheme management.
B. The Andhra Pradesh Context
Economic Growth and State Finances
1.06   The economy of AP is still predominantly agrarian and agriculture employs about 67% of
the work force. Given its poor economic growth performance, AP has failed to expand its revenue
base needed to finance its subsidy and welfare programs and has been under fiscal stress since the
mid 1980s. This was created by (a) declining own state revenue as a share of Gross State Domestic
Product (GSDP); and (b) rapid change of state expenditure composition with substantial increase in
the share of subsidies, welfare programs, and salaries, together with a corresponding fall in the share
of non-wage O&M, and expenditure on physical and social infrastructure. As a result, the principal
fiscal and debt indicators have deteriorated along with growth performance. The fiscal deficit has
grown to 3.4% of GSDP by FY95/96 with total revenue and expenditure constituting 14% and 18%
of GSDP respectively. In recent years, about 22% of the State's total expenditures were financed
through borrowings and the capital expenditure share of total expenditure has been only about 15%.
1.07   An increasing reliance on central loans to finance State Plan expenditures has led to a high
level of debt relative to the state revenues. Interest payment have reached 28% of AP's own revenue
(2.3% of GSDP), while the total state debt amounts to 24% of GSDP. Consequently, the state
government has been increasingly forced to divert funds away from productive uses and resort to
borrowing to meet its commitment to expensive welfare schemes. The state's fiscal stress has been
aggravated in the past two years by introduction of a subsidized rice distribution scheme for the poor,
and loss of revenue due to prohibition of alcoholic drinks in the state. These programs together have
put an additional burden of about 4.2% of GSDP on the state's budget, and has precipitated an acute
fiscal crisis and liquidity difficulties.
Rural Demography and Poverty
1.08   Andhra Pradesh (AP) is India's fifth largest State (275,100 km 2) and fourth most populous
(66.51 million in 1991). Over 73% of the population resides in rural areas but rural to urban
migration has led to a high urban growth rate. A continuous increase in the number of agricultural
holdings is occurring with the average size of agricultural holdings dropping from 2.51 ha in 1970 to



3
about 1.55 ha in 1991. Marginal and small farms represent about 77% of all holdings, but only about
36% of the farm area. Whereas AP was the fourth highest state in percentage of population "below
the poverty line" (BPL) around 1960, it declined to about the nation's fourth lowest around 1990.
Poverty alleviation has improved more slowly in the 1980s despite the resources allocated by AP to
subsidies and direct welfare programs. This is explained by two factors. First, a large proportion of
AP anti-poverty programs are related to broad-based, badly targeted current consumption programs,
and not to asset building and employment generation. Among Indian states, AP now has the highest
proportion of its non-interest expenditure allocated to such programs. Secondly, higher subsidy and
budgetary allocations for welfare programs has crowded out physical infrastructure expenditure.
Agricultural Performance
1.09   Economic Productivity. The economic performance of AP's agriculture lags behind that of
India and prices for all crops except tobacco lag behind national averages. Since agriculture is the
main activity inter-linked with other sectors, growth in rural economic output in AP is largely
dependent on removing policy constraints which either inhibit cultivation or depress farm-gate
prices. Despite relatively high crop yields, real economic productivity was not achieved in the 1980s
because of use of costly modern inputs. Due to the large size and importance of the agricultural
sector, agriculture has always been the main focus of AP government policy and budget: irrigation
infrastructure and agriculture have respectively received about 40% and 12-14% of total public
investment. Prior to recent reforms, agriculture received large irrigation and power subsidies which
amounted to 2.7% of the GSDP, or 7.1% of agricultural value added.
1.10   Agricultural Output. The cultivable area of 15.65 M ha comprises 57% of the State. The
net sown area (i.e. net of the fallow area) in 1989/90 was 11.09 M ha and utilized with a cropping
intensity is 120%. Food crops constitute about 64% of the cropped area and about 71% of these
crops are grown in the monsoon season. AP produced 7.2% of India's total foodgrains in 1989/92,
and is the fourth largest grain-producing state in India. With the exception of rice--whose area has
grown over the last decade--the cultivated area of all other cereals is declining in response to rising
prices of oilseeds, pulses, and cotton.
1.11   Expansion of irrigation has had a major impact on agricultural productivity and the share of
irrigation in gross sown area was 40% in 1993/94. Irrigated rice constitutes about 52% of the total
foodgrain area. Irrigation and agro-chemicals are a major factor in increasing agricultural output in
AP. The average fertilizer consumption per gross cropped area was about 119 kg/ha in 1991 (the
second highest in India after Punjab). AP's pesticide use is the highest of any state. Since 1989/90,
however, agricultural production has been stagnant due to the continued decline in canal command
area (para. 1.12). which, in turn, led to a fall in cropped area and fertilizer use.
Public Irrigation Scheme Management
1.12   Scope of Public Irrigation. With a total net area of 4.029 M ha under irrigation in 1993, AP
is the second largest irrigation state after Uttar Pradesh, and accounts for about 9% of the nation's
irrigated area. Its canal command net area of about 1.73 M ha is the second largest in India. The
composition of the net area under various irrigation sources in terms canals, tanks, wells and various
other sources was about 43%, 18%, 35%  and 4%  in that order.  Canal schemes are used
predominantly for rice and cotton production, comprising about 52% and 39% respectively of the
gross area crop irrigated. The areas irrigated by private wells are predominantly used for irrigation



4
of most other foodgrains and cash crops. The net area under public surface irrigation reached a peak
of 2.9 M ha in 1990, but declined to 2.3 M ha by 1994 due to inadequate funding of O&M.
1.13   The Irrigation & Command Area Development Department. All public investment in
major and medium irrigation schemes, i.e. schemes larger than 2,000 ha (Map IBRD 18986RI)--
along with water resources planning, regional flood control and drainage, and construction of multi-
purpose reservoirs--are the responsibility of the Irrigation & Command Area Development
Department (ICADD). Minor irrigation investments are undertaken by ICADD's Minor Irrigation
Department and the Rural Development and Agriculture Department. Private sector participation is
limited to private funding of wells and small pump schemes. On three major schemes covering a
substantial portion of the canal command area, canal water management and on-farm development
are undertaken by a Command Area Development Authority (CADA) under ICADD control. The
construction of hydroelectric plants for multi-purpose reservoirs is undertaken by the AP State
Electricity Board, which operates them in coordination with ICADD with respect to water release
regimes. ICADD's budget resource allocation emphasizes starting new major and medium projects
rather than rehabilitation of existing schemes. This leads to time and cost overruns due to the spread
of limited capital resources and upkeep of under-employed personnel.  Furthermore, zonal
restrictions on transfer or retrenchment of lower level staff prevent staff reduction when an ICADD
project is completed.
1.14  Irrigation Laws. AP has no comprehensive irrigation law. Up to 1984, there were two
regional Acts: the Irrigation Cess Act, 1865 applicable to the Rayalaseema and Coastal Region; and
the Telangana Irrigation Act 1948, applicable to the Telangana Region. The 1865 Act made it lawful
to levy irrigation water charges on an scheme constructed by government, and to regulate cultivation
in designated areas (localized land) by imposition of a penal cess for: (a) irrigation outside a defined
six month irrigation season; or (b) by interfering with water supply to other irrigators. The 1948 Act
extended these regulatory concepts to include seasonal prohibition crops such as rice on the basis of
their water requirement. However, most of the provisions under the 1948 Act have been superseded
by the Irrigation Utilization and Command Area Development (IU & CAD) Act 1984. The 1984 Act
is applicable in any project placed under a CADA and enlarges ICADD's functions beyond water
management to include voluntary beneficiary participation and on-farm development. This Act has
not been effective in enforcing localization fostering voluntary beneficiary management, or
improving water management. Irrigation water charges for public schemes are levied under the 1988
Water Tax Act and are a function of crop type, season and size of scheme.
1.15   Localization. Irrigated areas in AP are classified as "Irrigated Wet" (IW) and "Irrigated
Dry" (ID) under a legal procedure known as "Localization". Under the 1984 Irrigation Utilization
and Command Area development Act, localization determines the water delivery regime that may be
supplied based on annual water availability, or a project planning policy of spreading the benefits of
irrigation as widely as possible by banning water intensive crops. This allows ICADD to prescribe
the season of irrigation for a canal, and the cropping pattern, period of sowing and crop duration
based on irrigation requirement considerations (IW, ID, double or perennial crop). Accordingly, IW
and ID localization designation of a canal command generally applies to either the monsoon and
post-monsoon seasons. In IW designated areas, all crops may be grown but farmers grow mostly
rice and sugarcane. In ID designated areas (usually lighter soils), rice and sugarcane are specifically
banned under the provisions of the 1984 Act because farmers in the canal head reaches would
prevent water from reaching the tail-end areas. Section 24(2) of the 1984 Act allows GOAP to alter
the Localization designation of an area if it wishes to advance the technology of land and water
management practices.

Previous Bank Involvement and Lessons Learned
1.16   Previous Involvement in Irrigation. As of 9/30/95, the Bank commitment of US$492.91
million for 16 ongoing projects in AP was the fourth largest state project portfolio. In water
resources development, a Hyderabad Water Supply Project (Cr.2115-IN/Ln.3181 -IN), and
hydrological data network improvement under the multi-state Hydrology Project (Cr. 2774-IN)
accounted for US$91.35 M. Previous Bank support for four irrigation projects has played a major
role in the irrigation development of AP These are: (a) Pochampad Irrigation (Cr. 268-lN); (b)
Godavari Barrages (Cr. 532-IN); (c) AP Irrigation and Command Area Development Composite (AP
I) (Ln. 1251-IN); and (e) Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation (AP II) Project (Cr. 1665-IN/Ln. 2662-
IN). The National Water Management (NWM) Project (Cr. 2179-lN/Ln. 3260-IN) included an AP
component to demonstrate improved network designs in six medium schemes.
1.17   General Lessons Learned. The Pochampad, AP I and MWM projects provided valuable
lessons such as: (a) a canal system must be properly designed and constructed to deliver water to the
individual farm; (b) major and minor conveyance systems, and main drainage, must be built
simultaneously; (c) to ensure project viability, water should not be released for irrigation until the
minor system is ready to receive it; (d) the minor system, from government outlets to farm gates,
must be operated by farmers organized in water user associations (WUAs); (e) the need for full canal
lining and more attention to a project's agricultural aspects during supervision; (f) development of
realistic operational plans for water management and O&M based on a prior diagnostic analysis; and
(g) increased training of irrigation staff in O&M, and training of agricultural department staff and
farmers. The AP component of the NWM Project was not successful because attention was not
given to eliciting farmer agreement to de-localization of IW lands.
1.18   The Lessons of AP II. As the proposed project is a follow-on project to, inter alia, complete
AP II (para. 1.22), the key lessons] of AP II are important. The primary lesson is that a project will
not succeed unless it is well prepared and appraised. Project appraisal lessons include: (a) water
supply availability and reliability must be unambiguously established and command areas sized
accordingly, but consideration should be given to possible system expansion at a later date; (b)
detailed designs for major works must be available at appraisal and should be based on cost-effective
design alternatives, field surveys and sub-surface investigations; (c) appraisal cost estimates should
be based on prevailing contracting industry prices; (d) introduction of new methods of design and
canal management must be fully documented by appraisal to ensure their understanding and
acceptance by the Borrower; and (e) appraisal missions must review the implementing agency's
ability to control construction quality and ensure efficient operation and management. Project
implementation lessons are: (i) procurement of works contracts must follow a logical implementation
sequence to facilitate timely realization of planned benefits and permit program adjustments if
problems arise; and (ii) project implementation success depends on the establishment of viable
institutional arrangements for participatory beneficiary involvement, and particularly where water
delivery arrangements are to be changed, appropriate administrative frameworks must be in place to
implement the new system.

C. The Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation (AP II) Project
The AP II Sub-Projects
1.19   AP II Objectives and Canal Management Policies. The proposed project is a follow-on
operation to complete the Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP II) and support irrigation
reforms in AP. Bank support for AP II (Credit 1665-IN/Loan 2662-N) consisted of a loan and credit
of US$131 million and SDR127.5 million to increase agricultural production by: (a) rehabilitation of
the existing 234,000 ha Sriramasagar Project (SRSP) command and its extension by another 34,000 ha
to km 284 of Kakatiya Canal (KKC); and (b) development of a new 65,000 ha command served by the
Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC). New water management principles were to be introduced to
implement GOAP's policy of equitable and cost-effective delivery of available water to a maximum
number of beneficiaries. These included: (i) reduced water allocation by "Irrigated Dry" (ID)
localization of land for all new command areas, and de-localization of "Irrigated Wet" (IW) land to ID
in SRSP; (ii) Rotational Water Supply (RWS), i.e. intermittent deliveries on a 7-14 day "on-off' basis
to outlets serving 40 ha blocks within which water would be distributed by farmer-managed Outlet
Committees according to a roster of pre-arranged turns; (iii) setting the capacity of irrigation outlets to
deliver a discharge proportional to the land area to be served according to the Structured Irrigation
Network concept of canal design and operation; (iv) throttling of oversized outlets and significant
elimination of uncontrollable direct farm outlets from large canals in SRSP; and (v) requiring rice
farmers on de-localized IW land to accommodate reduced and intermittent water deliveries by supply
augmentation from their private wells.
1.20   The SRBC Sub-Project. The SRBC command area is located in AP's Rayalaseema Region
and is situated along the west bank of the Kundu River, a tributary of the Krishna River (Map IBRD
18843R). The command area is about 130 km long and 5-10 km wide, with a cultivable command
area (CCA) of 77,000 ha. The area became potentially irrigable after completion of the Srisailam
Reservoir [live storage of 250 thousand million cubic feet (TMC)] on the Krishna River in the late
1970s. This reservoir was originally designed for hydropower generation only but was later
converted to a multi-purpose facility for water supply and irrigation. When SRBC was originally
conceived, all its water requirements were to be abstracted from the Srisailam Reservoir within 3-4
months during the monsoon season and conveyed over 70 km to the Gorakullu and Owk seasonal
storage reservoirs within the irrigation command. However, during the AP II appraisal these two
reservoirs were dropped. A description of the socio-environmental features of SRBC is given in
Annex 2 (paras 5-10). The SRBC planning history and Krishna River water allocation is described
in Annex 1.
1.21   The SRSP Sub-Project. The SRSP command is located in the Telengana Region of AP in
the Godavari river basin (Map IBRD 18842R). It is served by the Sriramasagar Reservoir on the
Godavari River. The upper portion of the command served by the Kakatiya Canal (KKC) was
originally developed up to KKC's km 113 under the Bank-supported Pochampad Project (para. 1.16).
By the early 1980s, GOAP had extended the KKC up to km 234 to create an irrigation potential of
323,000 ha. These works included construction of the Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) across the
Mannair River (a tributary of the Godavari River) at KKC's km 146 near Karimnagar. LMD
augments SRSP water supply by capturing the runoff from the Mannair River's free catchment and
serve as a balancing reservoir for SRSR. Under AP 11, the KKC was to be completed to km 284 and
its command extended to an additional 34,000 ha. A description of the socio-environmental features
of SRSP is given in Annex 2 (paras. 11 - 15) while its development history and Godavari River water
allocation are described in Annex 1.

Causes of AP II Implementation Failure
1.22   Implementation Problems. AP II did not achieve its development objectives: by the time of
project closure no additional area was ready for irrigation in SRBC and SRSP. Many of the reasons for
AP II's poor implementation progress arose from delays in land acquisition, procurement difficulties
and litigation, staff changes, counterpart funding shortages, and limited logistics resources. Other
causes of delay were the technical differences that arose between the Bank and GOAP as a result of
inadequate project quality-at-entry (paras. 1.21 and 1.22). Furthermore, Bank funding was reduced
during the course of the project due to: (a) reallocation of SDR40.8 million to implement the AP
Cyclone Emergency Reconstruction Project (Cr. 1770-IN); and (b) cancellation of the entire loan by
1993 on the grounds of slow disbursement and Rupee devaluation.  Thus, despite improved
implementation in 1993/94, it was not possible to extend the project period as all Bank project funds
would have been disbursed by June 1994. These financing difficulties were partially overcome in
November 1993 when the Bank announced that: (i) it would consider supporting completion of AP II
works under a follow-on project, provided a satisfactory feasibility study was submitted by GOAP
resolving all outstanding issues; but that (ii) all interim procurement would be at GOAP's own risk. At
project closure, GOAP was left with contractual commitments of about US$118 million.
1.23   Resettlement &  Rehabilitation (R&R).  The AP II R&R component provided for
retrospective actions to rehabilitate Project Affected Persons (PAPs) displaced by the construction of
the Srisailam Reservoir in the 1960s, and the Lower Mannair Dam in the 1970s and 1980s. However,
project effectiveness was delayed about 15 months till October 2, 1987 due to GOAP's inability to
submit a Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) satisfactory to the Bank, and only after the
Bank waived this effectiveness condition. Instead the Bank accepted a continuously evolving RAP
without defined action targets or a R&R policy: thus at closure, it is not certain whether the R&R
component fully achieved acceptable targets. No provision was made in the project RAP for PAPs
affected by canal or road construction as this was assumed to have insignificant impact.
1.24   Inadequate Public Consultation in SRSP. To ensure that the AP 1I water management
strategy (para. 1.16) would be undertaken in a systematic manner, GOAP was to introduce and apply
RWS and an ID water allocation regime (para. 1.15) in SRSP. Since rehabilitation and de-
localization would take time, a phased program was agreed whereby the whole IW area of 62,000 ha
above LMD would be converted to ID by June 1993. However, when the first Government Order
(G.O.) for de-localizing 5,299 ha from IW to ID in the Karimnagar district was issued in July 1987,
the district's public representatives opined that the conversion would entail hardship and financial
losses to the affected farmers, and petitioned GOAP to reconsider the matter.  Given that
maintenance of the status quo would defeat the whole purpose of the AP II project, a GOAP Expert
Committee upheld the project's water management principles (para. 1.19) but recommended that de-
localization would be slower with 80% of the de-localization to be undertaken during the last year of
the project prior to its closure on June 30,1 994. Thus, due to difficulties with rice cultivators, no
rehabilitation works were undertaken in SRSP and instead, only works to extend the command area
below km 234 of KKC were undertaken.
1.25   Design And Appraisal Inadequacies of SRBC. The technical and cost overrun difficulties of
SRBC implementation may be traced to Bank acceptance of a project prefeasibility study instead of a
feasibility study. Cost estimates were not based on detailed designs but on prefeasibility study
estimates, detailed operational hydrology assessments were not undertaken, and design altematives
were not based on detailed field studies and sub-surface investigations. The lack of prior canal



8
alignment studies and detailed sub-surface investigation resulted in the SRBC main canal cost overruns
due to: (a) the frequent need to excavate in unanticipated rock outcrops; and (b) construction of
unforeseen high concrete walls to retain canal flow at locations where the main canal crossed flat
valleys. Since main canal alignment was not reviewed after dropping of the seasonal storage reservoirs
(para. 1.20), the Owk Tunnel and Owk Reservoir became inevitable. Furthermore, despite Bank review
of SRBC water availability during appraisal, Bank concerns about water availability became a major
issue and led GOAP to prepare simulation studies to reintroduce the Gorakulu and Owk reservoirs into
AP II (Annex 1).
Resolution of AP II Project Design Issues
1.26   Project Design Revisions. Preparation of the proposed project sought to apply the lessons
of prior Bank involvement in AP irrigation projects and those of AP II in particular (paras. 1.24-
1.25). The AP II project design was reviewed and modified to mitigate project implementation risks
and resolve planning issues. This included: (a) detailed feasibility studies, sub-project feeder road
traffic surveys (Annex 10, para. 34) and participatory rural appraisals to determine farmer irrigated
cropping pattern preferences (Annex 10, para. 15); (b) river basin and project simulation model
studies on water supply availability and reliability (Annex 1); (c) formulation of a R&R policy and
action plans for rehabilitation of families affected by canal and road construction (paras. 2.40-2.47
and Annex 5), and completion of the AP II R&R program for reservoir oustees (para. 2.48); (d)
improvement of detailed engineering designs (para. 2.13) and bid documents; (e) construction
quality assurance arrangements (paras. 2.26-2.28); (f) undertaking of a priori and fully documented
public consultations in SRSP regarding farner acceptance of project de-localization and rotational
water supply policies (Annex 14); (g) a framework for participatory irrigation management based on
turnover of tertiary irrigation networks to registered WUAs (paras. 2.32-2.36, paras. 4.01-4.05 and
Annex 3); (g) an improved framework for project operations and maintenance (O&M) organization,
management and funding (para. 2.19, paras. 4.06-4.08); (h) an improved irrigation agronomy and
extension program (paras. 2.29-2.31); (i) an expanded staff and farmer training program (paras. 2.37-
2.39); (j) environmental impact analysis and environmental management plan (paras. 2.49-2.52 and
Annex 2); and (k) statewide increase of irrigation water charges (paras. 4.09-4.11 and Annex 11).
The need for investments to ensure the safety and sustainability of project reservoirs that had became
apparent during AP II led to inclusion of a dam safety component (paras. 2.21-2.25). Particular
attention was given to project performance indicators (para. 4.35), implementation monitoring
arrangements (paras. 4.3 8-4.41) and required project staffing schedules (Annex 8).
Investigation of Scheme Design Alternatives
1.27   SRBC (Annex 1). The water availability issue was resolved by a GOAP simulation model
of the existing and proposed schemes and facilities in the AP portion of the Krishna Basin. The
model examined various planning options related to the size of SRBC command area and the need
for off-channel storage reservoirs to ensure its water supply reliability. It was found that--under full
anticipated development of the Krishna river basin--a 75% annual water supply reliability to SRBC
would be ensured to a command of 65,000 ha with an Owk Reservoir of reduced capacity (para.
2.11). Water availability for SRBC should not be a sub-project viability issue. To ensure that
adequate priority would be allocated to seasonal water supply to SRBC, appropriate operating rules
were developed for Srisailam Reservoir and institutionalized by a Government Order (para. 4.18).
1.28   SRSP (Annex 1). Water availability and command area size alternatives were reviewed by
means of a simulation model which focused on water supply reliability to the existing and proposed



9
extension of the command below LMD. The model results clearly indicated that supply reliability to
any extension of the existing command area would be unacceptably low given upstream riparian
water rights and the limited storage capacity of the Sriramasagar Reservoir. Thus the proposed
project would only undertake rehabilitation of the existing SRSP command and not support
completion of the 34,000 ha extension begun under AP II except for retrospective R&R of families
affected by land acquisition for AP II SRSP network extension works. The model also exhibited
sensitivity to overall irrigation efficiency which should attain about 40% if water supply to the below
LMD command is to have a reliability of 75%. Consequently, in addition to public consultations
regarding the RWS policy, a Government Order for de-localization of the command to an ID supply
regime was issued prior to negotiation of the proposed project. The delocalization was required to
ensure the irrigation efficiency improvements expected under the project from network
rehabilitation, RWS and introduction of water distribution by WUAs to achieve water distribution
equity and control wasteful irrigation (para. 2.18).
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Rationale, Objectives and Components
Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.01   Irrigation Sector Reform. In line with the India CAS (para. 1.04), the Bank has been engaged
in a dialogue with GOAP about fiscal measures to alleviate its irrigation sector financial crisis.
Subsequent statewide public consultations on irrigation water charges resulted in GOAP issuing an
Ordinance for an unprecedented increase in irrigation water charges. A complementary increase in
O&M budgets is also being considered. Dialogue with GOAP has also set in motion an ICADD
organizational reform process including plans to place tertiary irrigation networks under beneficiary
control through participatory irrigation management (PIM) institutions. Having adopted a PIM Policy,
GOAP is engaged in the formation of autonomous WUAs throughout the public irrigation sector.
GOAP is also addressing the management and operational performance problems in ICADD. Since the
project is intended to serve as pilot for GOAP's strategies of decentralized management and beneficiary
empowerment, promotion of this effort via the project would be consistent with the Bank's irrigation
lending strategy for India (para. 1.05). Involvement in the project at this juncture would strongly
support GOAP's irrigation sector reform program and enable the Bank to maintain an irrigation policy
reform dialogue with India's second largest irrigation state.
2.02   Rural Infrastructure Development. The Bank's support for the project would contribute to
GOAP's high priority goals of improving the performance of upland irrigation schemes and their
expansion (paras. 1.09 and 1. 16). The economic potential created by AP 11 investments have yet to be
tapped, and Bank financing as a "lender of last resort" would help make this possible. The Bank's
involvement would significantly reduce the time it would take GOAP to complete the AP II works
using its own meager resources. The project would also support the safety and sustainability of two
multi-purpose reservoirs of vital regional importance and also facilitate the execution of an otherwise
unaffordable environmental conservation initiative. Thus, Bank support to increase rural productivity
in an environmentally sustainable manner would contribute to improved economy and efficiency in
public expenditure. The project has a potential for rural transformation: thus Bank involvement would
thus support GOAP's strong political-economic commitment to poverty alleviation (para. 1.06) and
contribute to raising the family incomes of marginal and small farmers--who comprise the majority of
project beneficiaries--above the official poverty threshold.



10
Project Objectives
2.03   The primary objective of the project would be to complete ongoing irrigation development and
scheme rehabilitation works begun under Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project and thus realize the
potential for increasing agricultural productivity and rural incomes in two economically backward
regions of Andhra Pradesh. The other objectives would be to: (a) pilot implementation of management
reforms to improve public irrigation performance by facilitating beneficiary participation in the
operation and maintenance of major irrigation schemes, and upgrade GOAP capacity to improve
irrigation services and command area management; (b) retrospectively mitigate the adverse impacts of
land acquisition under the Second Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project, and proactively provide economic
rehabilitation for those families still to be affected by completion of SRBC works; (c) ensure the safety
and sustainability of three dams supplying water to the project areas; (d) implement a mandated
regional program of environmental improvements, safeguards and natural resource conservation; and
(e) improve GOAP monitoring and evaluation capability for large externally aided irrigation projects.
Project Components
2.04   The proposed project would incur a base cost of US$434.06 million over a five and one half
year period to implement the six components needed to achieve project objectives. A summary
description of these components follows below while their detailed features are given in Section B to D
thereafter.
2.05   Irrigation Development and Rehabilitation Works (Base Cost US$346.32 million). This
component consists of two sub-projects as follows:
* SRBC Sub-Project (Base Cost US$166.14 million). The SRBC component would support
completion of the scheme including all civil works begun under AP II. Structures and activities
include: (a) completion of sections of the main canal and the Gorakullu By-Pass Siphon; (b)
construction of the Owk Tunnel and Owk seasonal storage reservoir; (c) lined irrigation network for
65,000 ha; (d) drainage system and on-farm development; and (e) completion of feeder roads begun
under AP II and about 50 km of new feeder roads.
* SRSP Sub-Project (Base Cost US$180.18 million). The SRSP component would support the
rehabilitation of 165,000 ha of irrigation system above the Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) and 88,000
ha of existing network below LMD up to km 234 of Kakatiya Canal. Necessary works and
activities include: (a) selective rehabilitation of canal lining and structures of Kakatiya Canal up to
km 234; (b) rehabilitation and modemization of the existing irrigation network (inclusive of on-
farm development and drains where necessary); and (c) completion of feeder roads begun under AP
II and about 50 km of new feeder roads.
The base costs of each sub-project include the following common implementation activities and
investments: (i) procurement of equipment for communications, construction quality assurance
laboratories and O&M organization; (ii) construction quality assurance training of construction
supervision staff and irrigation training of O&M staff, (ii) establishment of a computerized
Management and Information system; and (iv) surveys, studies and technical assistance.
2.06 Agricultural Support Service Programs (Base Cost US$10.71 million). The component
would support programs for improving the technical performance and productivity of irrigated



11
agriculture. The Irrigation Agronomy Program for SRBC and SRSP includes: (a) applied research and
demonstration of irrigation practices and agronomy to improve irrigation practices and crop yields; (b)
upgrading of the agricultural extension services in SRSP; and (c) program of applied research,
demonstrations and extension to promote high value horticultural crops. The WUA Promotion Program
includes: (i) completion of a pilot program to develop WUA frameworks, training modules and joint
system management modalities involving 32 WUAs in SRSP; (ii) implementation of an Action Plan to
establish WUAs for the whole command areas of SRBC and SRSP; (iii) technical assistance by NGOs
for the WUA program; and (iv) studies of indigenous irrigation institutions in SRBC and SRSP. The
Farmer Training Program  includes: (i) provision of training facilities and courses in irrigation
agronomy to ICADD staff and farmers; and (ii) irrigation and management training courses for ICADD
staff and WUA office holders.
2.07   Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) Program (Base Cost US$21.81 million). This
program provides for economic rehabilitation of the families of three groups of Project Affected
Persons (PAPs) and their major (adult) children adversely affected by past and proposed land
acquisition for SRBC and SRSP works. This includes: (i) retrospective assistance to about 6,000 PAPs
(including their 2,787 major children) affected by land acquisition for canals and roads under the AP 11
project; (ii) rehabilitation of about 500 PAPs (including their 244 major children) to be affected by
SRBC canal works under the project; (iii) assistance to 778 "below poverty line" reservoir oustee
families who were not assisted under the AP R&R component; and (iv) PAP vocational training for
income generating schemes. The program would also complete the AP 1I R&R component's program
of provision of community facilities and house plots for reservoir oustees in 104 resettlement villages.
2.08   Environmental Management Plan (Base Cost US$32.48 million). This component supports
a GOI mandated regional program of environmental safeguards and nature conservation in command
area districts. It includes: (a) compensatory afforestation; (b) improvement and protection of six Forest
Reserve areas and two wildlife sanctuaries; (c) establishment of an LMD bird sanctuary and fish
farm; (d) catchment area treatment programs to mitigate reservoir sedimentation ; (e) an
environmental health program; (f) construction of three environmental education centers and
establishment of project environmental monitoring units; and (g) an SRSP agro-forestry program.
2.09   Dam Rehabilitation and Safety Assurance (Base Cost US$20.28 million). This component
supports investments to: (i) maintain the structural and mechanical integrity of Sriramasagar, Lower
Mannair and Srisailam dams; and (ii) works to prevent failure of the Srisailam dam spillway.
2.10   Project Monitoring and Evaluation (Base Cost US$2.47 million). This component provides
for strengthening of ICADD's Project Preparation and Monitoring Unit.
B. Detailed Features of Irrigation Investments
SRBC Civil Works
2.11   Main Canal (Annex 2, Figure 1). The partially completed main canal, flows south along
hillsides for 50 km  before reaching the partially completed  Gorakullu  By-Pass (GBP)
aqueduct/siphon and the irrigation command. Beyond GBP, the canal flows for about 63 km
commanding about 41,000 ha divided into 11 irrigation blocks (of which two are under
construction). Between km 113.6 to km 119.5, new conveyance system investments consist of: (a)
the 2 km long Owk Tunnel and (b) the linkage of two existing irrigation tanks by low dams and a
central spillway to create the 1.9 TMC capacity Owk seasonal storage reservoir. The existing tanks



12
command about 670 ha under rice cultivation and provision is made for a reliable supply to this area.
A pumping station at Owk Reservoir is provided to fully evacuate reservoir dead storage every year.
After Owk Reservoir, the existing main canal continues for about 26 km. Five irrigation blocks
covering 24,000 ha would be constructed to complete a total command area of 65,000 ha.
2.12   The main canal works and GBP are divided into eleven ongoing construction contracts
begun under AP II and continued through 1994-1996. With the exception of GBP, these works are in
an advanced stage of completion and have been inspected in June 1996 by an independent
construction quality audit team to certify their eligibility for retroactive financing. The planning,
subsurface investigations and designs for the Owk Complex (tunnel and reservoir) have been
continuously monitored and reviewed by an independent Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP). The
Owk Complex is divided into 3 contract packages based on detailed designs and bid documents
reviewed by an experienced construction specialist.
2.13   Irrigation Network. Management and control of canal flow is based on Rotational Water
Supply (RWS) (i.e. "on-off' alternate supply periods of at least 7-10 days each) and structure designs
suited to the "structured irrigation network" (SIN) principle. The SIN principle provides no gated
structures below the head of a minor canal serving 2,000-4,000 ha and which is to flow at full design
discharge during each irrigation period. Distribution canals for the 16 irrigation blocks offtake from
the main canal through head regulators located adjacent to, or upstream of a main canal cross-
regulator. The head regulators are equipped with manually operated undershot gates, however
consideration will be given to installation of overshot gates for more reliable control. Technical
assistance would be utilized to analyze the viability of this possible innovation. In order to facilitate
efficient conveyance (including partial reduction of seepage losses), maintenance and canal
sustainability in Black Cotton Soils, the canal network utilizes a lined section down to a discharge of
about 0.028 cumec (1 cusec). Since the distribution network is aligned predominantly on swelling
Black Cotton soil, the lining is to be placed on a compacted layer of cohesive non-swelling (CNS)
soil of appropriate thickness (based on standard field investigation of soil swelling properties).
2.14   The irrigation network has been divided into 16 contract packages. Construction of Blocks
IV and VIII was begun in 1994 and is ongoing and were found eligible for retroactive finance by the
construction quality audit. These blocks were originally to be lined to a I cumec capacity only: thus
the works for lining to a 0.028 cumec capacity will be a separate contract to be bid during the
project. Irrigation water is to be supplied to watercourses through adjustable proportional module
(APM) and open flume module (OFM) outlets to ensure that each 30-40 ha watercourse command
receives a flow in proportion to its size. No direct outlets will be allowed from the main canal. The
APMs and OFMs are capable of being shut by sliding shutters if some watercourse commands do not
wish to draw water after heavy rainfall: hence all minor canals are also to have a tail-escape structure
into the main drainage network.
2.15   The project will assist farmers in laying out the micro-network within a watercourse
command and with the lining the first 10 m of each watercourse. Separate contracts will be used for
drainage and watercourse command on-farm development works. The latter are to be begun about
nine months prior to the completion of civil works in each irrigation block and their designs would
be vetted by farmers after preparation by consultants. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
all micro-network designs for each watercourse command ("chak") in SRBC would be completed by
consultants at least 15 months prior to completion of each irrigation network works contract, and that
these designs would be reviewed and accepted by the prospective beneficiary farmers prior to
initiation of the micro- network works.



13
SRSP Civil Works
2.16   Scope. Rehabilitation and modernization works are to be undertaken in two command areas
(Annex 2, Figure 2): "above LMD"(km 0-146 of KKC) and below "LMD" (km 146-234 of KKC).
The works are grouped under a number of contract "packages": a package being either a specific
length of Kakatiya Canal (KKC) and/or a portion of the command area--normally a distributary canal
command or part of one, an area of watercourse command development and/or an area of drainage
works. There are 16 rehabilitation packages above LMD covering an existing area of 165,000 ha and
7 rehabilitation and network completion packages below LMD covering 88,000 ha. One package
above LMD and three packages below LMD are ongoing works begun under AP II which are
deemed eligible for retroactive financing by the construction quality audit.
2.17   Kakatiya Canal Rehabilitation and Improvements. The conveyance capacity of KKC is
about 40% below its nominal design discharge of 243 cumec because of damaged lining, channel
side slope slips, neglected silt deposition etc. Many of the mechanical appurtenances in its
regulating structures are also in poor condition or barely operable. Simulation studies (Annex 1)
have indicated that, unless its capacity is restored after rehabilitation of the command above LMD, it
will not be able to convey monsoon surplus water stored in the SSR to LMD for irrigation of the area
below LMD. As per the designs prepared under AP II, the KKC discharge capacity is to be restored
and increased from 243 cumecs to 274 cumecs from km 0 to km 146 by increasing the full supply
depth of the canal by 0.46 m and raising the canal lining. KKC also requires repairs to its existing
lining in many reaches and completion of some structures.
2.18   Distribution Network Rehabilitation. The design for the rehabilitation of the irrigation
network is based on introduction of RWS and remodeling of structures according to SIN principles
and is otherwise similar to that of SRBC (para. 2.13). Accordingly, all SRSP lands have been de-
localized to ID irrigation (para. 1.15). The number of gates are therefore to be reduced, and suitable
SIN structures are to be provided. About 30% of the lined network is aligned through Black Cotton
soils where lining is to be placed on a CNS soil layer. Where possible, small distributaries are to be
linked to enable efficient water control and canal regulation. Many outlets for these small areas are
oversized and would be throttled to reduce their excessive and wasteful discharges, while all
watercourse pipe outlets would be replaced by APM or OFM modules. All broken structures and
mechanical appurtenances are to be repaired. Prior to Negotiations, GOAP issued a Government
Order de-localizing all SRSP command lands up to km 234 of Kakatiya Canal to ensure the viability
of RWS implementation.
2.19   Interim Repairs and Maintenance. Currently only about Rs.19/ha/year is allocated for
maintenance for the SRSP scheme as a whole. Consequently, much deferred maintenance needs to
be carried out (such as desilting and small structure repairs) just to keep the remaining network in
minimal running order prior to completion of rehabilitation. The pilot WUA establishment program
has shown that with minor repairs and farmer cooperation under a WUA framework, the irrigated
area could be increased by as much as 20-28%. GOAP has therefore issued a Government Order in
1995 allocating a sum of Rs217.1 million for interim repairs to be spent over a period of 7 years
beginning in FY95/96. As an incentive for farmers to form WUAs, all deferred maintenance works
would be undertaken by WUAs under contract with ICADD. However, as irrigation network and
main canal contracts in SRBC and SRSP are completed, normal O&M expenditure would be
provided with project assistance on a declining scale (para. 3.18)



14
Rural Feeder Roads
2.20   The AP II program for construction and upgrading of SRBC and SRSP feeder roads to
provide all-weather access to villages having a population of over 1,000 would be completed under
the project. Thus no part of the irrigated portion of the sub-project areas would be further than 3-4
km from an all-weather road. To date, 107 km have already been completed under AP II: therefore
about 50 km of new roads would be undertaken in each of sub-project command areas respectively.
The feeder roads would conform to GOAP design standards satisfactory to the Bank. These include:
(a) 3.5 m wide roads with surfacing of water-bound macadam and no black topping; and (b)
construction of hard passages instead of concrete bridges over seasonal streams. The sub-grade
design would be according to requirements dictated by forecast rural traffic (typically 15 cm deep)
and the foundation according to California Bearing Ratio criteria. To ensure that planning, design
and construction of the road sub-component can progress unhindered, an assurance was obtained at
negotiations that, by October 1, 1997, and thereafter by April I of every year, GOAP would submit
to the Bank/IDA for review: (i) plans for the extent of the sub-project road reserves to be acquired
for development in the following or subsequent construction season; and (ii) detailed designs, cost
estimates and bid documents satisfactory to the Bank/IDA for the roads to be newly constructed.
Dam Safety Works and Assurance
2.21   The dam safety component for project reservoirs has been prepared by ICADD on the basis
of DSRP site visits and recommendations from 1988 to 1996. These were compiled into two 1995
Notes on Dam Safety and Sustainability and a 1996 summary report entitled Dam Safety Assurance
and Rehabilitation - Identification Report (Annex 14). The latter report summarizes the project
program and outlines a general dam safety assurance program for all dams in the state.
2.22   Srisailam Dam Spillway Safety. The plunge pool downstream of Srisailam dam's ski-jump
spillway is becoming scoured and the possible progressive movement of the scour upstream could
endanger the foundation of the ski-jump bucket. The consequent exposure of the weak seams
occurring in dam's foundation may adversely affect the gravity dam's safety against sliding. The
two outer gates of the spillway cannot be opened because of dangerous erosion of the river valley hill
slopes by flaring of the spillway water trajectory. Thus spillway modifications are also needed to
ensure dam safety against large floods.
2.23   Based on model tests, the solution suggested by the DSRP envisages construction of: (a) a
coffer dam for dewatering the plunge pool; (b) construction of a toe wall with its top about 2-3 m
above the bed and its foundation firmly anchored into hard rock to a depth of about 2 m; and (b) the
space between the toe wall and existing apron would be filled with concrete up to 3 m thick, and
covered with a 3 m thick concrete blanket firmly anchored in rock with passive anchors. Model tests
indicate that construction of a divide wall on the downstream spillway face and bucket adjacent to
the non-overflow 'river sluice' block could curb the spillway water jet flaring problem.
Implementation of these solutions will require: (i) assessment of the magnitude and extent of the
existing scour by detailed inspection of the plunge pool by underwater photography; and (ii) a
feasibility study including analysis of construction methods. Technical assistance from international
experts would be sought evaluate the feasibility study.



15
2.24   Sriramasagar Dam and LMD River Sluices Repair. Silt has accumulated behind the six
river sluice gates of Sriramasagar dam and thereby jamming them completely (one river sluice of
LMD has been similarly jammed). These gates are now inoperable, cannot function as permanent
low-level outlets and also compromise structural safety since emergency gates were never installed.
The immediate silt will have to be removed by deployment of desilting machinery (e.g. mini-
dredgers) and divers are needed to clear the gate grooves to make them operable. Some gates may
have to be replaced, but due to the height of accumulated silt it may be necessary to block the sluice
tunnels permanently: the need for this contingency would be determined by dam safety studies.
2.25   Dam Sustainability. A number of investigations and improvements have been identified by
the DSRP to ensure the sustainability of the Srisailam, Sriramasagar and Lower Mannair dams.
These activities, to be undertaken under DSRP supervision, would include: (a) detailed structural
behavior, dam deformation and instrumentation studies for Srisailam Dam; (b) installation of
additional structural and uplift pressure monitoring instrumentation and devices; (c) modernization
of disposal of internal drainage water in the dams and provision of ventilation in their internal
inspection galleries; (d) petrographic analysis of rock and concrete samples (including coring of
samples) to check alkali-aggregate reactivity potential; (e) procurement of lightweight pneumatic
diamond core drilling machines and compressors for reaming of choked drainage holes in foundation
galleries; (f) field and laboratory equipment for concrete leaching investigations to mitigate the
clogging of porous concrete drains which drain seepage water from the dam body; and (g) technical
assistance to undertake a Probable Maximum Flood studies.
Construction Quality Assurance Plan
2.26   Laboratory Equipment.  ICADD has prepared an Action Plan for Quality Control
Organization (Annex 14) to cope with the increased construction supervision load that would be
generated by the large number of construction contracts that would be simultaneously active in
SRBC and SRSP. In addition to defining the duties, functions and numbers of staff required by the
Quality Control Units (para. 2.27), this Plan also provides for upgrading of inadequate central and
field laboratory equipment and facilities based on the listing of cement, concrete, aggregate, steel and
soil tests to be performed by these laboratories (Annex 9). The existing four laboratories in SRSP
are to be expanded into three central laboratories and four field laboratories (for routine daily tests).
Because of the more compact nature of the SRBC scheme, upgrading of the existing central
laboratory is proposed with routine tests being carried out by three mobile field laboratories.
Detailed lists of the laboratory equipment required are given in the Quality Control Action Plan.
2.27   Supervision Staff Training (Annexes 4 and 9). Because it involves new major works,
SRBC requires highly trained supervisory staff if quality assurance is to be achieved by supervisory
staff. The project has already benefited from participation of 20 SRBC engineers in a National
Council for Cement and Building Materials (NCCB) course in concrete construction practice. Under
a Training Program (Annex 14) prepared by ICADD it is proposed that the NCCB training program
would continue under the project and include 60 and 150 SRBC and SRSP officers respectively. The
program would include 'hands-on' and 'on-the-job' training to construction and quality control
personnel. This would be followed by periodic quality audits and re-training. The training program
envisages 16 three-day Quality Control and Assurance courses for 20 Supervisory Engineers (SEs)
and Executive Engineers (EEs) per course at the AP Water and Land Management Training and
Research Institute (WALAMTARI) campus over a five years.



16
2.28   Contract Management. In addition to the extant Quality Control Manual, Quality Audit
Guidelines and an 'OK Card' system have been introduced during project preparation with salutary
results. The OK Card system is a pro-forma check-list of all tasks, installation and construction
activities associated with each structure and separate civil construction type for each contract. The
cards are inspected by quality control staff and are duly signed and remarked upon by both
supervision and contractor representatives when each work is ready for execution and upon its
completion. These procedures would be continued under the project. In addition to the above, a
training program envisages 16 three-day Contract Law and Administration courses for 20 SEs and
EEs per course at the WALAMTARI campus over a five year period. An understanding was reached
at negotiations that the OK Card system would be followed by GOAP and maintained.
C. Detailed Features of Agricultural Support Service Programs
Irrigation Agronomy Program
2.29   Applied Research and Demonstrations. Irrigation agronomy in SRSP would be improved
by an active program of applied research on farmer's fields with the objective of evolving and
demonstrating profitable diversified cropping sequences for horticultural and 'dry' crops (e.g. maize,
cotton and sunflower) under an RWS regime. Extension 'messages' would be developed with
respect to optimal crop wetting and time of application, improved field irrigation techniques,
fertilizer and agro-chemical application, and use of improved cultivars and varieties. The program
would be undertaken along two selected distributaries above and below LMD respectively over a
period of five years. Each distributary would have three 40 ha sites at selected locations along its
upper, middle and lower reaches: thus the test area would total 240 ha. There would also be
sprinkler and drip pressurized irrigation demonstration plots of 2 ha each. These sites would
preferably be where WUAs have been organized and would be selected jointly by ICADD,
Department of Agriculture (DOA) and farmers' representatives. A third test area of 120 ha would be
selected in either Block IV or Block VIII of SRBC depending on which is completed first.
2.30   Lists of required vehicles, laboratory and field equipment and necessary farm implements
have been prepared. The sub-component would require temporary recruitment (for 5 years) of 3
research associates and 3 data recorders. Aside of extension to disseminate findings, a Farmer
Exchange Program would form part of the demonstration strategy. Under this program, funding is
provided over a five year period to arrange 2-day observation visits of 2,700 selected farmers from
new and rehabilitated commands to research stations and other commands.
2.31   Upgrading of SRSP Extension Services. The existing agricultural extension service would
be strengthened in the area of irrigation water management, systematic land development, and credit
for land leveling through cooperatives and banks. The Contact Farmer approach of the Training &
Visits (T&V) system was found to be ineffective and has been replaced by more effective mass
contact through regular large group meetings and exhibitions.  Participatory Rural Appraisal
techniques for eliciting farmer feedback would be an element of the extension approach. The
compulsory fortnightly Village Extension Officer (VEO) orientation and training meetings of the
T&V system would be maintained to ensure uniform and timely extension message transfer. Andhra
Pradesh Agricultural University (APAU) staff would participate in bimonthly workshops organized
by the agricultural research stations in the command to deal with location-specific problems, and to
maintain a linkage to the concurrent applied research program.



17
Water User Association Promotion Program
2.32   WUA Promotion Strategy. Based on GOAP's PIM Policy (paras. 4.01-4.02 and Annex 3),
ICADD has prepared an Action Plan for the Promotion of Farmers' Organization in Irrigation
Management of Sriramsagar and Srisailam Right Branch Canal Projects (Annex 14). The Action
Plan target is phased establishment of 472 autonomous WUAs covering 256,000 ha in SRSP and 150
WUAs covering 69,000 ha in SRBC. Each WUA will be responsible for: (a) manage the minor canal
command under its control to equitably deliver water supplied under a RWS regime to each
irrigation block outlet; and (b) maintain its canal network. The Action Plan provides a generic model
format of WUA Bye-Laws and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for partial management
transfer. Both documents have been reviewed and found satisfactory to the Bank. Copies of these
model documents are exhibited in Annex 3. Each WUA will be governed by an elected executive
committee of nine members and include a President, Treasurer and Secretary.
2.33   GOAP's decision to attempt joint management and partial transfer of irrigation networks to
farmers is based on a phased process-oriented strategy of coordination of the many administrative,
organizational, financial and institutional supporting actions to achieve turnover initially at the minor
canal level. The process-oriented approach focuses initially on the effectiveness of the different
decision-making processes in achieving satisfactory performance. Accordingly, the generic WUA
framework currently being piloted in SRSP (para. 2.35) with 32 WUAs would be modified as
necessary on the basis of experience and success. Management transfer would concentrate on
establishing WUAs with jurisdiction over 400-750 ha by associating defunct voluntary Outlet
Committees into a WUA on the basis of maximum social homogeneity within a single "Revenue
Village" if possible.
2.34   A second phase of participative management would involve consolidation of WUAs into a
larger organization at higher levels for managing a portion of the larger irrigation system. The
WUAs would be expected to federate into apex committees on a distributary level (Distributary
Committees) so as to provide a coordinating function for member WUAs and ICADD staff. At
Command Area Development Authority (CADA) level in SRSP (and later in SRBC), a reconstituted
CADA Board would be responsible for overall scheme management (paras. 4.04-4.06) along with an
executive committee of composed of representatives of Distributary Committees.  When the
minor/distributary is handed over to a WUA, ICADD involvement would consist of technical advice.
Other government support such as training, extension and management support would be provided as
needed to further strengthen WUA participation in decision-making processes and foster a sense of
partnership. It is envisaged that successful WUAs may amalgamate to enter into marketing,
transport and agro-processing ventures.
2.35   Implementation Approach. Mass education and motivation campaigns would be organized
in the project area. For SRSP, a consultative process in relation to system rehabilitation diagnostics
would be carried out with respect to designs, outlet locations, the direct outlet problem etc. Training
modules to facilitate implementation are being developed under the ongoing pilot program. The
MOU defining WUA rights and responsibilities and the WUA bye-laws would be finalized in a
democratic manner during WUA establishment, and support arrangements would be adapted to local
conditions. The generic framework of latter aspects are being developed in an ongoing 2-year pilot
program for 17,021 ha in SRSP with the assistance of two experienced NGOs. The NGOs are
working in collaboration with WALAMTARI to develop location-specific training materials and
modules.



18
2.36   The programs for WUA establishment in SRSP and SRBC (Annex 3) would vary in detail
because of basic differences in scheme type (rehabilitation only in SRSP and introduction of
irrigation in SRBC), local established practices and perceptions. The common framework includes:
*  Social Preparation and Socio-Anthropological Studies. Motivation camps and meetings in each
village to promote WJUAs with audio-visual aids, training materials and direct discussion over a
period of 6-9 months. In this period, irrigators would be identified, WUA boundaries would be
finally determined and potential members who can serve as office bearers and training needs
would be identified. GOAP is of the view that local indigenous farmer organizations (such as
those for tank irrigation), and their linkages and community roles, need to be understood and
integrated or associated with the WUA framework. Two such studies by consultants will be
undertaken in SRSP and one in SRBC.
*  WUA Formation. In this process, WUA representatives would be selected through the existing
village structures and other functional organizations. The working modalities, responsibilities,
functions, duties would be formalized as bye-laws for the WUA. The WUA's relations with
ICADD would be determined by a MOU. Training would begin in this period which is expected
to take 3-4 months.
*  WUA Legal Registration. WUAs would be required to register as legal entities under AP's
Societies or Cooperatives Acts, or under appropriate provisions of the 1984 IU & CAD Act
(para. 1.14). Although the choice of registration modality will be left to WUA members,
guidance will be provided based the experience gained under the ongoing SRSP pilot program.
Prior to registration, 51% of farmers in terms of numbers or landholdings must be enrolled as
members of the WUA.
*  Financial Arrangements. WUA financial sustainability is proposed to be achieved primarily
through the efforts and initiative of its members, but the modalities to be finally used will depend
on the findings of the ongoing pilot program and the evolution of GOAP's initiative to require
WUA formation on all public irrigation schemes. WUA revenue options being considered
include: (i) individual membership fee payment on a per ha basis for upkeep of the irrigation
network and administrative costs ; (ii) a commission to collect water rates and benefit from a
rebate of 40% thereof (para. 4.10), or government support by earmarked sharing of the per ha
O&M budget for the scheme; and (iii) initial managerial support grant of Rs.275/ha over three
years available from a GOI PIM program. GOAP policy at present is to minimize dependence
on direct government subventions and rely on incentives for WUA formation to foster self-
reliance based on beneficiary empowerment.
*  Consultative Process. In SRSP, the system rehabilitation and watercourse improvement designs
prepared by ICADD would be reviewed with the affected WIUA members prior to their
procurement. Seasonal canal closure periods to facilitate rapid completion of works would be
explained. This would also involve the issue of controlling irrigators served by direct outlets
from a large canal: it is proposed that these irrigators would be placed under WUA jurisdiction
under the provisions of the MOU. In SRBC, the system and watercourse designs would be
explained to prospective irrigators and their inputs sought through existing organizations. An
2   E.g. a one time initial membership payment of Rs.250/ha to be held in a fixed deposit interest bearing
account yielding Rs.30/year/ha to be used for maintenance;



19
assurance was obtained at negotiations that, prior to the award of any SRSP contract for
rehabilitation of the irrigation network, the beneficiary farmers would be consulted on the
modifications to the tertiary network designs with respect to relocation of irrigation outlets to
farm watercourses or farm block watercourses, and shall take into account the views of
beneficiaries.
* WUA Establishment. ICADD and NGO Social organizers would provide technical assistance to
WlUAs for 2 years (including the preparatory period) after which they are expected to be self-
sufficient enough to discharge their obligations as per the MOU. During this period, the SRSP
WUAs would be expected to undertake emergency repairs and works with the funding provided
for this purpose (para. 2.19). The WUA establishment program will be implemented by
WALAMTARI, NGOs and trained SRSP CADA staff. An NGO Adviser will be retained
according to terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank at the state level to provide support on
WVUA establishment and operation.
Farmer Training Program
2.37   Training Infrastructure. At present, WALAMTARI has a campus in Hyderabad, four
farmer training centers (FTCs) in SRSP and one in the SRBC area. Since the available training
facilities and infrastructure are inadequate, in addition improving the training facilities and
infrastructure at existing FTCs, the project would support establishment of two new FTCs in SRBC
and one additional FTC in SRSP. GOAP has prepared a Training Implementation Plan in which all
equipment lists, course details and proposed expenditures are specified.
2.38   Extension Training.  An extension staff training plan has been prepared for VEOs,
Agricultural Development Assistants (ADAs) and Agricultural Officers (AOs) in SRSP and SRBC.
The training would be conducted by staff of the WALAMTARI with inputs from APAU. Staff from
Officer level and above would be sent to the WALMTARI campus for training in water use
management, while tailor-made courses for VEOs and ADAs would be organized on site as off-
campus courses at regional agricultural research stations. This program envisages 24 basic and
refresher courses for 364 VEOs, ADAs and AOs over a five year period.
2.39   WUA Training. Training is a key element of the WUA Promotion Program. The five year
program of training courses by WALAMTARI and NGOs would cover all WUA office bearers,
selected contact farmers, agricultural officers and ICADD staff involved in the WUA promotion
process. Sixteen 3 day workshops on PIM and WUAs would be offered at the WALAMTARI
campus for a total of 480 senior engineers and agricultural officers. The sub-project FTCs would
provide: (a) 600 WJUA courses for a total of 18,000 SRSP WUA members and 360 courses for
10,800 SRBC WUA members; and (b) 32 farmers' participation and public relations courses for 960
ICADD and agriculture staff at or below Deputy EE and AO rank posted to SRBC and SRSP.
D. Detailed Features of Social and Environmental Programs
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) Program
2.40   Land Acquisition. The total amount of land required for all project works, including roads,
amounts to 7,981 ha, including 4,877 ha of land already taken over for the project since 1985 and
3,104 ha to be acquired for the proposed project. Of the total amount of land required, 6,479 ha is
privately owned land, of which 4,030 ha have already been acquired and 2,449 ha are at different



20
stages of acquisition. Compensation for land was paid in line with the Land Acquisition Act (LAA)
of 1894, amended in 1984. This compensation proved inadequate and many landowners sought and
received redress of grievances in the courts. GOAP issued Negotiations Committee Rules in 1992,
stipulating the constitution of Negotiation Committees and procedures for negotiated compensation
with landowners affected by land alienation for public projects. Persons whose land acquired after
1992 received consent awards. Thus, for land still to be acquired, GOAP will seek utilize the
Negotiation Committee procedure to pay land compensation at the prevailing land market value in
addition to entitlements under para. 2.44. For trees, structures and other assets to be acquired,
replacement value will be paid. If the negotiations fail to result in consent awards, the affected
person could resort to the legal proceedings under the LAA.
2.41   Eligible Project Affected Persons (PAPs). New irrigation commands potentially improve
the livelihood of all command area population: thus loss of a small area of dry land to canal
construction would be offset by increased income from the remaining holding. Thus PAPs are
defined by the project R&R Policy as including all persons who have lost--or stand to lose--a
"minimum economic loss" of his/her land, including land utilized under customary usufruct rights,
and is either left with less than a "minimum economic holding", or whose income has fallen below
the state's poverty line due to land acquisition. The "minimum economic loss" of holding is
considered to be loss of 25% of the holding size on the date of Notification under the LAA, while a
"minimum economic holding" (MEH) is defined as I ha of irrigated land or 2 ha of dry land. The
PAP definition also includes landless persons, dependent on manual labor and living below the
state's poverty line, whose livelihoods have been adversely affected due to alienation from land or
property upon which such livelihood previously depended. Persons suffering less than a minimum
economic loss would receive normal compensation under the LAA (para. 2.40).
2.42   PAP Categories (Including Scheduled Tribes). The following population categories are
eligible for R&R benefits under the project: (a) land holders and their families losing at least a
minimum loss of their land holdings, or otherwise relegated to the official BPL livelihood category
by past or future land acquisition; (b) landless persons (such as tenants, sharecroppers and
encroachers) and their families losing at least a minimum loss of their cultivated land; and (c) the
major children of PAPs of either sex who are more than 18 years of age, irrespective of his/her
marital status, at the time of the socioeconomic survey. Two specific categories of PAPs entitled to
additional benefits are: (a) those who lose any of their homestead land or are otherwise displaced
from their village as a result of land acquisition; and (b) PAPs belonging to Scheduled Tribes who
are entitled to replacement of land [para. 2.44(a)] in addition to all rehabilitation benefits. In the
SRBC area, Scheduled Tribes constitute about 2.2% of the total population and 1.2% of the PAPs; in
SRSP, Scheduled Tribes comprise about 15.5% of the project area population and about 10% of PAP
households. In both cases, Scheduled Tribes are engaged in farming and are project beneficiaries,
and accordingly no separate Tribal Development Plan has been prepared.
2.43   Number of PAPs. Independent consultants conducted detailed socioeconomic surveys in
the project affected areas on the basis of the approved R&R Policy. The surveys were satisfactory to
the Bank and completed: (a) verification of the extent of land and other assets acquired under AP II
and to be acquired by the project; and (b) identification of individual PAPs in each category and their
socio-economic profile. Thus the total number PAPs is about 6,500 scattered in 308 villages and
includes 3,031 major children at the time of the socio-economic survey in 1994. The sub-categories
include: 121 PAPs who have lost their houses/homesteads; about 675 PAPs rendered landless; about
311 PAPs that became functionally landless (i.e. losing so much land that they ceased farming); 7



21
tenant PAPs; and 61 PAPs belonging to Scheduled Tribes of which 49 will get replacement land. and
all are farmers who would be irrigation beneficiaries.
2.44   R&R Entitlements and Benefits (Annex 5). The R&R Policy aims at improving, or at least
restoring, the living standards of PAPs by providing--along with irrigation benefits--an assistance
framework for replacement of lost assets and economic rehabilitation activities. Thus, in addition to
mandatory compensation under the LAA, the following entitlements are provided under the R&R
program to PAPs:
(a) Land-for-Land Option. Replacement land of comparable quality will be provided to PAPs
through allotment of government land or ceiling surplus land to the extent of their loss up to a
limit of 2 ha of dry land or I ha of irrigated land, preferably in the same revenue village.
Preference will be given to persons belonging to the weaker sections. In the case of PAPs
belonging to Scheduled Tribes: those rendered landless will be given 2 ha of new land while
those losing part of their holding would be given replacement land
(b) Economic Support Package. In case of unavailability of nearby government land, a package of
economic support programs will be implemented to purchase productive assets for income
generation. The package will consist of the following ex-gratia grants:
(i) Productive Asset Grants. The following grants are available for PAP categories:
- Rs.8,000 to each PAP that has obtained judicial awards under LAA grievance procedures
in the past, or whose land has been acquired under the consent award system after 1992;
- Rs.8,000 for all major children of each PAP (irrespective of PAP category);
- Rs.13,000 for each PAP that has not obtained judicial or consent award for their land;
and
- Rs. 16,000 for each PAP rendered landless or functionally landless by the project.
(ii) Womens' Thrift Group Grants. Women groups of PAP spouses will be organized for
income generation activities. Financial assistance will be provided to each group of 15
women at Rs.15,000 (i.e. Rs.1,000 per spouse).
(iii) Vocational Training. Each PAP will be provided Rs.3,000 for vocational training linked
with relevant economic activities for himself/herself or family members.
(iv) Maintenance Allowance. Each PAP will be given a maintenance allowance at Rs.500 per
month for nine months irrespective of whether his/her land was acquired in the past or would
be acquired in future. He/she will also be given a smokeless stove (chulla) at project
expense.
(v) Cattle Maintenance Allowance. Each PAP will be given a cattle maintenance allowance at
Rs.200 per month for 6 months irrespective of whether his land has been or will be acquired.
Each PAP may pool his productive assets grant together with that of one or all of his major
children to purchase land or income generating assets such as livestock, machinery or equipment.
The grants will be held in joint bank accounts and released only for an approved income
generating scheme. Maintenance and cattle allowances may also be deposited in the joint
account for income generating schemes if a PAP so desires.



22
(c) Homestead Land and House Construction Allowance. Each PAP family losing its house or
homestead will be provided 200 m2 of developed land for homestead land and Rs.14,000 for
house construction with provision of free transport facility to the new site.
(d) Access To Government Programs. The R&R Policy states that PAPs may also be provided
access to ongoing GOAP welfare programs such as: (i) subsidized rice schemes; (ii) Scheduled
Caste and Scheduled Tribe development programs; (iii) employment guarantee and assurance
programs; (iv) provision of protected drinking water; (v) adult literacy programs; (vi) Integrated
Rural Development Program (IRDP) and Development of Women and Child in Rural Areas
(DWCRA).
2.45   Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans. Based on the above R&R Policy framework,
GOAP prepared separate economic rehabilitation action plans (ERAPs) for each sub-project's PAPs
affected by the construction of main canals, distributary canals and farm roads constructed prior to
and under AP II, as well as the small number of families that will be adversely affected by
construction of the SRBC command area. The ERAPs contain detailed planning of rehabilitation
activities, including household-oriented economic activities, training programs, organizational
arrangements, community mobilization through NGO facilitation and monitoring mechanisms. In
preparing the ERAPs, the consultants have planned R&R activities by villages and consulted each
PAP about his/her preferences for income-generating schemes. The ERAPs were found to be
satisfactory to the Bank.
2.46   Village Rehabilitation Action Plans. To orient R&R implementation towards each village
containing a significant number of PAPs, 95 Village Rehabilitation Action Plans (VAPs) are to be
prepared during project implementation on the basis of a sample VAP included in the ERAPs. This
will provide an opportunity for further consultation with the PAPs in refining the PAP-specific
income generation activities and promote PAPs' participation in planning and implementing of their
R&R programs. VAPs will further confirm the identified economic activities and detail all PAP-
specific rehabilitation measures on the basis of the following factors: (a) village resources potentials
and PAP skills; (b) linkages with government programs; (c) support needs for carrying out income
generation activities, including new skills, financial services and market analysis; and (d) training
needs for PAPs with different income generation schemes.
2.47   R&R Training.  Each ERAP contains a training program to ensure successful R&R
implementation in facilitating all income generating schemes and women group economic activities.
R&R staff training and PAP vocational training would be provided as follows:
*  Training for Engineers. Training for 20 engineers will cover R&R policy and the R&R program
to raise their awareness to R&R issues and help resolve difficulties and conflicts in R&R.
*  Orientation Training For Rehabilitation Officers & NGOs. The training of Rehabilitation
Officers and NGOs is aimed at upgrading their skills, familiarizing them with R&R planning and
R&R implementation planning. The training would be implementation and problem-oriented
and will be conducted in working sessions in highly participatory manner. R&R officers at the
state level and consultants previously involved in the R&R planning would deliver the training
on the R&R Policy's entitlements and rehabilitation activities, while NGOs would provide the
training in community mobilization.  Training topics would include the following: (a)
community mobilization techniques; (b) income generation schemes in various sectors; (c)



23
identification and verification of all developmental schemes; (d) organization of womens' thrift
groups; (e) operation of joint accounts and disbursement; (f) identification of training programs
for youths; (g) risk analysis of various economic schemes and possible measure to prevent and
correct them; and (h) R&R monitoring arrangements
Training For PAPs. The success of income generation programs is crucial to the R&R target of
improving and restoring the living standards of the population adversely affected by the project.
As most of the identified schemes are new to the PAPs, they require new knowledge, techniques
and skills to carry out the schemes. The ERAPs provide for training of about 3,440 PAPs in
nearby training centers. Detailed vocational training programs, trades and schedules would be
provided in the Village Action Plans. PAP training would cover the following topics: (a)
technical skills required for different trades; (b) maintenance of productive asset; and (c)
womens' group economic activities. A total of 5,063 women would receive training to facilitate
success of their womens' thrift group income-generating schemes.
2.48   AP II Reservoir R&R Remedial Action Plans. A Remedial Action Plans (RAP) was
prepared for retrospective completion of residual works and rehabilitation begun under the AP II
project for the displaced families in the resettlement villages of the Srisailam and Lower Mannair
Reservoirs. The RAP is based on a detailed survey in the 104 resettlement villages to evaluate the
status of the infrastructure (roads, electrification drinking water needs, primary education facilities,
medical and veterinary service facilities and other community buildings) provided under AP II and
determined residual requirements. The Remedial Action Plan includes three components as follows:
e  Infrastructure Provision. The survey identified remedial works according to planning norms and
proposed the following groupings of investments: (a) balance works which are incomplete and
required to be completed as per the R&R Action Plan of AP II; (b) improvements needed for
improved utilization of the facilities already provided in the resettlement villages; and (c)
additional facilities which are required as per the perceptions of the village population.
*  Free House Plots. Free house plots are to be provided to the homeless people in the 104
resettlement villages. The survey has identified 2,231 people without houses, 379 in the 81
Srisailam Reservoir resettlement villages and 1,852 in the 23 LMD oustee villages. GOAP will
provide each homeless family with 200 m2 of developed homestead land free of cost.
* Income Generation Schemes. Due to the absence of detailed surveys for the AP II R&R
component, the survey could not identify the 778 PAPs in the 23 LMD villages who had not
received their income generation scheme benefits under AP II. Therefore the RAP's income
generation programs would target the poorest 778 families in the 23 resettlement villages of
Lower Mannair Reservoir.
An assurance was obtained from GOAP at negotiations that the R&R program would be
implemented according to the provisions of paras. 2.40-2.48 above and the R&R Targets and Actions
matrix in Annex 5.
Environmental Management Plan (Annex 2)
2.49   Potential Environmental Impacts.  The project has been designated as falling into
Environmental Category 'B'. Five principal types of environmental impact are potentially of
concern in the development of SRBC and rehabilitation of SRSP. These impacts are: (a) the



24
potential for soil waterlogging and secondary salinization due to rise of the groundwater table as a
result of canal irrigation; (b) loss of reservoir storage through sedimentation caused by watershed
degradation; (c) increase in malaria and waterborne diseases; (d) loss of forest land due to reservoir
and canal construction; and (d) adverse impact on flora and fauna as a result of construction of
irrigation canals. Separate EIA studies analyzing the above potential impacts for SRBC and SRSP
were compiled by consultants and submitted to the Bank in May 1994 as part of the initial project
feasibility study. These studies were based on existing and new surveys of soils, land use, flora and
fauna, and on specialized groundwater monitoring investigations and analysis undertaken by
GOAP's Groundwater Department (GWD).
2.50   Environmental Clearances. In order to receive national environmental clearance for the
project, GOAP prepared a Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan
(EMP) for both SRBC and SRSP according to national guidelines in March 1995. However, prior to
according its clearance in March 1996, MOEF required that the EMP include several natural
resource and nature conservation programs which would benefit the sub-project districts. The need
for these interventions are not attributable, for the most part, to any adverse impact caused by
irrigation works per se, but ensuring that development would not impinge on, or affect, natural
resource and wildlife assets in the project area's districts, and raising its population's environmental
awareness.
2.51   Impact Assessment. No irreversible, diverse or complex adverse impacts were found by the
MOEF review committee in either of the sub-project command areas which would change the
project's 'B' environmental category rating accorded by the Bank. Given GOAP's obligation to
carry out the regional EMPs, they have been included as a monitorable investment under the project.
Bank missions confirmed GWD's assessment that waterlogging and secondary salinization would
not be caused by a rise of groundwater tables into the crop root zone except, possibly, in isolated
pockets. The EMP has provision was made for promotion of groundwater development and
conjunctive use to mitigate such impacts if they arise (Annex 2, paras. 16-25).
2.52   EMP Components. The EMP for the SRBC and SRSP sub-project areas includes: (a)
compensatory afforestation of 1,910 ha of in degraded areas; (b) eco-restoration programs consisting of
habitat protection and infrastructure improvements in the Pakhal and Rollapadu bird and wildlife
sanctuaries, afforestation of 2,100 ha of degraded areas in Forest Reserves, establishment of three
environmental education centers and an LMD Bird Sanctuary, and anti-poaching units; (c) catchment
area treatment programs consisting of 55,102 ha of afforestation and soil conservation measures to
reduce sedimentation of the Srisailam, Sriramasagar and LMD reservoirs; (d) improved prophylactic
programs for prevention of waterbome diseases such as immunization of 13,600 children in SRBC,
chlorination, anti-mosquito spraying and establishment of mobile health units and dispensaries; (e)
agroforestry extension support consisting of distribution of 100,000 teak stumps and 20,000 fruit tree
seedlings and establishment of two mobile extension units; (f) 275 km of canal plantation and
construction site restoration measures; (g) establishment of a fish farm at LMD; (h) two environmental
monitoring and evaluation units; (i) support for anti-poaching vigilance arrangements; (j) continuation
of groundwater monitoring programs in SRBC and SRSP command areas; and (k) farmer conservation
training. Further detailed descriptions of these components is given in Annex 2.

III. COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS
Cost Estimates
3.01   Project Cost Summary. The total project costs over a five and one half year period are
estimated at US$477.43 million including physical and price contingencies (US$43.36 million). This
amount includes foreign exchange costs of about US$50.11 million (10.5% of the total cost) and about
US$52.98 million for taxes and duties (11% of the total cost). Table 3.1 gives a summary of project
costs by component. Detailed summary cost tables including a breakdown by expenditure categories
are given in Annex 6. Detailed project cost tables are available in the Project File (Annex 14).

3.02   Cost Estimate Assumptions. The estimated base costs are given in 1996 prices. The cost of
ongoing civil works eligible for retroactive financing are based on the actual tender costs, while the
costs new civil works have been based on the GOAP "Schedule of Rates" adjusted upward by 30% to
cater for market conditions. The unit costs of equipment and vehicles are based on prices quoted by
suppliers. Physical contingencies of 10% are included for the ungrounded civil works. Price
contingencies for foreign exchange costs are based on annual international inflation estimates of 2.5%
in 1996, 1.7% in 1997, 2.2% in 1998, 2.6% in 1999, 2.8% in 2000 and 2.6% in 2001. Likewise for
local costs, the annual local inflation rates used are: 6.0% in 1996; 7.0% in 1997; 6.7% in 1998; 6.5% in
1999 and 6.0% in 2000 and thereafter. No price contingency was allowed for retroactive funding (para.
3.16) of project expenditures in FY 95/96 and FY96/97.
Financing
3.03   Financing Plan. Bank support would consist of an IDA Credit of SDR108.10 million
(US$150 million equivalent) and an US Dollar Loan of US$175 million at the IBRD variable interest
rate, and include up to SDR30.50 million (US$42.25 million equivalent) for retroactive financing (para.
2.17). Thus the Bank would finance about 68 percent of total project costs (77 percent net of duties and
taxes), or the equivalent of 100 percent of the foreign exchange component and 73 percent of the local
costs net of taxes and duties. The remaining 32 percent of expenditures (US$152.43 million) or 23
percent of expenditures net of taxes and duties (US$99.45 million) would be funded by GOAP. The
financing plan is summarized in Table 3.2 below: Detailed tables with a breakdown of components by
expenditure categories and by financiers are given in Annex 7.

3.04   Financing Conditions. The project would be completed in about five and half years by July
31, 2002 and would be closed on January 31, 2003. The loan/credit would be made available to GOI on
standard IDA/IBRD terms and conditions, and on-lent to GOAP by GOI under GOI's standard terms
and conditions for developmental assistance to the states with GOI assuming the foreign exchange and
interest rate risks. Under current GOI policies, on-lending to GOAP takes the form of a 30% grant and
70% loan at the interest rate of 13% per annum. The first half of the loan is recovered by GOI over 10
years without a grace period, whilst the second half is recovered by GOI over a period of 20 years,
including a grace period of 5 years.
Procurement
3.05   Non-Bank Finance (US$53.03 million). This includes expenditures for land acquisition
(US$13.90 million), engineering survey and administration (US$34.33 million) and operating costs
for the agricultural support services and the EMP (US$4.80 million), which would be fully financed
by GOAP. This expenditure category would be incurred for the existing staff of the ICADD,
WALAMTARI, and other agencies involved in agricultural extension and the EMP.
3.06   Civil Works (US$371.62 million). Bidding for civil works contracts would not attract
foreign bidders due to the relatively small size of the individual contracts for irrigation works, feeder
roads, and buildings. Therefore all civil works would be procured through National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) using standard bid documents, Direct Contracting, Quotations and Force Account as
follows:
* National Competitive Bidding (US$350.09 million). All irrigation civil works and feeder roads
(74 packages of which 77% are over US$100,000 and above), O&M upgrading and about 110
buildings would be procured using standard NCB bid documents and procedures satisfactory to
the Bank/IDA. Post-qualification criteria satisfactory to the Bank/IDA would be used for these
contracts with the exception of the Owk Tunnel and Owk Reservoir in SRBC where
prequalification would be required. Foreign contractors would be fully eligible to participate.
*  Direct Contracting/Ouotations/Force Account (US$21.53 million.). Scattered soil conservation
works in inaccessible locations, O&M works support on a declining scale (para. 3.18) and
command area development (watercourses, land leveling and field drainage), valued individually
at US$20,000 equivalent or less up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$21.53 million, are
not suitable for NCB. These would be procured following procedures acceptable to the
Bank/IDA either through: (a) Direct Contracting with non-governmental organizations and
WUAs; and (b) quotations solicited from at least three qualified contractors (unit rate/piece rate
system). Force Account would only be used in a manner satisfactory to IDA/Bank.



27
3.07   Afforestation (US$ 20.07 million). All the compensatory afforestation, the green belt and
reservoir plantation, degraded forest rehabilitation and canal bank plantation would be carried out
under a unit/piece rate system, or under force account as a last resort, by the Forestry Development
Corporation, and Departments of Forestry and Agriculture.
3.08   Goods and Equipment (US$16.76 million). Standard bidding documents (Supply, Supply-
cum-Erection) would be used for both ICB and NCB. All contracts for goods, equipment and
materials costing US$250,000 or more (totaling about US$7.40 million) would be awarded following
ICB procedures with a domestic preference for national suppliers.  Contracts, not exceeding
individually US$250,000 and in aggregate about US$3.31 million, would be procured following
NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank/IDA.  Isolated or small lot purchases including, in
particular, immediate requirements of equipment individually costing the equivalent of US$25,000
or less up to an aggregate of US$1.02 million would be procured following National Shopping
procedures. Items costing less than US$250,000 equivalent, which are not locally available would be
procured through International Shopping. All goods and equipment for PAP income-generation
schemes (US$4.03 million) are to be procured by local shopping with project assistance so as to be
eligible for reimbursement. Disbursements against such purchases of goods and equipment would be
made subsequent to eligible expenditures on the basis of supporting documents furnished to the
Bank.
3.09   Vehicles (US$0.80 million). Vehicles would consist of 40 cars, jeeps and vans and 42
motorcycles. All contracts for vehicles under the project would be procured under national shopping
procedures as procurement would involve different types of vehicles. Such national shopping would
primarily involve the use of Director General, Supplies and Disposal (DGS&G) rate contracts.
Contracts for hire of vehicles up to an aggregate of US$2.1 million equivalent would be procured
through quotations from three domestic suppliers.
3.10   Training, Technical Assistance and Studies (US$11.25 million). These comprise of: (a)
farmer and project staff training (US$4.15 million); and (b) consultantcy services (US$4.91million)
and studies (US$2.19 million). Except the training carried out by WALAMTARI and other
concerned implementing agencies, all training would be carried out largely by local professional
institutions and NGOs and procured through direct contracting. All technical assistance and studies
would be contracted on terms and conditions in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated January 1997. Consulting firms
would be selected by "Quality- and Cost-based Selection" procedures. Short lists for small
assignments costing less than US$100,000 may consist entirely of national consulting firms. NGOs
to assist with R&R and WUA formation would: (a) have to meet the NGO selection criteria in Annex
13; and (b) NGO services costing less than US$ 100,000 may be procured on a single source selection
basis when (i) an assignment is small, and (ii) the NGO has local experience and/or is exceptionally
qualified. Individual national or foreign consultants may be contracted as per the Guidelines. An
assurance was obtained from GOAP at negotiations that it would select NGOs in accordance with
criteria agreed with the Bank/IDA (Annex 13).
3.11   R&R Program and Recurrent Costs (US$4.90 million). These expenditures comprise of:
(a) incremental staff salaries, allowances and operating expenditures for PPMU (US$2.20 million);
(b) vehicle hire charges (US$2.10 million); and (c) R&R administration (US$0.60 million). No
disbursements would be made for incremental salaries and operating costs of the agricultural and
environmental management plan components valued at US$4.80 million equivalent.



28
3.12    Review  of Contract Award.  Prior Bank/IDA  review will be required for procurement
actions of: (a) all contracts for civil works valued at US$300,000 and above; (b) goods and
equipment and vehicles valued at US$200,000 and above; (c) all consultancy contracts valued at
US$100,000 and above (US$50,000 for individual consultants); and (d) all single source consultancy
contracts over US$100,000 equivalent. All other contracts would be subject to random post review
in the field by visiting missions. This would result in over 75% of the project procurement being
subject to prior review. Both GOAP and ICADD have had recent prior experience with Bank/IDA
procurement procedures.
3.13    Procurement Summary. The procurement arrangements and amounts for each expenditure
category are summarized in Table 3.3.

3.14   Procurement Procedure. To ensure efficient procurement, the following understandings
were recorded at negotiations:
(a) As a minimum, all bid invitations would be advertised in newspaper with national circulation
and shall contain the key post-qualification requirements in summary form. Bid documents
shall be provided promptly upon request, upon payment of the prescribed fee, and shall be
sent by mail upon request.
(b) During pre-bid conferences, bidders would be advised about: (i) Conditions of Contract
related to "Technical Expert" adjudicator for large civil works, default provisions, post-
qualification requirements, etc.; (ii) streamlined processing to elicit competitive bidding; and
(iii) the high likelihood of being declared unresponsive if all qualification data and securities
are not provided in bid documentation.
(c) Bids shall be evaluated within 30 days of bid opening and recommendations for contract
award should be forwarded to the Bank/IDA for review where necessary (prior review)
within 60 days thereof, and all contracts would be conveyed to the successful bidder within
the bid validity period of 90 days. Any justifications for extension of bid validity shall be
cleared with the Bank/IDA to preclude forfeit of financing for bids not awarded within a
reasonable time.
3.15   Procurement Management. The procurement process would be coordinated by the Project
Preparation and Monitoring Unit (para. 4.14). Bids would be evaluated by the concerned Chief
Engineer of SRBC or SRSP and a Bid Evaluation Report would be forwarded to the State
Commissionerate of Tenders (COT) chaired by the ICADD Chief Engineer for clearance. The
PPMU would ensure that suitably qualified individual(s) are designated to prepare a signed and dated
Bid Evaluation Report following a format and content acceptable to the Bank/IDA. COT procedures
and efficacy would be monitored by the Project Empowered Committee (para. 4.12) and if found
wanting, the Project Empowered Committee would undertake procurement management. ICADD's
semi-annual reports (para. 4.38) would contain summarized procurement data for each contract, the
dates of bid invitation, receipt, evaluation, approval and signing, and the names of contractors
bidding, offer prices, and firm awarded the contract.
Retroactive Financing
3.16   Amount and Eligibility Period. Implementation of civil works contracts in the two sub-
project areas procured under AP II according to Bank/IDA Guidelines has continued since the
project's closure on June 30, 1994 (para. 1.19). These works have been monitored by the Bank
during project preparation and have been subject to an independent construction quality audit in June
1996. The audit team certified that the works were of a high standard, and that the project quality
assurance procedures and controls (para. 2. 28) were sustainably implemented. Thus, to reimburse
GOAP for part of these expenditures, the Bank/IDA has approved retroactive financing of 13% of
the loan/credit amount for up to SDR30.5 million (US$42.25 million equivalent) for eligible
expenditures incurred by GOAP after February 28, 1995.
3.17   Escrow Account. It was agreed during appraisal that GOAP would deposit 50 percent of the
payment on account of retroactive financing of civil works in an escrow account to be used
exclusively for financing of GOAP's contribution to project financing. Not only would this
dedicated account serve to reduce the fiscal burden on GOAP during its proposed fiscal adjustment
program, but it would ensure that temporary delays in payments to suppliers and contractors would



30
not arise due to delays which could occur in GOI fund transfer to GOAP or to delay in GOAP
transfer of funds to ICADD. At Negotiations, assurances were obtained that GOAP would: (i)
establish a project escrow account for 50 percent of the payments received on account of retroactive
financing of eligible expenditures incurred prior to the date of the Development Credit and Loan
Agreements; and (ii) ensure that such such amounts are used as counterpart funds for financing
project activities prior to the Closing Date of the project.
Disbursement
3.18   The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 108.10 million (US$150.0 million equivalent) and IBRD
Loan of US$175.0 million would finance about 77 percent of the total project costs net of taxes and
duties. The proceeds of the Loan/Credit (Annex 7) would be disbursed against:
(a) 76% of expenditures on civil works;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures or 100% of local ex-factory cost or 80% of other local costs of
goods, equipment, furniture and vehicles;
(c) 95% of expenditures on national consultancy services, studies, training, and 100% of foreign
consultant services;
(d) 95 % of expenditures on afforestation and canal plantation; and
(e) on a declining basis for recurrent expenditures on canal O&M during construction, vehicle
hire charges, PPMU and R&R administration and incremental staff--90% during FY96 and
FY97; 80% during FY98 and FY99; 55% during FY2000 and FY2001; and 25% thereafter.
3.19   Disbursements against civil works and forestry plantation contracts exceeding US$300,000
equivalent, vehicle and equipment contracts exceeding US$200,000 equivalent, and consultancy and
training contracts exceeding US$ 100,000, would be fully documented (for individual consultants, the
limit would be US$50,000 equivalent). For all other expenditures, disbursement could be against
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documents for SOEs would not be submitted to the
Bank/IDA, but would be retained by GOAP and made available to Bank staff during supervision.
Disbursements would exclude expenditures on land acquisition, survey and investigation and
engineering and administration for the irrigation sub-projects, R&R and operation costs of the
environmental management plans, which would be funded by GOAP. The estimated Schedule of
Disbursements is presented in Annex 7.
3.20   Special Account. To facilitate project implementation and to reduce the risk of shortage of
GOAP's counterpart funding as well as to reduce the volume of withdrawal of application, a Special
Account in US dollars would be established in the Reserve Bank of India with an authorized
allocation of up to US$15 million equivalent, equal to the anticipated average four monthly
disbursement. This deposit is based on estimates of the project's financing needs and projected
Bank/IDA disbursements (Annex 7). The special account that would be maintained by the
Department of Economic Affairs would show all withdrawal requests disbursed, amounts advanced
and reimbursed by the Bank/IDA, and the balance at the end of each accounting period. Auditor's
reports would reflect the certification of the balance held by the Reserve Bank of India.



31
3.21   Disbursement Procedure. In line with the agreements of the Fourth Country Portfolio
Performance Review, GOI would ensure that, at the beginning of each fiscal year, an amount equal to
25% of project's expenditure budget--as determined by the project Annual Action Plan and Budget
(para. 4.38)--would be made available to GOAP as Advance Central Assistance for transfer to the
project implementing agency. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that GOI and GOAP would
implement a system satisfactory to the Bank/IDA for channeling the funds required for the project to
the project entities. An understanding was reached at Negotiations that GOI would release 25% of
anticipated project expenditures in advance to GOAP in accordance with the amounts established in the
project's Annual Action Plans and that, upon receipt of funds from GOI, GOAP would transfer such
funds, together with its quarterly counterpart contributions, immediately to the project accounts of
ICADD. In addition, an understanding was recorded at Negotiations that on April I of each year,
commencing on April 1, 1998 and thereafter by April I of each year, GOAP would inform the
Bank/IDA of the annual budgetary allocations made for meeting the financial needs of project
implementation during the forthcoming fiscal year.
Accounts and Audit
3.22   Project Budget Unit. A Program Budget and Accounts (PB&A) sub-unit in the PPMU
would establish, maintain, and administer the financial management systems including program,
budget and cost allocation/accounting systems. This unit will be supported with adequate and
qualified staff on a full time basis. The system would be used to develop annual budgets by
consolidating budget requests from all ICADD organizational units and to ensure that the final
budget request is consistent with the policies and instructions from GOAP. Each management or
operational unit would be responsible for providing PB&A with required information and estimates.
PB&A would use this data to produce management reports that would track program progress. An
assurance was obtained at negotiations that a fully staffed Program Budget and Accounts sub-unit
headed by a qualified accountant would be established in the Project Preparation and Monitoring
Unit by October 1, 1997.
3.23   Project Accounts. A separate project account maintained by the PPMU in ICADD which,
with supporting documentation, would identify all project transactions on an ongoing basis including
contributions from GOAP, GOI and the loan/credit and provide a comprehensive record of project
financing and expenditures. The majority of project expenditure will be incurred at the main
component SRBC and SRSP sub-project sites. Payments will be made by Pay and Account Officers
who will compile and submit monthly accounts to Directors of Accounts stationed at SRBC and
SRSP. The monthly accounts will be consolidated by the PPMU in accordance with the accounting
standards of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, which are acceptable to the Bank. The
consolidated audited project accounts, including the special account and SOEs, and the auditor's
reports, which would include a separate statement on the SOEs and their certified copies, would be
submitted to the Bank/IDA annually no later than six months after the close of the fiscal year. The
audit report on SOEs would specifically comment on their usage and the controls established to
ensure their accuracy. Previous Bank-supported irrigation projects implemented by the ICADD
maintained satisfactory accounting systems and records and also complied with their audit
covenants.
3.24   The project accounts would show: (a) details of expenditures by investment items together
with their funding sources; and (b) expenditures at (a) classified by project components. The general
format of such accounts are exhibited in Annex 7. Project accounts would summarize expenditures
showing: (i) actual versus planned expenditures for each quarter and accumulated to date; and (ii)



32
financing source for the quarter, and accumulated.  The summaries, which would provide
information for the SOEs would form part of the project account, including those expenditures for
which reimbursement is claimed with full documentation. The project accounts would be supported
by a listing with the withdrawal applications submitted for the period. Assurances were obtained
from GOI and GOAP at negotiations that: (i) project accounts, including the Special Account and
Escrow Account, would be maintained and audited annually in accordance with sound auditing
standards consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank/IDA;
and (ii) certified copies of the annual financial statements and SOEs together with the auditors
report, which would comment separately on the SOEs, would be submitted to the Bank/IDA not later
than six months after the close of each GOAP fiscal year (April I to March 31).
IV. ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organizational Reforms
Participatory Irrigation Management
4.01   State PIM Policy. A GOAP Government Order (G.O.) issued on July 19, 1995 adopted a
policy to promote participatory irrigation management (PIM) whereby the management of irrigation
networks below the minor canal level would be handed over to WUAs. A subsequent G.O. for a
statewide framework for WUA formation and implementation based on the SRSP pilot experience
was issued in February 1997. Expansion of the pilot program to cover the whole of the SRSP and
SRBC areas under the project is intended to serve as a prototype for the other public irrigation
schemes in the state. The objectives of the PIM Policy are to improve agricultural productivity by:
(a) improving water deliveries through more effective O&M and thus improve distribution equity
and reliability; (b) ensuring physical sustainability through a division of labor whereby ICADD
would focus its resources on maintenance of the headworks, main canals and reliable agreed water
supplies to WUAs; and (c) promoting partnership, communication and cooperation between ICADD
and farmers.
4.02   The salient features of GOAP's PIM policy are: (a) farmers in the command area of major,
medium and minor irrigation projects will be encouraged to form WUAs to operate and manage
irrigation systems in their respective areas; (b) a WUA would manage a hydraulically contiguous
unit composed of a minor canal (or part of a distributary) serving 400-750 ha within the area of one
"Revenue Village" under a Memorandum of Understanding between its members and ICADD; (c)
the WUAs would be legally registered and democratically autonomous bodies subject to professional
audit and function according to principles determined by bye-laws to be framed under the IU & CAD
Act; (d) the WUA will have the powers to regulate distribution of water within its jurisdiction on a
volumetric or any other basis and levy and collect penalties fixed by it for violation of water its
internal distribution arrangements; (e) WUAs may sell water saved through improved irrigation
available to their members; (f) the IU & CAD Act would be amended to recognize WUAs, provide
incentives for their promotion including powers to initiate action against irrigators interfering with
water distribution; and (g) ICADD will promote maximization of WUA responsibilities by (i)
providing a reliable water supply at the minor canal head, (ii) undertaking rehabilitation of irrigation
networks wherever WUAs are formed, and (iii) facilitate fixation and collection of water user
charges by WUAs.



33
Reorganization of Command Area Development
4.03   State Command Area Development Council. GOAP issued a G.O. on June 13, 1996
implementing GOI recommendations for state CAD Councils and CADAs. The reconstituted State
CAD Council will be responsible for taking policy decisions on developmental activities in all the
public gravity irrigation commands in the state. The new State CAD Council will contain non-
governmental members representative of the state's command areas. Such members include
Members of Parliament (MPs) , Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), farmer's
representatives from WUAs and NGOs. The Council will meet at least twice a year and its decisions
are to be implemented without further examination by a concerned department.
4.04   Command Area Development Boards.  The reconstituted CADA Boards in AP will
approve programs, review CAD activities, and take implementation decisions subject to the
guidelines issued by the State CAD Council. New functions of the CAD Boards include: (a) acting
as a catalyst for formation of Farmer's Associations, WUAs and Distributary Committees; (b)
technical assistance to farmer organizations and WUAs, monitoring of their activities and advice in
selection and introduction of suitable cropping patterns; (c) assistance in developing groundwater to
supplement surface irrigation; and (d) assistance in development of post-harvest services and
organization of fairs, workshops, etc. to motivate farmers. Up to 60% of a reconstituted CAD Board
will be non-official members such as MPs and MLAs, heads of local government institutions, NGO
representatives, and Distributary Committee representatives from all reaches of a canal network.
Each CAD Board will be chaired by the Minister-in-Charge CAD Program and official members will
include concerned government Departments officials, District Revenue Collectors and the CADA's
Administrator-cum-Chief Engineer. GOAP and GOI program funds for WUA and CAD activities
will be released directly to CAD Boards so that they may function independently.
4.05   GOAP will constitute an Executive Committee for each CAD Board headed by the CADA
Administrator-cum-Chief Engineer. The CADA Executive Committee will be responsible for the
detailed working of each command's programs, take important administrative decisions and decide
matters according to the general directions of the CADA Board. The Executive Committee's
membership will have a 5 year tenure and include: (a) district officials from various involved GOAP
departments; and (b) the presidents of WUAs and/or Farmer's Associations at canal minor and
distributary level at the rate of two from the head, middle and tail reaches of the system. All
Department Heads of the various GOAP departments working in the command will be responsible to
the CADA Administrator in all matters related to the CAD activities and transfers of officers of the
Departments concerned are only to be made with the prior concurrence of the Administrator.
4.06   SRSP CADA Restructuring. The SRSP CADA would be restructured and serve as a pilot
for evaluation of GOAP's CADA reorganization program. The following modifications would be
implemented to improve the performance of the SRSP CADA:
*  The ICADD Chief Engineer (SRSP) would only be responsible only for construction activities
while all O&M activity would be the responsibility of the SRSP CADA Administrator. The
functions of O&M and CAD are to be integrated at the Division level to facilitate an assured
water delivery to WUAs.
* The CADA would be organized into two command area O&M Divisions (one for the above
LMD command and one for the area below LMD) and a separate Division for the Sriramasagar



34
Dam and headworks (Annex 8). The Administrator would be assisted by a Deputy Chief
Engineer and three Superintending Engineers each responsible for a Division. Groundwater and
Agricultural extension staff working in the command would report to him on their CAD-related
activities. Assistant Agriculture Officers would have an agricultural engineering background for
the tasks of implementing the canal Rotational Water Supply regime and technical assistance to
WUAs.
*  Gate operators ("Laskars") at the lowest level in the CADA organization are proposed to be
brought under the administrative control of WUAs in order to assist them in day-to-day water
management.
*  WUAs will be encouraged to take over the management of water distribution and canal
maintenance below minors and for this purpose, the entire SRSP command will be reorganized
into WUAs. Thus, with ultimate turnover of the tertiary network to WUAs, CADA water
management responsibilities would cease at the offtakes to WUA jurisdictions.
* SRSP CADA Administrators would be appointed with a minimum tenure of two years. The first
such appointment was made prior to project negotiations.
4.07   The organograms of the restructured CADA are given in Annex 8. When SRBC nears
completion, a SRBC CADA will be organized along similar lines to that of SRSP and incorporating
the experience gained in SRSP. Assurances were obtained from GOAP at Negotiations that by
October 1, 1997: (i) arrangements for a reconstituted SRSP CADA Board would be in place; and (ii)
proposed SRSP CADA restructuring appointments, including that of Assistant Agricultural Officers
with agricultural engineering training, will have been completed..
4.08   SRSP CADA O&M  Framework. The SRSP CADA restructuring is predicated on a
transfer of works from the construction wing of ICADD to the SRSP CADA organization as laid
down in a July 28, 1995 Government Order [G.O.Ms. 1 171&CAD(PW-SRSP.II(2))]. A detailed
procedure for the transfer has been developed and is given in the SRSP Plan of Operations &
Maintenance (POM) document which includes O&M functions and several other technical and
administrative responsibilities. The POM also sets forth a framework for: (a) the O&M and
management duties of all O&M staff; and (b) the maintenance planning and budget estimation
procedures. The reorganization and transfer process is expected to take about two years (inclusive of
staff training and system operation hand-over). During the project, joint O&M management of the
tertiary networks are expected to result in gradual hand-over of minor canal maintenance to
established WUAs. The experience gained with the restructured CADA O&M framework would be
applied for SRBC also.
Cost Recovery Arrangements
4.09   Irrigation Water Charge Increase (Annex 11, para. 11). During project preparation, the
Bank had expressed increasing concern about public irrigation investment sustainability caused by
the low allocation of funding for O&M works and the low level of irrigation water charges
(para.5.19). As part of a fiscal reform program, GOAP has gazetted an Ordinance on January 3,
1997 raising irrigation water charges to: (a) Rs.200 per acre for monsoon wet crops, and Rs.150 per
acre for dry season wet crops; and (b) a uniform rate of Rs. 100 per acre for dry crops irrespective the
season of their cultivation. This ordinance has subsequently been confirmed by the AP State
Assembly.



35
4.10   Revenue Sharing. In view of the large rate increase and as an incentive to WUAs, GOAP
has proposed that, in the case of major and medium schemes, only 50% of the collected irrigation
revenue from the enhanced water charge would be retained by the government: 40% would be given
to WUAs for O&M works and 10% to Gram Panchayats (local government councils). In the case of
minor irrigation schemes, 100% of the collected revenue would be given to WUAs.
4.11   Water Charges Review Committee. To ensure the efficacy of GOAP's increased irrigation
water charges, revenue sharing and RWS policies in for upland schemes, water charge assessment
procedures and revenue collection performance need to be regularly monitored and reviewed.
GOAP is in the process of establishing a standing state-level Water Charges Review Committee
(WCRC) with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank/IDA. The WCRC would also review data
on actual O&M budget allocation needs for those portions of schemes under ICADD control, water
charge levels and their affordability, and the impact of WUA promotion on revenue-sharing
formulae. The WCRC would consist, inter alia, of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Finance, Irrigation
and Revenue of GOAP and meet annually for consideration of adjustments to O&M budget
allocations, water charge assessment and collection policies and procedures. In preparation for such
meetings, GOAP would engage consultants to collect and compile data on water charge assessment,
revenue-sharing and collection performance, and trends in O&M costs. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that GOAP would: (i) constitute a Water Charges Review Committee (WCRC) with
composition and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank/IDA by October 1, 1997; and (ii) engage
consultants to prepare a report on water charge assessment, collection and revenue sharing for
consideration by the WCRC and for submission to the Bank/IDA for information not later than
December 31, 1998.
B. Project Management
Management Organization
4.12   Project Empowered Committee. For overall project oversight, control and coordination,
GOAP issued a G.O. on June 26, 1996 establishing an Empowered Committee chaired by the GOAP
Chief Secretary with Principal Secretary (Finance), Secretary (Law), Principal Secretary (ICADD),
and ICADD Secretary (Projects) as members. The Empowered Committee's functions are: (a)
ensuring timely release of funds to ICADD for the project; (b) dealing with senior personnel
management appointment matters; (c) monitoring of overall project progress; (d) ensuring
coordination and implementation performance of all government agencies and entities involved in
the project, and in particular, those involved in the EMP component; and (e) resolving procurement
issues and meeting of project procurement arrangements. The Empowered Committee would meet
twice a year following the issue of semi-annual project status reports (para.4.41) and may also be
convened by the Secretary (Projects) to deal with project management contingencies.
4.13   Overall Management. The project will be implemented by ICADD under the Principal
Secretary (ICADD). Direct project management responsibility will be vested in the Secretary
(Projects) who will supervise: (a) the Chief Engineers of SRBC and SRSP responsible for ICADD
line staff units engaged in design and construction supervision under the irrigation and dam safety
components; (b) the Special Officer with Chief Engineer rank in charge of the Project Preparation
and Management Unit (PPMU) responsible for procurement coordination, budgeting, reimbursement
and accounting, reporting, monitoring and evaluation, supervision of R&R implementation and
general coordination and supervision of training programs, research and agricultural extension; (c)



36
the work of the Forest Development Corporation undertaking the afforestation under the EMP
component and coordination of other participating agencies involved in the EMP; and (d) the SRSP
O&M works and WUA establishment undertaken by the SRSP CADA Administrator-cum-Chief
Engineer working under the direction of the ICADD's CAD Commissioner. Feeder road works will
be executed by the Roads & Buildings Department (RBD).
4.14   Project Preparation and Management Unit. The existing PPMU line responsibilities will
be reorganized by: (a) designating one EE as a deputy chief engineer responsible for a cell
monitoring all procurement, civil works and administration; and (b) designating an EE as deputy
chief engineer responsible for a cell monitoring all R&R, environmental and groundwater utilization
activities. An Accounts Officer will be responsible for an accounting and reimbursement cell and
Project Accounts (para. 3.23), while a Deputy Director of agriculture will monitor the Agricultural
Support Services component's research, extension and training activities. An WUA Advisor for the
PIM program (para. 2.36) will be assigned to the PPMU. An organogram of the PPMU is given in
Annex 8.
Works Quality Assurance and Supervision
4.15   Staffing. The management of the irrigation construction wings of SRBC and SRSP will
each be headed by a Chief Engineer (Annex 8). For SRSP, 137 additional supervision engineers will
have to be appointed. Quality assurance in each of these projects is currently undertaken by a sub-
project Quality Control Division (QCD) headed by an independent Supervisory Engineer under each
Chief Engineer. Given the large increase in construction activity, the number of quality control
divisions will be increased in both sub-projects. In SRSP alone, the number of QCD engineers
would be increased from 43 to 120 (Annex 8). The Action Plan for Quality Control Organization
prepared by ICADD defines the duties and responsibilities of all staff levels of the QCDs on-site and
in the field laboratories. It also defines the nature of coordination between the QCD and site
construction supervision staff and their duties with respect to reporting to the QCD. The Action Plan
empowers an EE of a QCD to order stoppage of work if serious construction flaws are identified
although arranging for their remediation remains the responsibility of the construction wing EE. An
assurance was obtained from GOAP at negotiations that, by October 1, 1997, additional staff would
be posted to SRBC and SRSP Construction Circles and Quality Control Divisions as per the staffing
schedule submitted by GOAP to the Bank/IDA on December 20, 1996.
4.16   Supervision Procedures. In addition to the extant AP II Quality Control Manual, Quality
Audit Guidelines and an 'OK Card' system for irrigation works have been successfully introduced
during project preparation as found during the construction quality audit of on-going works (para.
2.28). These procedures will be maintained during the project and serve to reduce spurious financial
claims while recording proper supervision procedure. For road quality assurance, RBD will second
experienced staff to the ICADD QCU divisions in the areas that road works are being constructed.
Dam Safety Assurance
4.17   ICADD's Dam Safety Cell (DSC) operates under the control of the Chief Engineer (Central
Designs Organization). Its functions consist of post-construction monitoring, data compilation and
collection, review of dam safety inspection reports of ICADD dams. GOAP has decided to
strengthen the DSC to cater for all aspects of dam safety in the state and ICADD has prepared a Dam
Safety Assurance and Rehabilitation Identification Report outlining the proposed program to monitor
the safety of the state's 180 large dams and tanks. Reorganization of dam safety activity will be



37
based on appointment of a State Level Dam Safety Committee chaired by the ICADD Engineer-in-
Chief. The Committee would meet at least twice a year to: (a) review the activities and reports of the
DSC; (b) establish priorities for works needing remedial safety works; (c) assign responsibilities for
execution of non-departmental works and determine the need for independent experts. The DSC's
expanded duties will include preparation of a Dam Safety Manual for each major dam beginning
with Sriramasagar, Srisailam and Lower Mannair dams. An independent project Dam Safety Review
Panel (DSRP)--originally constituted under AP II--will continue to review and guide implementation
of the project's dam safety component including construction of major structures in SRBC. The staff
assigned to dam safety works in SRBC will be increased to supervise Srisailam spillway repairs.
Krishna River Basin Reservoir Management
4.18   GOAP issued a Government Order on June 15, 1996 which institutionalizes operating rules
based on fixed delivery priorities according to available storage. A subsequent G.O. was issued on
August 1, 1996 to reconstitute the Inter-Agency Committee for Integrated Operation of the Srisailan
and Nagarjunasagar Reservoirs established in 1989 into a standing "Committee for Integrated
Operation of Krishna and Pennar Basin Schemes" (CIOKRIP) which is to meet seasonally to consider
water releases for multi-purpose uses for all schemes dependent on the Krishna River. Under these
G.O.s: (a) GOAP scheme water allocation priorities are preserved and non-firm hydroelectric power
generation at Srisailam is kept subservient to SRBC irrigation requirements; (b), specific uniform multi-
purpose operating tables are to be derived for Srisailam Reservoir's power and irrigation operation
staff; (c) CIOKRIP would plan meeting seasonal water requirements in the AP portion of the river
basin, review the efficacy of monthly allocations and multi-reservoir storage regulation; and (d)
monitor day to day release requirements during drought periods.
Resettlement and Rehabilitation
4.19   The Economic Rehabilitation Action Plans (ERAPs) for SRBC and SRSP (para. 2.45)
envisage a four tier R&R implementation and monitoring organization. This consists of the a State
R&R Committee, the R&R Cell of the PPMU, District R&R Committees, sub-project Rehabilitation
Units under a Special Collector and Village R&R Committees assisted by NGOs. An organogram
showing the overall management and implementation organization with the members of each
management unit is given in Annex 8.
4.20   State R&R Committee and PPMU R&R Cell. A multi-agency State R&R Committee has
been established under the chairmanship of the Principal Secretary (ICADD) to guide the R&R
activities under the project. Meetings of this committee would be convened by the Secretary
(Projects). The State R&R Committee will review overall R&R progress, make R&R policy
decisions, and coordinate among concerned departments. The PPMU will have a R&R Cell headed
by an EE of Deputy Chief Engineer rank to monitor day-to-day R&R performance and report to the
State R&R Committee. The PPMU R&R Cell would be responsible for R&R implementation in
ICADD and its functions include planning, supervision, monitoring and coordination of all R&R
activities. It would also be responsible for contracting NGOs according to the criteria in Annex 13 to
implement the assist in facilitating community income-generating activities.
4.21   District Level Organization.  The District R&R Committee--chaired by the District
Collector and consisting of NGO representatives and officials from government agencies--is the
R&R coordinating and implementing agency at the district level. Full-time Special Collectors have
been appointed to SRSP and SRBC to implement land acquisition and rehabilitation program of the



38
sub-project ERAPs. The Special Collectors would convene meetings of their respective District
Committee. The Special Collectors' office would be composed of a Land Acquisition Unit and a
Rehabilitation Unit, headed respectively by a Revenue Department Land Acquisition Officer and a
Rehabilitation Officer from the cadre of Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies who would
coordinate implementation with the various line departments.
4.22   Each Rehabilitation Unit would be staffed with the following additional officers: (a)
Assistant Rehabilitation Officer (Women & Child Welfare) responsible for liaison with the District
Rural Development Agency and Child Welfare Department to promote formation of women's thrift
groups, income generating schemes for women, and child and maternity care; (b) Project Economist
responsible for formulating Village Rehabilitation Plans (para. 2.46) and monitoring their
implementation, and for progress reporting to project authorities; (c) Computer Programmer
responsible for creating a data base for land acquisition and R&R works, maintenance of accounts
and computerization of all routine data and functions; and (d) Executive Engineer (Infrastructure) in
charge R&R civil works. An assurance was obtained at negotiations from GOAP that all
government staff positions required for the R&R implementation organization would be filled by
October 1, 1997.
4.23   Village Rehabilitation Committees. R&R Officers and NGOs will assist PAPs living in the
affected villages to form Village Rehabilitation Committees (VRC). The VRC will include women
and members from each recognized community group and caste. Working closely with NGOs and
R&R officers, the VRCs would participate in formulating Village Rehabilitation Action Plans
(VAP), PAP consultation, implementation of the VAPs and monitoring of R&R progress.
4.24   Non-Governmental Organizations.  NGOs experienced in rural development and
community mobilization would be engaged for R&R implementation. NGOs would be engaged by
the PPMU and work under the supervision of the Special Collectors and Rehabilitation Officers to
implement the ERAPs in cooperation with R&R officers in the district Rehabilitation Unit and other
line departments. NGOs would: (a) participate in all R&R committee meetings at different levels;
(b) organize VRCs and consultation of PAPs; (c) prepare VAPs with VRCs and R&R officers; (d)
assist Special Collectors in land acquisition, assessment of land value and payment of compensation;
(e) coordinate PAP-specific income generating schemes with VRCs and organize women's thrift
groups; (f) facilitate vocational training programs; and (g) monitoring income generating activities.
Terms of Reference are given in Annex 5 for NGOs involved in the R&R program.
4.25   Settlement of PAP Grievances. The VRCs and NGOs will be mainly responsible for
collecting complaints and grievances from PAPs regarding land valuation, entitlements, entitlement
delivery and R&R activities etc. These grievances will be brought to R&R officers for attention. The
District R&R Committee (para. 4.23) is the second level of grievance redress mechanism. If any
grievances cannot be redressed, they would be brought to the PPMU R&R Cell and the State R&R
Committee (Annex 5). Grievances, raised and disposed, will be recorded as part of the R&R internal
monitoring system (para. 2.28).
4.26   R&R Monitoring Arrangements.  Both internal and external monitoring would be
conducted concurrently to determine the implementation progress of the R&R component throughout
the project period. The monitoring entities would report to the State R&R Committee and the
PPMU's R&R Cell, who would review and evaluate the R&R progress and determine any necessary
measures to correct any identified problems. The PPMU will be responsible for the monitoring of
R&R implementation through the District Committees, NGOs and VRCs. The NGOs and the



39
Rehabilitation Unit under the Special Collector will monitor R&R progress and present quarterly
R&R progress reports to the District R&R Committees, who will, in turn, furnish the progress reports
to the PPMU. The PPMU R&R Cell would set up a computerized monitoring system and develop
monitoring forms.
4.27   Independent monitoring of R&R progress would be carried out by a qualified NGO engaged
for monitoring and evaluation of all R&R activities according to an agreed terms of reference
(Annex 5). The NGO multi-disciplinary team will be community-based and will have field offices.
The monitoring NGO would submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Special Collectors. At the
end of each year, the monitoring NGO would submit annual monitoring and evaluation reports with
suggestions for modifications and improvements for the coming year. The independent monitoring
report would be submitted to the Bank. An assurance was obtained from GOAP at negotiations that
it would recruit a suitably qualified NGO R&R monitoring consultant satisfactory to the Bank/IDA
by March 1, 1998 and that its annual monitoring reports would be submitted to the Bank/IDA.
Irrigation Agronomy and Farmer Training Program
4.28   Agricultural Research.  The research sub-component would be carried out under the
supervision of an agronomist from the AP Agricultural University (APAU) and officers from various
participating government departments redeployed for its execution. The work would be monitored
by WALAMTARI and the scientists of the three Regional Agricultural Research Stations (RARS) in
the SRSP project area and the RARS Nandyal in SRBC. An inter-disciplinary Coordination
Committee would be established for both SRSP and SRBC to ensure inter-departmental coordination
and its membership would include a progressive farmer from each research site. A State Level
Steering Committee will review and monitor the on-farm operational research programs through
regular contact with each Coordination Committee. The Steering Committee would contain senior
officials from ICADD, APAU, WALAMTARI, the Agriculture and Horticulture Departments and
farmers' representatives.
4.29   Agricultural Extension. While there are an adequate number of Village Extension Officers
(VEOs) in SRBC and in SRSP above LMD for the proposed extension program, the number of VEOs
in the Warangal district below LMD needs to be increased. Based on past experience, it is proposed
that the shortage of 35 VEOs could be filled by temporary recruitment (for 5 years) of 35 agricultural
graduates as agricultural development apprentices (ADAs) under the supervision of 5 Agricultural
Officers (AOs). The AOs would be incremental staff that need to be appointed. An assurance was
obtained at Negotiations that sufficient numbers of agricultural graduate VEOs and Agricultural
Officers would be posted by October 1, 1997
4.30   The various extension programs set up in a phased manner would be monitored in SRSP and
SRBC by Extension Program Steering Committees who would guide the personnel involved in
extension and training. The performance of ADAs, AOs and VEOs would be evaluated by these
committees. The membership of each Extension Program Steering Committee would be chaired by
the Associate Director of Research of an RARS and include: (a) Joint Director of Agriculture (b)
SRSP CADA Administrator/Superintendent Engineer SRBC; and (c) WUA representatives.
4.31   WALAMTARI Training Programs. The existing WALAMTARI training organization
established for AP II would be expanded under the leadership of the WALAMTARI Director-
General (Annex 8). A Director (Training & WUAs) would be responsible for the conduct of project
training courses at WALAMTARI headquarters for the officers of ICADD and the Agriculture



40
Department. He would be assisted by one EE and one Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) for
carrying out the training programs, and by a Institutional Specialist (rural sociologist of Associate
Professor rank) for promotion of WUAs (Annex 8). The Director (Field Training) would be
responsible for the conduct of training at the eight field training centers. He would be assisted one
DDA at headquarters and by an EE placed in each of the two project commands (at LMD in SRSP
and Nandyal in SRBC) to guide training and coordinate the activities at various field training centers.
The DDA would guide and assist agricultural training and oversee the maintenance of demonstration
farms at field training centers. Both Directors should be of SE/JDA rank. An assurance was
obtained from GOAP that the Director of WALAMTARI field training programs would be posted by
October 1, 1997.
Environmental Management Plan Responsibilities
4.32   GOAP desires that a professional agency assume the responsibility of implementing the
EMP in a systematic manner. Thus GOAP has entrusted the Andhra Pradesh State Forest
Development Corporation (SFDC), a GOAP parastatal agency, with implementation of the
afforestation components. Monitoring of the EMP activities of the SFDC and all other participating
departments and agencies would be carried out by the Environmental cell of the PPMU (para. 4.14).
SFDC would directly implement compensatory afforestation, canal bank plantation, catchment area
treatment plans and soil conservation measures. The SFDC has the requisite infrastructure for
implementation of the activities entrusted to it, including soil conservation works. The agency
obtains its technical forestry staff on secondment from the State Forest Department who have the
requisite experience. The other agencies involved in the EMP are Agriculture, Environment &
Forests, Groundwater, Fisheries and State Health Directorate. Sub-components relating to wildlife
preservation would be entrusted to the Wildlife Wing of the Forest Department. Site restoration and
muck stabilization would be the responsibility of ICADD through its supervision of construction
contracts. Although the head of each participating department is responsible for execution of his
agency's involvement in the EMP, each agency would designate a nodal officer for coordinating its
activities. Overall implementation will be monitored by the State Level and Project Environmental
Management Committees established by G.O. in February 1993.
C. Implementation Monitoring
Implementation Schedule
4.33   Project monitoring and physical and financial planning are related to the GOAP fiscal year
(April I to March 31 of the following year). A Master Implementation Schedule for each project
sub-component within the SRBC and SRSP sub-project areas has been prepared by ICADD. The
Master Schedule notes all key procurement events and records the periods of canal closure in SRSP
during which work can take place. A summary implementation schedule is exhibited in Annex 12; a
detailed implementation schedule for the R&R component is given in Annex 5.
4.34   The master schedules are based on the following principles: (a) all land acquisition for
SRBC works is to be completed prior to the estimated date of award of any new civil works contract;
(b) on-farm irrigation and drainage works in SRBC are scheduled to commence at least 9 months
before completion of the tertiary network of their respective irrigation blocks so that they could be
ready on time for initiation of irrigation (para. 2.15); (c) whereas six of the sixteen irrigation block
packages of SRBC would only be awarded in PY3, all network rehabilitation contracts for SRSP
would be awarded in PYI and PY2; and (d) scheduling of SRSP main canal and main distributary



41
works is based on closure of Kakatiya Canal from March 15 to June 15 of each year while
rehabilitation of small distributaries and minors is to be undertaken sequentially from December 15
to June 15 by missing a Rabi irrigation season as necessary. The need for seasonal canal closure in
SRSP has been conveyed to irrigators during public consultations and included in bid documents.
Project Performance Monitoring Framework
4.35   Project Performance Indicators The PPMU would be responsible for assembling and
reporting all project performance indicators from field units and participating agencies according to
an agreed framework. The physical and financial progress data for each construction contract and
irrigation performance would be obtained from the Management Information System database to be
established in the office of the SRBC and SRSP Chief Engineers respectively. A framework of key
Performance Monitoring Indicators relating to achievement of project objectives, outputs and
component input implementation progress has been prepared and is shown in Annex 12. The
PPMU's would arrange for a Baseline Sun=e (Terms of Reference in Annex 12) to record present
socio-economic and production conditions in the sub-project areas for the purposes of comparison
with a similar survey to be conducted prior to project closure. The survey--to be completed by the
end of the first project year--would cover agricultural data (average cropping patterns, yields, input
use etc.), household income and socio-economic data, current sources of irrigation and areas
irrigated. At negotiations, the Baseline Survey terms of reference and Performance Monitoring
Indicators were confirmed by GOAP and an understanding was recorded that GOAP would establish
a data collection system to facilitate regular reporting of the project output and implementation
progress indicators in project status reports. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that the
Baseline Survey would be completed not later than December 31, 1998.
4.36   Water Charge Collection Monitoring. The assessment and collection of water charges is
the responsibility of the Revenue Department (RD). Water charge assessment requires accurate
verification of areas actually irrigated. Detailed records of water charge assessments are maintained
by the Village Revenue Office describing the performance of the irrigation system below the
irrigation outlet. A provisional assessment is made for every field receiving irrigation (source-wise)
during October/November of each year and is finalized in May/June of the following year. Revenue
Village assessments are then aggregated by revenue jurisdictions for the entire state. Assessment of
water charges and the exchange of information between the RD and ICADD needs to be improved.
The reason why every potentially irrigable field is not irrigated or receives inadequate service is
recorded and used to deal with applications for remission of the water charge. However, water
charge remission information is not communicated to ICADD nor is it consulted information
exchange between ICADD and RD is infrequent and limited. ICADD does not provide RD with
irrigation maps nor does RD inform ICADD about irrigated areas entered in village records: thus
information that could serve to improve system performance is not used. Exacerbated by lack of
field staff in RD, this lack of communication enables farmers to conceal irrigated areas, evade
payments and misuse water.
4.37   During its implementation, the proposed project would serve as a model for establishment of
a service quality and increased water charge linkage in SRSP and SRBC. To achieve this, it would
be necessary to maintain separate accounts for each sub-project reflecting both water charge amounts
collected by RD and O&M expenditures by the ICADD and the WUAs. Unfortunately, water charge
collection accounts are not kept in a manner that allows full reconciliation over the entire command:
the units are village areas which almost always include non-irrigated areas and other irrigation
sources such as wells and village tanks. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that, for the SRSP



42
sub-project, GOAP would: (i) arrange for separate village irrigation revenue records to be kept by the
Revenue Department for canal irrigated areas based on distribution network maps supplied by
ICADD; (ii) require ICADD to keep records of the volume and duration of water supply made
available to each tertiary area and WUA; (iii) require that ICADD canal flow records and Revenue
Village canal scheme irrigation records be systematically analyzed and reconciled each year for
monitoring of WUA efficacy in field water distribution, bulk water supply service, and water charge
assessment and collection efficiency; and (iv) cause ICADD to submit the above analysis results to
the Water Charges Review Committee and the Bank/IDA for information not later than December 31
of each year starting 1998.
Reporting and Project Review
4.38   Reporting. An action-oriented review, planning and budgeting reporting process would be a
key feature of project management and implementation monitoring. This would take the form of: (a)
a semi-annual Project Status Report (which would include, inter alia, data on construction progress,
quality assurance and contract management prepared by the Chief Engineers of SRBC and SRSP
respectively; and (b) a comprehensive Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget (ARAPB) Report
(para. 4.39). All reports would be compiled and prepared by the PPMU. The semi-annual Project
Status Reports would be produced in standard format and would track the implementation progress
of each project component, including physical and financial progress, procurement, disbursement
and key output and implementation performance indicators. The semi-annual status reports and
ARAPB report would be submitted to the Principal Secretary (ICADD) and Secretary (Projects), and
copied to the Empowered Committee, relevant GOAP officials, GOI and the Bank/IDA. The project
reporting arrangements were confirmed at negotiations. Assurances were obtained from GOAP at
negotiations that: (i) it would prepare and submit a draft Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget
Report for the forthcoming GOAP fiscal year to the Bank/IDA for review and comment by January
15 of each year, commencing January 15, 1998; and (ii) not later than April 15 of each year, the
agreed Action Plan would be implemented taking account of Bank/IDA comments in accordance
with the agreed budget.
4.39   Annual Project Implementation Review. Preparation of the ARAPB Report would be the
main vehicle for annual GOAP review of project performance and future needs, for adjusting
ICADD's program as needed, for budgeting by GOAP of ICADD's expenditures, for assessing
progress and determining follow-on actions regarding WUA formation policies, and for major
review and supervision by GOI and the Bank/IDA. For ICADD, it would provide annual opportunity
to assess the overall project program, to propose adjustments as needed and to present its
consolidated plan and justification for financing needs for the forthcoming year. The ARAPB Report
would review the past year's achievements for each component and responsible unit and/or agency in
terms of development indicators, physical targets and expenditure, and would propose a revised work
program and expenditure budget for the forthcoming fiscal year.
4.40   The ARAPB Report's content would include: (a) description of each year's works, schedule
of activities, staffing requirements and distribution of responsibilities; (b) proposed expenditures for
the next fiscal year compared with the past year's actual expenditures and the budgeted and expected
expenditures of the current year; (c) details on major civil works contracts exceeding US$300,000,
and equipment and vehicle contracts exceeding US $200,000; (d) review of implementation progress
related to the improved canal and water management program in SRSP (and for SRBC when
irrigation begins); (e) detailed review of project maintenance needs; (f) progress with the project
farmer participation and turnover program; and (g) progress with the various staff and farmer



43
training programs. The ARAPB Report would quantify and compare progress with an updated
Master Implementation Schedule and the previous ARAPB, and would highlight key issues and
constraints. An overview with summarized data and a listing of decisions taken or recommended,
based on each unit's submission, would be prepared by the PPMU. This would include commentary
on the status of decisions and actions outstanding from the previous semi-annual status report, and
review of decisions/actions still required related to recommendations of the Project Empowered
Committee, GOI or Bank/IDA supervision missions.
4.41   Mid-Term Review. Prior to project mid-term, a Mid-Term Review Report would be
prepared by the PPMU according to a terms of reference to be agreed with a prior Bank/IDA
supervision mission. The mid-termn review report would include an assessment of: (a) procurement,
implementation and disbursement progress of each project component; (b) progress in participatory
irrigation management, water delivery improvement and collection of irrigation water charges in the
SRSP command; (c) reorganization and improvement of SRSP CADA performance; (d) the
likelihood of completion by project closure of all components in general and irrigation works in
particular; and (e) any project design changes or component restructuring needed to achieve project
objectives prior to closure. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOAP would: (i) submit a
detailed Mid-Term Review Report of the project to the Bank/IDA by October 31, 1999; and (ii) not
later than April 30, 2000, review with the Bank/IDA any possible need for adjustments to the design
of project components and its implementation arrangements and thereafter implement the mid-term
review's recommendations.
Supervision Plan
4.42   Bank/IDA supervision would be initiated by a Propect Launch/First Supervision Mission
mounted as soon as possible after the project is declared effective. The mission would assist ICADD
in ensuring that: (a) procurement, accounting and disbursement arrangements meet Bank guidelines
and project covenants; (b) implementation and procurement schedules and benchmarks are updated;
(c) adequate arrangements are made to collect and process data for performance monitoring
indicators; (d) project reporting formats are satisfactory; (e) finalize terms of reference for technical
assistance and studies. The first mission will also review arrangements for: project staffing and
SRSP CADA reorganization, inter-agency coordination, contract management and quality assurance,
initiation of staff and farrner training programs, WUA formation and improved canal management in
SRSP. Subsequent Bank/IDA supervision missions would comprise a main annual supervision
mission at the time of ARAPB review (para. 4.39), supplemented by shorter field visit. A
Superviaion Plan is given in Annex 12. A separate mission would be mounted for Bank/IDA
participation in the mid-term review to be conducted by GOAP.
V. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Project Benefits
Productivity, Employment and Income (Annex 10)
5.01   Farm Production and Economic Benefits. Assistance to GOAP for rehabilitation and
completion of the SRSP 253,000 ha command area and completion of the 65,000 ha SRBC project
begun under the AP II project would add 153,000 ha to the surface irrigation commands in AP. The
agricultural objective of these works is to promote the production of high value cash crops in upland



44
irrigation schemes by improved water delivery, applied farming systems research, irrigation
agronomy extension and farmer training. These inputs would result in significant incremental
agricultural production consisting of cereals and pulses, oilseeds, cotton and other cash crops.
Project agricultural output would generate an annual Value Added to the local economy estimated at
Rs.5.03 billion (about US$140 million) in 1995 prices. These project outputs would be sustained by
investment to ensure the safety and economic life of the Srisailam and Sriramasagar dams which, in
turn, would ensure sustained irrigated and hydroelectric power production within the Krishna and
Godavari river basins outside the project areas. Completion of the command area feeder road
program would promote farm produce marketing and provide quantifiable economic benefits in
travel time and vehicle operating cost savings valued at about Rs.60 million per annum.
5.02   Afforestation  Products and  Environmental Conservation.   The Environmental
Management Plan component would also generate several benefits, including: (a) soil conservation and
reduced reservoir sedimentation due to catchment area treatnent and reservoir green belt plantation; (b)
generation of forest products by compensatory afforestation, canal bank and the green belt plantations;
and (c) water-borne disease control under the environmental health program. Natural resources and
wildlife conservation in protected areas would be improved, while conservation benefits are not readily
quantifiable, canal bank and reservoir green belt plantation would produce saleable fuelwood,
pulpwood, faggotwood in the future (para. 5.07).
5.03   Employment. The number of directly benefiting farm families is estimated at about
447,700 (about 2.24 million people). At full development, the increased demand for farm labor would
amount to about 31.6 million man-days per annum (equivalent to about 105,450 full-time jobs). About
one half of the manpower demand would be supplied by hired labor, the majority of which consists of
landless workers. The increased agricultural production would generate off-farm employment (over
26,000 transport, marketing and processing jobs) in project area Districts. Construction of civil
works would generate a temporary increase in employment opportunities.
5.04   Farm Income Enhancement. The project would result in a significant increase in farm
income for primarily marginal and small farmers owning less than 2 ha (the average farm holding is
1.8 ha and 1.1 ha in SRBC and SRSP, respectively), and comprise 70% to 80% of the total holdings
in the two sub-projects. The annual net income increments for average farms are estimated at 360%
in SRBC, 104% in SRSP's rehabilitated command above LMD, and 197% in partially completed
SRSP command below LMD (Annex 10). The net income of the average farms in both sub-projects
is currently at or below the AP absolute rural poverty threshold of Rs. 11,000/family. Since the
estimated net income increment for average SRSP farms ranges from Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 18,000, the
project would raise most land-owning farm families above the poverty threshold. The project R&R
component would benefit families impoverished by land acquisition under previous projects within
the command area.
Irrigation Management Reform Benefits
5.05   Having served as a catalyst for GOAP irrigation sector management and fiscal reform, the
project would be a pilot to test management reform modalities for statewide adoption. The benefits
include determination of an effective process for: (a) empowerment of irrigators to take over the
operation and maintenance of minor canal networks by voluntary establishment of autonomous
WUAs; (b) involvement of irrigators in joint management of major canal schemes through
representation on Command Area Development Boards or Scheme Committees; and (c) transfer of a
part of the financial and management burden of canal network O&M funding and enforcement of



45
water delivery discipline to irrigation scheme beneficiaries with the objective of improving ICADD
irrigation services. An important benefit of the project would be the piloting of: (i) modalities to
realize GOAP's water rationing strategy for increasing the potential of upland canal commands
having scarce water resources; and (ii) ensuring reliable and adequate water supply to WUAs by
ICADD scheme organizations having main system O&M and water management as their primary
function. Thus, success of the twin pronged approach of PIM and improved irrigation service under
the project would lay the foundation for improvement of irrigation efficiency in upland areas and
improve the ability of irrigation schemes to compete with the growing water demand of other
sectors. Improvement of ICADD implementation capacity in the area of construction quality
assurance, R&R implementation and monitoring of large externally aided projects would also be a
beneficial outcome of the project.
B. Economic Justification
Economic Analysis Assumptions (Annex 10)
5.06   Assessment Scope. The economic analysis focuses on quantifying the net benefits of
irrigation on agricultural production and feeder road investments and on road users. The costs of the
agricultural support services program were included as necessary to achieve crop yields and the
diversified cropping pattern. The benefits were reduced by: (a) reduction in cultivated area due to land
required for civil works; and (b) the opportunity cost of hydroelectric power generation foregone due to
diversion of irrigation water to SRBC from the Srisailam multi-purpose reservoir. The economic rates
of return (ERRs) and Net Present Values (NPVs) have been calculated separately for: (i) the three
irrigation commands of the sub-project areas (SRBC, above LMD and below LMD in SRSP); (ii) SRSP
as a whole; and (iii) the overall project.
5.07   The R&R costs related to the SRSP sub-project were excluded from the economic analysis
since they are not related to the benefits of irrigation scheme rehabilitation. The proposed SRSP
expenditures would address the impoverishment of people affected by irrigation works under the AP II
project outside the rehabilitated command area (para. 1.28) and are therefore not relevant to irrigation
investment decisions. Investment to ensure the safety of the Srisailam Dam spillway was also excluded
from the analysis because its benefits are largely attributable to the protection of the dam's
hydroelectric plants and major downstream facilities in the river basin. The costs and benefits of the
Environment Management Plan were excluded because most of the benefits are related to regional
environmental conservation and are difficult to quantify in economic terms.
5.08   Benefit Assumptions. The quantified benefits are mainly incremental agricultural production
due to assumed cropping pattern and productivity changes in each command, supplemented by the
estimated economic benefits attributed to feeder road investments (e.g. economic savings in vehicle
operating costs and travel time). In SRSP, the agricultural benefits are expected to come mainly from
significant shifts from low value to higher value crops as a result of rehabilitation of the existing
irrigation network and expansion of reliable canal irrigation to the whole command. For SRBC, project
benefits are derived from the change from rainfed to irrigated production in the form of higher crop
yields, an increase in cropping intensity and shift to higher value crops. The build-up rate of benefited
areas was derived from the projected command area contract completion schedule. The maturation rate
of irrigation benefits has been assumed over three years at a constant rate in already irrigated areas and
over five years in areas where large scale surface irrigation would be newly introduced. Benefits were
reduced by the agricultural production foregone due to project land acquisition and by the hydroelectric
power generation foregone at Srisailam Dam due to SRBC.



46
5.09   The "Without Project" (WOP) and With Project (WP) cropping patterns were based on
available data and Participatory Rural Appraisals to elicit farmer preferences under a reliable irrigation
water delivery hypothesis. The resulting cropping patterns assume a cropping intensity of 160% and
150% for SRBC and SRSP respectively. Achievement of these cropping intensities is very likely
because: (a) major canal schemes in AP have an average cropping intensity of 125-130%; and (b)
SRSP's above LMD command has a current cropping intensity of 147%. Crop yields were estimated
on the basis of available data and the considered opinion of GOAP and FAO agronomists with
reference to existing yields and the impact of irrigation. For example, yield increments in SRBC are
high because less than 10% of the area is irrigated at present, while crop yield increments for SRSP's
above LMD command are lower as yields already reflect partial irrigation coverage .
5.10   Given the uncertainties of private sector investment in wells after scheme rehabilitation, the
analysis postulates that the private development of groundwater would continue at the same level in
both the WP and WOP scenarios: accordingly their costs and benefits are excluded. It is therefore
assumed that in SRSP the additional wells installed by rice cultivators to cope with the rotational water
supply regime in the WP case would equal the number that would be installed as a response to
inadequate canal irrigation coverage under the WOP scenario. For SRBC, it is unlikely that
groundwater development will expand significantly beyond its present level as the geology of 70% of
the command does not lend itself to viable well development.
5.11   Analysis Parameters, Prices and Costs. All costs and benefits have been expressed in
1995 constant prices and are net of identifiable taxes. The analysis uses a project life of 30 years and an
opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The prices of all tradable commodities and imports are based on
world reference prices adjusted to site or farm-gate values. All local costs, including unskilled labor
wages and non-traded goods, were converted to economic costs and values by using a Standard
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.90. Based on an analysis of taxes, duties, foreign exchange components,
local materials and labor charges of seven ongoing construction contracts, a conversion factor of 0.79
was used for valuation of irrigation works. Annual irrigation O&M costs were assumed to be Rs.494/ha
and adjusted to economic values by using an SCF of 0.9 as inputs consist mostly of salaries, local
materials and unskilled labor. Hydroelectric power generation foregone by the project was valued at
Rs. 1.6/kwh (based on AP State Electricity Board estimates of the long-run marginal cost of electricity).
Based on local traffic surveys and rural road vehicle operating cost savings studies, the annual
economic benefits of feeder roads in SRSP and SRBC were estimated at Rs.227,465 and Rs.207,130
respectively.
Economic and Risk Analysis Findings (Annex 10)
5.12   Economic Evaluation Results. Based on the above assumptions, the economic evaluation
results for a base case scenario are summarized in Table 5.1 below.

Present Value of Net Benefits(Rs. M)  7,228.0    4,272.0    11,501.0  780.0    12,280.0
The economic rate of return (ERR) of the whole project is estimated at 24% and the ERRs of sub-
projects are all favorable and higher than the 12% opportunity cost of capital. The present value of net
benefits (NPV) computed at the discount rate of 12% is positive for the whole project and the individual
commands. Although not relevant to the investment decision, the impact of sunk costs incurred under
the AP II project was evaluated. Expressed in constant 1995 prices, these expenditures amounted to
about Rs.4,405 million and of which SRBC sunk costs comprised 87%. Except for SRBC whose ERR
dropped to about 9%, the ERRs for SRSP and the whole project remained very favorable. These results
indicate that the project is justified, and not merely because its sunk costs have been excluded.
5.13    Sensitivity Analysis. "Switching values" were computed to determine the effect of deviations
from the main assumptions on the economic viability of the project: i.e. the value of the variable tested
which would reduce the present value of the project's net incremental benefits to zero when discounted
at a capital opportunity cost of 12%. The results indicate that, except for SRBC, ERRs of the above and
below LMD commands of SRSP are not very sensitive to substantial increases in the total costs,
particularly the construction costs, nor to substantial decreases in incremental benefits. The analysis
results are summarized in Table 5.2 below:

5.14   Economic Risk Analysis. The sensitivity of the economic analysis to planning assumptions,
as well as implementation risks, was analyzed. Fiscal and financial risks were analyzed separately
(paras. 5.16-5.32). The resulting ERR values are, for the most part, above 12% and indicate that
economic risks would not cause net benefits to drop below their switching value. The risk analysis
indicates that the project is robust, in economic terms, to deviations from appraisal assumptions.
This assessment is based on consideration of the following economic risks:



48
Impact of Implementation Delays. In the event of plausible increases in the construction costs
(+20%) or delay in the project's expected benefits, ERRs would still be acceptable for individual
commands, the combined SRSP command and the whole project. The ERR of SRBC is relatively
more sensitive to delayed benefits than to increased construction costs. A combination of both
contingencies would cause the SRBC ERR to fall below the ERR cut-off rate although the project
ERR would remain acceptable. Cost overruns in excess of 20% are somewhat unlikely since: (a)
civil works costs based on the official "Schedule of Rates" are adjusted upward to reflect recent
tender rates; and (b) irrigation contracts consist of simple canal works except for SRBC Owk
Reservoir and Tunnel contracts which comprise less than 10% of SRBC civil works costs.
* Impact of Rice Cultivation. If planning assumptions are not realized with respect to the projected
cash crop cropping patterns, investment in all sub-project commands--including SRBC--remains
economically attractive. To assess the risk that rice cultivation would expand despite rotational
water supply, the analysis assumed an increase of 50% in rice area. As the water requirement for
paddy is about twice that of upland crops, any increment in rice area would result in reduction of
the dry crop area and a lower cropping intensity. Thus the reduction in cropping intensity is
significant at about 47% at above LMD, marginal at about 13% for below LMD and only 3% at
SRBC. However, since the farmgate economic returns from rice are about 80% higher than most
cash crops (except cotton), the reduced cropping intensity is offset by the higher value of rice and
ERRs do not drop significantly.
* Seasonal Water Supply Deficits. The water deficit risks were based on computation of an expected
value of net benefits using water supply probabilities derived from river basin mathematical
simulation models of each sub-project. Seasonal water deficits do affect sub-project ERRs but do
not cause them to fall below the 12% threshold, albeit that seasonal water deficits reduced expected
net benefits by 11% for SRBC, and by 10% and 16% for SRSP above and below LMD commands
respectively. The benefit reduction for SRSP's below LMD command is the largest as simulation
studies indicated that its water supply reliability was very sensitive to hydrological risk in the rabi
(post-monsoon) irrigation season. Consequently, the analysis assumed its water supply to be zero
in the rabi season during deficit years, whereas for the other two project commands, irrigation was
assumed to be curtailed by 50% in deficit years.
* Lower Crop Yields. For the yield reduction analysis, a 25% decrease was assumed for rice and
10% for other crops (Annex 10, para. 46). Except for the above LMD command, reduction in rice
yield did not have a major effect on ERRs because of its relatively small role in the cropping
pattern. However, when combined with yield shortfalls for all other crops, a significant reduction
of ERR ensues albeit not to critical levels (except for SRBC).

C. Financial and Fiscal Analysis
Analysis Background and Scope (Annex 11)
5.16   Sector Debt Service Expenditure. Public irrigation has been given the highest priority in
the State's capital budget and amounted to 20% of the total GOAP public investment and is now
about 1.2% of SGDP. Irrigation is the third largest sector in terms of total budgetary allocations after
welfare programs and education. The State's annual interest payments to GOI for irrigation debt are
substantial and increased from Rs.4 billion in FY93/94 to Rs.7.22 billion in FY95/96. In FY95/96,
debt service payments amounted to about 85% of irrigation sector's total revenue expenditure
account and comprised about 38% of the State's total debt service payments.
5.17   Sector O&M  Expenditure. The most pressing financial problem faced by the AP public
irrigation sector is chronic under-funding of O&M works has led to a decline of the net canal
command area from 2.8 million ha in FY90/91 to 2.3 million ha in FY94/95. The actual O&M
allocation in real terms was kept at only about 24% of the actual funds needed for adequate upkeep
of the existing irrigation network. The average sector O&M allocation in FY94/95 was Rs.300/ha of
which 30% was spent on salaries and ICADD overhead, 66% for repairing the ravages of deferred
maintenance and only 4% on normal maintenance. The inadequate O&M allocation causes the
"deferred maintenance culture" currently practiced in the irrigation sector and inadequate cost
recovery has been the cause of under-funding of O&M.
5.18   Sector Revenues. Because of the high share of irrigation expenditures in the total State
expenditures, inefficiency in the public irrigation sector generates an adverse multiplier effect on



50
overall efficiency and growth in the economy. Prior to the recent increase in irrigation water charges
and agricultural power tariffs, surface and groundwater irrigation subsidies have reached 260% of the
total budgetary allocations to the irrigation sector and comprised about 6% of the state revenue
deficit. Direct cost recovery through water charges has been about 0.5% of agricultural value added.
Revenue from irrigation water charges in FY94/95 accounted for less than 1% of total GSDP. Despite
their low levels, water charges are generally perceived by farmers as taxes and not as user charges for
public irrigation services. FY94/95 water charge revenue collection amounted to 78% of the water
charge assessment: Compared to previous years, FY94/95 represents a drastic decline in collection
efficiency per gross irrigated ha which had attained 97% in FY93/94.
5.19   Requisite Analysis Scope. The current Andhra Pradesh fiscal crisis (para. 1.07) and sector
fiscal management thus gives rise to sector financial sustainability questions that need to be assessed
in addition to the conventional financial assessment of the project's direct and indirect cost recovery
potential and farmers' ability to pay irrigation water charges. These questions relate to: (a) the
incremental impact of project debt service needs on irrigation sector revenue expenditure; (b) the
impact of increased water charges and indirect project cost recovery revenue generated by
incremental agricultural sales taxes; (c) the state's fiscal capacity to meet project debt service
payments and O&M funding needs; (d) the minimal irrigation water charge and indirect cost
recovery collection efficiency required to ensure adequate coverage of project debt service and O&M
funding requirements; (e) the impact of statewide partial management turnover to WUAs on the
sector and project O&M funding burden.
5.20   The above considerations all have a bearing on the question of whether adequate funding of
project O&M can be sustained after cessation of Bank assistance. The sector fiscal health and
project debt service capacity issue arises out of the grant and loan arrangement by which the
proposed credit/loan of US$325 million would be on-lent to GOAP as additional central assistance.
The project IDA/IBRD credit/loan is made to GOI under standard terms and conditions and GOI
assumes the foreign exchange and variable interest rate risks. However, the 30% of this amount is
made available to AP as a GOI grant while the remaining 70% is on-lent under GOI's standard terms
and conditions3 at an interest rate of 13%. Thus the loan's impact on sector debt service repayment
needs to be kept in view when state finances are under stress.
Financial Analysis (Annex 11)
5.21   Water Charge and O&M Funding Assumptions. Firstly, the irrigation water charge rates
used in the analysis are those expected to be in effect by July 1, 1997. (Annex 11, para. 11). Since
rotational (intermittent) water supply would be the mode of water delivery for each command after
its de-localization to ID status (paras. 1.15-1.16), it is assumed the wet crop (rice) cultivators would
be charged a flat rate of Rs.247/ha. Secondly, it is expected that, given the increased water charges,
GOAP will provide for a statewide increase in irrigation O&M expenditures under its fiscal adjustment
program. Because the predominant crop grown on existing canal schemes in AP is rice, it is tentatively
assumed for the purposes of this analysis that the O&M allocation would be raised in future from
Rs.300/ha/year to Rs.494/ha/year (Annex 11, para. 14). This increase would also facilitate essential
scheme rehabilitation to overcome the ravages of deferred maintenance (para. 5.17) and enable turnover
The loan is divided equally into two parts: the first half is recovered at an interest rate of 13% per
annum over 10 years without a grace period; the second half is also recovered at an interest rate of
13% but over 15 years after a grace period of 5 years.



51
of tertiary networks to WUAs. Thirdly, based on ICADD data for the SRSP scheme, it is assumed that
where WUAs manage minor canals in their jurisdiction, only half of the GOAP maintenance budget
would be required by ICADD for the main network. When WUAs are fully established and responsible
for their minor network under a MOU with ICADD (paras. 2.32-2.36), actual O&M expenses for the
minor canal network would be provided by WUA members in cash and kind, and from a 40% rebate on
water charges under a proposed revenue sharing scheme (para. 4.10).
5.22   Indirect Cost Recovery via Agricultural Sales Taxes. Indirect taxation accounts for about
72% of total state tax revenues of which the most important was the sales tax on agricultural products
which averages 4% of gross output. Given that irrigated areas have a higher crop yield than rainfed
areas, the incremental sales tax on their incremental output may be regarded as an indirect cost recovery
mechanism which contributes to general state revenue. Accordingly, since the project's output would
generate incremental agricultural sales tax revenues, these were included in the analysis as an indirect
source of cost recovery. Using the project farm models, the per ha incremental sales tax revenue for
SRBC is estimated at over 600% (because of the change from rainfed to irrigated production), while
that of SRSP ranges from 200-300%. The total incremental agricultural sales tax revenue is estimated
at Rs.485.6 million (Annex 11, para. 18 and Table 5).
5.23   Project Rent Recovery Index. For the assessment of the project's farmers ability to pay the
increased water charge, the Project Rent--defined as the incremental net benefit per ha due to the
project after deduction of appropriate allowances for management and risk--has been estimated for
each sub-project using the representative farm models (para SS). Using the incremental water charges
and estimated average farm budgets under the WOP and WP scenarios, the Project Rent for an average
project farm would be substantial. The rent could vary from about Rs.9,807/ha to Rs.15,290/ha in
SRSP's above and below LMD areas respectively and attain Rs.23,783/ha in the SRBC area. Whereas
project rent constitutes about 91% of the present value of incremental project net income, the project
rent recovery index4 is only 10% (i.e. only 10% of the rent is recovered through water charges and
agricultural sales taxes). The project rent recovery index considering only water charge revenue is
about 8%. The rent recovery indices indicate that, if the project net benefits would materialize, there
could be scope to increase cost recovery further if necessary by raising water charges, or at least
maintaining a high collection efficiency.
5.24   Project Cost Recovery Index. For the assessment of the ability of the increased water charge
as a revenue generation mechanism for recovery for project costs, the project cost recovery indices5
were computed. The cost recovery index of assumed O&M costs by potential water charge revenues is
66%. However, a O&M requirement of Rs.494/ha is rather high for rehabilitated or new schemes and it
is likely that ICADD would allocate a lower unit O&M budget to the project commands (at least in its
early years). Since current SRSP staff costs are about Rs. 160/ha, this would leave Rs.324/ha for normal
O&M. It may be expected that actual O&M requirements would be much lower and that the increased
water charges would be adequate to cover O&M costs for the project. This would remain true even if
The Rent Recovery Index is the percentage ratio between the incremental per ha tax and water charge
revenues and the unit Project Rent. All amounts are expressed in present values discounted at 12%
over 30 years in constant 1995 prices.
The Cost Recovery Index is the percentage ratio between the per ha cost recovery revenues
(incremental water charges and agricultural sales tax revenues) and incremental unit irrigation capital
and O&M costs. All amounts are expressed in present values discounted at 12% over 30 years in
constant 1995 prices.



52
water charge revenues are shared with WUAs in return for assuming the O&M burden of the minor
canal systems of SRSP and SRSP.
5.25   Considering the contribution of incremental sales taxes, the project cost recovery index in terms
of O&M costs alone is 285% while the cost recovery index for both capital and O&M costs is 19%.
After deducting full recovery of estimated O&M costs, incremental sales tax revenues are able to
recover about 13-14% of project capital costs during the project's economic life of 30 years. Given the
reliance of GOAP on indirect taxation, the effective rate of cost recovery is probably understated as
increased agricultural income would generate growth in other sectors of the economy and thus
additional revenue through other tax measures.
Fiscal Analysis (Annex 11)
5.26   Project Fiscal Impact Assumptions.  Assuming constant 1995/96 prices, the proposed
project as a whole would incur average annual expenditures of Rs.2.86 billion of which GOAP's annual
average counterpart contribution would be Rs.0.91 billion with the remainder being financed by
additional central assistance facilitated by Bank/IDA financing. Assuming that, with fiscal reform to
reduce the state's current fiscal deficit, GOAP could maintain its FY95/96 level of sector capital
expenditures (Rs.6.83 billion), the project's annual counterpart capital outlay would comprise about
13% of irrigation capital expenditures. Thus if the sector capital budget is not increased, expenditure on
other ongoing projects may have to be curtailed. In terms of debt service obligations to GOI, standard
on-lending conditions would entail an average annual project debt service of about Rs.0.801 billion and
increase the current sector average annual debt service amount by 11%. Assuming that, with fiscal
reform, the total sector revenue expenditure can be maintained at the FY95/96 level of Rs.8.54 billion,
the project's annual debt service would comprise about 9.4% of total sector revenue expenditure.
5.27   Annual revenue expenditure for project O&M  a few years after completion of SRBC
construction and SRSP rehabilitation is estimated at Rs. 157.1 million if the full O&M burden remains
with GOAP, or Rs.94 million if ICADD only bears 60% and the remainder is bome by WUAs6. Sector
revenue expenditure for O&M at Rs.494/ha (para. 5.21) is estimated at Rs. 1,212 million after project
completion. Thus project O&M costs would comprise about 13% and 8% sector O&M revenue
expenditure without and with WUA burden sharing respectively. The project share of O&M
expenditure may be smaller in the initial years as the works would be new. However, for the purposes
of a sectoral analysis, project O&M costs are assumed to increase after several years and equal those of
other projects.
5.28   Project Debt Service Deficit. Under the revised water charge structure, the project could
generate a total annual potential revenue of Rs.603.4 million annual consisting water charge assessment
of Rs.1 17.8 million7 and potential agricultural sales tax revenues of about Rs.485.6 million (para. 5.22).
This revenue would cover only 63% of the total annual average expenditure of Rs.958.1 million
consisting of the estimated project O&M requirement (para. 5.27) and annual average debt service
(para. 5.26), while the potential water charge revenue would cover 75% of the assumed O&M cost.
These findings are similar to those of the cost recovery index calculation (para. 5.24). The cost
6      Based on a command area of 318,000 ha for both sub-projects and an estimated O&M budget of
Rs.494/ha. If revenue sharing is instituted whereby 40% of the water charge is returned to WUAs and
10% to Gram Panchayats, it is assumed that GOAP will only budget Rs.247/ha for O&M.
7      Based on a uniform water charge of only Rs.247/ha (para. 5.21).



53
recovery revenue deficit of Rs.354.7 million could be regarded as reducing the cost recovery efficacy of
agricultural sales taxes from the agricultural production of other irrigation projects whose potential
annual sales tax revenue is estimated at Rs.1,101 million. To maintain the irrigation sector's fiscal
status quo, the project debt service deficit would have to be made up by increased state revenue
generated by other fiscal reforms and adjustments currently being actively pursued by GOAP in
consultation with the Bank.
5.29    Impact of Revenue Collection Efficiency.  The foregoing analysis may be regarded as
theoretical as it compares project costs with potential revenues in the form of projected water charge
and agricultural sales tax revenue assessments that ostensibly could be made by the state
government's Revenue Department that collects both water charges and sales taxes. Given shortfalls
in water charge collection such as those of FY94/95 (Annex 11, para. 9), overall cost recovery would
be lower and depend on the Revenue Department's collection efficiency of both water charge
assessments and sales taxes. In the absence of data on actual sales tax collection efficiency within
the irrigation commands of AP it is assumed--for the purposes of analysis--that the collection
efficiencies of both revenue sources are identical.
5.30    Assuming that existing public canal schemes and minor irrigation tanks totaling 2.135
million ha (excluding SRSP) achieve the present average cropping intensities of 125% and 115%
respectively, and that about 90% of the gross cropped area consists of wet crops, a potential water
charge revenue assessment of Rs.1.35 billion could be expected under the new water charge rate
structure (Annex 11). This amount is about 330% larger than the sector water charge assessment
made by the Revenue Department in FY94/95 under the previous rate structure. An analysis was
thus made of the ability of sector water charge revenues and project agricultural sales tax revenues to
recover sector O&M costs and project debt service under different revenue collection efficiencies.
The analysis was repeated for a scenario which assumes that the all canal schemes are organized
under WUAs and a revenue sharing arrangement. The results are summarized as shown in Table 5.4
below.

54
5.31   It is seen that there is only a marginal difference in project debt service recovery between
with and without WUA/revenue sharing scenarios. In both cases, sector water charge revenues
substantially recover O&M expenditure except that with WUAs only about half the O&M burden is
carried by the state. When revenue collection efficiency drops to 75%, the unrecovered O&M
expenditure and project debt burden is equivalent to about two thirds of the estimated agricultural
sales revenue generated by all existing public irrigation schemes; with WUAs this amount increases
to about three quarters. Thus in order to maintain the fiscal and operational advantages of WUAs
without compromising capital cost recovery, it is essential that every effort be made to maintain
water charge efficiency at a level of 90% or more.
5.32   Overall Project Fiscal Viability Assessment. The analysis indicates that the significant fiscal
burden of the project may be offset provided efforts are made to maintain a revised water charge and
agricultural sales tax collection efficiency of at least 75%. Joint management of irrigation schemes by
establishment of WUAs would significantly reduce GOAP's O&M burden expenditure burden albeit
that a significant rebate of water charges is contemplated. The project design has considered fiscal risks
by requiring the establishment of a Water Charge Review Committee which would periodically review
water charge assessment and charge collection efficiency and advise government of the adjustments
required to maintain the financial viability of the public irrigation sector.
D. Project Risks
5.33   Government Commitment.  Waning GOAP commitment is a risk.  However, all
indications point to very strong GOAP commitment to ensure that project implementation does not
fail in the manner of AP II and that its irrigation management reform piloting aspects will succeed.
Firstly, GOAP is engaged in fiscal adjustment dialogue with the Bank as part of a very large
assistance program for FY98/99 and, despite its fiscal difficulties, has agreed to an exclusive escrow
account for funds received as retroactive finance (para. 3.18). It published a White Paper irrigation
financial difficulties and undertook statewide public consultations prior to the politically risky major
increase of irrigation water charges. Secondly, success of the project is vital for the sustainability of
the AP public irrigation sector in general and, in particular, for satisfying the local political and inter-
state water sharing imperatives motivating the development of upcoming upland irrigation projects.
GOAP has undertaken a series of frank political and beneficiary consultations about the SRSP canal
operation policy which caused problems under AP II before issuing Orders for the final de-
localization of the SRSP command. Thirdly, its commitment to a publicly announced joint irrigation
management policy and beneficiary empowerment under WUAs extends beyond the project and
receives support from the government's highest levels. GOAP is now in the process of establishing
WUAs in all its major irrigation schemes without Bank support or pre-conditions. Fourth, GOAP
supports the agreed project R&R Policy despite its precedent setting financial implications for other
ongoing and future irrigation projects. However, notwithstanding GOAP's commitment, there are
several ubiquitous project risks to be contained as described below.
5.34   Implementation Agency Motivation Risks.  The enunciated GOAP commitment to
improved irrigation service and beneficiary empowerment may not be enthusiastically shared by an
agency such as ICADD whose staff motivation traditionally lies in executing civil works. This risk
has been addressed in project design. Firstly, NGOs will play a major role as Social Organizers in
establishing WUAs and in assisting GOAP revenue and rural agencies in R&R implementation.
Secondly, project preparation has led to strengthening the role of CAD by appointment of an CAD
Commissioner of Joint Secretary rank, while project design requires: (a) transfer of SRSP O&M
functions to its CADA under a CADA Administrator with two year tenure; (b) establishment of a



55
CADA Agricultural Engineering Wing using agriculture staff; (c) significant beneficiary
representation on the CADA Board; and (d) placement of minor canal gate operators under WUA
control. Thirdly, the agronomy and extension component and the Environmental Management Plan
will be respectively implemented by WALAMTARI and SFDC, i.e. by agencies seeking to expand
their role and therefore with an incentive to performn. Difficult project staffing issues are to be
resolved by the Empowered Committee while general problems of redundant ICADD staff are being
addressed by GOAP.
5.35   Implementation Capacity and Delay Risks.  The economic analysis has indicated
sensitivity to delayed benefits which would arise from delay in completion of irrigation works. The
principal sources of this implementation risk are delayed civil works procurement (including
excessive bid values in relation project estimates), delayed transfer of funds to implementation units
and construction contract management disputes. There is also a risk that poor construction quality
could shorten the economic lifetime of canal structures and thus curtail the area irrigated. Aside of
GOAP desire not to let implementation delays reoccur by using an Empowered Committee to
monitor implementation and resolve issues causing delay, these risks are mitigated in the project
design. The safeguards include: (a) the escrow account which provides an initial buffer against
delays in resource transfer from GOI and within GOAP and the proposed Annual Review, Action
Plan and Budget process for monitoring and control of project implementation; (b) completion of bid
documents prior to project start-up; (c) use of a tender premium in base cost estimates, rigorous post-
qualification where possible to minimize bidder collusion and ensure selection of competent
contractors; (d) specification of canal rehabilitation "construction windows" in bid documents to
elicit competitive bidding; (e) bid validity and evaluation time limitations; (f) continuation of the
job-specific daily OK Card system for monitoring supervision and contractor performance; and (f)
use of an independent adjudicator for initial contract dispute resolution. ICADD has already proved
its ability to deliver good construction quality and this would be strengthened by expansion of the
training component of the construction quality assurance program and quality monitoring
organization.
5.36   Beneficiary Response Risks. The risks that farmer production response may not coincide
with project plans have been assessed by the economic analysis and have been found not to be overly
critical in economic efficiency terms. However, there are other irrigator response risks which may
arise during project implementation which could be more critical in reducing project benefits.
Firstly, control of wasteful irrigation in SRSP's above LMD command may not be fully achieved
despite rotational water supply and WUA management of farm water deliveries. Thus, the water
supply to the below LMD command would be less reliable than forecast by the sub-project
simulation model. Secondly, the irrigation agronomy extension program may not be effective in
training farmers in improved water management. The project design has tried to mitigate the risks of
wasteful irrigation by placing irrigators served by direct outlets from large canals within the
jurisdiction of WlUAs and it is expected that the proposed partial devolution of ICADD's disciplinary
powers to WUAs will enable enforcement of discipline. It is also assumed that rehabilitation of this
command will create a political lobby that would be brought to bear on water wastage and excessive
water consumption by farmers in the above LMD command.
5.37   Financial Sustainability Risks. There is a risk that water charge and agricultural sales tax
collection efficiency may be lower than anticipated due to the higher charge levels and other GOAP
fiscal reform measures to increase revenue by taxation. As this could affect project cost recovery, a
provision has been made to monitor water charge assessment and collection in the SRSP sub-project
(para. 4.37). The monitoring results would also serve as an input to the GOAP Water Charge Review



56
Committee which is to monitor statewide water charge revenue collection (para. 4.11). The risk of
inadequate O&M budgeting would arise if water charge collection efficiency is low. It is assumed
that the O&M burden would be reduced by turn-over of the minor canal system to WUAs and by the
statewide water charge revenue sharing proposal for water charge rebates to WUAs to promote their
assumption of the canal maintenance burden. Nevertheless, there remains a risk that-in the future--
fiscal pressures and completion of other large projects may result in erosion of the ICADD's O&M
budget for those works it remains responsible for.
5.38   Water Availability Risks.  There is some risk that future irrigation development by
upstream riparian states could reduce water availability to the project commands and that reservoir
sedimentation may reduce water supply reliability. These risks have been assessed by simulation
models (Annex 1) and are deemed unlikely because: (a) the SRSP command area supported by the
project has been limited to the existing potential created; (b) SRBC water supply reliability has been
assessed on the assumption of full future development of the Krishna river basin; and (c) the models
were run assuming expected reservoir capacity levels after 50 and 75 years of sedimentation.

INDIA
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Overview of Water Availability Issues
Interstate Rivers
1.    The Interstate Water Disputes Act. Water is a State subject under the Indian Constitution.
Riparian disputes about the sharing and development of the waters of an interstate river are resolved
and regulated by the Union Government by means of The Interstate Water Disputes Act passed in 1956.
The Act provides for setting up a Tribunal to adjudicate in case of a dispute about water of an interstate
river or river basin. The Act is set into motion on a complaint made by a state party to the central
government, who constitutes a Tribunal at its discretion for resolution of the dispute. The Tribunal may
apportion flow to downstream riparian states and also among existing schemes, future projects and
beneficial uses (e.g. hydro-power) brought before the Tribunal by the riparian states.
2.     Project Interstate Rivers. The proposed project (AP III) would support further development
and management of the waters of the Krishna and Godavari rivers for irrigation within Andhra Pradesh
(AP). The Krishna River Basin drains 258,848 km2 of catchment from its headwaters to the Bay of
Bengal and its river network flows through the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and AP. The Godavari
River drains a catchment of 309,760 km covering the states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and AP.
The project includes: (a) completion of the 65,000 ha Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) sub-
project which is to receive its water supply from the Srisailam Reservoir on the Krishna River; and (b)
rehabilitation the 253,000 ha Sriramasagar Project (SRSP) which receives the bulk of its water supplies
from the Sriramasagar Reservoir on the Godavari River and supplementary supplies from the Lower
Mannair Dam (LMD) located on the Mannair River (a small tributary of the Godavari river within AP).
Since interstate water disputes had arisen on both the Krishna and Godavari rivers, riparian state water
sharing is based on allocations determined by the Awards made by two Tribunals under the 1956 Act.
The Srisailam Right Branch Canal Project
3.     Srisailam Reservoir. The idea of utilizing Krishna River waters to irrigate the drought-
prone upper Pennar river basin in the Rayalaseema region is more than 100 years old. The first
attempt was the Kumool-Cuddapah (KC) Canal scheme (IBRD Map BBB), begun in 1872 which, by
diversion from the Krishna river and through a system of multiple pick-ups from the Kundu river (a
tributary of the Pennar River), enabled progressive utilization of return flows to irrigate about 88,814
ha on the east bank of the Kundu River . The area of the SRBC project on the right bank of the
Kundu, about 130 km long and 5-10 km wide, and having a cultivable command area (CCA) of
77,000 ha, became potentially irrigable only after completion of the Srisailam Reservoir (IBRD Map
BBB) on the Krishna River in the late 1970s.
4.     The Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal Award. In 1973, the Krishna Water Disputes
Tribunal (KWDT) allocated 2060 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) or 58,333 million cubic metres
(Mm) of the Krishna River's estimated 75% dependable annual water yield (para BB) between the
three riparian States involved. The Award is distributed as follows:



Annex I
Page 2 of 19
Andhra Pradesh                    800 TMC (22,654 Mm3)
Maharastra                        560 TMC (15,857 Mm3)
Karnataka                         700 TMC (19,822 Mm3).
The water utilization of existing projects in all three co-basin states as of September 1960 was
protected within the KWDT allocations. The Award further confines planned irrigation development
by the two upstream riparian states in the Krishna basin to be consistent with the above allocations.
The KWDT Award covered existing (at the time) uses and all future allocations and is therefore quite
specific. Review in the year 2000 AD is dependent on any one riparian State requesting it.
5.    A further 70 TMC (1982 Mm3) of estimated irrigation return flow (regeneration) within the
basin was allocated to the states by the KWDT. Since AP had already fully utilised its KWDT
allocation for existing projects, its allocation was augmented by the KWDT to 811 TMC (22,965 Mm3),
i.e. to include 11 TMC (311 Mm3) of the regeneration flow amount. According to a subsequent KWDT
Order issued in 1976, AP is permitted to use any surplus waters in excess of 800 TMC reaching its
border up to the year 2000 AD without conferring a future right to these flows.
6.    Interstate Agreements. During the 1970s, it became clear that Madras City in Tamil Nadu
(TN) requires water from the Krishna to ensure its municipal and industrial requirements, the three
Krishna basin states each allocated 5 TMC of their KWDT share, i.e. totaling 15 TMC (425 Mm3), to
TN for Madras City. Thus it became necessary to skim water from the Srisailam reservoir without
passing it through the turbines, and convey it by canal through a number of balancing reservoirs to
the AP/TN border via a canal financed by TN. The so-called Telegu Ganga Canal (TGC) would
divert 15 TMC of surplus Krishna flows over a period of 3-4 monsoon months and deliver 12 TMC
(allowing for losses) to storage facilities in TN for Madras's use over an eight month period. Once
the cost of water transfer via the TGC from the Srisailam Reservoir to the Pennar basin would be
thus covered, AP conceived three new irrigation projects to utilize its return flow award and the
sanction to use surplus waters for irrigation of its poorest and drought-prone Rayalaseema region.
Tamil Nadu agreed that TGC could serve the Telegu Ganga Project (TGP) which would be based on
diversion of 29 TMC (821 Mm3) of Krishna surplus flows from Srisailam Reservoir into the TGC to
irrigate about 117,000 ha. GOAP has also planned another project to utilize 30 TMC of its surplus
Krishna water called the Srisailam Left Branch Canal Project (SLBC).
7.    SRBC Water Allocation. The third new project, SRBC, was not specifically given an
allocation by the KWDT. However the scheme's 19 TMC (538 Mm 3) planned water requirement was
originally cleared by the GOI Planning Commission on May 16, 1981. Since then, the 11 TMC (311
Mm3) regeneration amount awarded by the KWDT to AP has been allocated to SRBC by Government
Order (GO-Ms No. 154 dated June 6, 1994). The same Order included a statement of intent for
obtaining the remaining 8 TMC (227 Mm3) by "..modernisation of KC Canal system or any other
system.". GOAP has since concluded an Agreement with the Japanese Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund for grant financing of KC Canal relining and modernization works. It is assumed
that the water savings obtained by this project would facilitate greater irrigation efficiency in the KC
Canal scheme and enable water to be made available for SRBC consumptive use.
8.    SRBC Water Supply. SRBC's water supply is obtained by an off-take from the TGC at a
distance of 19.4 km from Srisailam Reservoir. Accordingly, the main canal leaving the reservoir was
designed for a capacity of 315.7 m3 per second (cumec) to cater for both SRBC, TGP and Madras
needs on the assumption of diversion of surplus Krishna waters from Srisailam Reservoir during a 3
to 4 month monsoon period. The SRBC main canal was planned to carry a maximum discharge of



Annex 1
Page 3 of 19
140.5 cumec for a distance of about 50 km to the command area. This capacity was selected on the
assumption that at least 12.82 TMC would also be diverted during the monsoon months for storage
in two balancing reservoirs: Gorakullu Reservoir with a live storage of 10.73 TMC at km 50 of the
SRBC main canal, and Owk Reservoir with a live storage of 2.09 TMC at km 116 of the SRBC main
canal. Construction of the SRBC main canal began under the Bank-assisted Second Andhra Pradesh
Irrigation Project (AP II).
9.     AP II Water Availability Issues. The AP II project appraisal mission determined that a
reliable water supply was possible without construction of the Gorakullu and Owk Reservoirs as
proposed by GOAP. By elimination of these reservoirs, the SRBC scheme's operation was to be based
on continuous abstraction from Srisailam Reservoir for 9-10 months during the irrigation season instead
of reliance on off-channel reservoirs filled in 3-4 months during the monsoon season only. It therefore
became important to operate Srisailam Reservoir in such a manner that it could supply SRBC's
irrigation needs throughout the irrigation season. Nevertheless, during AP II implementation and
despite a GOAP assurance that 19 TMC would always be allocated to SRBC, water availability for
SRBC and operation of Srisailam Reservoir became an issue between the Bank and GOAP. Thus when
the preparation of the proposed AP III project began, GOAP claimed that the two off-channel reservoirs
(Gorakullu and Owk) having a combined gross storage capacity of 17.92 TMC were necessary to
ensure a water supply reliability of 75% for SRBC as per Indian planning standards. Accordingly,
GOAP also proposed to extend the SRBC cultivable command area (CCA) from 65,000 ha to 77,000 ha
as originally envisaged when the project was approved by GOI in 1981.
10.    SRBC Project Preparation Issues. The project preparation mission found that: (a) no design
studies and investigations had been undertaken for the enlarged command; (b) the proposed Srisailam
Reservoir operating rules resulted in a higher supply reliability for the proposed TGP and SLBC
schemes than for SRBC (which had an identifiable water allocation derived from the KWDT Award
and was already under construction); (c) aside of requiring relocation of a large village, the Gorakullu
Reservoir site was located over karstic limestone outcrops and that its viability could not be ascertained
without extensive and time-consuming investigations; (d) the SRBC main canal excavation had
progressed to about km 100 and its alignment could not be practically changed to eliminate the Owk
Tunnel and Reservoir; and (e) the Owk Reservoir's gross capacity would have to be reduced from 4.86
TMC to 1.86 TMC (live storage 0.84 TMC) by lowering its level by 7 m so as not to relocate a village
and to prevent possible water leakage through karstic limestone outcrops at the higher elevations.
11.    Given these findings, the Bank requested GOAP to review its project simulation studies to
determine SRBC water supply reliability without the Gorakullu Reservoir. The cardinal assumptions of
this review were: (a) use of the agreed hydrological series developed by the KWDT in determining
water allocations to the riparian states; and (b) that proposed projects such as TGP and SLBC would be
included in the simulation so as to determine SRBC supply reliability under full development within
AP. The review was to investigate alternative operating rules for the Srisailam Reservoir which would
ensure supply reliability to SRBC without Gorakullu Reservoir and with an Owk Reservoir of reduced
capacity. These studies were also to allow for the need to augment the water supply to Hyderabad. In
parallel, GOAP was also to begin investigation of the sedimentation rates of Srisailam Reservoir as only
one reservoir survey had been conducted in the 1980s. Thus it became relevant to also investigate
water reliability sensitivity to long term reservoir storage reduction.
12.    The outcome of these studies--described herein--resulted in a reformulation of the SRBC
project design, namely, that the Gorakullu Reservoir would not be necessary for irrigation of 65,000 ha
and that a reduced capacity Owk Reservoir would be included in the project. A pumping station would



Annex I
Page 4 of 19
be installed at Owk Reservoir in order to utilise 0.64 TMC of dead storage for supply augmentation.
Since the SRBC main canal had already been excavated to its original capacity as a flood flow canal
under AP II, the present design leaves GOAP the option of possibly building Gorakullu Reservoir and
expanding the Owk reservoir to full capacity in the post-project period if economical solutions to the
potential reservoir leakage problems could be found.
The Sriramasagar Sub-Project
13.    Sriramasagar Reservoir and Lower Mannair Dam. For a few hundred years, irrigation in
AP's drought-prone Telangana Region had existed in small areas served by locally constructed
village tanks. During 1951, the erstwhile Govemment of Hyderabad submitted a scheme to the GOI
Planning Commission based on a dam at Pochampad on the Godavari River and dams on its
tributaries, the Kaddam and Mannair rivers. The Pochampad site was located a little below the entry
point of the Godavari River into AP territory. However, only the Kaddam Dam was built. The final
Pochampad Project proposals were cleared for GOAP in 1964 and were based on utilization of 66
TMC of Godavari waters stored in a 112 TMC gross capacity Pochampad Dam (82.1 TMC live
storage) to irrigate 231,000 ha via a 113 km long Kakatiya Canal (KKC). The dam was also to
include a hydroelectric generating plant with a 36 MW installed capacity. Bank involvement began
in 1971 with assistance to GOAP for completing the Pochmapad Dam--later renamed Sriramasagar
Reservoir (SRSR)--and extension of the existing 17,000 ha command area to 100,000 ha. When
detailed localization surveys revealed that a CCA of 0.231 M ha was not available up to km 113 of
KKC, plans were made to: (a) extend KKC another 33 km up to the Mannair River; (b) construct the
13.4 TMC capacity Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) as a balancing reservoir; and (c) extend the
command area beyond KKC's proposed km 146.
14.   Command Area Development. The Pochampad Project became known as SRSP when it
was reformulated in 1982-1984 to increase the command area from 0.231 M ha to 0.392 M ha by: (a)
extending KKC to km 284 to create a 343,000 ha command, and supplying water to Warangal town
at KKC's km 234; and (b) including two new canals from SSR: Saraswathi Canal to potentially serve
17,000 ha and linking SRSR to Kaddam reservoir; and Laxmi Canal to serve 6,400 ha (see Figure 2).
KKC was also to be lined to reduce losses and GOAP adopted a water management and system
design policy based on Rotational Water Supply and de-localization of the whole area for ID
irrigation only. The extension of KKC to km 146 LMD and the new Laxmi and Saraswathi canals
were funded by GOAP, while command area development of 33,500 ha was to be undertaken under
the bank-supported AP I project. AP I had implementation problems, and after restructuring, all
field channels and on farm works were eliminated.
15.   Thus by 1985, prior to the AP II appraisal, only about 120,000 ha of the main network out of
total CCA of 164,800 ha above LMD had been completed (except for channel lining) but the minor
network was not completed. Nevertheless, GOAP began to extend KKC below LMD until km 234.
Under AP II, the KKC works up to km 234 were to be completed and extended to km 284 to create a
command of 163,000 ha below LMD. Thus the total area served by KKC was expected to be
328,000 ha and serve over 651 villages. Rehabilitation of the existing command area above LMD
was an important AP II project component. In 1985/86 the net area irrigated by KKC was only
31,564 ha as the minor network was incomplete. During AP II, the net area irrigated rose to a
maximum of 73,447 ha in 1990/91 (inclusive of an extension of about 8000 ha below LMD complete
by 1989), and declined to 63,345 ha in 1992/93. This negative trend indicates that only a small part
of the minor canal networks were ever completed, and then deteriorated rapidly within a few years
after completion due to inadequate maintenance funding (about 85 to 90% of the O&M budget is



Annex I
Page 5 of 19
spent on establishment costs and salaries). By the closure of AP II in June 1994, no existing
command above or below LMD was rehabilitated nor were any of the new command areas
completed except for some of the distributary and branch canals.
16.   Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal. The Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal (GWDT) made
a water allocation to each riparian state after an analysis of the hydrology of the entire Godavari River
Basin. The 75% dependable yield of the Godavari River Basin at the Dowleshwaram gauging station
on the lower Godavari River was assessed by the GWDT to be 3,000 TMC (84,951 Mm ) of which
1,172 TMC (33,168 Mm3) was allocated to AP. Although specific GWDT allocations are made for
each basin there is not the same degree of project definition that occurs in the KWDT Award. As per
GWDT, AP is entitled to use all water reaching its territory including that reaching SRSR. Upstream
of SRSR, the following provisions of the GWDT agreements apply:
*  Three existing dams upstream of SRSR (Jaikwadi and Sidheswar in Maharashtra and Nizamsagar
within AP) are able to trap all flows of the catchment upstream of them, leaving an effective
catchment of 40,415 km for the SRS reservoir.
*  Agreements (as stated by GWDT) provide for 98 TMC (2775 Mm3) to be allocated to schemes in
the upstream effective catchment area.
*  There is no specific water allocation for SRSP except that the project will get any water left over
after upstream utilisation of 98 TMC (2775 Mm3) (i.e. any determination of the amount of water
available to SRSP must be reduced by 98 TMC to allow for future development).
GOAP entered into a bilateral agreement with the state of Maharashtra in 1975 and filed a document
which became part of the GWDT Award. According to this document, a quantity of 200 TMC (5,660
Mm3) is accepted as available at the Maharashtra border for flow into SRSR and served as the basis of
GOAP planning of SRSP in 1982/84 (para.16). In contrast to the KWDT provisions, no expiry date
was set for the GWDT Award.
17.   SRSP Water Availability Estimates The AP II Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) estimated the
75% dependable inflow to SRSR to be 160 TMC according toCWC computations. Adding an
estimated 13.4 TMC as the 75% dependable inflow into LMD, the total 75% water availability for
the SRSP scheme was regarded by the Bank to be 177.4 TMC. The SAR assumed that the
requirements of Laxmi, Saraswathi and KKC (up to km 284) commands would be 121.6 TMC and
the balance amount of 56 TMC was therefore assumed to be available for irrigation beyond km 284
of KKC. The AP II SAR based its assessment on a canal irrigation efficiency of 50%, but noted that,
if irrigation efficiency was realistically only 3 7%, scheme expansion below KKC 's km 284 would not
be possible. In 1992, the CWC re-estimated the 75% dependable inflow to SRSR to be 196.1 TMC
(after subtraction of 98 TMC for future developments upstream). Accordingly, GOAP undertook a
water supply reliability simulation study of the SRSP scheme and published a report in 1993 to
expand the scope of the KKC command by 198,300 ha beyond the 328,000 ha envisaged under AP
II. The overall scheme irrigation efficiency assumed in these GOAP studies was 70%.
18.    SRSP Project Preparation Issues. When project preparation began in May 1994, GOAP
expected that the AP II program of rehabilitation and extension of 328,000 ha of SRSP would be
completed, and that the command area beyond km 284 of KKC would be extended by 34,300 ha. The
initial Bank preparation missions were concerned that these plans were optimistic because: (a) estimates
of the Godavari River inflow to SRSR seemed uncertain; (b) there were indications that sedimentation
rates of SRSR were higher than originally assumed; (c) improvement of the project's low irrigation
efficiency would be a difficult social engineering task; and (d) planning based on canal irrigation



Annex I
Page 6 of 19
efficiencies of over 40% was unrealistic. The Bank therefore indicated that it would only support
scheme rehabilitation up to km 234 of KKC and not support completion of the works to expand the
SRSP command beyond km 234 as it feared that water supply reliability beyond this point would be
low because of the above reasons. In order to resolve the issue of supply reliability, it was agreed that
GOAP would therefore review both the hydrology of inflows into SRSP and its SRSP simulation model
to (i) study water supply reliability below LMD, and (ii) determine the system's sensitivity to key
planning assumptions and parameters including Godavari River flow estimates. The outcome of
GOAP's simulation studies--described herein--confirmed the Bank's concerns: consequently, the
proposed project only supports rehabilitation of the existing command up to km 234 of KKC. The
project does however support an economic rehabilitation program for families affected by land
acquisition for the SRSP extension works undertaken under AP II.
B. Hydrological Series Used for Simulation Studies
Krishna River Basin
19.   Inflow into Srisailam Reservoir. The KWDT established and published a Krishna River flow
series for the period 1894/95 to 1971/72 consisting of the annual mean flows at the Vijayawada gauging
station near Prakasam Barrage in the Coastal Region of AP (see Figure 1). To this was added the yearly
estimate of water use upstream of Vijayawada obtained by consensus from the three Riparian States
(Maharastra, Kamataka and Andhra Pradesh). The resultant annual flows can be considered as a best
estimate of the 'natural' or 'virgin' flow record of the Krishna from its origin to the coast. The 75%
dependable annual flow of 2060 TMC upon which the KWDT Award is based was derived from this
data series. For reasons of data integrity, only data for 1900/01 to 1971/72 was used in the project
simulation study. In order to derive a hydrological series representing the gross water yield at the
Srisailam Reservoir for use in the simulation study, the flows at the downstream Vijayawada gauging
station (Figure 1) were multiplied by a factor of 0.9123 derived from gauging station and catchment
area correlation. The net inflow series at Srisailam Reservoir was obtained by first deducting upstream
water allocations made by KWDT, and then by adding 11 TMC (311 Mm3) regeneration flow and the
water saving of 8 TMC (227 Mm3) expected from the KC Canal rehabilitation program (para. 7).
20.    Free Catchment Inflows. The simulation model undertakes a fortnightly routing of the series
of modelled inflows into Srisailam Reservoir. According to the reservoir's operating rules, computed
releases through the power plant and spillway are routed downstream to the Nagarjunasagar Reservoir
(NSR). The yield of the free catchment between the two reservoirs is considered while carrying out the
reservoir operation of NSR to meet its water demand. Simulated releases from NSR flow down the
Krishna to Prakasam Barrage (PB) and is augmented by yield of the free catchment between the two
structures. This yield estimate is computed by a procedure proposed by CWC in 1986. From this yield,
the inflow of the upper interim catchment (para. 19) is deducted along with the utilisation of all
schemes between NSR and PB to give the gross yield of the lower catchment. The net annual flow
series is then computed by deducting the water allocations of all schemes between NSR and PB
Godavari River Basin
21.    Generation of the SRSR Inflow Series. Prediction of water supply reliability for SRSP under
alternative development scenarios requires the derivation of a net monthly inflow series that reflects
development of the whole upper catchment of the Godavari River according to the provisions of the
GWDT. Because of very large inflows downstream of the SRSR, it is not easy to correlate the short
record of SRSR inflows and the long record of downstream flows at the Dowleshwaram gauging station



Annex I
Page 7 of 19
in the Coastal Region of AP. For this reason, the methodology of derivation of a reliable hydrological
series comparable to that of Krishna Basin was not possible. Instead an inflow data series for SRSR
from 1971/72 to 1986/87 was used by GOAP and extended by means of rainfall-runoff data correlation
as per a procedure developed by CWC in 1992 (para SS). Estimated utilisation for the 40515 km2 free
(effective) catchment, for each year were added to the SRSR inflow series to get gross flow. This
record was correlated with the monsoon period weighted average rainfall downstream of the three dams
which capture all the water above SRSR (Nizamsagar in AP, Jaikwadi and Sidheswar in Maharashtra).
The resulting regression equation was then used to extend the flow series back to 1950/51 based on
rainfall data. The next step was to deduct spill flows from the Nizamsagar Dam. To derive total annual
flows for the extended record based on rainfall data, it was assumed that the monsoon period flow
amount could be multiplied by 10%. Calculations have been made on the basis that the Jaikwadi and
Siddeswar dams did not spill in the 1971/72 to 1986/87 period. The gross 755 dependable yield was
computed to be 284.68 TMC. Committed and contemplated utilisation of 98 TMC (2,775 Mm3) was
deducted (para. 18) from the extended gross annual yield series series to obtain the net annual inflow
series to Sriramasagar Reservoir for the period 1950-1987 which was to be used in the simulation
model. The 75% dependable net SRSR inflow worked out as 196.1 TMC (5,553 Mm3).
22.    Alternative SRSR Inflow Series. The Bank missions determined that there were uncertainties
in the rainfall-runoff correlation used to extend the 1971-1987 SRSR inflow data record. It also found
that there were apparently non-random trends in the data used in GOAP's correlation studies. GOAP
were therefore asked to consider the alternatives to its flow generation methodology. The various
estimates of the net 75% dependable inflow into SRSR that emerged from the alternative
methodologies is shown in Table 1 below.

The alternatives considered were: (a) use of data from upstream CWC gauging stations (Basar,
Mancharial,Yelli) in the 'free' catchment above SRSR to produce an inflow series; (b) extend the
derived 1950-1987 inflow series to 1994 using available SRSR data; and (c) compile an alternative
series for SRSP based on Nizamsagar Dam inflows for the period 1950-51 to 1989-90. The purpose of
these altemative computations was to determine whether the streamflow generation procedure used by
GOAP was robust. The Bank's consultant hydrologist (FAO) also undertook an independent evaluation
by using: (i) 28 years of daily streamflow data of upstream gauging stations and correlation with SRSR
inflows; and (ii) correlation with Nizamsagar dam inflows.

23.    GOAP prefers its standard inflow series giving a 75% dependable SRSR inflow estimate of
196.1 TMC (Table 1, column 1) and regard the other alternatives (Table 1, columns 2 & 3) as upper and
lower limits within the range of statistical error. Thus the standard 1950-1987 series is used in GOAP
simulation studies . The inflow series preferred by the Bank/FAO is the Nizamsagar Dam series (Table
1, column 5). This series has been used in some simulation modelling runs to provide an alternative
estimate of scheme reliability (Table 6).
24.    Total Surface Water Availability. Water for the Kakatiya Canal is obtained from the Lower
Mannair Dam (LMD) as well as SRSR. No processed discharge data (aside of a 4 year record) exists
for LMD: thus flows have been derived by correlation with actual records for the nearby Kaddam
Reservoir using rainfall-runoff relationships and the free catchment area between Upper and Lower
Mannair dams on the Mannair River. The 75% dependable annual inflow to LMD is calculated by
GOAP as 12.4 TMC (351 Mm3). The 75% dependable water availability for the overall scheme is
shown in Table 1 for alternative SRSR inflow estimates and a constant average monthly series is used
for LMD inflow in the SRSP simulation model.
C. Simulation Framework
Srisailam Reservoir Operation Model
25.    Simulation Model Components. The simulation model to determine how the 65,000 ha
SRBC command will succeed in competition with existing and future irrigation, hydroelectric and
water supply schemes, entailed definition of detailed reservoir and scheme operating rules, and scheme
water requirements. Thus, ongoing schemes (SRBC and TGP) and future projects (SLBC and
Hyderabad water supply augmentation) are regarded as being commissioned. The schemes included in
the model are shown in Figure 1. Upstream of Srisailam Reservoir, water is diverted to the Jurala and
KC Canal irrigation schemes. Water would be supplied from Srisailam Reservoir to the two power
stations, three new irrigation schemes (SRBC, TGP and SLBC) and the downstream existing irrigation
schemes. Tributary rivers below Srisailam Reservoir contribute water to the existing and proposed
downstream water demands. In addition to water and power, water supply for Madras is to be diverted
from the Srisailam Reservoir according to interstate agreements (para. 6), while Hyderabad supplies are
to be abstracted from the Nagarjunasagar Reservoir.
26.    Krishna Model Characteristics. A detailed simulation model was developed by ICADD that
took account of seasonal crop water demand, estimated reservoir evaporation losses, hydropower flow
requirements, reservoir operating rules and scheme supply priorities according to GOAP policy.
Fortnightly steps were used to obtain the basic scheme performance data used to for evaluation of
model performance. GOAP's priorities for water release at the Srisailam Reservoir were based on
ensuring urban water supply first, then meeting demand of existing schemes and firm power generation
commitments, followed by SRBC's allocation and lastly, new surplus water irrigation schemes. The
priorities are therefore: (i) Madras Water Supply; (ii) Nagarjunasagar and Prakasam Barrage irrigation
together with Hyderabad water supply augmentation and firm power commitments of Srisailam
Reservoir; (iii) SRBC irrigation; (iv) filling of Owk Reservoir; (v) Telegu Ganga Project; and (vi)
SLBC Project. The model's scheme and reservoir operating rules based on the above priorities are
quite complex and are related to reservoir storage levels. These rules are fully detailed in ICADD's
simulation study reportI. Detailed crop water demands that vary with seasonal climatic conditions are

modelled. Estimates of total fortnightly reservoir evaporation losses are deducted from all reservoirs in
the model.
27.    Analysis of Development Options and Scheme Performance. The principal development
options analysed to assess SRBC water supply reliability included: (a) inclusion or exclusion of the
Gorakullu Reservoir; (b) a reduced capacity Owk Reservoir; (c) impact of non-realisation of 8 TMC per
year water savings from rehabilitation of the KC Canal scheme; and (d) development of the SRBC
command area to 77,000 ha instead of 65,000 ha as proposed under AP II and AP III. Supply reliability
of each scheme was expressed as a percentage of the number of modelled years that modelled supply
fell short of its fortnightly water demand in any period. For irrigation projects, an the definition of
success included acceptance of cumulative annual shortfalls of 0.3-0.4 TMC. The total annual power
output for each hydroelectric plant was also computed to determine shortfalls created by alternative
development options.
28.    Reservoir Operating Levels.  In particular, the system  performance sensitivity to an
alternative Srisailam MDDL was modelled given the current tendency to draw down the reservoir in the
dry season in order to maximize power output. When the reservoir becomes a multi-purpose facility in
the future, such drawdown could cause late filling of the reservoir and delay or affect diversions for
Madras, SRBC and TGP.
29.    Reservoir Sedimentation Scenarios.  Various reservoir sedimentation scenarios were
modelled to determine the sensitivity of supply reliability and sustainability to loss of reservoir live
storage. The base case assumes reservoir live storage decreased by 50 years of sedimentation. Since
the Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar reservoirs were completed in the late 1 970s, this modelling
assumption simulates available storage during the economic lifetime of SRBC (i.e. the next 30 years).
Considerable analytical effort was devoted to establishing reservoir sedimentation volumes after 50
years of operation as only one reservoir survey undertaken in the early 1 980s is available. Calculations
are based on upstream river sediment gauging station data and on actual sedimentation rates for the
upstream Tungabadhra Reservoir (in Kamataka) over a 30 year period. As a result of the focus A series
of cross sections have been established at the Srisailam Reservoir so that sedimentation can be
systematically monitored once every five years as required by national guideleines.
30.   Irrigation Efficiency Planning Assumptions. A sensitivity test based on a range of irrigation
efficiencies from 56% to 40% have been modelled to determine water supply reliability to this key
parameter. ICADD optimistically selected a 56% irrigation efficiency in its SRBC planning studies
whereas Bank missions consider 40% to be a reasonable planning assumption.
31.    Sensitivity to Hydrological Series Length. The KWDT Krishna River flow series used
enables simulation of 87 years of scheme performance. Actual Srisailam inflows for the period 1972 to
1993 were added to this series in order to extend the modelling period and test sensitivity to series
length. However, this comparison is only an indicative one as data on actual abstractions by upstream
riparian states are not available to AP for post-KWDT period.  Accordingly, natural inflow is
approximated by adding KWDT sanctioned water allocations to existing upstream riparian schemes.

(modelled)
The SRSP simulation model includes two reservoirs (SRSR, LMD) and four irrigation commands.
These commands are Laxmi Canal, Saraswathi Canal, SRS irrigation (Kakatiya Canal above LMD up
to km 146) and LMD irrigation (Kakatiya Canal from LMD up to km 234 or up to km 284). The model
also considers the impact of the proposed Korutla Flood Flow Scheme to divert monsoon flood flows
from SRSR into a detention reservoir at Korutla via a canal instead of discharging floods downstream.
This scheme would operate once the SRSR water level reaches the reservoir Flood Release Level (FRL)
at elevation 1,091 feet.
33.    Water Delivery Priorities.  Water delivery priorities are placed within the context of
integrated operating rules for a range of water levels in each reservoir. These priorities are:
(i)    Water supply to the NTPC thermal power station from SRSR and urban water
supply from to LMD to Warangal and Karamnigar;
(ii)   Irrigation requirements for above LMD (from SRSR);
(iii)   Augmentation of to LMD storage from SRSR; and
(iv)   Irrigation below LMD from LMD storage.



Annex I
Page II of 19
Hydroelectric power is generated only when water is released into KKC from SRSR.
34.    Variation of Reservoir Operating Levels. The design operating levels for the two project
reservoirs are:
Sriramasagar Reservior
FRL (flood release level)                332.54 m (1,091 ft)
MDDL (minimum drawdown level)            322.48 m (1,058 ft)
Lower Mannair Dam
FRL (flood release level)                280.42 m (920.00 ft)
MDDL (minimum drawdown level)            275.85 m (905.00 ft)
The sensitivity of water supply perfornance to the SRSR MDDL was considered by running the model
with a SRSR MDDL of 1,034 ft (i.e. running the risk of a delay in filling the reservoir in the subsequent
monsoon season and thus possibly delaying the initiation of irrigation above LMD).
35.    LMD Storage Management Procedure.  Provision was made to review the balancing
capacity of LMD as a storage facility for surplus Godavari River inflow into SRSR and seasonal
irrigation below LMD. Under normal model conditions, LMD's reservoir is maintained at or near FRL
by releasing water from SRSR and conveying it to LMD provided all irrigation demands of KKC above
LMD can be met and canal conveyance capacity is adequate (para.4 1). Thus a series of simulation runs
were made whereby water is only released to LMD from SRSR when LMD levels are below its FRL
reservoir capacity.
36.   KKC Conveyance Capacity. The Kakatiya Canal's original design capacity up to km 146
was 8,500 cusecs (240.7 cumecs) but its current capacity is about 5,000 cusecs because of bed siltation
and broken lining. The project would increase the KKC cross-section to a capacity to 9,000 cusecs in
order to improve delivery of Godavari floodwater (which would otherwise spill from SRSR) to LMD
for seasonal storage. The simulation model uses existing and proposed KKC conveyance capacity to
determine the impact of the proposed capacity increase on SRSP water supply reliability and to model
its current restricted operational status.
37.    Sensitivity to Planning Uncertainties. Planning parameters were varied as in the Krishna
Basin model. Variations used in the model sensitivity analysis runs included: (a) higher than planned
water use in the command above LMD (b) water demand estimates computed by an altemative method;
(c) smaller water diversions in upstream riparian states; (d) use of the less bountiful SRSR inflow series
derived by FAO; and (e) alternative canal irrigation efficiency estimates.
38.    Sensitivity to Canal Irrigation Efficiency Estimates. The canal irrigation efficiency of
SRSP is low. The net area of 63,645 ha irrigated in 1992/93 (mainly for rice) utilized about 95 TMC
(i.e. about 85% of the project water allocation of 113 TMC planned to be used on 328,000 ha) with a
cropping intensity of about 112% (the project area cropping intensity is higher due to well and tank
irrigation). The 1992/93 gross water use is equivalent to an annual gross water application of about
3,773 mm of water per ha or about 6.6 times the GOAP's planned water duty of 572 mm/year/ha for
SRSP as a whole. The large apparent water use means that irrigation consisted of continuous flow
through rice paddies, with about one third of the residual flowing into village irrigation tanks to
supplement their rice cultivation, and about two thirds flowing into watercourses discharging into the
Godavari River and recharging the aquifer (and partly recycled by well irrigation to increase the



Annex 1
Page 12 of 19
overall irrigation efficiency of the command). Part of the problem stems from: (a) allowing rice
farmers to use water indiscriminately in the early years of project development; (b) the deficient
design of SRSP whereby--in many instances--water is directly supplied from a large canal to small
irrigation blocks through oversized outlets. Although design deficiencies are to be corrected under
the project, water supply to the below LMD command is dependent of the irrigation efficiency
achieved above LMD.
39.    Sensitivity to SRSR Sedimentation Rates. In order to derive a conservative estimate of
supply reliability, the simulation model was run using SRSR and LMD storage capacity reductions
equivalent to 50 years of sedimentation at a design catchment erosion rate of 1.2 acre-feet/sq. mile/year.
Accordingly, based on computations and revision of the reservoir area-capacity curve, the modelled
storage capacity for SRSR after 50 years of sedimentation was taken as 77 TMC at its FRL elevation
(instead of its initial capacity of 112 TMC). The sensitivity of scheme water supply reliability was also
tested by running the model using a SRSR capacity of 60 TMC, i.e. a forecast of residual storage after
75 years of sedimentation. The need for this sensitivity analysis arose out of the Bank's concern that
the design sedimentation rate may be too low when compared to the rate implied by analysis of the only
available 1984 reservoir hydrographic survey (i.e. at the time the SRSR spillway gates were installed).
Hence, particular importance was given to the issue of model sensitivity to reservoir sedimentation in
that it could affect water supply reliability in the later years of the project's economic life. Since GOAP
claimed that there were errors in its 1984 survey because too few reservoir cross-sections were used, it
commissioned the AP Engineering Research Laboratory to undertake an additional hydrographic survey
in 1994.
40.    The 1994 reservoir survey report concluded that SRSR storage capacity had reduced from 112
TMC to 90.3 TMC over a 24 year period, and its analysis implied an average annual sedimentation rate
of 1.0 acre-feet/sq. mile of free catchment/year. However, at appraisal in 1996, GOAP informed the
Bank that the original topographic survey used to derive SRSR's initial storage capacity of 112 TMC,
was found to be erroneous. Revised calculations indicated that the reservoir's initial volume was most
likely about 98.8 TMC. This meant that SRSR's 50 year volume was recomputed as 81 TMC. Since
this result is similar to the volume of 77 TMC used in modelling studies, GOAP saw no need to
undertake further model sensitivity tests. However, an independent analysis by the appraisal mission
hydrologist indicated that extrapolation of the 1994 survey results and the smaller initial capacity of
SRSR that the 50 year SRSR capacity could be as low as 67 TMC, i.e. almost the 75 year residual
storage value used by GOAP in its model. Thus particular attention is given to SRSR sedimentation in
the interpretation of model results and to execution of the SRSR catchment treatment plan included in
the proposed project's Environmental Management Plan component.
D. Krishna River Basin Model Results
Performance of Krishna River Basin Schemes
41.    Basin Performance. The success of the SRBC project in achieving 75% dependable water
supply (scheme success) was evaluated using the simulation model for the Krishna Basin. The standard
simulation case results indicate that--under full development without Gorakullu Reservoir--all schemes
modelled succeeded in achieving an acceptable requisite water supply reliability or power output (see
Table 3 below). Acceptability was defined as a reliability of 75% for irrigation schemes and over 95-
98% for urban water supply.

42.    SRBC is too small to affect existing schemes within the AP portion of the Krisha Basin. If
SRBC were not included in the basin development program, then average power output increases from
2390 GWh to 2435 GWh.: i.e., an additional 45 Million KWh of power is generated each year (1.9%
more). Model runs for the case without the SBRC scheme are not available, but a study that considered
the effect of not supplying the 8 TMC KC canal leakage water suggests that success rates would
increase in the order of 1% to about 5% for other schemes and uses.
43.    Implementation of Srisailam Reservoir Operating Rules. There is a risk that reservoir
operating rules will be breached in times of power shortages to the disadvantage of SRBC. For this
reason--and based on simulation model results--a Government Order has been issued which establishes
the reservoir MDDL at 834 feet and institutionalises the successful operating rules simulated in the
model. A Government Order has also been issued to reconstitute the Inter-Agency Committee for
Integrated Operation of the Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar Reservoirs into a standing "Committee for
Integrated Operation of Krishna and Pennar Basin Schemes" which is to meet seasonally to consider
water releases for multi-purpose uses for all schemes dependent on the Krishna River. Under these
Orders, (i) GOAP scheme water allocation priorities are preserved and non-firm hydroelectric power
generation at Srisailam is kept subservient to SRBC irrigation requirements and (ii), specific uniform
multi-purpose operating tables are to be derived for Srisailam Reservoir's power and irrigation
operation staff.
SRBC Water Supply Reliability Sensitivity Analysis
44.    Base Case Scenario. The SRBC success rate of 77.5% (Table 3) is 2.5% more than required
although it should be noted that this result is based on considering an delivery shortfall of 0.3 TMC (i.e.
less than 2% of crop demand) as a success. The base case modelled by GOAP is based on the following
key parameters: Srisailam Reservoir MDDL of 834 feet and reservoir capacity after 50 years of
sedimentation, irrigation efficiency of 56%, a 77,000 ha SRBC command area and no Gorakullu
Reservoir. The sensitivity analysis examined the impact of these key planning parameters.
45.    SRBC Sensitivity Analysis.  Sedimentation of the Srisailam Reservoir does not seem to
present a problem. Reducing the command area from almost 77,000 ha to 65,000 ha as planned for the
proposed project improved success by about 3% while adding the Gorakallu off-channel reservoir
improves scheme reliability by only 6%. In contrast, changing the MDDL to 796 feet (242.62 m)



Annex I
Page 14 of 19
instead of limiting drawdown to the design MDDL of 834 feet (254.20 m) produces an unacceptable
result in that the supply reliability drops to about 40-45%. If the reservoir is drawn down to an
elevation of 796 feet regularly (as it is at present for hydroelectric power generation) and not kept above
834 feet, then not only does the scheme fail year by year but the onset of the irrigation season would
sometimes be delayed. With only a small amount of off river storage at Owk Resevoir, there is total
reliance on the Srisailam reservoir for early supply. The Gorakallu Reservoir could provide some
seasonal flexibility but its cost-effectiveness is very much in doubt.
46.    Rabi season irrigation reliability is not seen as a problem provided the scheme is operated
according to the modelled water allocations. Using a realistic 40% scheme irrigation efficiency reduces
supply reliability to about 73% for the base case: however this is not of major concern because of the
command area has been reduced to 65,000 ha in the project design.
47.    Adherence to supply priorities according to the Srisailam Reservoir's proposed operating rules
is important because of the relatively high level of the SRBC canal intake level of 854 feet (260.30 m).
Priority of supply over TGP and SLBC is important to SRBC as shown by the model. If SLBC or TGP
get priority over SRBC outside their limited reservoir operating range (875 to 885 feet), then it is likely
that such a practice would not only affect SRBC performance but it would cause a delay in initiating
SRBC's irrigation season. If model scenarios and operating rules are adhered to, then the absence of
KC Canal water savings (8 TMC) is not a significant factor.
Appraisal Mission Assessment
48.    The findings of the GOAP Krishna Basin simulation model are sufficiently convincing that
water availability and supply reliability should not present unacceptable planning and operational risks
that could compromise the viability of the SRBC project design during its economic life. The model
evaluated scheme performance under conditions of full river basin development as sanctioned by the
KWDT, more realistic irrigation efficiency assumptions and allows for reduction in Srisailam
Reservoir's flow regulation capacity due to unavoidable sedimentation. The project design to be
completed under the proposed AP III project in itself includes: (a) a smaller command area to be served
by the original water allocation; (b) an a priori decision to ration water by Rotational Water Supply
under an "Irrigated Dry" localization; (c) some off-channel storage in the form of Owk Reservoir; and
(d) specific operating rules and formalized management arrangements for Srisailam Reservoir which
preserve SRBC and other irrigation interests.
49.    According to a formalized GOAP water allocation policy, SRBC is accorded a higher supply
priority than TGP (currently in the early stages of construction) and SLBC (whose construction has
hardly begun). Thus, if AP's surplus monsoon water use sanction is revoked by reconvening the
KWDT in the near future in favor of greater development by upstream riparian states, AP may still
adjust the water allocation to its uncompleted projects to meet SRBC needs.
E. Sriramasagar Project Model Results
GOAP Standard Scenario Outcome
50.   Irrigation. The water supply reliability of SRSP was evaluated by simulation in the same
manner as SRBC. GOAP's standard simulation scenario was based on the following key parameters: a
flow series having a 75% dependable flow of 196 TMC; a SRSR MDDL of 858 feet and a storage
capacity reduced to 77 TMC after 50 years of sedimentation; an assumed scheme irrigation efficiency



Annex I
Page 15 of 19
of 56%; irrigation below LMD up to km 284 of Kakatiya Canal; and a KKC capacity above LMD of
9,700 cusecs. The standard case gave a reliability of 85.4% for water delivery to the command above
LMD and 87.8% for the command below LMD: i.e., 10% to 12% more than the 75% reliability
required.
51.    Increasing the capacity of Kakatiya Canal is critical. If the Kakatiya canal is limited to 5000
cusecs and not 9,700 cusecs then none of the 41 years modelled meets irrigation demand below LMD
(0% success). It is clear that increasing KKC capacity as proposed is necessary to fill LMD reservoir
and maintain 75% dependable flow below LMD. It was also found that if KKC is not used to divert
water from SRSR whenever LMD falls to below 90% of its capacity, irrigation below LMD is badly
affected due to the limited storage capacity of LMD. Thus, upgrading the conveyance capacity of KKC
is essential to scheme success and is an integral part of the proposed project.
52.    A summary of the above results are given in Table 4 below.

Note   All the individual comparisons are the same in all aspects apart from the model component being

53.    Power Generation. Power generation at SRSR is incidental to irrigation as a matter of GOAP
policy: hence GOAP will not issue an Government Order to maintain the MDDL of SRSR at 1,058 feet.
In recent times when the SRS reservoir has been drawn down to 1,032 feet (314.55 m), there has been
considerable delay in releasing water for the first irrigation. One of the factors in the delay appears to



Annex [
Page 16 of 19
be that of trying as much as possible to release water via the power station which can only occur above
1058 feet.
General Sensitivity Analysis
54.   Planning Parameters. Reducing the command area to km 234 and the use of the latest FAO
methodology for crop water demand estimates increases- scheme success under the standard scenario by
about 3-5% and 7-8% respectively. On the other hand, a higher water demand reduces success by about
10-12%. Assuming a canal irrigation efficiency of 56%, FAO undertook a separate analysis of crop
water demand specifically allowing for: (a) irrigation scheduling using a Rotational Water Supply
system as per the project's proposed operating modalities; and (b) supplemental irrigation only in the
monsoon season. It was found that water demand could be up to 38% lower than assumed by GOAP
for the model. It is therefore estimated that if canal irrigation efficiency were reduced to 40% in FAO
computations, overestimation of water demand may only be about 20%. This could somewhat mitigate
the model's poor result when a canal irrigation efficiency assumption of 40% is used.
55.    Operational Parameters. Operating the SRSR Reservoir to MDDL 1034 feet increases
success by about 10% although initiation of irrigation on June 1 will usually be delayed, often through
into August. The model's performance was notably insensitive to the use of the Bank/FAG flow series
which only reduced standard scenario success by 3%. The SRSR capacity capacity to regulate inflows
is somewhat sensitive to storage reductions due to sedimentation, particularly for the SRS command
above LMD; however, the 75 year sedimentation scenario which is assumed to reduce storage to 60
TMC did not reduce supply reliability below 75%. The Korutla Scheme reduced success of the
standard scenario by 6%; however, if canal irrigation efficiency is less than 56%, this scheme would
have an adverse impact on SRSP performance.
Canal and Scheme Irrigation Efficiency Impact
56.   Canal Irrigation Efficiency. The SRSP project was found to be very sensitive to canal
irrigation efficiency assumptions, particularly if the command below LMD is extended to km 284 of
KKC. An efficiency level below 45% implies an unreliable supply below 75% if the command is
extended below km 234: at 40% efficiency, the reliability of supply below LMD up to km 284 was only
2%. Modification of the project design to rehabilitate the command below LMD up to km 234 only
resulted in a water supply reliability of about 60% and 54% above and below LMD respectively. This
result does not take account of: (a) the higher overall scheme irrigation efficiency achieved at present
and in the future by conjunctive use of groundwater and recycling of canal seepage losses; and (b)
possible water savings by reducing water deliveries in the monsoon season to supplemental irrigation
only.
57.   Impact of Groundwater Conjunctive Use on Scheme Efficiency. The simulation model
does not include allowance for groundwater recharge from canal seepage and its conjunctive use. There
are about 15,000 shallow wells with pump-sets above LMD and about 13,200 below LMD up to km
234. In addition there are about 14,200 bullock powered wells (mhotes) above LMD and about 4,950
below LMD. Pumped wells irrigate about I ha of rice in the monsoon season and about 0.45 ha of rice
or dry crop in the Rabi season; mhotes irrigate about 0.33 ha of rice in the monsoon season only.
Studies by the AP Groundwater Department suggest that recharge up to KKC's km 234 would be about
80 Mm3 year which is about 3% of the canal fed water.



Annex I
Page 17 of 19
58.   Analysis of groundwater potential for the post-project situation indicate that--with energization
of mhote wells and additional pumped wells--the increment in utilisable groundwater resources above
and below LMD (up to km 234) are about 223 Mm3 and 97 Mm3 respectively. This corresponds to
about 23,000 additional wells above LMD and about 9,000 wells below LMD, or a total number of
wells above and below LMD equal to about 42,400 and 22,000 respectively. Thus about 20-25% of
each command could be served by groundwater to make up for deficiencies in supply and cater for
supplementation of water supply to rice cultivators when rotational water supply is introduced.
Accordingly, even if canal irrigation efficiency would only be 40%, overall scheme irrigation efficiency
would be close to 75% (under the conditions assumed in the simulation model.
Appraisal Mission Assessment
59.    GOAP's simulation model results indicate that the AP II investment in extension of the
command beyond km 234 of KKC was not warranted as water supply would be extremely unreliable.
Accordingly, the Bank will not support further investment in the area except for redressal of the adverse
impacts of land acquisition under AP II. Since reduction cf SRSR storage capacity from about 90
TMC at present to 77 TMC (the 50 year sedimentation value) would take at least twenty years, a canal
irrigation efficiency of 40% would be mitigated by reservoir capacity and groundwater conjunctive use
to keep overall scheme efficiency at a 75% level. Thus, investment in rehabilitation of the command
below LMD up to km 234 is regarded as a reasonable project risk by the appraisal mission.

INDIA
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT PLAN
A. Overview
1.    Environmental Assessment Procedure. Under India's Environmental Protection Act of
1986 administered by the GOI Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF), the potential adverse
environmental impacts of any public investment project need to be analyzed and if found to be
significant in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), they need to be addressed in an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The review process includes a separate GOI Ministry of
Social Welfare review of potential adverse social impacts caused by population displacement in
general and adverse impacts on members of Scheduled Castes and tribes in particular. Albeit that a
State investment project may be cleared by the GOI Planning Commission as technically and
economically viable, capital expenditure may only begin if and when MOEF issues a general letter of
clearance of the EIA and EMP. A state government is to make the necessary budget provision to
carry out the EMP and its implementation is monitored by MOEF.
2.    Potential Environmental Impacts.  Five principal types of environmental impact are
potentially of concern in the development of SRBC and rehabilitation of SRSP. These impacts are:
(a) the potential for soil waterlogging and secondary salinization due to rise of the groundwater table
as a result of canal irrigation; (b) loss of reservoir storage through sedimentation caused by
watershed degradation; (c) increase in malaria and waterborne diseases; (d) loss of forest land due to
reservoir and canal construction; and (d) adverse impact on flora and fauna as a result of construction
of irrigation canals. Separate EIA studies analyzing the above potential impacts for SRBC and SRSP
were compiled by consultants and submitted to the Bank in May 1994 as part of the initial project
feasibility study. These studies were based on existing and new surveys of soils, land use, flora and
fauna, and on specialized groundwater monitoring investigations and analysis undertaken by
GOAP's Groundwater Department.
3.    Environmental Clearances. In order to receive national environmental clearance for the
project, GOAP prepared a Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan
for both SRBC and SRSP according to national guidelines in February/March 1995. The EMPs
included normal construction impact mitigation and monitoring irrigation impact required of any
well planned irrigation scheme. Prior to according its clearance, MOEF required that the EMPs
include several natural resource and nature conservation sub-components which would benefit the
sub-project districts. These interventions are not attributable to any adverse impact caused by
irrigation per se. Details of the proposed R&R Action Plan were also required. The EMPs were
cleared by MOEF in March 1996.
4.    No irreversible, diverse or complex adverse impacts were found by the MOEF review
committee in either of the sub-project command areas which would change the project's 'B'
environmental category rating accorded by the Bank. Given GOAP's obligation to carry out the
regional EMPs, they have been included as a monitorable investment under the project. A detailed
description of the project's EMP features are given below after a description of the project area and a
summary of groundwater and drainage analyses.

B. Geographical Features of the Project Areas
The Srisailam Right Branch Canal Sub-Project (SRBC)
5.    Location. The SRBC command area is located in the Kumool District of AP's Rayalaseema
Region within the Krishna River Basin and is situated along the west bank of the Kundu River, a
Krishna tributary (Map IBRD &&&). The command area is about 130 km long and 5-10 km wide,
with a cultivable command area (CCA) of 77,000 ha (Figure 1). The area became potentially
irrigable only after completion of the Srisailam Reservoir (IBRD Map 18843) on the Krishna River
in the late 1970s. This reservoir [live storage of 250 thousand million cubic feet (TMC)] was
originally designed for power generation.
6.    Climate, Drainage and Soils. Climate is temperate with hot summers and mild winters. The
average annual rainfall is 761 mm with nearly 71% falling from July to September and the remainder
between October and December. During 1901-1993, rainfall varied between 280 mm (in 1920) to
1,070 mm (in 1970) and droughts during the monsoon are common. The command has a flat
gradient of about 1:1,000 towards the Kundu river and is drained by numerous small streams. About
80% of the command area consists of deep Black Cotton soils with 83% of the soils falling into Land
Irrigability Class II.
7.    Demography. The area has a total population of about 286,000 living in 95 villages. The
average household size is 5 people. Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) comprise
about 28% and 2% of the total population respectively, while the majority belong to the Backward
Caste (artisans, servants and laborers) and Other Caste (landed) groups. Landowners comprise about
24% of the population.
8.    Land Tenure. The average farm size is 1.8 ha whereas 2 ha of rainfed land is regarded as a
"minimum economic holding" in AP. Land holdings are unequally distributed (Table 1). Marginal
farmers and small farmers having an average holding of 0.53 ha and 1.44 ha respectively, comprise
68% of the landowners but own only 26% of the land area. The medium and large farmers
comprising only 32% of landowners, own 74% of the land and have a average farm holding of 4.85
ha. Thus the predominant cropping pattern is determined by mainly by medium and large farmers.
9.    Agricultural Development. Rainfed crops predominate in the proposed command area with
the most important cash crops being sorghum, groundnut, tobacco, sunflower, coriander, cotton and
pulses. Because they are grown under rainfed conditions, average yields are low. There are about
2,650 wells irrigating about 3,650 ha during the monsoon (kharif) season and about 2,600 ha in the
post-monsoon (rabi) season. About 2,800 ha is irrigated by 14 irrigation tanks. In contrast, within
the Kurnool District there are about 150,000 ha irrigated by the Kurnool-Cuddapah (KC) Canal
Scheme on the east bank of the Kundu, wells and tanks. Seed, fertilizer and pesticide depots are
within a reasonable distance (less than 16 km) for about two thirds of the villages. Oil mills, rice
mills and other market and processing facilities are adequate and within reasonable distance of the
command area. About 32 villages are near (less than 16 km) veterinary hospitals and livestock
service units. Agricultural credit institutions such as Scheduled Banks, Grameena Banks and
Cooperative Credit Societies are plentiful in the area.
10.   Infrastructure. The population is relatively well served by social infrastructure. There are:
19 hospitals, dispensaries and primary health care centers; and 77 primary schools and 14 high
schools. Only 18 villages have tubewells while all other villages obtain potable water from open



Annex 2
Page 3 of 14
wells. All villages are electrified. The area is served by good road, bus and rail links to the rest of
the state and 72 villages are served by all weather feeder roads. There are post offices in 66 villages
although only 28 have telephones.
The Sriramasagar Sub-Project (SRSP)
11.   Location and Scope. The SRSP command is located in the Telengana Region of AP and
covers part of the Nizamsagar, Karimnagar and Warangal Districts (Map IBRD 18842). It is served
by the Sriramasagar Reservoir (SRSR) on the Godavari River near the Maharashtra State border. The
upper portion of the command (about 100,000 ha) served by the Kakatiya Canal (KKC) was
originally developed up to KKC's km 113 under the Bank-supported Pochampad Project. During the
late 1970s and early 1980s, GOAP extended the KKC up to km 234 near the town of Warangal to
create an irrigation potential of 323,000 ha (Figure 2). The works included construction of the
Lower Mannair Dam (LMD) across the Mannair River (a tributary of the Godavari River) at KKC's
km 146 near the town of Karimnagar. LMD augments SRSP water supply by capturing the runoff
from the Mannair River's free catchment and serve as a balancing reservoir for SRSR (i.e. to prevent
spillage of monsoon floodwaters at SRSR). The KKC and irrigation works below LMD were not
completed by GOAP when the SRSP sub-project AP II was appraised. Under the Second Andhra
Pradesh Irrigation Project, the KKC was to be completed to km 284 and its command extended by an
additional 34,000 ha.
12.   Climate Drainage and Soils. The climate is tropical with hot summers and dry winters.
The average rainfall varies from about 1,170 mm near SRSR to about 878 mm at Warangal (km 234
of KKC). There is marked inter-annual variation in rainfall and several consecutive years of drought
are not uncommon. The topography of the gross command area comprises of a series of valleys with
flat bottom lands which are separated by steep ridges and bare rock domes. The net to gross
command area ratio is therefore only about 50%. Drainage density is high and is generally northeast
to the Godavari River and streams have perennial base flows maintained by effluent discharge from
groundwater. About 60% of the command area consists of Black Cotton soils (Vertisols) while the
remainder are red Alfisols. A high clay content and relatively poor drainage is found only where
black soils overly sedimentary formations such as limestone. About 67% of the cultivable command
area is classified under Land Irrigability Class II while about 13% is classified as Class III.
13.   Population and Land Tenure.  The potential project area (587,000 ha) has a total
population is about 4.05 M, of which about 1.83 M live in the SRSP command area up to KKC's km
234. The farming population constitutes about 70%. The average holding size is 1. I ha. Marginal
farmers and small farmers having an average holding of 0.44 ha and 1.40 ha respectively, comprise
about 83% of the landowners but own 47% of the land area. The medium and large farmers
comprising 17% of landowners with an average holding of 3.8 ha.
14.    Agricultural Development. In the early 1990s, the net area irrigated by KKC was about
70,000 ha, while that irrigated by tanks and groundwater up to km 284 was about 30,000-40,000 ha
and about 90,000 ha respectively. During the kharif season, paddy is the preferred crop while pulses
are grown extensively. In the upper reaches of the command (above LMD) maize is an important
crop, while groundnut is preferred below LMD. Amongst the two-seasonal crops, large areas of
cotton and chilies are grown below LMD, while tumeric is favored above LMD. During the rabi
season, paddy followed by maize and groundnut are preferred above LMD; however, since there is
limited canal irrigation below LMD, groundnut is an important crop. The yields of irrigated crops
are above the state averages. Agricultural processing facilities for rice oil seeds and cotton are

adequate. Agricultural extension is provided by the Agriculture Department as well as private
fertilizer and pesticide suppliers.
15.   Industry and Infrastructure. The region is not industrially developed and there few
industries in the command area. There are some factories based on mining and forest products. The
main mineral resource is coal the Karimnagar District and hence two thermal power stations of 62
MW and 2,100 MW installed capacity each are located there. Aside of the 27 MW hydro capacity at
SRSR, some mini-hydro plants are being built on SRSP's larger canals. All important towns and
district headquarters are connected by good all-weather roads. Under the AP II project, 45 feeder
roads with a total length of 485 km were built connecting 112 villages to state roads.
C. Groundwater Build-Up Potential
SRBC Irrigation Development Impact
16.   Groundwater Development Potential.  The SRBC command is underlain by semi-
consolidated rocks of sedimentary origin such as quartzite, shale and limestone. They have a non-
uniform fracture porosity extending about 70 m deep and groundwater is utilized by about 1,890 dug
wells and tubewells irrigating only about 3,500 ha. Their yield is highly variable depending on local
geohydrological conditions and vary from that required to irrigate 0.5 ha/well to those capable of
irrigation about 4 ha/well. The Groundwater Department has undertaken intensive groundwater
monitoring since 1991 when a network of 137 observation wells was established. Water levels are
measured during fixed 10-day periods in January, April, June, August and October, and water quality
samples are taken in April and October. Under current conditions, water levels below the ground
surface are, for most of the area, deeper than 3 m--even in the post-monsoon period. The average
water table depth in the 1993 pre-monsoon period varied from 5.6 m below ground level (b.g.l.) in
block VII to 13.0 m b.g.l. in block IV. During the post-monsoon, water table depths b.g.l. reached
3.6 m in block IV and 9.83 m in block VII. The Kundu River serves a groundwater drainage
recipient for the area.
17.   Groundwater development is not financially feasible in about 70% of the gross command
area, even with large diameter hand dug wells which are pumped intermittently because of low well
yields. Thus, even allowing for additional recharge from canal seepage, the additional full
groundwater development possible in the 65,000 ha SRBC command area is only about 5,000 ha
served by about 2,500 additional wells each abstracting about 12,000 m3/year (gross). Thus the
overall area irrigated by conjunctive use of groundwater could at the very most be about 8,500 ha or
about 13% of the net command area.
18.   Potential for Groundwater Build-up. A forecast of future groundwater build-up with and
without groundwater development was made by the Groundwater Department on the basis of
increased recharge from irrigation and canal seepage. The groundwater rise over the 16 irrigation
blocks as a consequence of estimated incremental recharge varies from about 1.8 m to 4.9 m. The
post-monsoon water levels in the SRBC command are projected to be shallow (0.0 m to 1.9 m b.g.l.)
in blocks VI, VII, XII, XIII and XVI and deep in blocks III, IV and IX. With full groundwater
development, post-monsoon water levels would be 1.38 m to 8.8 m b.g.l. so that all groundwater
levels would be below 2 m except in blocks VI and VII. This static analysis is however regarded by
Bank missions as inaccurate or overly pessimistic as it does not consider increased drainage to the
Kundu River and adjacent lower groundwater as a result of the increased groundwater gradients
caused by water table rise.



Annex 2

19.   Although all canals are lined and the scheme is based on a rotational water supply and
irrigation, prevention measures such under-drainage of canals in some of the problematic blocks has
been included in the detailed designs. While water logged pockets could occur over time, they
would not preclude rice cultivation. The nearby Mylavaram and Kurnool-Cuddapah (K.C.) Canal
schemes located in areas with similar hydrogeological, pedological and geomorphological
characteristics were analyzed as indicators of waterlogging development.  In both schemes,
groundwater build-up has not been a problem. In particular, the K.C. Canal command can be
regarded as a surrogate for SRBC command area when the latter is irrigated. The K.C. Canal
command lies on the east bank of the Kundu River and is virtually a geomorphological mirror image
of SRBC except that it has been irrigated for over one hundred years. The pre-monsoon water depths
are in the range 3-9 m b.g.l. while post-monsoon water level depths range from 1.3 m to more than
5.0 m b.g.l. and the area of water table depths <2 m b.g.l. is small. There are no reports of secondary
soil salinization and crop yields are high (e.g. 5 tons/ha for paddy). Thus, the K.C. Canal scheme
indicates that serious groundwater drainage problems are not to be anticipated in SRBC.
20.   Groundwater Quality and Salinization Potential. An Electrical Conductivity (EC) map of
the SRBC command shows that most of the areas zoned for potential groundwater development have
groundwater with EC <2,250 umhos/cm and some have EC <750 umhos/cm. While the upper end of
this conductivity range is fairly high, farmers using groundwater do not report water quality as a
problem for cropping. Areas proposed for development around Owk Reservoir have EC values
>2,250 umhos/cm. Here some farmers report problems with cultivating paddy nurseries with poor
quality groundwater, but have no problems with the transplanted crop. Leaching requirement is
estimated at 17% and can be met from field application losses. It is therefore considered that, in
general, groundwater quality is not a serious constraint in SRBC command, particularly when it can
be used conjunctively with high quality Krishna water which has an EC of less than 500 umhos/cm.
Furthermore, as in the nearby Mylavaram scheme, recharge will tend to improve groundwater
quality. Alkaline hazard is also not anticipated as the Sodium Adsorption Ratio of both surface and
groundwater is generally less than 4.
SRSP Irrigation Development Impact
21.   Hydrogeology and Well Yields.  Groundwater generally occurs under water-table
conditions. Large diameter dug-wells are the most common means of its abstraction although dug-
cum-tubewells are also found. The potential of the aquifers is generally limited. The yield of dug-
wells varies from 40-150 m3/day in consolidated rocks, 25-100 m3/hour with a 1.5-30 m drawdown
in semi-consolidated rocks, and about 90-180 m3/hour in alluvium along the Godavari river.
Whereas the latter are capable of continuous pumping, dugwells generally sustain pumping for more
than 2-4 hours/day: thus most dug-wells generally irrigate only 1-2 ha. The average net area
provided with supplementary groundwater irrigation during the monsoon is about 1.4 ha. Smaller
wells powered by bullocks to lift a large bucket device ("mhotes") can provide supplementary
irrigation to about 0.3 ha of monsoon paddy.
22.   Detailed hydrogeological surveys of the area immediately below LMD (down to distributary
D13) indicates that well yields are 30-50 m3/day in the rabi season and 50-100 m 3/day in the
monsoon season. The Groundwater Department estimates that the rabi season well yields can be
expected to improve when canal irrigation becomes widespread and regular as a result of the
rehabilitation works to be undertaken by the project. Above LMD, there are about 19,500 pumped
wells and about 14,220 mhotes; below LMD up to km 234 of KKC, there are about 13,200 pumped



Annex 2
Page 6 of 14
wells and about 4,950 mhotes. Thus the net project area irrigated above and below LMD is about
31,560 ha and 19,965 ha respectively. The current groundwater potential of the whole command area
(up to km 284) is about 24 TMC; this could increase by about 10% if the whole are were to be
irrigated. Water balance computations indicate that, with conversion of mhotes to pumped wells, a
pumped well increment of about 23,000 and 9,000 pumped wells can be installed above LMD and
below LMD respectively.
23.   Potential for Groundwater Drainage Problems. Intensive groundwater monitoring is
undertaken by the Groundwater Department. In the command above LMD there are 365 observation
wells monitoring a net area of about 294,000 ha; below LMD there are 239 observation wells of
which 115 monitor the command up to km 234 of KKC while the remainder monitor the area up to
km 284. Water levels are monitored five times a year while water samples are taken twice in April
and October. In the command above LMD, the pre-monsoon water table build-up has averaged 0.22-
0.27 m/year with a higher rise in canal head reaches because of their excessive water use. Currently,
above LMD, the gross area with a water table within 3 m of the ground during April is about 37,000
ha; about half of this area (less than 10% of the gross area) has pockets with a water table between 0-
2 m b.g.l.
24.    The Groundwater Department prepared a forecast the potential for waterlogging due to a
rise in the groundwater table as a result of increased recharge due to rehabilitation of the command to
km 234 of KKC. Assuming a uniform spread of the additional recharge and its retention in aquifer
storage, water table maps were prepared. The post-monsoon (October) map forecasts only small
pockets with water tables at less than 2 m b.g.l. The methodology was similar to that used for SRBC
and is therefore unconvincing because of the neglect of natural drainage to the Godavari River as it is
unreal to assume that all, or even a large proportion of incremental recharge will be retained in
storage. The Bank mission assessment is that significant problems of groundwater drainage and
adverse waterlogging will not develop in the project area even if groundwater development proves to
be lower than that assumed at full development. The natural groundwater drainage conditions will
prevent major long-term increases in permanent groundwater storage. The development of of
significant areas of shallow water tables will be confined to the valley bottoms and will not be
detrimental to the paddy crop which occupies most of such areas now and will most likely continue
to do so in the future.
25.    Groundwater Quality and Secondary Salinization. The EC maps of April 1993 show that
more than 90% of the area in the gross command area down to LMD is underlain with groundwater
with EC<1,500 umhos/cm and most is EC<750 umhos/cm. The small areas with EC>1,500
umhos/cm roughly correlate with shallow water table areas in the same month, implying that there
may be a relationship between salt concentration and depth below the water table. This situation
persists into the post-monsoon of October 1993. However, the areas underlain by water with
EC<3,000 umhos/cm are very small. They could well be related to pockets of constrained drainage
coupled with shallow water tables. They do not have significance in an area which has been
irrigated for up to 20 years. The command area below LMD shows a similar groundwater quality
pattern with small pockets of EC<2,250 umhos/cm which, in general, relate to relatively shallow
water table areas. It is noteworthy that this area has received little or no canal irrigation and that they
are situated in valley bottoms occupied by the commands of very old tanks. It is concluded that
secondary salinization is very unlikely and that leaching by rains and irrigation will prevent a

progressive build-up of salinity in the soil, albeit that a very slow decline of groundwater quality may
occur.
D. Irrigation of Black Cotton Soils
Crop Root Zone Drainage Analysis
26.    The Problem. Despite the small likelihood of major regional water table rise in SRBC and
SRSP, there could be concern about the natural drainage of Black Cotton Soils having low
permeability at a depth of 150-180 cm b.g.l. and the likelihood of crop yield reduction due to
seasonal perched water tables above this semi-impermeable layer. An early pedological survey of
the SRBC command found some signs of such a layer in Black Cotton soils. They could also exist in
some of the Black Cotton soils of SRSP which have a limestone parent material. Consequently,
FAO experts considered it important to assess whether the proposed RWS irrigation regime could
give rise to seasonal perched water tables and even salinization of the crop root zone.
27.    Drainage Simulation Models. One of the major difficulties in estimation of water (and
salt) drainage out of the root zone (up to 2 m b.g.l.) is allowance for water drawn into the atmosphere
by crop transpiration and direct evaporation. A mathematical model that simulates water flow, salt
transport, plant water uptake and crop yield was used by FAO to evaluate transpiration, evaporation,
drainage and water table depth as a function of crop type, soil hydraulic properties and potential
evapotranspiration demand. The key parameter of this model is the soil's unsaturated hydraulic
conductivity as a function of soil moisture content. This function was determined in the field for
SRBC and SRSP black and red soils using a simple and quick method. The simulation studies used
average monthly precipitation and Class A evaporation data. The crops simulated were corn,
sunflower and groundnut. The time for germination and time to reach full crop canopy were used to
differentiate between potential evaporation and actual transpiration at different crop growth stages.
28.    The study concluded that under normal rates of groundwater drainage prevalent in the SRBC
command (about 6 mm/day) and for water tables at 6 m b.g.l. or more, no annual accumulation of
aquifer storage and waterlogging of the root zone would occur under the proposed irrigation regime.
Similarly, no salinity problems are expected. However where an impervious layer exists with a
permeability of about 2 mm/day, it was found that waterlogging could develop in 8 to 15 years. It is
therefore important to monitor water tables, especially where subsurface drainage may be slow so
that appropriate measures may be taken if pockets of waterlogging develop. Large areas of perched
water table are not expected because of the self-mulching attributes of black soils.
Local Irrigation Practices
29.    The above findings induced FAO experts to look carefully at irrigation practices on Black
Cotton (Vertisol) soils in the K.C. Canal command adjacent to the proposed SRBC command area.
Field observations and discussions with farmers and agricultural department staff showed
conclusively that farmers understand and use furrow irrigation for cash crops (e.g. cotton and
chillies) and are also conversant with the practice of irrigation scheduling (i.e. appreciate the need to
supply water to crops as and when needed). The soils allow farmers in many places to grow rice
alongside and surrounded by "dry" crops; however there is an increase in the amount of rice grown
in low-lying lands. It was concluded that farmers in the area have a good understanding of irrigation
of clay soils; it is clear from their observations that they understand the problems caused by over-
irrigation and schedule their irrigation to avoid ponding of water and crop damage. To a great



Annex 2
Page 8 of 14
extent, the Black Cotton soils provide a suitable environment for irrigation since their uptake of
water can easily be observed and guide farmers' irrigation practices.
E. Environmental Management Plan
Compensatory Afforestation
30.    This EMP component is required in order to complete mandatory replacement of
government forest land areas utilized for the construction of canals prior to the proposed project. For
SRSP, this envisages completion of afforestation of 289 ha of degraded lands in the foreshore of the
Sriramasagar reservoir. In SRBC, an area of 885 ha will be reforested in the Kurnool district even
though only 149 ha of forest land would have been diverted for the sub-project at its current scope.
About 736 ha of forest land may be diverted in future if the Gorakullu Reservoir is constructed.
However, since clearance of this compensatory afforestation was requested and cleared for
immediate transfer to the State Forest Department in 1994, it would be undertaken under the project
since the rehabilitated lands are to serve as a source of timber, fuel and fodder for local villages and
alleviate the pressure on dwindling forest resources. The already identified degraded areas are to be
planted with suitable tree species and protected with cost-effective structural and non-structural soil
and water conservation measures. Various planting models were initially identified by the State
Forest Department and provision made for implementation infrastructure, nurseries etc. These
models have been modified for implementation by the Forest Development Corporation (FDC).
SRBC Eco-Restoration and Degraded Forest Improvement Program
31.    Development Impact. A detailed investigation of the flora and fauna along the alignment of
the main canal and within the command area of SRBC was undertaken by the State Forest
Department, the Zoological Survey of India and Society for Conservation and Management of
Natural Resources. It was found that the SRBC main canal would serve as a natural protective
barrier for the mammalian wild fauna in the reserve forests and hilly areas to its west and thus
facilitate their conservation. The provision of cross-drainage structures at all streams and springs
prevent any disruption of natural runoff in the command area and thus its fauna and flora are not
affected. At Rollapadu, the canal passes within 3 km of the Great Indian Bustard (Choriotis
nigriceps) bird sanctuary but would not have an adverse impact: in fact, its water would benefit all
terrestrial and aquatic birds. Within the command area, it is anticipated that irrigation would change
the dryland habitat, increase the cultivated area and, over time with increasing population, create
some pressure on forest resources.
32.    Mitigation Measures.  In order to ensure protect wildlife and forest resources from
developmental pressures, the following mitigation measures would be supported under the project:
(a) Degraded Area Development in Reserve Forests. In order to improve barren degraded areas of
thorny dry scrub species totaling 800 ha in five reserve forests near the command area, several
treatment models have been proposed involving gap planting, nursery pasture plots, agave
plantation, vegetative strips and soil and water conservation measures. The latter works will
include 100 percolation tanks within these and other reserve forests. The selected treatment mix
would depend on soil, slope and canopy cover of the treated area. In addition, another 300 ha of
degraded area outside the forest reserves would be planted with local species. A joint forestry
management approach was not been adopted for the treatment models as the treated areas are on



Annex 2
Page 9 of 14
remote government land far from villages, and are to be managed and harvested by the FDC to
gain revenue for project maintenance.
(b) Canal Bank Plantation. In selected stretches totaling 35 km along the main canal near reserve
forests, a double row of trees and will be planted to consolidate canal banks and serve as a partial
barrier to wildlife access. About 50% of the trees would be harvestable varieties such a Neem,
fruits etc. while the rest would be large canopy shade trees.
(c) Environmental Education Centers. Two well-equipped environmental education centers based
on the theme of water resources development and conservation are proposed near the command
area for public education purposes. The existing education center at the Rollapadu Bird
Sanctuary is also to be upgraded with models, exhibits, a library and four tourist suites. This
improvement would be part of an environmental awareness campaign related to grassland
ecology and endangered species such as the Great Indian Bustard.
(d) Nutritive Fodder Plots and Animal Watering. In order to reduce pressure on the pasture grass in
the reserve forests, 20 fodder plots of 2 ha each for wild herbivores will be developed with
irrigation water facilities for the dry season. In the degraded areas and on the fringes of reserve
forests near high priority villages, 100 ha of nutritive fodder plots will be developed to reduce
competition between cattle and wild herbivores. Saucer pits and check dam water holes will be
built in gullies and eroded depressions of the degraded areas for wildlife watering. In the priority
villages on the forest reserve fringes, breached tanks will be repaired and cattle watering
facilities provided.
(e) Environmental Monitoring and Anti-Poaching Units. A fully equipped monitoring and research
unit is to be established at the Rollapadu environmental education center to monitor the efficacy
of the environmental program. Three motorized anti-poaching vigilance squads are to be
established to protect forest wildlife.
SRSP Eco-Restoration Program
33.   Possible Impact. A detailed investigation of the flora and fauna along the alignment of the
main canal and within the command area of SRBC was undertaken by the State Forest Department,
the Zoological Survey of India and Society for Conservation and Management of Natural Resources.
The resultant program concentrates on district eco-restoration activities and safeguards in the area
below LMD inclusive of the new command below km 234 of KKC. The new command is not
funded under the project and borders on the Pakhal Wildlife Sanctuary which contains a population
of about 11 tigers.
The mitigation program components include:
(a) Degraded Forest Rehabilitation. Degraded areas totaling 1000 ha within 9 blocks of the 21,135
ha forest reserve area will be improved along the same lines as in SRBC.
(b) Canal Bank Plantation. This would be similar to SRBC for a length of 150 km.
(c) Development of LMD Bird Sanctuary. The 17 sq.km reservoir and foreshore vegetation area
would be declared a bird sanctuary in view of the many species of local aquatic and winter
migratory birds now supported by the water body. Investments required include: (i) demarcation



Annex 2
Page 10 of 14
surveys, biological inventory survey and preparation of a sanctuary management plan; (ii)
planting of 50 ha of Babul and Barringtonia saplings; (iii) construction of viewing towers,
shelters and staff buildings; (iv) equipment and staff. Two flora and fauna vigilance parties
would be established and equipped. Artisanal reservoir fishing is controlled by issue of Fisheries
Department licenses and would not interfere with the bird sanctuary situated on islands and the
foreshore. The existing fish seed farm would be expanded to include 20 nursery ponds, breeder
pond, seed parking hall and Chinese hatchery.
(d) Development of LMD Deer Park and Environmental Education Center. A recreational garden,
playground, aviary, water fowl pond and moated deer park would be established at LMD to cater
to the population of Karimnagar town. The park would contain a landscaped Environmental
Education Center building housing a library, auditorium and museum The center would be
equipped for educational exhibits, audio-visual and interactive displays.
(e) Pakhal Wildlife Sanctuary Improvement. In order to monitor and control the pressure on the
sanctuary area, two vigilance parties would be established and provided with buildings, transport
and communication equipment. Habitat improvement works would be built such as: (i)
boundary demarcation barricades, cattle-proof trenches, etc.; (ii) repairs and improvements of
animal water and fodder sources; and (iii) soil and water conservation works in degraded areas.
To reduce pressure on the sanctuary, a village eco-development program would be supported in
four selected villages. This program includes: livestock improvement and development of
fodder plots and watering facilities; provision of alternative energy sources; and income
generation schemes.  The details of this program, including the process of beneficiary
involvement in its formulation, are not yet available.
(f) Monitoring and Research. Incremental staff will be hired for a scientific unit to monitor the eco-
restoration program and will be provided with facilities and equipment in Karimnagar.
Catchment Area Treatment Program
34.    The AP Remote Sensing Applications Center has prepared catchment area treatment plans
(CATPs) based on collateral remote sensing data to reduce sediment inflow into the Srisailam and
Owk reservoirs serving SRBC and for the Sriramasagar and LMD reservoirs in SRSP. The land use
and cover of the watersheds comprising the free catchment (i.e. below upstream reservoirs) of each
reservoir has been analyzed to compute their sediment yield index and determine their treatment
priority. The CATPs include vegetative and structural soil conservation measures for all watersheds
having a high priority for soil erosion reduction. These measures include: (a) land protection using
afforestation, silvipasture and agroforestry treatment models for various categories of land type with
emphasis on degraded areas; (b) gully control works (rockfill and check dams) with vegetative
measures to arrest silt flow; and (c) greenbelt plantation with commercially viable trees along
reservoir foreshores, together with vegetative barriers and soil conservation structures where
necessary. The limited area treatment of the Sriramasagar reservoir catchment (1,104 ha and 129 silt
arresting tanks) derives from it being a supplement to ongoing government programs which have
already treated about 18,000 ha out of 45,000 ha.
The overall program of catchment treatment to be funded under the project is is summarized
in the table below:

Agroforestry Extension
35.    MOEF has stipulated that the command areas should have a mobile extension unit to
disseminate agroforestry techniques. A distribution target of 100,000 teak stumps and 20,000
assorted fruit tree seedlings every year for five years in SRBC and SRSP has been set for this
program. The seedlings will be distributed by mobile extension units established for this purpose.
Environmental Health Program
36.    A baseline survey of health care delivery capacity was conducted by the State Health
Directorate in 120 villages of the new command area of SRBC. The project will support a limited
environmental health program against water-bome and other diseases in each sub-project. This
includes: (a) immunization of 13,600 susceptible children against Japanese Encephalitis; (b)
distribution of chlorine tablets for pot chlorination and bleaching powder for protection of village
water supplies; (c) anti-malaria spraying in villages; (d) additional stores of drugs, disinfectants,
nutrients and X-ray film for primary health care clinics and hospitals in the command areas in order
to cope with the additional load of the project's transient laborers and workers during the
construction period; (e) a fully equipped mobile medical team and vehicle-cum-ambulance to visit
labor camps and provide treatment of minor ailments; and (f) establishment of a dispensary in SRSP.
Restoration after Construction
37.    Restoration of construction sites is included in the technical specifications of all construction
contracts as a contractual responsibility: hence a special financial provision is not required. This
includes treatment of borrow areas, muck stabilization during canal construction etc. For Owk
Tunnel in SRBC, the design provides for suitable disposal and stabilization of tunnel spoil.
Groundwater Development Program



Annex 2
Page 12 of 14
38.   SRBC Groundwater Monitoring Studies. Provision has been made in the EMP for 8
professional Groundwater Department staff to monitor groundwater levels and quality and to plan
the promotion of conjunctive use to mitigate any waterlogging tendencies that may arise. This effort
would continue for the duration of the project.
39.   SRSP Groundwater Development Program. In addition to continuation of the ongoing
groundwater monitoring program, the EMP has made provision for GOAP assistance to promote
construction of 12,610 new wells and energization of 19,173 mhotes over a five year period. This
program would not only mitigate local waterlogging if it occurs, but also facilitate adjustment of rice
cultivators to RWS by enabling supplementation of intermittent canal flows from well supplies. The
total cost of over Rs, 1,514 million would be covered as follows: a 25% GOAP subsidy, a 15% equity
contribution from farmers, and 60% as credit from financial institutions such as NARBARD,
Scheduled Caste Corporation, District Rural Development Authority and banks. GOAP has issued
instructions to all District Collectors to extend all facilities to farmers available through normal
district well programs. The AP State Electricity Board is taking steps to improve power supplies.
The Bank/IDA does not provide any support for this well construction program under the project as
agricultural power tariffs are below national guideline norms of Rs.0.5 per kwh.
SRSP Environmental Monitoring Program
40.   An environmental monitoring program will be carried out in the SRSP command as follows:
Water .Qualiy. Surface and groundwater quality twice a year by the Groundwater Department.
-  SoiL. Soil characteristics such as conductivity, pH, salinity and texture will be sampled once
every three years; in areas prone to waterlogging, sampling will be carried out annually. The
implementing agency will be the soil conservation units of the Agriculture Department.
- Land Use. Post-construction monitoring will indicate status of borrow pits, temporary camp
sites, landfill sites, waste dumps. etc. The change in land use pattern will be monitored once
every five years using satellite imagery. The implementing agency will be the AP State Remote
Sensing Application Center.
*  Erosion and Siltation.  The Agriculture Department will monitor water sediment load,
effectiveness of soil conservation measures and erosion of canal bank spoil. In addition, ICADD
will undertake a reservoir sedimentation survey of Sriramasagar and Lower Mannair reservoirs
as part of the Dam Safety Component.
*  Spread of Aquatic Weeds. The Agriculture Department will monitor the density and problem
areas of aquatic weeds and the effectiveness of weed control measures.
*  Trends in Incidence of Water-Related Diseases. The Medical & Health Department will monitor
trends in water-borne and related diseases and the adequacy of local curative and vector control
measures.
The above program will be monitored by an Environmental Cell in the PPMU. Progress will be
reviewed by project-level and state-level environmental committees constituted by Government
Order in February 1993.

POLICY ON FArtMERS' PARTICIPATION IN InnIGATION MANAGEMENT
1ltic State ol AndIinz a I Piandsh I has itivestcd lairge  i nlouilts or Its scalce linaticial
resources to creat surface irrigation schiemes. The net Irrigation potential created thus
far is 6.4 M ha. Inispitc of Ithis largo effcrt, statistics stiow ttiat only about 4.3 M ha or
67% of the potcntial created Is utilized thus leavIng a gap of about 2.1 M ha. or 33%
unutilized. Some of the main reasons fcr this gap are the non-complaince of farmers
to the designed cropping pattern, the poor conditions of the irrigation systems, and
the lack of operational plans. In addition to this gap, water distribution within the
command areas is often neither reliable nor equitable wvith large differences in water
availability betvween tlie hiead and tail end of irrigation canals.
Irrigation & CAD Dept., has attempted to remedy this situation through various
measures among v.'hich are the rehabilitation of the distribution networks, the
introduction  of rotationlal watcr supply  based  on  structured  systems and  the
promulgation of tihe AP Irrigation Utilization and Command Area Development Act,
1984 authorizina tile creation of Command Area Devolopment Authorities (CAD) and
the formation of Pipe Committees. Though some improvements wvere noted, much
of the disorders noted previously continue and none of these initiatives have really
proved to bc fully sustainable. Thc failurc is mostly due to a top-down approach to
irrigation planning and managemenlt without adequate consullation with farmers.
Inr vicw or thc above difficulties, thie Irrigation & CAD lhas initaited a pilot program
involving farmers participation in irrigation management at the minor level.  This
progrem was carried out with some success with thie essistance of an NGO In
D64 of SRSP. Based on field observations, the IU & CAD Act legalizino farmers
organisations, and the experience of t!he pilt program, the GOAP would like to
develop a new approach to water manacemcnt. The new approach woulld be based
on participalory irrigation management tllroughi thie creation of Farmers Organisations.
It is proposcd to iiriplrcinncti this ncw approach first undicr lie proposed AP.111 Project
in the SRBC and SRSP commanids. THe salient features of the management policy
are as follows:
1. The farmers in the command of the projects will be encouraged to form Water
Users' Associationis to operate and nianage irrigation systems in thieir respective
area;
2. Irrigation system  upto minor level ccnsisting normally of an ayacut of 400 to
750 ha. v,ill bc placed under thie management of the respective Water Users'
Association under a rnemorandum  of understanding w;ith thie Department. The
enidcavour shall be to hiave prcfcrab!ly not niore than onc WUA in a Revenue
villagc.

3. The Water Uscrs' Associations will be autoriomous bodics whiich will furiction on
democratic principlcs n ld thieir aflalrs will be subjcct lo audit by prolessionals.
Tiho WUA will bo goverted une(or bye-liws to bo fiarncd unider tihe IU & CAD
Act;
4. The endeavour of tthe Department will be to give increasing responsibility of
managing irrigation systems to WUAs and for the purpose it will:
i) make available assured and reliable water at the head of minor;
ii) Undertake rehabilitation and modernisation of the internal water distribution
system whierevcr WUAs are formed;
iii) facilitate fixation and collection of operation and maintenance charges from
water users.
5. Ttic WUA will bc at liberty to regulate distribution of water to tlhe water uscrs on
volumetric or any other basis and to leavy and collect panalities if any, Fixed by
it for violation of the water distribution schieme linalised for tile irrigation system
under its administreaive supcrvision;
6. By improving cflicicncy of the irrigation system  the WUAs will bc at liberty to
save water and make the water so saved available to users on payment;
7. The IU&CAD Act vwill be suitably amended to provide for tile formation of WUAs
and to give suitable incentives for thier promotion;

FARMERS ASSOCIATIONS.
One of the major causes for the inefficient management of water resources is that there is
very little or no involvement of farmers in the management of the irrigation system. As a result
the supply of water to farmers is often unreliable, at variance with their needs, inequities
unsustainable and inefficient.
The situation is sought to be remedied substantially if farmers are actively involved in
the management of the irrigation system. the Ministry of Water Resources had urged the state
governments to set up farmers associations and issued guidelines as early as 1987.
Government of India have now decided to channel the plan allocations for CAD
Programme directly through the CAD Boards to the Farmers Associations to make them
responsive and accountable. In Andhra Pradesh a number of Farmers Associations ( Pipe
Committees) were formed in 1980's. However there has been slackening of pace in the 1990's.
Moreover, Some of the committees formed earlier have now become defunct. therefore the GOI
have felt that there is a need to form Farmers Associations in the State.
In His Letter, Minister of Water Resources , has conveyed that hereafter the Union
Government and the State Government should release funds to be utilised by  Farmers
Associations directly by the CAD Boards. He has also requested that the State Government
should immediately initiate steps to constitute Farmers Associations, CAD Boards and CAD
Council.
The Various Steps involved in thle formation of tlte Farmers Associations is listed
below:
1. Identify the Hydraulic Unit for which the FA is to be formed(Outlet, Minor, Branch). It
could be preferably be the minor, because of homogeneity andfinancial viability.
2. Motivate the farmer in order to, decide who should be Incharge of this crucial work &
involve NGO's and WALMI's.
3. Reach Agreement among a minimum of fifty-one percent of land holders of land in the
command for formation of FA.
4. Decide the Act under which to register the Association/Society(Co-operative/Registn of
Societies Act/Companies Act.)
5. Draft bye-laws of Association. Bye-laws should be in accordance with the objective of
Participatory Irrigation Management.
6. Undertake Joint Inspection of the system by FA's, Irrigation Department and CADA

COMMAND AREA DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME.
The command Area Development Programme was started in 1972 solely with the
aim of a systematic development of the command areas by making provision for field
channels, equitable distribution of water to farmers, land levelling and shaping, field
drains along with scientific crop planning, streamlining of supply of other inputs like high
yielding'variety seeds, -fertilisers, herbicides including short term credit, extension service
support and other infrastructures like roads, market, storage etc.
the components of the Comm-and Area Development Programme are as follows:
1. On Farm Development.
a. Development offield channels andfield drains within the command of
each outlet.                       .,
b. Land levelling, on an outlet command basis.
c. Realignment offield boundaries, wvherever necessary.
d. Enforcement of a proper system of warabandi andfair distribution of
water to individualfields.
e. Supply of all input and services, including credit and
f. Strengthening of extension services.

Sriramasaqar  Froject  (SRSF)  was  or iginally
conceived   and   constr-ucted   for  developing
backwat-d Telanarana area.   In SRSF' one third
area in the command was planned for paddy
(wet) dtring K"harif and about two thirds area
for ID durino Rabi.  This has led to unequtal
allocation and haphazard distribLttion of canal
waters.
Dur-irig oper-ation of the system in the last two
decades,  the  farmers  particularly  in  head
r-eaches of the distributories and minot-s drew
continuious water su1pply and grew wet cr-ops in
areas localized for ID deptiving the tail
enders of their legitimate share o-F water.
ConseqLuently even though irrigation potential
created in SRSP is 2.5 laIkh ha in Stage-I. the
area actLually ir-rigated is reported to be 1.2
to 1.3 lakh ha i.e. only about 5CI per cent of
potential created.   It is also r-epor-ted that
full  quantum  of water  meant to  serve  the

units will be created under the Special Collectors, the Land Acquisitin
Unit and Rehabilitation Unit to be headed respectively by the Lnd
Acquisition Officers and Rehabilitation Officers. The Rehabilitation
Unit will be staffed with full-time R&R officers. NGOs will be engaged
on a long-term basis to assist R&R officers in the Land Acquisition Unit
and the Rehabilitation Unit to implement the RAPs in the field. The
GOAP issued Negotiations Committee Rules in 1992, stipulating the
constitution of Negotiation Committees and procedures for negotiated
compensation with the affected persons.
4. Village R&R Committees (VRCY will be formed in the affected
villages with the help of NGOs and R&R officers in an effort to
promote PAPs participation in R&R activities implementation. The
VRC will be represented by members from each caste community i.e.
scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, backward caste, other castes and
women. in each revenue village. The VRCs will be actively involved
and fully participate in formulating Village Rehabilitation Action Plans
(VAP), facilitating PAPs participation and consultation, implementation
of the VAPs and monitoring of R&R progress. They will work closely
with NGOs and R&R officers.
B    Project          Detailed baseline socioeconomic surveys have been conducted for the
Socioeconomic   project by experienced consultants. The surveys covered the full
Survey           inventories of PAPs, tenants, sharecroppers and their socioeconomic
profile, household characteristics, full resources bases, impact of land
loss on incomes. The surveys have also identified the functionally
landless PAPs and have brought up grievances of PAPs due to the
completed land acquisition, such as bifurcation of land, uneconomic
status of remaining holdings etc. The surveys involved active
participation of PAPs and community leaders.
C Legal          Government of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) takes the Land Acquisition Act
Framework and  of 1894, as amended in 1984, as the basis for determining land
R&R Policy       compensation. Since early 1995, GOAP started to work on an AP III
resettlement and rehabilitation policy consistent with the Bank's
Operation Directive on involuntary resettlement. The agreed policy
with the Bank has been translated into local language and disseminated
among PAPs. The policy provides a legal framework for defining
project affected persons, their rights and entitlements, involvement of
non-government organizations and affected people, project R&R
structure, grievance procedures.
D    R& R Action      GOAP prepared, on the basis of the socioeconomic surveys and the
Plan             agreed R&R Policy for AP III, RAPs for SRS Component, SRBC
Preparation      Component, Srisailam Retrofit and Lower Manair Retrofit.

H    AP II Retrofit   The consultant carried out the survey in the resettlements and, on the
basis of the survey, prepared action plans for the retrofit.
The survey has identified and the RAP has planned to provide for
outstanding facilities, improvements of existing facilities and
requirements of new facilities in the resettlements. The survey has also
identified 2,231 homeless people in both reservoir areas and the RAP

I   Community        PAPs have been closely involved in the preparation of the socio-
Participation &   economic surveys and RAPs. Census surveys were conducted through
Consultation     personal contacts and interviews with individuals or families, including
women, landless tenants, sharecroppers, government land assignees.
Detailed discussions were held with individual PAPs for their input on
assets lost, compensation paid or to be paid, court cases, impact on
living standards, economic rehabilitation activities and income
generation schemes and remaining problems.
Community participation and consultation is designed into the
implementation mechanism. Village R&R Committees are to be set up
to ensure the full participation of the PAPs in the village-level R&R
planning and its implementation. Village Committees, as
representatives of the PAPs, could help to improve the village RAPs
with constant feedback from the PAPs.
NGOs will be engaged to facilitate PAP participation. PAP and NGO
representatives are on the District R&R Committees to further enhance
PAP participation in their development.
L   Implementation   GOAP has worked out detailed, PAP-specific compensation and
Mechanism        rehabilitation programs by village, phased out over a period of 5 years.
Detailed implementation schedules have been prepared for all R&R
activities under the project (See Attachment 8 for the master schedule).
As an effort to further enhance PAP participation during
implementation, Village R&R Committees are to be organized to fully
represent PAPs' opinions in implementation jointly with NGOs and
R&R officers. As part of the detailed and final planning effort, Village
Committees, NGOs and R&R officers will reconfirm and finalize all
details of PAP-specific rehabilitation activities in each Village R&R
Action Plan. To ensure the success of the income generation schemes, a
lot of efforts have gone into training planning. A detailed training
program has been drawn up.
M.  Monitoring &      Both internal and external monitoring will be conducted concurrently
Evaluation of    throughout the project implementation.. The monitoring bodies will
Resettlement     ultimately report to the State R&R Committee, who will review and
Progress        evaluate the R&R progress and make decisions on necessary measures
to improve R&R performance.
Internal monitoring. The Project Monitoring Unit will supervise and
monitor R&R implementation through the District Committees, NGOs
and VRCs. The NGOs and the Rehabilitation Unit under the Special
Collector will monitor R&R progress and present quarterly progress
reports to the District R&R Committees, who will, in turn, furnish the

Involvement of Non-Government Organizations (NGO)
in Implementing
Project Affected Persons Economic Rehabilitation Program (PAPERP)
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Introduction
1.    The Government of Andhra Pradesh GOAP is implementing the Third Andhra
Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP III) with World Bank assistance. A.P.I.P-III comprises two
sub-projects namely (i) Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) in Kurnool district and (ii) Sri
Rama Sagar Project (SRSP) in the Karimnagar and Warangal districts. Resettlement and
Rehabilitation (R & R) is small but significant and essential component of the project. The
displaced persons under the Srisailam Reservoir and Lower Manair Reservoir have been
covered for Resettlement and Rehabilitation under three Action Plans under the Second
Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Project (AP II). The R & R Component under AP III envisages
economic rehabilitation of the persons affected by the canal system, roads network, etc.,
together with retrospective completion of the AP II program.
2     GOAP has formulated an R & R Policy indicating aims and objectives for the
Economic Rehabilitation. GOAP further conducted socioeconomic surveys, findings of
which form the base line for the PAPERP designed for the Economic Rehabilitation. The
Project Affected Persons Economic Rehabilitation Plan (PAPERP) is proposed to be
implemented over a period from 1997- 98 to 2001-2002. The policy stipulates involvement
of NGOs and its role in the PAPERP implementation. The Special Collector SRBC Kumool
and Special Collector SRSP Hyderabad are responsible for the planning, implementation and
monitoring of the PAPERP in the respective districts that have been prepared for each sub-
project. In order to enable them to implement PAPERP through such a process, the GOAP is
appointing a NGO to work with Special Collector, Land Acquisition.
The Aim
3.    The aim of the assignment is to help the Special Collector, Land Acquisition to
initiate and sustain a process of participatory PAPERP by mobilizing and organizing the
affected communities in implementing the PAPERP so that they could all be fully involved
in the restoration and improvement of their livelihood.

Independent Monitoring And Evaluation of
Project Affected Persons Economic Rehabilitation Program
Draft Terms of Reference
Introduction
1.    The Government of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) has proposed Third Andhra Pradesh
Irrigation Project (AP III) for World Bank Assistance. AP III comprises two sub-projects,
namely (i) Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) in the Kumool district and (ii), Sri Rama
Sagar Project (SRSP) in the Karimnagar and Warangal districts.  Resettlement and
Rehabilitation (R & R) is a small but essential part of the project. The displaced persons
under the Srisailam Reservoir and Lower Manair Reservoir have been covered under the
three Resettlement Action Plans (1988-89, 89-90 and 91-93) under the AP II Project. The R
& R Component under AP III envisages economic rehabilitation of the persons affected by
the canal system, roads network with a retrofit component for AP II.
2.    The GOAP has formulated a R & R Policy indicating the aims and objectives for the
rehabilitation of the affected persons. A Project Affected Persons Economic Rehabilitation
Action Plans (PAPERP) has been prepared on the basis of this policy. The PAPERP
stipulates involvement of a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) for Monitoring and
Evaluation so that the process of land acquisition and implementation of Economic
Rehabilitation is carried out as per the set targets. There are about 3,416 PAPs including
1,696 PAPs under SRBC sub-project (Kumool district) and 2,619 under SRSP sub-project
(Karimnagar and Warangal districts).
The Aim
3.    The GOAP has a separate cell under the Special Collector, Land Acquisition, to
implement the PAPERP with the help of NGOs. In order to ensure effective implementation
of the PAPERP and achievement of the designed targets, the GOAP is appointing a Non-
Governmental Organization to conduct independent monitoring and evaluation of the R&R
components to provide an on-going assessment of R&R implementation to enable timely
adjustments of implementation setup and procedures.
4.    In order to achieve this aim, the assignment of independent monitoring and evaluation
assignment will have the following specific targets:
* Concurrent monitoring of R&R implementation progress as laid out in the
PAPERPs for SRBC and SRSP;
* Evaluation of R&R progress and achievement of projected R&R objectives;
formulation of the necessary measures to resolve problems and improve R&R
implementation.



Annex 5
Page 24 of 26
Scope of Work
5.    The assignment covers the two sub-projects: SRBC in the Kurnool district and SRSP
in Karimnagar and Warangal districts. The NGO will work closely with Special Collector,
Land Acquisition and his staff at the sub-projects for the period 1997-98 to 2001-2002.
6.    The NGO should describe its methodologies in its inception report, specifying the
type of quantitative and qualitative methods that will be used in the field for monitoring and
evaluation.
7.    The NGO should work with the resettlement agency to set up the computerized
monitoring system for R&R component. The monitoring system should be operated by the
resettlement agency as part of its internal monitoring.  It is the responsibility of the
resettlement agency to track the daily physical progress of the project as part of the project
internal monitoring.
8.    As part of the effort to set up the monitoring system, the NGO should develop a
detailed list of specific and measurable indicators to indicate achievement of physical targets
and fulfillment of program objectives for the GOAP. The indicators should fit into the
framework of general project R&R performance indicators prepared for the AP III project
and form the basis for R&R internal monitoring. These indicators should cover:
* organization performance;
* community mobilization and participation;
* financial progress;
* physical progress;
* grievance redress;
* performance of rehabilitation activities;
* availability of support services;
* womens' development;
* impacts of training programs;
9.    The NGO should carry out concurrent monitoring of R&R activities. Provided with
updated data on physical R&R progress through internal monitoring, the NGO should verify
these information through systematic and extensive PAP contact monitoring activities in the
field and thorough diagnostic analysis. Contact monitoring and diagnostic studies should be
based on participating in public consultations and PAP meetings, interviewing a random
sample of PAPs and resettlement officers, field visit observations and survey of controlled
groups of PAPs.
10.   Based on analysis of provided progress data and contact observations in the field, the
NGO should be able to determine whether the goals of R&R--namely maintenance or
increase of PAP living standards--are achieved through evaluating:



Annex 5
Page 25 of 26
* the application of the R&R policy;
* the functioning of the R&R institutional setup;
* the timely delivery of entitlements under the R&R Policy;
* the functioning of consultative and participatory arrangements;
* the operation of designed economic activities;
* the functioning of the grievance redress mechanism; and
* the restoration of PAP living standards.
11.   The NGO will conduct a socioeconomic evaluation of the PAPERP implementation at
project completion to measure the living standards of the affected persons against that
established in the socioeconomic survey before the project.
12.   The NGO should submit semi-annual monitoring and evaluaton reports to the GOAP
and the World Bank.
Timeframe
13.   The assignment is for three years to be extended annually on the basis of
performance.
The Non-Government Organization
14.   The NGO will have a team of professionals who have skills and experience in
resettlement and rehabilitation, rural community development, social assessment,
participatory methodologies and monitoring of social development.

iii) For masonry and concrete, the stren4th of mortar and
concrete is as specified  in  ajreement.  Laboratory  has to desijn the
proportions  of  different inyredients  throuyh  tests  for  the  specified
stren-jth . The tjrojortioniny shall be done by wei,ht.
iv) For concrete and mortars where strejnth is not jiven and
only proportions have been specified the s tren,th of mix be worked out
the laboratory and this should be treated as standard for execution.
v) When controlled concrete is specified it is essential that mix
desi9n be done.
vi) Since the strenjth of cement varies from batch to batch in
a cement factory itself, it is essential that a relation between strenjth
of cement versus strenyth  of concrete may be worked out in the lab.
Well in advance of the startiny  of the work.  This would facilitate in
furnishind the proper proportion to the field staff for the mix for it
entails addinj or reducing cement content based on the strenjth of
cement.
vii) The stren,th of concrete is specified for 28 days.  It will
be difficult for 28 days to set the strenjth of concrete and assess its
4uality.   11ence  accelerated  curiny  test be  under taken  as  per  the
relevant  I.S.  usin,  boilding  water  method.   From  this  method  a
relationship  between  stren-,th  attained  with  aceelarated  curing  versus
normal curinj at 28 days be arrived at.
viii) Apart from these, control charts for cement and concrete
will also be prepared in the Laboratory  to assess the level of quality
control and to take remedial measures for the defective works, if any.
Other statistical analysis as reciuired would also be under taken.

INDIA
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Project Benefits
Economic and Environmental Impacts
1.    Agricultural Benefits. Assistance to GOAP for rehabilitation and completion of the SRSP
253,000 ha command area and completion of the 65,000 ha SRBC project begun under the AP II
project would add 153,000 ha to the 2.3 million ha of surface irrigation commands in AP. The
agricultural objective of these works is to promote the production of high value cash crops in upland
irrigation schemes by improved water delivery, applied farming systems research, irrigation
agronomy extension and farmer training. These inputs would result in significant incremental
agricultural production consisting of cereals and pulses, oilseeds, cotton and other cash crops. Project
agricultural output would generate an annual Value Added to the local economy estimated at Rs.5.03
billion (about US$140 million) in 1995 prices. These project outputs would be sustained by
investment to ensure the safety and economic life of the Srisailam and Sriramasagar dams which, in
turn, would ensure sustained irrigated and hydroelectric power production within the Krishna and
Godavari river basins outside the project areas. Completion of the AP II command area feeder road
program would promote farm produce marketing and provide quantifiable economic benefits in
travel time and vehicle operating cost savings.
2.     Employment.  The number of directly benefiting farm families is estimated at about
447,700 (about 2.24 million people). At full development, the increased demand for farm labor would
amount to about 31.6 million man-days per annum (equivalent to about 105,450 full-time jobs). About
one half of the manpower demand would be supplied by hired labor, the majority of which consists of
landless workers. The increased agricultural production would generate off-farm employment and
have significant employment multiplier effects. It is estimated that over 26,000 transport, marketing
and processing jobs would be generated in the sub-project area Districts. Construction of civil works
would generate a temporary five year increase in local employment opportunities since a large number
of unskilled laborers would be employed in construction during project implementation period.
3.     Afforestation  Products  and  Environmental Conservation.   The  Environmental
Management Plan component would also generate several diverse benefits. These include: (a) reduced
reservoir sedimentation as a result of soil and water conservation in treated catchments comprising
reservoir foreshore areas; (b) generation of forest products by compensatory afforestation, farm
forestry, canal bank and the green belt plantations; (c) water-borne disease control under the
environmental health program; (d) natural resources and wildlife conservation in protected areas would
be improved; and (e) project programs and two environmental education facilities would be provided to
increase the environmental awareness of the local population along with agro-forestry training.
Investments in a comprehensive environmental monitoring program would monitor progress in
improvement of the regional environment and conservation. The above benefits are not readily
quantifiable in economic terms: however, compensatory afforestation, canal bank and reservoir green
belt plantation would produce about significant quantities of salable fuelwood, pulpwood, faggotwood
in the future.
4. The overall direct project impact at full development is summarized in the table below:

Impact on Farm Incomes and Poverty Alleviation
5.     Farm  Model Analysis.  The project impact on farm  incomes has been assessed by
representative farm models based on average holding sizes of 1.1 ha for SRSP and 1.8 ha for SRBC as
these represent about 80% and 70% respectively of total farm holdings in the two sub-project areas
(Table 16). Farm model net incomes were evaluated for three development scenarios: the present (P),
the future without project (FWOP) and the future at full development with the project (FWP). The
average 1995 financial farm gate prices prevailing in the sub-project areas were used to value outputs
and inputs in the computation of unit area crop budgets for each likely crop under each of the three
scenarios. The per ha financial crop budgets are given in Tables 1- 12 along the crop yield assumptions
used. Farm cropping patterns are modeled on the regional cropping patterns for each of the three
scenarios (Tables 13-15). The farm model analysis results are detailed in Table 17. A summary of
average farm net income results is given in the table below:

Annex 10
Page 3 of 39
6.    The impact of the project on project area farm incomes would be substantial. At full
development, annual net farm incomes in with project are estimated to increase by 200%-360% in areas
where presently there is little or no canal irrigation (i.e. in SRBC and in SRSP below LMD), and by
about 100% in areas where presently there is already some canal and well irrigation (in SRSP above
LMD). Incremental annual net farm incomes in SRSP range from Rs.12,025 for farms in the above
LMD area to Rs 18,150 in the below LMD area, while in SRBC they could average about Rs.48,395.
The incremental benefit cost ratio for SRSP farms is about 2 while that of SRBC could attain 3.5.
7.    Poverty Alleviation Impact. In Andhra Pradesh, the number of population living below the
poverty line has declined from 44% in 1981 to 32% in 1991, compared with 48% and 30% respectively
for all India. In the project districts, the number of population who live below the poverty line range
from 36% in SRBC and 50% in SRSP. The percentage of landless population in the project areas is
estimated to be about 25% in the SRBC and 21% in SRSP. Since a farm family of five requires an
annual income of about Rs. 11,000 to be above the Andhra Pradesh absolute poverty threshold, the
results for the "present" (P) scenario shown in the table imply that, at present, 80% of farmers in SRSP
and 70% of farmers in SRBC have incomes below the poverty threshold of Rs. 11,000 per annum.
Given that opportunities for off-farm incomes are limited, it may be assumed that the per capita income
of most of these families and those of the landless population at present do not reach this level. Under
the FWOP scenario farm income would increase very marginally above the poverty line threshold while
under the full development FWP scenario, all average farm incomes would be above the poverty line.
Irrigation Management Reform
8.    Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM). Having served as a catalyst for GOAP
irrigation sector management and fiscal reform, the project would be of a pilot nature to test
management reform modalities for statewide adoption. Its pilot benefits include: (a) finalization of
legal and administrative modalities for empowerment of irrigators to take over the and operation and
maintenance of minor canal networks by voluntary establishment of autonomous Water User
Associations (WUAs); (b) devolution of responsibility for equitable water delivery to WUAs; and (c)
involvement of irrigators in joint management of reservoirs and major canal schemes through
democratic representation on public Command Area Development Boards or Scheme Committees.
Thus a significant part of the burden of canal network O&M funding and enforcement of water
delivery discipline would be transferred to irrigation scheme beneficiaries.
9.    Improved Irrigation Service. An important benefit of the project would be the piloting of
modalities to realize GOAP strategy for increasing the potential of upland canal commands having
scarce water resources. The strategy is based on an ICADD focus on: (a) providing intermittent
water supply uniformly to a whole command and allowing farmers to cultivate crops of their choice
with available water supplies, instead of using Localization to regulate high consumptive use crops
to specific locations and seasons; and (b) ensuring reliable and adequate water supply to WUA
jurisdictions by specific ICADD scheme organizations having system O&M and water management
as their primary function. Thus, success of the twin pronged approach of PIM and improved
irrigation service under the project would lay the foundation for improvement of irrigation efficiency
in upland areas and contribute to the irrigation sector's unavoidable adaptation to growing water
demands from other sectors.
10.   Improved ICADD Implementation Capacity. The project's construction quality assurance
arrangements (including ICADD construction staff training and and management of improved civil
works contract documents developed for the project), together with the focus on public consultation



Annex 10
Page 4 of 39
and participation, would improve ICADD's implementation capacity for other large state irrigation
projects. The project R&R Policy and its implementation arrangements sets a precedent for more
equitable treatment of project affected families of future irrigation projects and the experience to be
gained would improve ICADD's R&R implementation capacity.
B. Economic Analysis
Analysis Approach and Methodology
11.    Project Components Considered. The project would modernise/rehabilitate the existing
irrigation infrastructure in the Sriramasagar Project (SRSP), and complete the on-going irrigation works
to develop the 65,000 ha Srisailam Right Branch Canal (SRBC) command. In SRSP, the modernisation
and rehabilitation works would be carried out within the 165,000 ha command served by km 0-146 of
Kakatiya Canal above Lower Mannair Dam (LMD), where the existing irrigation network is shrinking
due to neglect, and along its km 146-234 below LMD serving a 88,000 ha area where there are already
some distributaries but very few minor canals. The economic rates of return (ERRs) and Net Present
Values (NPVs) have therefore been calculated separately for: (a) the three commands of the sub-project
areas (SRBC, above LMD and below LMD in SRSP); (b) SRSP as a whole; and (c) the overall project.
12.    The analysis included only the direct costs to be incurred and benefit accrual from the irrigation
sub-projects and the feeder road program. This included R&R expenditures for SRBC only since SRSP
R&R expenditures are provided for addressing the impoverishment of people outside the command area
that were affected by the construction of irrigation works under the AP 11 project. However, the
investments for ensuring the safety of the Srisailam Dam spillway were excluded from the analysis
because their very significant benefits would be attributable to the protection against a possible
irreparable the dam's hydroelectric plants and other downstream facilities in the river basin, as well as
stoppage of Madras and Telegu Ganga Project water supply. Consequently inclusion of these benefits
in the form of damage prevention would distort the economic assessment of SRBC as an irrigation
project on the one hand, while the apportionable investment cost to SRBC is very small on the other.
The costs and benefits of the Environment Management Plan were excluded from the analysis because
most of the benefits are related to regional environmental conservation while the present value of direct
benefits such as revenues derived from afforestation activities, are very small in relation to quantifiable
agricultural benefits.
13.   Treatment of Groundwater Development. The area irrigated by village irrigation tanks has
remained more or less constant in both sub-project areas and is not expected to increase. However,
there has been substantial groundwater development within and outside the SRSP sub-project area
because of increased recharge due to canal seepage, improved electrification, cheap credit and the
limited coverage of the deteriorating irrigation network. This activity will likely continue in the future
albeit at a reduced rate within the SRSP command because of the availability of greatly expanded canal
irrigation after project completion. The total area irrigated by electrified and bullock-driven wells is
currently about 50,000 ha and could potentially be increased by about 30,000 ha. Although conversion
of the bullock-driven wells to electric pumping is possible to expand their coverage by 5,000-8,000 ha,
this is unlikely once canal irrigation is available. However, given the uncertainties of private sector
investment in wells in SRSP after scheme rehabilitation, the analysis postulates that the private
development of groundwater would continue at the same level in both the "With Project" (WP) and
"Without Project" (WOP) scenarios. Accordingly, it is assumed that in SRSP the additional wells
installed by rice cultivators to cope with the rotational water supply regime in the WP case would equal
the number that would be installed as a response to inadequate canal irrigation coverage under the WOP



Annex 10
Page 5 of 39
scenario albeit not in the same locations. Therefore, the economic resource costs of development and
operation of wells and their benefits have been excluded in both the WOP and WP cases for SRSP.
14.    For the new SRBC command, the limitations of groundwater exploitation make it unlikely that
groundwater development will expand significantly beyond its present level of about 3,500 ha as the
hydrogeology of 70% of the command does not lend itself to viable groundwater development. The
maximum potential increment in groundwater development is only about 5,000 ha and then only if
water tables rise significantly after several years in parts of three or four of the sixteen irrigation blocks
of the command area as a result of seepage losses and a relatively less pervious subsurface layer (Annex
CC). Thus, groundwater development is regarded as identical for both the WP and WOP scenarios and
not included in the SRBC economic analysis.
15.    Derivation of Economic Benefits. The quantified benefits are mainly incremental agricultural
production due to cropping pattern and productivity changes in each command, supplemented by an
estimate of the likely economic benefits that could be attributed to feeder road investments (e.g.
economic savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time). In SRSP, the agricultural benefits are
expected to come mainly from significant shifts from low value to higher value crops as a result of
rehabilitation of the existing irrigation network and expansion of reliable canal irrigation to the whole
command. For SRBC, project benefits are derived from the change from rainfed to irrigated production
in the form of higher crop yields, an increase in cropping intensity and shift to higher value crops. The
WOP and WP cropping pattems were initially based on data and estimates provided by agricultural
research and Agriculture Department staff and modified on the basis of Participatory Rural Appraisals'
(PRA) managed by a specialized NGO with GOAP assistance. The PRA was based on farmer
consultations conducted in 70 and 48 villages respectively above and below LMD in SRSP, and in 42
villages within the SRBC command area. Proposed cropping pattems resulting from the PRA and
proposed crop yields were reviewed during project preappraisal and finalized by agreement between
Bank, FAO, GOAP and Agricultural University agronomists.
16.    Sensitivity/Risk Analysis. Risk and assumptions that may not fully materialize are treated in
the sensitivity analysis by varying benefit and cost streams to reflect particular risk scenarios. The risks
analyzed include: (a) seasonal water delivery deficits; (b) the percentage change in net benefits or
project costs (i.e. "switching values") that would reduce ERRs to the opportunity cost of capital (12%);
(c) impact of implementation delays; (d) combinations of increased costs and lagging benefits; (f)
expanded rice cultivation instead of the expected predominantly upland cropping pattern of cash and
food crops grown under a rotational water supply regime; and (g) over-estimation of projected yields
for rice and cash crops.
Cost Assumptions
17.    Pricing Framework. The economic analysis has been carried out in 1995 constant prices over
a project life of 30 years. All local costs, including unskilled labor and other non-traded goods, were
converted to economic costs and values by using a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.90. The
economic prices of traded commodities and fertilizers were derived from the world market price
forecasts and adjusted for transport and handling charges to farm gate prices (Table 18).
The PRAs are documented in the following ICADD reports: (a) Agricultural Aspects of Srisailam Right
Branch Canal Command, June 1994; and (b) Agricultural Aspects of Sriramasagar Command, July 1994.



Annex 1O

18.   Irrigation Investment. The investment in irrigation civil works, including command area
development, equipment, buildings and physical contingencies is estimated at: (a) Rs.4,544 million and
Rs.2,099 million for commands above and below LMD respectively; and (b) Rs.5,999 million for
completion of SRBC. These works require a mixture of equipment, local materials, fuel and both
skilled and unskilled labor. Based on a sample of seven ongoing construction contracts, these costs
may be broken down into about 13.5% in taxes and duties, 11.5% in foreign exchange components, and
75% local materials, unskilled labor, engineering and administration. Local costs were adjusted to
economic prices by using the SCF of 0.9. On this basis, a specific conversion factor (CF) for
construction equal to 0.79 was derived.
19.   Irrigation O&M. Annual irrigation operation and maintenance costs (O&M) are estimated at
Rs.494/ha in SRBC and SRSP below LMD, and an increment of Rs.314/ha in the existing irrigation
areas in above LMD (currently O&M expenditures in this command are Rs. 120/ha). These costs were
adjusted to economic terms by SCF of 0.90 as they consist mostly of salaries, local materials and
unskilled labor.
20.    Dam Safety Assurance. Investment costs--excluding those to be incurred for safety of the
Srisailam Dam spillway--are mainly consultancy services and studies, and some equipment. Total
costs, including physical contingencies, are estimated at Rs.35 million for above LMD, Rs. 19 million
for below LMD in SRSP2 and Rs.45 million for SRBC. The financial costs were converted to border
prices by using SCF of 0.90.
21.    Resettlement and Rehabilitation. The project provides funds for R&R programs, including
grant packages, training and community infrastructures, to people whose lands were and would be
acquired for construction under the previous AP II project and under this project. The total costs,
including physical contingencies but excluding land compensation, are estimated at Rs. 173 million for
SRBC and Rs.138 million for areas beyond km 234 of Kakatiya Canal. The latter costs were excluded
from the economic analysis (para. 12). The local costs were adjusted to border prices by using SCF of
0.90, except for investments in community infrastructure which were adjusted by CF of 0.79.
22.    Agricultural Support Services.  Total costs over the implementation period, including
physical contingencies, are estimated at Rs.178 million and Rs.1 14 million respectively for SRSP's
above and below LMD commands, and Rs.139 million for SRBC. To provide continuing support for
agricultural extension and water user associations thereafter, annual costs of Rs.7.7 million, Rs.5.8
million and Rs.7.9 million are provided for the above LMD, below LMD and SRBC commands in that
order. Local costs were adjusted to border prices by using SCF of 0.90.
23.    Feeder Roads. The total length of rural roads completed under AP II (up to March 1995) were
171 km in the above LMD, 265 km in the below LMD and 102 km in SRBC. During FY95/96, 47 km
of road were completed in the above LMD, 22 km in the below LMD and only 5 km in SRBC. An
additional 94 km of on-going and new roads would be completed during the project period. In order to
complete residual works started under the previous AP II project's R&R program, about 108 km of
rural roads would be constructed in 104 resettlement villages for reservoir oustees under the project's
R&R component as shown in the table below.
2   In the separate analyses of the above and below LMD commands, the dam safety assurance costs included
in the analyses were allocated in the proportion of 65:35 to each command.

24.    Using the practice followed on other Bank rural road projects in India, only 50% of feeder road
construction costs were included in the economic analysis because several known benefits cannot be
easily quantified. The SRSP cost estimates used on this basis were Rs.25 million and Rs. 15 million
above and below LMD respectively, while for SRBC the cost used in the analysis was Rs.71.5 million.
Annual O&M costs have been based the average costs of Rs.35,000/km estimated by the AP
Department of Roads and Buildings. All financial costs were adjusted to border prices by a CF of 0.79.
25.    Foregone Benefits of Land Used for Construction. A total of 75 ha and 312 ha were
acquired for the construction of SRSP feeder roads in the above LMD and below LMD commands
respectively. In SRBC, a total of 2,244 ha were and would be acquired for the construction of irrigation
infrastructure and feeder roads in SRBC. The foregone benefits from land lost for construction have
been valued at the economic net production value of crops under the without project scenario. These
are estimated at about Rs. 17,560/ha and Rs. 11,550/ha for SRSP's above and below LMD commands
and Rs.8,1 10/ha in SRBC.
26.    Foregone Benefits of Hydroelectric Power. When SRBC is completed and water is used for
irrigation, there could be some loss of hydroelectric power due to diversion of stored water for
irrigation. Simulation studies indicate that, assumingfull development of the Krishna river basin, there
could be about 45 million kwh (Gwh) of power generation foregone annually out of a potential
generation of 2,435 Gwh with a 97% reliability (Annex KK). Although the basin is not yet fully
developed and larger irrigation projects are planned, this opportunity cost has been attributed to SRBC
only to capture losses that may occur in the state economy, i.e. such as the cost of purchasing power
from other sources. Based on the estimates of AP State Electricity Board, the marginal cost of
electricity--ranging from Rs.1.2/kwh to Rs.2.0/kwh--is averaged at Rs.1.6/kwh. Thus, the forgone
hydropower benefits at full development have been valued at Rs.72 million annually.
Benefit Assumptions
27.    Market Prospects. Andhra Pradesh is a net exporter of food grains, oilseeds, sugarcane and
fruits. Incremental production resulting from the project will be a small percentage of AP's total
agricultural production and therefore would be readily handled by existing marketing channels. Prices



Annex 10
Page 8 of 39
of oilseeds are likely to be kept steady by India's high income elasticity of demand for edible oils, and
by GOI's continuing efforts to reduce its large vegetable oil imports. In the long run, prices of
agricultural produce would be dictated by international market prices. For cotton, the production trend
indicates a change from short and medium-staple to long-staple cotton which responds better to
irrigation and is internationally more readily marketable.
28.    SRSP Sub-Project Cropping Pattern. In the 163,874 ha command above LMD where
currently about 30-40% of the area receives canal irrigation, overall cropping intensity is about 147%
due to the presence of tanks and wells. The maximum gross canal irrigated area has never exceeded
106,000 ha, while in 1992/93 it was only 80,268 ha implying an irrigation intensity of only about 49%
due to deficiencies in the water distribution system resulting from deferred maintenance. Rice is
cultivated on over 95% of the area irrigated by canals. In the 67,431 ha command below LMD where
the maximum gross area irrigated was 25,648 ha in 1990/91, the cropping pattern is subsistence
oriented and its cropping intensity is about 109%. A participatory rural appraisal was conducted by
ICADD to determine likely changes in cropping patterns in the advent of command area rehabilitation
and increase in the area under canal irrigation.
29.    Based on the past cropped areas and production trends in the sub-project areas, the WOP
cropping intensity in the above LMD areas is expected to remain at the present level, but cropping
patterns would change by a shift towards high value crops. Cropping intensity in the below LMD area
is estimated to increase slightly to 114% under the WOP scenario. The present and expected cropping
patterns in the two sub-project areas are shown in Tables 13 and 14. However, with rehabilitation of the
canal network, the cropping intensity is expected to reach not less than 150% because of conjunctive
groundwater use, made largely possible by the higher aquifer recharge rates due to irrigation. The
principal crops grown in the WP scenario would be paddy, maize, pulses, groundnuts, sunflower, cotton
(mainly below LMD), sugarcane (mainly above LMD) and vegetables.
30.    SRBC Sub-Project Cropping Pattern. The present cropping intensity in the SRBC project
area is about 103%. The rainfed cropping pattern is largely subsistence oriented: food grains and
legumes for home consumption and oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane and vegetables as cash crops. Double
cropping is sustained by wells irrigating about 3,500 ha. The existing cropping pattern was determined
from agricultural statistics and a participatory rural appraisal survey of potential project beneficiaries
conducted by ICADD. The survey also elicited responses about crop preferences and likely crop mixes
under irrigation. Without irrigation, neither the present crop mix nor cropping intensities are likely to
change much. However, better extension services, coupled with appropriate rainfed production
technology, and increased adoption of high yielding variety seeds may enable yields to increase
somewhat without the project. Based on the past cropped areas and production trends in the sub-project
area, cropping intensity under the "without project" (WOP) scenario is estimated to increase slightly to
about 107% (Table 15). With irrigation under the "with project" (WP) scenario, production would
become more stable, intensified and would shift to higher value crops. Cropping intensity is estimated
to reach about 160%. The largest output increments are expected from oilseeds (groundnut, soybean
and sunflower), sugarcane, and vegetables, and from the change to long-staple cotton (para. 27).
31.    Benefited Areas. The build-up rate of benefited areas was derived from the projected
command area contract completion schedule. The maturation rate of irrigation benefits has been
assumed over 3 years at a constant rate in the above LMD command which is already irrigated and over
5 years in commands where new irrigation would be introduced. Incremental annual benefited areas by
sub-projects are summarized below:

32.   Economic Prices of Commodities and Inputs. The economic prices of paddy, maize, sugar,
soybeans, sorghum, groundnuts and fertilisers were based on the average FY2000-2005 import parity
prices and cotton export parity price derived from the World Bank's Commodity Price Projection as
shown in Table 18. The domestic costs of transport, handling charges and processing were adjusted by
SCF of 0.90. The economic prices of non-traded commodities were derived by applying the SCF to
prevailing financial farm gate prices. Table 19 gives a summary of financial and economic prices.
33.   Opportunity Cost of Labour. Current market wage rates for hired unskilled labour range
from Rs.20 per man-day during slack periods to Rs.30 per man-day during peak periods in SRSP, and
from Rs. 15 per man-day to Rs.25 per man-day in slack and peak periods respectively in SRBC. The
unskilled labour wage is averaged at Rs.25 per man-day in SRSP and Rs.20 per man-day in SRBC. The
shadow wage rate is assumed to be the average market wage, adjusted by SCF of 0.90.
34.    Feeder Road Benefits. Benefits generated from rural feeder roads have been quantified from
vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings, passenger time saved and the incremental load from time saved.
The analysis has been based on the results of surveys conducted in December 1994 by the AP
Department of Roads and Highway on 12 rural feeder roads in SRSP and 6 feeder roads in SRBC.
Traffic counts and VOC savings were covered under the surveys while the passenger and incremental
load time saved were based on the Central Roads Research Institute "Impact of Rural Roads Traffic
Flow Patterns and Economic Benefits", case study in Haryana, 1987, updated to 1995 constant prices.
Based on the above information and assumptions, annual economic benefits per km have been
estimated at Rs.227,465/km/year in SRSP and Rs.207,130 in SRBC as shown in Tables 20 and 21.
35.    Under the project, annual economic benefits from rural roads at full development are estimated
at Rs.10.7 million in the above LMD command, Rs.5.0 million in the below LMD command and
Rs.44.1 million in SRBC. Including the benefits generated from feeder roads constructed under the
previous AP II project, annual economic benefits from rural roads at full development are estimated at
Rs.49.5 million and Rs.65.1 million in the above LMD and below LMD commands of SRSP and
Rs.65.2 million in SRBC.

Economic Rate of Return
36.    On the basis of the above assumptions, the economic rate of return (ERR) of the whole project
is estimated at 23.9% (Table 18). The ERRs of sub-projects are all favorable, ranging from 13.7% for
SRBC to 30.9% and 35.8% respectively for the SRSP above LMD and below LMD commands and
33.7% for the SRSP sub-project as a whole (Tables22-26). The net present value (NPV) at the discount
rate of 12% is estimated at Rs.12,280 million for the whole project. The results are summarized in the
following table:

37.   Impact of Sunk Costs. The expenditures incurred under AP II, including expenditures
incurred after its closure up to February 1995, amounted to Rs.264.0 million and Rs. 600.4 million
respectively for the above and below LMD commands of SRSP and Rs. 3,822.2 million for SRBC.
Restated in 1995 constant prices and in economic terms, all expenditures of AP II would be Rs.215.9
million for the above LMD command, Rs.566.2 million for the below LMD command and Rs.3,623.0
million for SRBC. As shown in the above table, with inclusion of AP II sunk costs, the ERRs of the
individual commands would fall to 35.0% and 27.5% for the for the above LMD command and below
LMD commands of SRSP, and to 9.2% for SRBC. The ERRs of the combined SRSP and the whole
project would fall to 31.4% and 18.7% respectively. Although not strictly relevant to the investment
decision for the project, these results indicate completion of the project would be justified including the
full costs of the AP II project.
Sensitivity Analyses
38.    Switching Values. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of deviations
from the main assumptions on the economic viability of the project. The measure of sensitivity used, "
the switching value" is the value of the variable tested which would reduce the present value of the
project's net incremental benefits to zero when discounted at a capital opportunity cost of 12%. The
analysis results indicate that, except for the SRBC sub-project which has comparatively low switching
values, ERRs of the above and below LMD commands of SRSP are neither sensitive to substantial
increases in the total costs, nor to substantial decreases in incremental benefits.
39.    The ERRs of the two SRSP commands would fall to 12% when the total costs increased by
278%-309%, or incremental net benefits decreased by 74%-76%. Because of the relatively high
completion costs and small benefited areas of SRBC, its ERR would fall to 12% when the total costs
increased by 19%, or incremental net benefits decreased by 16%. ERRs of the whole project would fall
to 12% when the total costs increased by 160% respectively, or incremental net benefits decreased by
62%. The switching values are summarized below:

Risk Analysis
40.    Several tests were perforned to assess the sensitivity of the economic analysis to planning,
implementation and operational risks (para. 16). The results are given in the following table:

41.    Implementation Delays. Shortage of counterpart funds and/or contractual problems could be
potential risk causing delays in the implementation schedule. This would result in the increases in the
construction costs and delay the project's expected benefits. The sensitivity analyses undertaken on the
above variables show that ERRs would still be acceptable for the combined SRSP and the whole
project. However, ERRs of command areas are more sensitive to delayed benefits than to increased
construction costs. The above LMD command is more sensitive to the below LMD command in this
respect--especially if benefits are delayed two years--but still remains well above the cutoff ERR.
SRBC, however, becomes marginal if benefits are lagged by two years. Increases in the construction
costs by 20% would only reduce ERRs of SRSP sub-projects slightly but brings the ERR of SRBC



Annex 10
Page 12 of 39
close to 12%. A combination of 20% increases in the construction costs and benefits lagged by two
years would reduce ERRs by 3.6%-12.4% for sub-project commands and 6.8% for the whole project.
In this case, the ERR for SRBC would drop to 10%. These results indicate that the project is robust
provided that implementation is properly managed to contain cost escalation and implementation delay.
42.    Reduced Seasonal Water Availability. Reduced seasonal water availability is always a
potential risk for an irrigation project planned with an overall water supply reliability target of 75% (the
irrigation project standard for India). Reduction in irrigation water supply would result in the reduction
of the projected cropping intensities. Supply reliabilities for each command were selected based on the
results of the Krishna and Godavari river basin simulation models (Annex **). In the monsoon (kharif)
season, full irrigation water supply for the above LMD command was found to be available over 85%
of the time and over 75% of times at the below LMD and SRBC commands. For the analysis, it is
conservatively assumed that, because of delay in reservoir filling, no water is available for irrigation in
the kharif season during deficit years. In the post-monsoon (rabi) irrigation season, full irrigation water
supply was found to be available about 85% of times for the above LMD command and about 75% of
times at the below LMD and SRBC. When rabi season deficits occur, the analysis assumes that only
50% of irrigation water supply would be available above LMD and at SRBC. However for SRSP's
below LMD command, due to the sensitivity of supply reliability to water delivery (Annex $$), it is
assumed that there would be no rabi water supply during a rabi season deficit year. Thus, in terrms of
weighted probabilities, the supply probability for the rabi season is 92.5% above LMD, 87.5% at SRBC
and 75% at below LMD.
43.    Based on the above assumptions, the net agricultural production benefits at full development
would reduce by 10% at above LMD, 16% at below LMD and 11% at SRBC. Accordingly, seasonal
water deficit impacts are found to reduce ERRs by 1.5% for SRBC, 5.5% and 6.7% for below and
above LMD, and 3.9% for the whole project. These results are probably overstated since: (a) the
modelled supply reliability for SRBC were based on full future development of the Krishna river basin
within AP whereas there some uncertainty that full development could be completed in the next 20-25
years; (b) no allowance was made for production from groundwater irrigation when assuming that
supply in deficit years would be reduced to 50% and zero respectively above and below LMD; and (c)
the impact of deficit years has been assumed to be extreme as deficits may vary from marginal to large.
44.    Changes in the Expected Cropping Patterns.  The projected predominantly cash crop
cropping patterns might not materialize despite enforcement of rotational water supply since farners
may opt to expand the cultivated areas with paddy particularly in SRSP's above LMD command. As
the water requirement for paddy is about twice that of upland crops, the dry crop area would be reduced
and the commands would be partially irrigated. Assuming that the projected paddy areas in both kharif
and rabi seasons would increase by 50% in all commands, the cash crop areas in both seasons would
reduce by 46%-73% above LMD, 3%-57% at below LMD and 1%-6% at SRBC3. If this occurs, the
For above LMD: paddy areas increase from 55,000 ha to 82,500 ha and cash crop areas reduce from
75,500 ha to 20,500 ha in kharif season; while in the rabi season, paddy areas increase from 28,000 ha to
42,000 ha and cash crop areas reduce from 61,000 ha to 33,000 ha. At below LMD: paddy areas increase
from 20,504 ha to 30,760 ha and cash crop areas reduce from 36,168 ha to 15,656 ha in kharif season;
while paddy areas increase from 1,056 ha to 1,585 ha and cash crop areas reduce from 43,120 ha to
42,062 ha in the rabi season. For SRBC: paddy areas increase from 2,336 ha to 3,505 ha and cash crop
areas reduce from 38,675 ha to 36,337 ha in kharif season; and during the rabi season, paddy areas
increase from 500 ha to 750 ha and cash crop areas reduce from 40,125 ha to 39,625 ha.

reduction in the cropping intensity is significant at about 47% at above LMD, but only marginal at
about 13% at below LMD and only 3% at SRBC.
45.   Although the per ha financial returns from paddy are more or less equal to those of some cash
crops (e.g. sunflower, soybean, maize, vegetables and groundnut), the per ha economic returns from
paddy (expressed in border prices) are about 80% higher than high value cash crops, but 25%-35%
lower than cotton and seed production. Therefore the economic analysis is not overly sensitive to errors
in forecasting the paddy area since the substantial reduction in cropping intensity, particularly in above
LMD command, is partly offset by the higher economic returns from paddy. In terms of production
benefits, total net production benefits would reduce by 22% at above LMD only 1% at both below
LMD and SRBC, and the estimated ERRs would reduce from 35.8% to 23.1% for the above LMD
command, but are likely to remain unchanged for the below LMD and SRBC commands. The
estimated project ERR would however reduce from 23.9% to 21.0%.
46.    Possible Over-Estimation of Crop Yields. Although the estimation of crop yields for the
SRSP WP case was carefully discussed (para. 15), the irrigated paddy yield selected by experts for the
WP scenario would seem to be relatively high relative to the paddy yields of the WOP scenario. For
cash crops there is less cause for concern as these crops are largely grown under rainfed conditions at
present in all sub-project areas: hence WOP case yields are understandably lower than the yields that
could be achieved with irrigation. However, there is always the risk that all assumed crop yields may
not be achieved by average farmers because the expected input levels might not be applied, or improved
seeds, fertilizers and production credits might not always be available.
47.   Thus, assuming that paddy yields in the WP case are 25% lower than those used for the base
case analysis, WP net production benefits are reduced by 11% and 6% above and below LMD
respectively, and only by 1% at SRBC (which has a very small paddy area). Accordingly, the estimated
ERRs would fall to 29.7%, 29.5% and 13.6% for above LMD, below LMD and SRBC in that order.
When yields also include a 10% yield reduction for other crops, the reductions in WP net production
benefits are 20% for above LMD, 17% for below LMD and 14% for SRBC. Thus the estimated ERRs
would fall to 24.5% for above LMD, 26.2% for below LMD and 11.8% for SRBC. Thus, using
conservative crop yields, the overall project ERR drops to 21.5%.

IDIA
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
FINANCIAL AND FISCAL ANALYSIS
A. Public Irrigation Sector Finances
Public Irrigation Finances
1.    State Finances. The assured counterpart funding during project implementation, and funding
for O&M works after construction under the project could potentially be a risk from general fiscal crisis
in Andhra Pradesh (AP). The fiscal stress has been caused by (a) declining state own revenues; and (b)
sharp rising unproductive public expenditures on subsidies, poorly targeted welfare programs,
especially the 2-Rupee rice scheme, and salaries which has crowed out productive expenditures on
physical and social infrastructures, and non-waged O&M. As a result, the main fiscal and debt
indicators have deteriorated together with the slow growth performance. The fiscal deficit in the State
has increased to 3.4% of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in FY95/96and amounted to Rs.22.5
billion in FY95/96, and is estimated to increase further to about Rs.23.9 billion in FY96/97. The
debt/GSDP ratio currently stands at about 24% of GSDP.
2.    In recent years, about 22% of State's total expenditures were financed through borrowings,
and the share of capital expenditures has been only 15%. Total capital expenditures were Rs. 16.0
billion in FY95/96, while the revenue expenditures amounted to Rs. 102.0 billion (Table 1). An
increasing reliance on central loans to finance the State plan expenditures has led to a high level of
debt relative to the revenues of the State. Expenditures on interest payments alone presently absorbed
about 16.4% of total State revenue receipts, and the share is projected to increase some 20% of total
State's revenues and 30% of tax revenues before the end of the decade.
3.    Irrigation Investment and Revenue Expenditures. Irrigation has been given the highest
priority in the state's capital budget and comprised about 43% thereof in FY95/96. This amounts to
20% of the total investment in the state. Because of its high share in the capital stock of the state,
any inefficiency in the irrigation sector generates an adverse effect on overall efficiency in the
economy. After peaking at 2.4% of AP's GSDP in 1986/87, public expenditure in the irrigation
sector declined to 1.2% of GSDP in 1995/96. However, it has remained the third largest sector in
terms of total budgetary allocations after welfare programs and education. Capital expenditures
declined from Rs.7.83 billion in FY93/94 to Rs.6.83 billion in FY95/96 while revenue expenditures
(excluding debt service) declined from Rs.1.93 billion to Rs.1.32 billion in this period. It should be
noted that the total revenue expenditure also included interest payments . Annual interest payments
to GOI on irrigation debt increased from Rs.4.04 billion in FY93/94 to Rs.7.22 billion in FY95/96.
Accordingly, total irrigation sector revenue expenditure increased from Rs. 13.80 billion in FY93/94
to Rs.15.37 billion in FY95/96. Thus, in FY95/96 debt service amounted to about 85% of total
sector revenue expenditures and comprised about 38% of total State debt service payments (Table 1).
l Interest payments are included under the revenue expenditure account and, at the same time, the same
amount is recorded under the revenue receipt account. This is an accounting transaction or a notional
payment from ICADD to the State Treasury. Because no actual transaction occurs, this practice distorts
the fiscal accounts.



Annex I1

4.     Irrigation Subsidies. Surface and groundwater irrigation subsidies comprise about 6% of
the state revenue deficit. These subsidies are granted in the form of water and power rates which are
substantially below the cost of delivery. Water subsidies affect the relatively affluent Coastal Region
where about 85% of canal schemes are situated. Power subsidies affect the drought-prone upland
areas of the Telengana and Rayalaseema Regions, where about 80% of wells are located. The
surface water subsidies (difference between the cost of delivering water, including the interest costs
of capital invested, and the revenues from it) have reached Rs.7.3 billion in FY95/96, i.e. about 90%
of the total public expenditure on irrigation and flood control in that year. Agriculture consumes
more than 40% of the total available power in the state at a price that is about 2-3% of the average
power production cost. The total agricultural power subsidy amounted to Rs.16.3 billion in 1994/95,
or 184% of the total public expenditure in the sector.
5.     Irrigation Revenue Sources. Until 1984, land revenues and water charges were the two main
revenue sources derived from directly the public irrigation sector. Land revenue was abolished in 1984
and irrigation water charge revenue has since become the only direct revenue source. A Betterment
Levy for recovery of capital costs was successfully challenged in the Courts and its collection
suspended. Direct cost recovery through water charges has been about 0.5% of agricultural value
added. Revenue from irrigation water charges in FY94/95 accounted for less than 1% of total GSDP,
and only about 12% and 46% respectively of ICADD's O&M budget requests and actual allocations
(para. 6). Indirect taxation accounted for 72% of total state tax revenues of which the most important
was the sales tax on agricultural products which averages 4% of gross output.
Current O&M Budgets and Water Charge Revenue
6.     O&M  Budgets. The most pressing financial problem faced by the AP public irrigation
sector is chronic under-funding of O&M works. This has led to widespread deferred maintenance
and a decline of the net canal command area from 2.8 million ha in FY90/91 to 2.3 million ha in
FY94/95 (see table below).

7.    ICADD's O&M  budget requests for surface irrigation schemes increased from Rs.1.98
billion (Rs.708/ha) in FY90/91 to Rs.2,91 billion (Rs.1,263/ha) in FY94/95, while actual O&M
expenditure in this period increased from only Rs.449 million (Rs.160/ha) to Rs.692 million
(Rs.300/ha). Thus the actual O&M allocation in real terms was kept at only about 24% of the actual
funds needed for adequate upkeep of the existing irrigation network. The relatively high unit O&M
expenditures of Rs.300/ha is misleading: about 66% (Rs.200/ha) was spent on repair of the ravages
of deferred maintenance, while 30% (Rs.90/ha) covered salaries and establishment costs and the
remainder of 4% was devoted to normal maintenance. The inadequate O&M allocation is the source
of the "deferred maintenance culture" currently practiced in the irrigation sector and inadequate cost
recovery is the main cause of under-funding of O&M.
8.    Irrigation Charges Revenues. Water charge levels for public irrigation schemes are low. The
present water rates were set in 1988 and have remained unchanged till January 3, 1997 (para. 1 1). The
rates vary depending on whether land is localized as "Irrigated Wet" (IW) or "Irrigated Dry" (ID).
When charge assessments are made, rice and sugar-cane are regarded as "Wet Crops"; however if water
is supplied for rice under rotational (intermittent) water supply where IW land has been de-localized to
ID, dry crop charges would apply. Farmers benefiting from public minor irrigation are charged lower
rates than those located within major and medium irrigation schemes because of the higher O&M costs
of the latter.
9.     Despite their low levels, canal water charges are generally perceived by farmers as taxes and
not as user charges for public irrigation services which are generally poor and unreliable. The above
table shows that FY94/95 water charge revenue collection amounted to Rs.318 million (Rs.106/gross
irrigated ha). Thus revenue amounted to 78% of the water charge assessment, and only 46% of the
actual irrigation O&M expenditure of Rs.692 million. Compared to previous years, FY94/95 represents
a drastic decline in collection efficiency per gross irrigated ha which had increased from over 91% to
97% in FY93/94.
Fiscal Reforms in Public Irrigation
10.    State  Fiscal Adjustment Strategy.   GOAP's counterpart funding  during  project
implementation, and funding for O&M works after completion of the proposed project could potentially
be at risk due to the general fiscal crisis in Andhra Pradesh. However, GOAP has begun undertaking
several fiscal reforms and is engaged in an on-going dialogue with the Bank regarding further fiscal
2
adjustments and reforms . Overall fiscal reforms that would be implemented to improve the finances of
GOAP to bring down the primary deficit to a sustainable level include: (a) enhancement of own tax and
non-tax revenues by reforming the state tax system and increasing cost recovery; (b) re-prioritizing
public expenditure and improving its management; and (c) restructuring the public enterprise sector. In
late 1996, GOAP introduced several measures to ease the severe fiscal crisis including: (i) introduction
of new tax measures; (ii) reduction in the rice distribution scheme by increasing the issuing price and
reducing the amount of rice ration; and (iii) enhancement power tariffs including raising the agricultural
tariff from Rs.0.034/kwh to Rs.0.2/kwh.

11.    Revised Water Charges. As part of its fiscal adjustment strategy, GOAP has gazetted an
Ordinance on January 3, 1997 to increase seasonal irrigation water charges for major, medium and
minor schemes. The previous (1998 to 1996) and current charges are shown in the table below.

B. Cost Recovery Analysis
Revenue Potential of Increased Water Charges
12.    Assessable Area for Water Charges. The increased irrigation water charges should have a
positive fiscal impact and substantially reduce the revenue deficit in the public irrigation sector. Upon
completion of the proposed project, the assessable net area to which water charges apply would increase
from 2.135 million ha (including 0.6 million ha of minor irrigation) to 2.453 million ha. The functional
area of major and medium schemes of about 1.600 million ha (including a functional area of 0.065
million ha in SRSP) would increase to 1.853 million ha. It is assumed that for existing schemes: (a) the
cropping intensity of large projects and minor irrigation remains about 125% and about 116%
respectively; and (b) about 90% of the gross cultivated area remains under wet crops as at present. For
SRSP and SRBC, it may be assumed that the planned cropping intensity of about 150% would be
achieved. Using the above assumptions, the assessable areas for water charges would be as follows:
Post-Project Water Charge Assessment Areas (thousand ha)
Crop Type              Monsoon (Kharif) Season            Post-Monsoon (Rabi) Season

13.    Projected Water Charge Revenue Assessment. Applying the current water charge rates to
the various crop type and scheme category areas totaling 3.092 million ha in the above table, the total
water charge assessment could potentially reach about Rs. 1.35 billion. This amount would be about



Annex 11
Page 5 of 16
double the actual O&M expenditures of Rs.692 million in FY94/95 and equal to the sector's revenue
expenditures of Rs. 1.32 billion in that year. It is also 332% higher that the water charge revenue
assessment of FY94/95. Achievement of this potential however depends on the water charge collection
efficiency. As WUA formation for joint management of major and medium projects is now being
implemented as a matter of GOAP policy, it is expected that 40% of the increased water charges would
be shared with registered WUAs as an incentive rebate. Thus, there a high likelihood of maintaining a
high collection efficiency comparable to that of the early 1990s.
O&M Budget Reform Assumptions
14.    O&M Budget Increase. Since the net area irrigated continues to decline annually because of
the O&M funding deficit, a major rehabilitation effort is required to overcome deferred maintenance
and maintain public irrigation at its current level by increasing O&M budgets. Thus a concomitant
increase in irrigation O&M expenditures is contemplated to match increase in water revenues. Because
the predominant crop grown on existing schemes is rice, it is tentatively assumed for the purposes of
this analysis that the O&M allocation would be Rs.494/ha/year. Assuming that staff costs and overhead
remain constant at Rs.90/ha, an amount of Rs.304/ha would be available for scheme rehabilitation and
normal maintenance.
15.    O&M Burden-Sharing with WUAs. The proposed revenue sharing arrangement (para. 13) is
predicated on the premise that WvUAs would be responsible for maintenance of minor canal systems
under their jurisdiction. Based on ICADD computations for the SRSP scheme, it would seem that the
main canals and headworks comprise about 50% of O&M requirements. Thus, it is tentatively assumed
that where WUAs manage minor canals in their jurisdiction, only half of the maintenance budget would
be required by ICADD for the main network, while WUA O&M expenses would be provided by WUA
members in cash and kind.
Project Cost Recovery Potential
16.    Project Rent. For the assessment of the project's farmers ability to pay the increased water
charge, the Project Rent has been estimated (Table 2). A key assumption with respect to water charges
is that due to the introduction of rotational water supply, farmers would be charged dry crop water rates
of Rs.247/ha even if they cultivate rice as they would have to provide supplementary water supply from
their private wells. Other assumptions about implicit management fees and production risk equivalents
are given in Table 2. On the basis of the incremental water charges and estimated average farm budgets
under the "future without project" and "with project" scenarios, the Project Rent for an average project
farm would be substantial: it could vary from about Rs.9,807/ha to Rs.15,290/ha in SRSP's above and
below LMD areas respectively and attain Rs.23,783/ha in the SRBC area (Table 2).
17.    Unit Capital and O&M Costs. The unit capital costs of irrigation works, including on-farm
development works and physical contingencies but excluding feeder roads, are estimated at
Rs.26,920/ha (US$770/ha) and Rs.22,520/ha (US$640/ha) in SRSP's above and below LMD areas
respectively, and at Rs.80,000/ha (US$2,285/ha) in SRBC. The present value of the above capital costs,
discounted at 12% over 30 years, are Rs.21,781/ha and Rs.18,215/ha respectively above and below
LMD in SRSP, and Rs.65,554/ha for SRBC. Assuming that GOAP will increase O&M budgets to the
Project Rent is defined here as the incremental unit net benefit due to the project after deduction of
appropriate allowances for management and risk.

highest seasonal level of the new water charge (para.14), annual O&M costs (including staff and
overhead) are estimated at Rs.494 per ha for both sub-projects. While this amount may be too high in
the initial years after construction, it has been assumed that the O&M allocation will equal that of the
sector as a whole within a few years. Since Rs.180/ha is currently spent in the above LMD area of
SRSP, the incremental O&M expenditure would be Rs.314 per ha. The present value of incremental
O&M costs is estimated at Rs.2,114/ha for SRSP's above LMD command and Rs.2,793/ha for the
SRBC and below LMD commands.
18.    Cost and Rent Recovery Indices. For the assessment of the water charge as a revenue
generation mechanism for cost recovery for project costs, the project cost and rent recovery indices4
were computed. Since the project's incremental output would generate incremental agricultural sales
taxes, these were included in the computation as an indirect source of cost recovery. For the project
areas, the present and future estimated level of agricultural sale tax revenues per ha of net CCA are
estimated5 as follows:
Agricultural Sale Tax Revenue Estimates-(Rs. Mpr ha)
Present Sales Tax Revenue      Project Sales Tax Revenue
SRBC      Above      Below      SRBC    Above      Below
LMD    LMD                    LMD    LMD
369       553        430       2,319    1,266     1,432
19.    The project cost recovery indices in terms of O&M costs and overall project costs are 285%
and 19% respectively (Table 3) when indirect cost recovery through incremental agricultural sales taxes
are considered. In terms of water charges and O&M costs only, the cost recovery index is 66% as a
uniform dry crop water charge of Rs.247/ha/season is used. Thus O&M costs may only be fully
recovered when all incremental revenue such as sales taxes are considered; however sales taxes are not
adequate to recover capital costs during the projects economic life of 30 years. Given the reliance of
GOAP on indirect taxation, the effective rate of cost recovery is probably understated as increased
agricultural income would generate growth in other sectors of the economy and thus additional tax
revenue.
20.    Whereas project rent constitutes about 91% of the present value of incremental project net
income, the rent recovery index is only 10% (i.e. only 10% of the project rent is recovered through
water charges and agricultural sales taxes). The rent recovery index on water charges is only about 8%.
The latter rent recovery index indicates that, if the project net benefits would materialize, there could be
scope to increase cost recovery further if necessary by raising water charges.
The Cost Recovery Index is the percentage ratio between unit cost recovery revenues (the incremental
water charge and agricultural sales tax revenues) and incremental unit irrigation capital and O&M costs.
The Rent Recovery Index is the percentage ratio between the incremental unit tax and water charge
revenues and the Project Rent. All amounts are expressed in present values discounted at 12% over 30
years in constant 1995 prices.
Assuming one third of cereal and legumes and all cash crops would be marketed and that the incremental
revenue would be entirely due to the investment in the project.

C. Financial Sustainability Assessment
Project Debt Service and Revenue Expenditure Impact
21.    Impact on State Finances. In line with the India CAS, the incremental fiscal impact of the
proposed project was analyzed in view of its significant impact on state finances. Excluding past
project expenditures in FY94/95 and FY95/96 which amounted to 25% and 20% of the sector capital
expenditures respectively, the proposed project as a whole would incur average annual expenditures6 of
Rs.2.86 billion of which GOAP's annual average counterpart contribution would be Rs.1.13 billion
(Table 1). In terms of debt service obligations to GOI, standard on-lending conditions for the project
would entail an average annual debt service of about Rs.0.801 billion in addition to the current state
debt service of about Rs.19.26 billion. Assuming that state capital expenditure can be maintained at its
FY95/96 level of Rs.16 billion, the project would require an increment of about 18% in state capital
expenditure, and raise state annual debt service by about 4.2% (Table 1). Hence, given the state fiscal
stress, the increased water charges and the incremental agricultural sales taxes generated by the project
play a vital role in offsetting project debt service and ensuring revenue for a sustainable O&M budget.
22.    Impact on Sector Finances. Assuming that, with fiscal reform to reduce the state's current
fiscal deficit, GOAP could maintain its FY95/96 level of irrigation capital expenditure of Rs.6.83
billion, the project's annual capital outlay would comprise about 42% of irrigation capital expenditures
during the project implementation period.  Thus if the sector capital budget is not increased,
expenditure on other ongoing projects may have to be reduced. In terms of debt service obligations to
GOI, standard on-lending conditions for the project would increase the current sector average annual
debt service amount of Rs.7.22 billion by about 11% to Rs.8.02 billion. Assuming that, with fiscal
reform, the total sector revenue expenditure can be maintained at its FY95/96 level of Rs.8.54 billion,
the project's annual debt service would comprise about 9.4% of total sector revenue expenditure. Thus
the increased water charge and indirect cost recovery through incremental agricultural sales tax
revenues generated by the project are essential to maintaining the irrigation sector's fiscal status quo.
23.    Annual revenue costs for project O&M after withdrawal of Bank support are estimated to
amount to Rs. 157.1 million if the full O&M burden remains with GOAP, or Rs.94 million if ICADD
only bears 60% and the remainder is provided by WUAs7. Thus if sector revenue expenditure remains
at its FY95/96 level of Rs. 1.32 billion, project O&M costs would comprise about 12% and 7% sector
revenue expenditure without and with WUA burden sharing respectively. The role of a high water
charge collection rate to offset the increased revenue expenditures for project O&M is crucial if the
project is to be physically sustainable.
24.    Revenue Generation Deficit. Under the revised water charge structure, the project could
generate a water charge assessment of Rs. 117.8 million and potential agricultural sales tax revenues of
about Rs.485.6 million. However, the total annual potential revenue of Rs.603.4 million would not be
adequate to cover the total annual expenditure of Rs.958.1 million consisting of an O&M requirement
of Rs.157.1 million and annual average debt service of Rs.801 million. The deficit of Rs.354.7 million
6   Actual annual expenditures are estimated to range from Rs.1.74 billion in FY96/97 to Rs.4.49 billion in
FY98/99 and fall to Rs.1.72 billion in FY2001/2002.
Based on a command area of 318,000 ha for both sub-projects and an estimated O&M budget of
Rs.494/ha. If revenue sharing is instituted whereby 40% of the water charge is retumed to WUAs, it is
assumed that GOAP will only budget Rs.296/ha for O&M.



Annex 1I
Page 8 of 16
would have to be covered from general revenues such as agricultural sales taxes from the agricultural
production of other irrigation projects whose potential annual sales tax revenue is estimated at Rs. 1,101
million (Table 5). If existing project sales tax revenues are regarded as of means of offsetting the
annual average sector debt burden of Rs.7,218 million, the project revenue deficit would reduce their
debt service contribution by about 32%. This deficit actually depends on water charge and sales tax
collection efficiency and could be larger. These deficits would have to be made up by increased
revenue generated by other fiscal reforms.
Required Revenue Collection Efficiency
25.    Breakeven Collection Efficiency Without WUAs. An analysis was made of the water charge
collection efficiency required to cover sectoral O&M costs and the project debt service burden
assuming that ICADD remains responsible for all O&M works and that no revenue sharing is
introduced. This assumes that there is no statewide management transfer to WUAs who would assume
part of the O&M expenditure burden in return for revenue sharing rebates on water charges. Under this
scenario (Table 4): (a) required sector O&M expenditure at Rs.494/ha would be Rs. 1.21 billion; (b)
sectoral debt service would increase by Rs.0.80 billion due to the project (para. 21); and (c) potential
water charge assessment for all public irrigation would be Rs.1.35 billion (para.13). Accordingly,
sectoral O&M costs and incremental project debt service total Rs.2.01 billion. Thus, a water charge
collection efficiency of 90% would be required to recover 100% of estimated sectoral O&M costs, or
60% of the sectoral O&M and project average annual debt service (Table 4).
26.    Estimated agricultural sales tax revenue generated on existing irrigation schemes (Rs.1.10
billion/year) and the incremental sales tax generated by the project (Rs.0.49 billion/year) would total
Rs. 1.59 billion per annum (Table 5). Considering both total agricultural sales tax revenue and water
charge revenues implies that estimated sector O&M costs would still be fully covered if agricultural
sales tax and water charge collection efficiencies drop to 75% respectively (Table 5). However, sector
water charges and incremental sales taxes generated by the project are not able to recover the sectoral
O&M costs and project debt service: There is a 9% shortfall at 100% collection efficiency to a 32%
shortfall at 75%  collection efficiency.  The amount required for break-even would require a
contribution of sales tax revenue generated by other irrigation schemes. The percentage required of
sales tax revenue generated by existing schemes varies from 16% at 100% collection efficiency to 77%
at 75% collection efficiency (Table 5).
27.    Breakeven Collection Efficiency with Revenue Sharing and WUAs. An analysis has also
been made of the fiscal sustainability of the sector on the assumption that revenue sharing in the form of
a rebate on the increased water charge would serve as an incentive for statewide establishment of
WUAs in line with GOAP policy. The proposed revenue sharing arrangement between ICADD/GOAP,
local government (Gram Panchayats) and WUAs would be in the ratio of 50:10:40 and result in a water
charge revenue assessment of Rs.606 million. It is also tentatively assumed that the ICADD O&M
budget allocation would be reduced from Rs.494/ha to Rs.247/ha and result in an O&M budget totaling
Rs.606 million for existing schemes and the proposed project. Under this scenario (Table 6), whereas
water charge revenue would cover O&M expenditure at a collection efficiency of 90%, only 43% of
state O&M expenditure and project debt service totaling Rs. 1.41 billion would be recovered by water
charge revenue alone. If indirect cost recovery via the project's incremental agricultural sale revenue is
added, recovery of sector O&M costs and project debt service drops from as high as 82% at 100%
collection efficiency to 625 at a 75% collection efficiency. The requisite percentage contribution of
agricultural sales taxes generated by other irrigation schemes needed to cover the deficit varies from 2%
at 100% collection efficiency to about 65% at a 75% collection efficiency (Table 6).

Overall Project Fiscal Viability Assessment
28.    The analysis indicates that the significant fiscal burden of the project may be easily offset
provided efforts are made to maintain a revised water charge and agricultural sales tax collection
efficiency of at least 75%. Sustainability in terms of recovery of sector O&M costs could be assured
even if collection efficiency were to fall to 50%. Joint management of irrigation schemes by
establishment of WUAs would significantly reduce the O&M burden expenditure burden albeit that a
significant rebate of water charges is contemplated: the rebate would be used by WUAs towards the
O&M costs of the network under their control. These rebates are indirectly offset by agricultural sales
taxes which indirectly contribute to recovery of project debt. The project design has considered fiscal
risks by requiring the establishment of a Water Charge Review Committee which would periodically
review water charge assessment and collection and advise govemment of the adjustments required to
maintain the financial viability of the sector.

THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
Baseline Survey Draft Terms of Reference
1.    The objective of a baseline survey are twofold: (a) it should provide the necessary
information to assess the current situation before significant project implementation at field level
takes place and (b), establish the data base for the project's irrigation development performance
indicators required to monitor and evaluate project success prior to its closure and preparation of the
Bank Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Based on the assessment of the current situation,
the baseline survey would provide simple and low cost performance indicators to monitor project
success continuously for all sub-project areas. Performance indicators form part of the performance
review of a particular activity to be measured against specified objectives. The baseline survey and
the development objective performance indicators is an interdisciplinary product jointly produced by
irrigation engineers, agricultural scientists/economists, remote sensing specialists, and water resource
managers.
2.     The baseline survey also makes use of secondary data sources such as data collected by the
Revenue Department, Agriculture Department, Bureau of Economic Statistics, social agencies, etc.
Such data would also include, inter alia: land tenure/farm size distribution, number of "Below
Poverty Line" families, agricultural sales revenues generated within command area mandals (or other
convenient Revenue jurisdiction)
3.     The following list gives examples of possible performance indicators for specific project
outputs. The necessary information for the indicators should be obtained through the baseline survey
in order to assess the current situation and develop an estimate of the value of agricultural production
in the sub-project areas. The list is meant as a suggestion of possible indicators. It is neither
complete nor do all of the suggested indicators have to be used for the monitoring process.
(a)    Engineering indicators for operation performance of existing irrigation:
(i)    actual dates of irrigation versus planned dates of irrigation;
(ii)   variations in the flow at main canal and distributary heads as a ratio of their
planned discharges;
(iii)   variations in the flow at minor canals and their tail clusters as a ratio of their
planned discharges; and
(iv)   volume of the water received at the distributary head as a ratio of water
discharged at the main canal head.
(b)    Engineering indicators for maintenance performance:
(i)    actual capacity of main canal and distributaries as a ratio of their design
capacities;



Annex 12
Page 22 of 23
(ii)    maintenance cost per kilometer of canal/drain system maintenance broken
up in 3-4 categories of different ranges of canal sizes;
(iii)   maintenance cost per hectare of command area;
(iv)   actual maintenance expenditures versus budget targets; and
(v)    actual area irrigated as a percentage of planned area (kharif and rabi seasons
separately).
(c)    Agricultural production indicators for performance of SRBC and SRSP:
(i)    command area receiving full, partial and no canal water supplies as a ratio of
total command;
(ii)   production of the principal irrigated crops comprising at least 90% of the
total gross cultivated area under canals, wells and tanks;
(iii)   changes of crop yields in relation to the previous year;
(iv)   changes in the cropping pattern in relation to the previous year;
(v)    changes of farm income in relation to the previous year; and
(vi)   amount and value of the three or four principal crops as a ratio of water
deliveries.
(d)    Remote sensing to indicate performance of scheme completion, rehabilitation and
modernization investments at a command level:
(i)    total area under irrigation in each season (differentiated by canals, wells and
tanks if possible);
(ii)   changes in the cropping pattern/cropping intensity.
(e)    Performance indictors for the institutional restructuring of SRSP/CADA:
(i)    reorganization benchmarks achieved;
(ii)    programming and budgeting plans formulated and submitted on schedule;
(iii)   annual training program for SRSP/CADA personnel completed on schedule;
and
(iv)   number of senior engineers who received management training.
(f)    Performance indicator for farmer turnover (WUA) program:
(i)    number of WUAs established and participating:
a.     collecting water charges;



Annex 12
Page 23 of 23
b.    in joint management with SRSP CADA; and
c.    taking responsibility for O&M.
(ii)   amount of funds collected by farmer councils for maintenance work;
(iii)   number of Distributary Committees involved in scheme management;
(iv)   number of "laskars" working under WUA control; and
(g)    number of WUAs having problems in operation and/or control of irrigators with
access to direct outlets from large canals.
4.     More detailed baseline field surveys would be conducted by stratified farm and participatory
rural appraisal survey to determine representative farm models and their net income levels. These
models would include marginal farmers, small farmers and medium farmers. A representative
stratified sample would be developed and the same farms would be monitored by a survey prior to
project completion.
5.    Appropriately experienced universities and/or research institutions would be chosen in
consultation with the Bank/IDA, to conduct the work. The survey would be funded as part of the AP
III project technical assistance provision.
6.    On completion of the baseline survey, the above monitorable indicators would be
appropriately modified, and modifications included in ICADD's semi-annual and/or annual reporting
system as appropriate as part of the Project Performance Indicators. However, farm models would
only be prepared for the baseline survey, project mid-term review and ICR mission. The baseline
survey would also form a starting yardstick for ICADD monitoring and evaluation activities and for
the project's Implementation Completion Report.

CRITERIA FOR NGO SELECTION






INDIA
THIRD ANDHRA PRADESH IRRIGATION PROJECT
Criteria for the Selection of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)
The project would seek NGO participation in various activities related to:  farmer
organization and beneficiary participation in management, operation and maintenance of irrigation
systems; and resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected persons. Based on a Terms of
Reference prepared by the Irrigation & Command Area Development Department (ICADD), ICADD
would solicit detailed proposals for collaboration from interested NGOs. ICADD would be
responsible for reviewing the proposals and agreeing on appropriate mechanisms to involve NGOs in
the project. The selection of the NGOs would be guided by the following criteria:
(a)    As part of legal requirements, the NGO should be a registered body under the
relevant State Law. It should regularly maintain its accounting records and have
properly audited annual statement of income and expenditure;
(b)    Since the program involves working primarily with small and marginal farmers, it is
essential that the NGO has a proven track record in community development in the
agrarian setting. To avoid creating any biases and misconceptions in the minds of
the people, the NGO should be secular and non-political in the conduct of its field
activities;
(c)    As the project requires NGO support for farmer organization activities at many
diverse locations, NGO's should have adequate numbers of field level staff
conversant with the local dialect and customs, and having a clear understanding of
the socioeconomic and political situation of the areas in which they will operate.
They should also possess excellent communication skills and good rapport with the
community so as to involve them in their own farmer organization or economic
rehabilitation;
(d)    A prior understanding of the concept of an irrigation project and experience in areas
relevant to the NGO's interest in project participation (for instance, in community
development, farmer organization, resettlement and rehabilitation, tribal welfare)
would be desirable. Owing to the nature and extent of the physical coverage of the
program, each selected NGO will be part of the community organization or R&R
process. Hence, the NGO should be able to interact smoothly with, and be a part of
,a team; and
(e)    Finally, the NGO should have internal stability so as to assure long-term support to
the project.
