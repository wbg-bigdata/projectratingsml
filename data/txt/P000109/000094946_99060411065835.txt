IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BENIN
PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
(Credit 2286-BEN)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for a Pre-Investment Project in the
Republic of Benin for which a credit 2286-BEN in the amount of SDR 4.1 million (US$5.4
million equivalent) was approved on June 27, 1991, signed on July 12, 1991, and declared
effective on February 10, 1992.
The credit was closed on December 31, 1997 thirty months after the scheduled closing
date of June 30, 1995. Final disbursement took place on May 25, 1998 at which time a balance
of SDR 300,539.86 (US $399,140.98 equivalent) was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Richard Verspyck (Task Tearn Leader, AFTU2), and Tejbir
Singh Phool (Consultant) and reviewed by Letitia A. Obeng (Sector Manager, AFTU2).
Preparation of this ICR began in conjunction with the Bank's final
supervision/completion mission in November 1996. The borrower contributed to the preparation
of the ICR by providing pertinent information and commenting on the draft ICR. The borrower
prepared an independent evaluation of the project, of which a summary is attached.

PRE-INVESTMENT PROJECT
(Credit 2286-BEN)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.   In 1989, Benin abandoned the socialist path it had followed since 1974 and engaged in a
structural adjustment program with the assistance of the IDA and the IMF. Democratic elections
in 1991 brought about a Government that agreed with the Bank to deepen the structural
adjustment process by: (a) reducing the role of the public sector to the provision of core public
services, (b) reinforcing public sector resource management by improving investment
programming and the management of public enterprises remaining in the Government portfolio,
(c) restructuring the banking system to enable it to resume effective financial inter-mediation,
and (d) reforming incentive policies to promote private sector activities.
Project Objectives
ii.   The Pre-investment Project (PPI) was part of IDA's country assistance strategy and was
also part of a strategy for institutional development and strengthening of ministerial entities. The
MoP set both immediate and long term objectives: first, to relieve the immediate constraints on
investments caused by a lack of properly prepared projects; and, second, create the institutional
capacity for identifying investment proposals and processing them thrcugh feasibility studies,
obtaining financing and establishing final project execution plans. The project included the
following components: (a) an institutional strengthening component (US$1.5 million) benefiting
the Ministry of Planning (MP) and the Coordinating and Programming Units (CPC) of the
technical ministries; (b) an investment preparation component (US$3.6 million equivalent); and
(c) a sectoral priorities component (US$0.9 million equivalent). The project was to benefit the
whole of the Public Investment Program (PIP) and was not established as a project preparation
fund from which Bank's task managers would draw at their own initiative.
iii.   The timing of the project was appropriate in view of the rapidly evolving role of the
public sector and public investment. However, the objective to rapidly build a pipeline of
projects was neither realistic in view of the deficiencies of sectoral capacities nor commensurate
with the amount of financing provided. Drastic changes in the Government's role required a
global rethinking of the specific missions of the sectoral ministries and a cultural change of their
civil servants. Those changes required concentrating first on strategic studies and building
capacities prior to launching new project proposals. Although the lack of coordination between
the MP and the technical ministries represented a major concern of the Government, there is no



- 11 -
evidence that the implementation procedures were discussed with stakeholders outside of the
MP.
Implementation Experience and Results
iv.   Project achievements can be assessed as substantial with regards to institutional
strengthening and capacity building. Through the project, CPC's were established as the
interlocutors of the MP and promoters of sectoral strategies in their respective ministries, which
facilitated the PIP process. The project also promoted the local consulting industry that provided
half the resources used. The achievements of the pre-investment studies component were partial.
The project helped to generate only US$70 million of investments, compared to US$125 million
forecasted at appraisal. The sectoral studies component achieved substantial results by
formulating and disseminating sectoral strategies for transport, agriculture, energy, urban
development, tourism and water resources management. These achievements are likely to be
maintained.
v.    The final project costs of US$6.0 million are identical to the MoP estimates although
only 94 percent of the credit were disbursed. The project financed 32 studies conducted by 9
ministries, consisting of 15 pre-investment studies, 9 sector studies, and 8 studies related to
capacity building. This pattern is significantly different from the one envisioned in the MoP
where pre-investment studies were expected to draw 80 percent of the resources. It is also more
appropriate because most of the ministries had neither the institutional capacity nor the pre-
developed sector strategies that could have formed the basis for rational project identification.
vi.   The implementation period lasted thirty months longer than expected and only 40 percent
of the credit amount were actually disbursed at the scheduled closing date (December 31, 1995).
Completion required three closing date extensions. While MP commitment to the project is not
questionable, a number of factors affected the project and its implementation. Among the factors
not subject to Government control, the most prominent were the default of the consultant
selected to assist the Project Management Unit (PMU) which delayed the actual start-up and the
growing popularity of Benin in the donors' community which reduced the demand for pre-
investment studies and increased the pressure to develop sectoral strategies. The factors subject
to Government control that affected the project were, on the negative side, the protracted
establishment and emergence of the CPC's within the technical ministries and the slow decision-
making process inherent to the Beninese bureaucracy, and, on the positive side, the excellent
quality and stability of project management and the timely provision of counterpart funds.
vii.   The Bank performance has been satisfactory at the identification and the supervision
stages and deficient for preparation assistance and appraisal. The Borrower performance is also
rated as deficient in preparation, and can be rated as satisfactory during implementation, given
the substantial capacity gap that pre-existed.
viii.  The key indicator of the positive outcome of the studies component is clearly the extent
to which studies have led to priority investments or appropriate policy decisions. The annexed
Table 7 provides the outcome/impact of the 32 studies financed by the project. Overall, 90
percent of the studies have a verifiable impact. Among the most prominent are: (a) the studies



- iii -
that allowed to formulate the transport sector strategy and the Transport Sector Project financed
by the Bank and many donors; (b) the agricultural research study; (c) the agricultural filieres
study; (d) the water resources strategy study; and (e) the tourism policy study. A number of
institutional studies also led to reassessing and reformulating policies and procedures related to
the PIP process. It is difficult to find an objective measure of the outcome of the institutional
strengthening component, beyond the qualitative appreciation provided in the assessment of the
development objectives and of the Borrower's performance. However, the impact of the PPI on
the promotion of the local consulting industry is measurable and substantial.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
ix.   The project outcome is rated as satisfactory because the project objectives were met,
components were completed, and covenants complied with.
x.    This project has largely achieved its mandate and downstream operations (projects or
policy reforms) are now the responsibility of the technical ministries. The PMU established for
the PPI also supported the PAGE and will continue to do so as long as the PAGE continues. It is
anticipated that the PMU eventually will be disbanded.
xi.   One may observe situations where a flexible tool similar to the PPI may have some
attractive potential and could for instance facilitate Economic and Sector Work. Future
operations, if any, should take into account the following lessons from the implementation of this
project:
*  All projects aiming at improving processes (in this case, public investment programming)
must be based on an explicit consensus among stakeholders and on a detailed assessment of
their respective capacities.
•  The supervision of a multi-sectoral project is quite time-consuming on the Bank's side, even
if project management performance is satisfactory. It requires a well-functioning country
team, budgetary cross-support and effective coordination arrangements for following-up
studies execution and conclusions dissemination.
•  The preparation of sectoral strategies in sectors where the Government's role and
responsibilities are rapidly evolving requires first building consensus and awareness among
public stakeholders.
*  Genuinely-committed Borrowers may fully finance the incremental operating costs related to
project management, if the Bank does not assume a priori that this is the Bank's
responsibility.

PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT IDENTITY
Name:             Pre-Investment Project
Credit Number:    2286-BEN
RVP Unit:         Africa Region
Country:          Republic of Benin
Sector:           Multi-sector
B. BACKGROUND
1.    Benin spreads over approximately 11 3,000 square km with a population estimated in
1991 to 4.9 million people. A socialist regime that governed from 1974 to 1989 nationalized
most private businesses and financial institutions. Collective farming systems were established
and sizable investments were made to support public enterprise.
2.    The early years of the socialist regime witnessed strong re-export trade in agricultural
products, and buoyant investment activity, that coincided with beneficial economic booms in the
neighboring countries of Nigeria and Niger. The later part of the of this period however, saw
much of the gains being lost as the economic booms in neighboring countries ended and the state
intervention in productive activities failed to deliver the goods. In 1989, the socialist path was
abandoned, and with the assistance of the IDA and the IMF, the Government undertook a
structural adjustment program. Democratic elections held in 1991 brought up a Government that
promised economic reforms.
3.    At the time of the preparation of this Pre-Investment Project (PPI), Benin depended on
subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Commercial and transport
activities were extremely vulnerable to developments in neighboring countries, notably Nigeria.
A budgetary deficit, a bloated civil service, and a money-losing state enterprise system burdened
the Government.
4.   In order to revitalize the administrative system, the Govermment decided to reorganize all
ministries and improve their professional capacity. The Government also decided to rationalize
public investment under the framework of a three-year rolling investment program. In June
1991, the Government agreed with the Bank to launch a second structural adjustment program to
undertake the following: (a) reduce the role of the public sector to the provision of core public



- 2 -
services, (b) reinforce public sector resource management by improving investment
programming and the management of public enterprises remaining in the Government portfolio,
(c) restructure the banking system to enable it to resume effective financial internediation, and
(d) reform incentive policies to promote private sector activities.
C. STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
5.    The PPI was a component of IDA's country assistance strategy. It was designed to
support the economic reforns of recent years and help the Government to revitalize and reorient
the administrative system as a provider of core services for the development of private sector and
of basic services to the population. It was also a part of a global strategy for institutional
development and strengthening of ministerial entities. The then ongoing Technical Assistance
Project (PATPGE, Credit No. 1530-BEN) and a subsequent Economic Management Project
(PAGE, Credit No. 2552-BEN) aimed at (a) reinforcing the capacities of the Ministry of Finance
to improve revenue collection; (b) assisting civil service reform; and (c) setting up and
implementing adequate procedures for the current budget. The PPI complemented these efforts
by focusing on the investment process. The project was requested by the Government who
identified the need for improving the quality of public investment programming in general and
for ensuring better and close coordination between the Ministry of Planning and the technical
ministries.
6.    The MoP set both immediate and long term objectives: first, to relieve the immediate
constraints on investments caused by a lack of properly prepared projects; and, second, create the
institutional capacity for identifying investment proposals and processing them through
feasibility studies, obtaining financing and establishing final project execution plans. These
objectives required the PPI to: (a) rapidly create and sustain a pipeline of investment proposals
identified, formulated, justified and fully prepared for evaluation by potential financing agencies
and ultimately for final project execution; and (b) build up the capacity of the Government to
continuously identify and manage the preparation of priority investment projects in all sectors.
7.    The PPI included the following components: (a) an institutional strengthening
component (US$1.5 million equivalent), for on-the-job training and technical assistance provided
to the Ministry of Planning and the coordinating and programming units (Cellules de
programmation et de coordination, CPC) of the technical ministries; (b) an investment
preparation component (US$3.6 million equivalent), for identifying work, feasibility studies and
detailed execution plans of projects included in the PIP; and (c) a sectoral priorities component
(US$0.9 million equivalent), for studies to upgrade information on sector investment priorities
and to develop sector strategies. In any case, the additional resources provided by the project
were expected to benefit the entire the Public Investment Program. The project was not
established as a project preparation fund from which Bank's task managers would draw at their
own initiative.
8.    Two features of the PPI deserve to be mentioned. First, the project aimed to actively
promote the local consulting industry, the development of which had been hampered by the
concentration of investment preparation capacity in a public Central Projects Bureau (BCP) in



-3 -
the MP. BCP's past performance had been unsatisfactory and its status was to be reviewed by
March 1992. Second, IDA funds could not be used to finance incremental operating costs of the
Project Management Unit; that had to be borne entirely by the Government. This was a
departure from previous practices. For instance, IDA had financed a major part of the operating
costs of the PATPGE.
9.    Evaluation of Objectives. The timing of the project was appropriate in view of the
rapidly evolving role of the public sector and public investment. One may wonder, however,
whether the objective to build rapidly a pipeline of projects was (a) realistic in view of the
deficiencies of sectoral strategies and capacities; and (b) commensurate with the amount of
financing provided. Changing the role of the public sector to become a provider of basic public
services and a promoter of private sector activities required a global rethinking of the specific
missions of the sectoral ministries and a cultural change of their civil servants. Those changes
required concentrating first on strategic studies and building capacities prior to launching new
project proposals.
10.   Evaluation of Risks. The MoP identified a generic risk associated with the PIP at large,
namely that the investment proposals may continue to ignore a rational process. Periodic joint
investment reviews by the Government and IDA and the Government's commitment towards the
reform of the PIP process were expected to mitigate this risk. Although the lack of coordination
between the MP and the technical ministries represented a major concern of the Government, no
specific risk was identified in that respect. There is no evidence, either, that the implementation
procedures were discussed with stakeholders outside of the MP, as the CPC's only existed on
paper at the time of negotiations.
D. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
11.   The Credit financed approximately US $ 4.1 million equivalent for the completion of 32
studies conducted by nine ministries. These included 15 pre-investment studies, nine sector
studies, and eight institutional/capacity building studies. The following table depicts the number
and type of studies conducted by each ministry. Table 7 provides a detailed list of studies.

- 4 -
12.   The sectoral distribution was uneven, as half of the 18 ministerial departments have not
benefited from the project studies. The beneficiaries are not limited to the usual clients of Bank-
financed projects, even if agriculture, infrastructure and education are prominently represented.
Sectors such as tourism, trade, youth and sports introduced a significant diversity, encouraged by
the MP. The latter kept the final say in the selection of studies and did not hesitate to turn down
proposals made by Bank staff at their own initiative. The screening role carried out by the MP
was consistent with the implementation principles agreed with the Bank.
13.   The institutional strengthening component was completed at a cost of approximately
US$1.85 million, of which US$0.6 million were from counterpart funds. As expected, most of
the training activities (with a total cost of US$400,000) were carried out in Benin. Twenty-three
local seminars provided 5,340 person-days of training. Those seminars focused primarily on the
PIP process, public investment expenditure management, procurement of consultants and
sectoral strategies dissemination. Training outside Benin was limited to 158 person-days of
management and public finance training provided mainly in Abidjan, with only 30 person-days
provided overseas. In addition, 18 ministries received office equipment for approximately US
$250,000. About US$600,000 of counterpart funds were devoted to finance the operating costs
of the PMU (including staff costs and logistics), a substantial portion of which supported the
dissemination of sectoral strategies.
14.   Finally, an amount of approximately US$600,000 equivalent was devoted to technical
assistance for a total of 39 person-months. Of this level of effort, 33 person-months comprised
an internationally recruited specialist who assisted the MP in setting up the PMU, establishing
procedures and channels of communication with the technical ministries and building capacity of
the MP and the CPC's to identify studies, and in developing the detailed training program.
15.   Macro Policies Objectives. Macroeconomic studies (e.g. the audit of the import
verification system) represented a negligible proportion of the studies financed by the PPI.
However, the project achieved macro policies objectives by (a) focusing the strategic studies on
the redeployment towards the private sector (particularly in agriculture and transport); and (b)
facilitating the public investment programming process.
16.   Sectoral Policies Objectives. The objective of strengthening sectoral knowledge and
sectoral strategies was clearly achieved as a majority of the studies was devoted to sectoral
studies. Sectoral studies and institutional studies were of good quality; with a few exceptions
(mostly in the energy sector), their outcome was widely discussed and disseminated among the
stakeholders and the donors' community. The PPI was instrumental in the development of
sectoral strategies for transport, agricultural research, energy, tourism and water resources
management. It also contributed to increased knowledge of more specific sectoral issues such as
agricultural diversification, distribution of veterinary products, urban housing policies and
renewable energies
17.   Physical Objectives. While the project did not finance physical investments, its pre-
investment studies component was expected to generate 25 percent of public investments



-5 -
scheduled in the three-year PIP period. Actually, the pre-investment studies helped to generate
about US$70 million of investments in the transport, agriculture, education and commerce
sectors. This amount is lower than the one expected at appraisal (US$125 million) and took
almost twice the time to materialize. It reflects a funding pattern significantly different from the
one envisioned in the MoP; namely that 80 percent of the studies would be pre-investment
studies and the remaining 20 percent sector studies. Less than half of the studies examined
projects while the remainder developed sector strategies and institutional reforms or capacities.
This pattern is considered more appropriate because most of the ministries had neither the
institutional capacity nor the pre-developed sector strategies that could have formed the basis for
rational project identification
18.   Institution Building Objective. Prior to 1992, the Directorate of Planning and
Prospective (DNPP) of the MP prepared the PIP in consultation with technical ministries in an
uncoordinated fashion. Each main directorate of the ministries brought up its own projects
without prior screening and checking against a sectoral strategy. The institutional strengthening
component of the PPI allowed, albeit slowly, CPC's establishment as interlocutors of the MP in
the technical ministries and promoters of the sectoral strategies, and hence to facilitate the PIP
process.
19.   A judicious use of the technical assistance allowed building capacity in the public sector.
The TA avoided direct interference in the delivery of the tasks of the staff of the
ministries-particularly in drafting terms of reference and study proposals. It rightly facilitated
the learning process that was taking place. The TA actually transferred know-how to the PMU
team and to the CPC's. This is evidenced by the smooth continuation of project activities after
the departure of the specialist and also after the change of the project manager in July 1996.
20.   Capacity building was also achieved in the Beninese consulting industry. Local
consultants provided half of the person-months required by studies financed by the PPI. The
monopoly of the BCP on investment design work was abolished and the BCP disbanded in 1992.
E. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
21.   The implementation period lasted thirty months more than expected and only 40 percent
of the credit amount were actually disbursed at the original closing date (December 31, 1995).
While the MP commitment to the project is not questionable-as evidenced by the 100 percent
financing of the incremental operating costs by counterpart funds -a number of factors affected
the project and its implementation.
22.   Factors not Generally Subject to Government Control. The first major delay was
incurred in recruiting the international consultant who would be entrusted with the major portion
of the technical assistance responsibilities. The first candidate selected in February 1992 (his
selection was a condition of effectiveness of the credit) became unavailable shortly after and the
Government was forced to recruit another candidate. The PMI became operational and the
project actually started in October 1992, 16 months after Board Approval.



- 6 -
23.   The donors' community interest in Benin increased once the new Government displayed a
commitment to democratic institutions and economic liberalization. The popularity of Benin
among donors affected the PPI in two ways. It reduced the demand for pre-investment studies,
while the demand for sectoral studies and strategies significantly increased. The reduction of
UNDP commitments in Benin after 1993 reinforced this trend. The PPI took over studies such as
the water resources strategy and the agricultural research review when UNDP funds failed to
materialize.
24.   Factors Generally Subject to Government Control. The protracted establishment and
emergence of the CPC's within the technical ministries and the slow decision-making process
inherent to the Beninese bureaucracy delayed implementation. The early stages of the project
showed inter ministry confusion as the MP tried to impose its choices of CPC heads to the
technical ministries. After that issue was settled, coordination problems emerged in the
relationship of the CPC's with other departments in their own ministries. Most of the CPC heads
had been appointed below the level of Director, which prevented them to directly dealing with
department directors in the highly structured organization of the Beninese civil service. These
problems were resolved in some ministries by appointing the CPC heads at Director level while
in other ministries post upgrading was not necessary.
25.   Other delays were encountered in obtaining a consensus over implementation procedures
and particularly recruiting and contracting of consultants. The technical ministries were reluctant
to let the MP manage the recruitment process. This issue was resolved by allowing the MP to
award contracts under close coordination with the technical ministries, including ministerial
sign-off on study contracts. The transparency and relative speed of the award process eventually
convinced the technical ministries to adhere to the procedures and the ministerial sign-off was
generally obtained in less than three days.
26.   The mandatory approval of contracts by the Ministry of Finance (MF) did not proceed
smoothly. That process required multiple and mostly unnecessary reviews and the approval of
the minister himself, without any possibility of delegation. In addition the MF, contrary to the
technical ministries had no particular incentive to a speedy approval. On average the award
process took 52 days (from proposals submission to the no-objection to award) while the
signature took 116 days, even reaching a peak of more than 200 days in 1994, when devaluation
of the CFA Franc created more pressing priorities. It is interesting to note that the contracts with
local consultants were processed even more slowly than those from foreign firms.
27.   Finally, the longest delays were observed in conjunction with the finalization of study
proposals by the technical ministries. Most of the ministries were not used to preparing terms of
reference and proposals, as required by the PPI's procedures. They were used to signing off on
drafts prepared by consultants and donor agencies (including the Bank). Initially, study
proposals denoted insufficient understanding of the changing role of the Government as they
focused on reinforcement of governmental controls, establishment of new public entities or
promotion of public investments in sectors clearly opened for private financing, such as urban
development or tourism. In order to build capacity and to ensure a better internalization of the



-7 -
studies downstream, the PMU entered into a time-consuming process of successive revisions of
drafts and proposals.
28.   Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control. Initially the MP was
reluctant to comply with its obligation to finance entirely the operating costs of the PMU. Once
convinced that the Bank was unwilling to compromise, the MP found the necessary resources
and provided counterpart funds during the implementation period in a timely manner.
29.   Administratively attached to the DNPP, the PMU was located in separate premises. The
physical separation contributed to a certain isolation of the unit from its interlocutors in the
DNPP, particularly the Division of Sectoral Studies (SES). The SES was supposed to play a
major role in the relationship between the MP and the technical ministries, but actually
concentrated its efforts on the preparation of sectoral roundtables. The PMU insisted, but never
really succeeded to involve SES' staff in its dialogue with the CPC's. The PMU was more
successful in collaborating with the Division of Monitoring and Programming (SPS), in charge
of preparing the PIP, which benefited from several studies and received logistical support.
F. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
30.   The concept of sustainability is relevant only to the institutional strengthening component
of the project. Capacity improvements in the CPC's and the improved relationship between the
MP and the technical ministries are likely to be maintained. The experience and competencies
acquired by the staff of the PMU continue to benefit the PAGE, but there are no guarantees that
they will be adequately employed after project closing.
G. BANK PERFORMANCE
31.   Bank performance is rated as satisfactory at the identification and supervision stages.
Preparation was deficient as the Bank overlooked the risks associated with establishment of the
CPC's. It failed to set realistic priorities in view of the existing capacities and to develop a clear
understanding of the implementation process outside of the Ministry of Planning. Detailed
implementation procedures were actually developed by the technical assistance after credit
effectiveness and after the establishment of the CPC' s.
32.   The same task manager, resident in the infrastructure division, continued with the project
during the entire supervision process and supervision missions generally coincided with other
bank missions. Even if procurement went smoothly, supervision (and particularly the screening
and feedback on study proposals and terms of reference) proved to be time-consuming. The
decision to keep the task management in Washington, rather than in the resident mission was
justified as most of the supervision effort consisted of desk reviews requiring inputs from a
number of country team members at HQ. While this process generally yielded satisfactory cross-
sectoral review, the Borrower felt, with reason, that assistance was sometimes late.
33.   Resident mission staff played, however, a proactive role in facilitating the dissemination
of sectoral strategies and coordinating implementation with the PAGE project.



H. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
34.   The Borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory at the implementation stage and
deficient in preparation. The establishment of the CPC's, critical to project success, should have
been completed ahead of credit effectiveness and the MP neglected to involve the technical
ministries in its dialogue with the Bank. The implementation performance is rated satisfactory,
despite the slow pace of disbursements. Project management was highly satisfactory in terms of
staff continuity, teamwork, procurement (at least for the steps controlled by the PMU), financial
management and monitoring. Audit and progress reports were timely submitted. The MP
financed all operating costs of the PMU, which demonstrates an unusual commitment to the
project. The performance of the technical ministries fluctuated with the quality and motivation of
their CPC's (significantly higher among the major players of the PIP process). The performance
of the MF was disappointing. Nevertheless, the Government's performance improved remarkably
during the extension period.
I. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
35.   The project outcome is rated as satisfactory because the project objectives were largely
met, components were completed, and covenants complied with.
36.   The key indicator of the positive outcome of the studies component is clearly the extent
to which studies have led to priority investments or appropriate policy decisions. The annexed
Table 7 provides the outcome/impact of the 32 studies financed by the project. Among the most
prominent are: (a) the six studies that allowed to formulate the transport sector strategy and the
Transport Sector Project financed by the Bank and many donors; (b) the agricultural research
study that allowed to mobilize US$9 million in support of its action plan; (c) the agricultural
filieres study that was used to formulate a project supporting the development of the private
sector; (d) the water resources strategy study endorsed by donors with implementation financed
by Danish aid; and (e) the tourism policy study that help to reorient Government priorities and to
market Benin's potential among foreign operators. A number of institutional studies also led to
reassess and reorganize policies and procedures related to the PIP process such as: (a) the 1993
assessment of the PIP portfolio; (b) the evaluation of the CPC's; and (c) the preparation of a
manual of procedures for the programming and execution of public investment expenditures.
37.   The outcome of three studies remains uncertain. For instance, the change of senior staff in
the energy sector apparently decreased interest in the outcome of the strategy paper and of the
renewable energies study. Overall, 90 percent of the studies have a verifiable impact.
38.  It is difficult to find an objective measure of the outcome of the institutional
strengthening component, beyond the qualitative appreciation provided in the assessment of the
development objectives and of the Borrower's performance. However, the impact of the PPI on
the promotion of the local consulting industry is measurable and substantial. Resolute efforts
were made to increase the participation of the local consulting industry in project
implementation. Overall, Beninese consultants provided about half the level-of-effort, measured
in person-months (111 person-months out of a total of 216 person-months).

J. FUTURE OPERATIONS
39.   This project has largely achieved its mandate and downstream operations (projects or
policy reforms) are now the responsibility of the technical ministries. The PMU established for
the PPI also supported the PAGE and will continue to do so as long as the PAGE continues. It is
anticipated that the PMU eventually will be disbanded. In that respect, a future evaluation by
OED is a low priority.
K. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
40.   Whether this type of project should be replicated is an open question. Although other
financing instruments, such as the PHRD grants, are readily available for pre-investment studies,
they cannot be used for financing sectoral studies. One may observe situations where a flexible
tool similar to the PPI may have some attractive potential and could for instance facilitate
Economic and Sector Work. Future operations, if any, should take into account the following
lessons from the implementation of this project:
* All projects aiming at improving processes (in this case, public investment programming)
must be based on an explicit consensus among stakeholders and on a detailed assessment of
their respective capacities.
* The supervision of a multi-sectoral project is quite time-consuming on the Bank's side, even
if project management performance is satisfactory. It requires a well-functioning country
team, budgetary cross-support and effective coordination arrangements for following-up
studies execution and conclusions dissemination.
* The preparation of sectoral strategies in sectors where the Government's role and
responsibilities are rapidly evolving requires first building consensus and awareness among
public stakeholders.
* Genuinely-committed Borrowers may fully finance incremental operating costs related to
project management, if the Bank does not assume a priori that this is the Bank's
responsibility.

Aide-memoire
1.    Une mission de l'IDA, effectuee par M. Richard Verspyck, charg6 de projet, a sejourne a
Cotonou du 31 octobre au 11 novembre 1996 pour suivre entre autres l'execution du projet de
Preinvestissement (PPI). La mission a tenu plusieurs reunions de travail avec l1'quipe du PPI et
les representants de divers ministeres. La mission tient a remercier ses interlocuteurs pour leur
disponibilite.
2.    La mission poursuivait les objectifs suivants:
(a)   finaliser avec le MPREPE le programme d'etudes et d'activites realisables d'ici la
cl6ture du proj et; et
(b)   discuter avec la cellule du projet les actions a mener en vue de l'achevement du
projet.
A. REVUE DU PROGRAMME D'ACTIVITES
3.    La perspective d'une cloture prochaine ayant declenche un regain d'enthousiasme pour le
projet, la cellule du PPI avait organise une serie d'entretiens avec les services promoteurs de
seize nouvelles propositions d'etudes et de cinq etudes proposees anterieurement. La cellule avait
au prealable effectue un premier criblage.
4.    L'equipe du PPI et la mission ont rappele les criteres d'eligibilite des propositions
d'etudes (etudes compatibles avec les objectifs du projet, c'est a dire etudes ayant un lien avec la
preparation de projets a inscrire au Programme d'investissements publics) et les contraintes de
duree d'execution, compte tenu des delais de recrutement de consultants et de signature des
contrats. Ceci a conduit:
(a)   a 6liminer onze propositions n'ayant pas de lien direct avec les objectifs du projet;
(b)   a demander une modification du champ des etudes de preinvestissement dont les
delais d'execution depassaient manifestement l'horizon du PPI ou qui incluaient
des etudes d'avant-projet detaille alors qu'aucun financement n'etait identifie;
(c)   a suggerer l'utilisation des possibilites offertes par le projet en matiere de
formation et de fourniture d'equipements en lieu et place de certaines propositions
d'etudes;

5.    Neuf etudes au total (dont quatre nouvelles) peuvent etre financees par le projet; leur liste
detaillee figure en annexe 1. Les propositions techniques et financieres sont attendues pour
l'etude preliminaire de la renovation du centre de Cotonou (a confier a Serhau) et l'audit de la
verification des importations (a confier A Cerdi). Les consultations peuvent etre lancees pour
l'etude de la filiere bois (proposee anterieurement), l'etude d'impact du tourisme et l'etude
d'APD des sites touristiques lagunaires. Les tennes de ref6rence de trois etudes doivent etre
finalises sur la base des commentaires produits par la mission.
6.    La mission a fait observer que la proposition d'etude d'informatisation des services
judiciaires etait prematuree, dans la mesure oii un programme d'assistance global au ministere de
la Justice devait etre defini a la suite des etats generaux. La cellule du projet se rapprochera de la
mission residente de la Banque pour explorer les modalites du soutien que pourrait apporter le
PPI.
7.    La signature des contrats derivant des propositions d'etudes agreees sera subordonnee A la
demonstration que leurs delais d'execution sont compatibles avec la date de cl6ture du projet.
8.    La cellule du PPI et la mission ont enfin revu le programme d'activites de formation.
Neuf seminaires seront organises d'ici la cl6ture, dont deux seminaires d'intemalisation de
strategies sectorielles (tourisme et habitat urbain) et le seminaire de validation du manuel de
procedures de la chaine PPBS des investissements publics.
B. RAPPORT DE FIN D'EXECUTION DU PROJET
9.    L'annexe 2 decrit le processus de preparation du rapport de fin de projet (RFE) qui doit
.tre termine dans les six mois suivant la date de cl6ture du credit. La contribution beninoise A ce
processus contribution comprend:
*  L'1laboration d'un plan pour la phase operationnelle (l'apres-projet), A foumir trois
mois avant la cloture c'est A dire avant fin mars 1997;
* L'etablissement et la transmission A l'IDA avant fin juillet 1997 des informations sur
la realisation du projet qui permettront A l'IDA d'elaborer sa propre contribution au
RFE;
*  L'elaboration d'un rapport d'e'valuation finale du projet, A transmettre A l'IDA avant
fin aout 1997.
10.   L'impact du projet sera evalue essentiellement en fonction:
* de l'utilisation effective des conclusions et resultats des 6tudes financees par le
projet;
* de la valorisation des capacites et competences creees durant l'execution, a la fois au
niveau de la cellule et A celui des CPC et ministeres techniques.
11.   Sur ce dernier point, il est essentiel que MPREPE examine : (a) les modalites de
valorisation des connaissances et competences en matiere de strategies sectorielles accumulees

par 1'equipe du projet ; et (b) son insertion dans les structures operationnelles du ministere. Les
conclusions de cet examen feront partie integrante du plan pour la phase operationnelle
mentionne ci-dessus.
C. RAPPEL DES ACTIONS A ENTREPRENDRE

REPUBLIC OF BENIN
MINISTRY OF PLANNING, ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING
AND EMPLOYMENT PROMOTION
PRE-IN VESTMENT PROJECT
(IDA Credit 2286-BEN)
COMPLETION AND EVALUATION REPORT
Executive Summary'
The Development Credit Agreement for the Pre-Investment Project (PPI) was signed on July 12,
1991 by the Republic of Benin and the International Development Association to assist the
Borrower to: (a) to relieve the constraints on investments caused by a lack of properly prepared
projects; (b) strengthen the Borrower's institutions in charge of identifying investment proposals
and processing them to the execution stage; and (c) provide sectoral strategies and priorities.
Those development objectives were fully justified. However, the expected outcome of the
Project assumed that sectoral strategies were largely available in the ministries and that the latter
would easily prepare the terms of reference of their studies, whereas the reality was less
promising. The Project indeed had to be involved much more than expected to fill the gaps
existing at the level of the ministries.
The Credit Agreement No. 2286-BEN became effective on February 10, 1992 with an amount of
SDR 4,100,000 equivalent to US$5,400,000, which represented 90 percent of the total cost of the
Project, including the Government contribution (US$600,000 equivalent). Twenty-five percent
of the credit amount was allocated to institutional strengthening (technical assistance,
training and equipment) and 75 percent to studies (pre-investment studies and sectoral
strategies). The original closing date was June 30, 1995. However the Project actually started
in October 1992 and the execution of most of the activities was delayed, particularly at the
beginning, by the slow decision-making process. Therefore, following three extensions of the
closing date, the completion of the Project was postponed until December 31, 1997.
Some activities had to be removed from the action plan of the Project to avoid any risk of over-
commitment of project funds that would have resulted from currency exchange variations. The
Credit account will be closed on April 30, 1998. The Borrower expects that 94 percent of the
credit amount will be disbursed by that date. Thus about CFAF 200 million will have to be
canceled due to those circumstances which are not attributable to an unsatisfactory management
of the Project.
The Project documents emphasized-with reason-the privileged working relationship between
the PPI-under the responsibility of the Ministry in charge of Planning-with the coordination
and programming units (CPC) or the directorates of analysis, forecasting and synthesis
This is the English translation of the Executive Summary of the 30-page completion report prepared by the
Project Unit. The full report (in French) is available on request.

(DAPS)-which became later the DPP/DPC--of the ministries. Thanks to the teamwork with
the CPC, the Project fully succeeded to maintain and reinforce the linkage between the
ministry of Planning and the sectoral ministries. On the other hand, it failed to significantly
strengthen the division of sectoral studies (SES) of the Ministry of Planning, Economic
Restructuring and Employment Promotion (MPREPE), although the SES represents an important
constituent of the Planning/Sectors link.
The training and equipment components of the Project benefited all ministries. Nevertheless the
studies benefited only half of the ministries, as the PPI could not refrain to give a priority to the
ministries which actually expressed demand for those services.
The Project Unit-also in charge of the Economic Management Assistance Project (PAGE)-has
been able to carry out its responsibilities with a limited staff of five people. The project
management costs amounted to less than 5 percent of the cost of the services rendered by the
Project. One may notice however that the operations of the Project Unit are hampered by its
cramped office space.
The Project suffered from a certain isolation, particularly in its relations with the donors and
some public enterprises. It also suffered from the slow decision-making process that translated
into unacceptable administrative delays. This inertia is mostly attributable to the Beninese
administration, but the donor is not immune from it. Whatever the source, it has to be
condemned as it slows disbursements, increases the workload with administrative tasks that
supplants more substantive activities and eventually decreases the absorption capacity of external
financing, which is detrimental to the entire community.
The Project also suffered from cash problems that took place: (a) at the beginning of every year
as the Government was slow in releasing the counterpart funds; and (b) in the second semester of
1997, following the donor's practice of progressively recovering the Special Account.
The Project Unit periodically prepared progress reports and action plans that form the basic
institutional memory of the Project and also justified the extensions of the closing date. The
National Debt Agency (CAA) monitored the financial execution of the DCA. The Bank's task
manager regularly supervised the execution of the Project and, between missions, continuously
listened to the Project through frequent exchanges of messages and phone conversations.
The Project financed 39 man-months of technical assistance, of which 33 man-months of resident
(expatriate) TA set up at project inception to: "(i) help to formulate (terms of reference and
letters of invitation) sectoral and pre-investment studies financed under the Project and help to
select consultants; (ii) actively participate to implementing the detailed training program; and
(iii) support the Project Manager in managing and monitoring the project ". The resident TA was
well integrated in the Project, which allowed him to fully carry out his duties by transferring
know-how and experience to the Project Unit and to its interlocutors (CPC/DAPS) in the sectoral
ministries.
The resident TA particularly: (i) proceeded to prepare standard RFP documents and procedures
as a teamwork exercise, the results of which are internalized by the Project Unit; (ii) helped the



Annex B - Borrower's Evaluation Report - Executive Summary                       3
Project Unit and the CPC to better master the preparation of TORs; (iii) allowed the Project Unit
to set up a database on consulting firms and to better understand their working methods.
The Project financed and delivered about 5,340 man-days of training and used most of the time
innovative training approaches (replicated in the PAGE project) characterized by: (i) putting
greater emphasis on behavior and processes (working relationships, information flows, time
management), beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge; and (ii) systematically replicating a
number of training sessions. The training activities had a positive impact on the audience, as
evidenced by the recent initiatives of CPC/DAPS to send direct requests to PPI that are fully
documented and adequately prepared.
The excessive turnover of the staff of CPC/DAPS/DPP limits, however, the impact of training
activities. Moreover, the interrogation on the impact of training leads to raise the question of the
motivation of the staff who would have to apply the acquired knowledge in their daily work.
The Project financed office equipment for the DNPP of the MPREPE and the CPC/DAPS/DPP
of all sectoral ministries (32 computers and 22 copiers). This contribution should be regarded as
a provisional relief.
The Project financed and carried out ten pre-investment studies and 22 sectoral studies
(including institutional development studies and environmental protection studies). Thus the PPI
is to be credited for the improved knowledge of several ministries (transport, agriculture, energy,
housing, tourism...) of their respective sectoral strategies. The weakness or absence of the
sectoral strategies available at the beginning of the Project unexpectedly led to give more
importance to sectoral studies than to pre-investment studies.
The impact on public investment of a number of the studies is clear. Still, it remains difficult to
measure as the recent completion of some studies (particularly sectoral strategies) delayed by
administrative reasons, has not yet allowed to implement their recommendations.
The execution of the 32 studies financed under the PPI represents 216 man-months of consulting
services of which 111 man-months (more than 50 percent) were provided by national
consultants. The Project should be commended for promoting national expertise, while
complying with the donor's directives on the selection and employment of consultants.
Nevertheless the issue of the effective use of the studies carried out and of their contribution to
the socio-economic development of the country remains the main concern in assessing the
Project. The cost of the capital borrowed (and to be reimbursed in foreign exchange) is not zero.
This capital resource should be devoted to increasing the national wealth to raise-through the
subsequent increase of fiscal resources-the national capacity to reimburse credits. This in turn
assumes that the studies-contrary to the often prevailing situation-are no longer an end by
themselves, but rather are regarded by a genuine 'Development Administration', as the starting
points of a decision-making process cleared from its present delays and weaknesses.
The completion of the PPI does not warrant by itself the emergence of a new project. But as the
final assessment of the PPI recognizes the merits of the Project, it also notes that its work is



Annex B - Borrower 's Evaluation Report - Executive Summary                    4
partly incomplete. It is therefore recommended to set up new ways of assistance in the post-
project phase.
Keeping in mind this concern for continuity, the Borrower first wishes that the closing of the
credit will not penalize the activities removed from the action plan to avoid over-commitments
and that those activities be taken over by another source of funds, to be identified. The Borrower
prepared a list of the relevant activities with a cost not exceeding CFAF 200 millions.
Regarding other activities to program in the post-project phase (with a total cost to be
determined, but higher than the above-mentioned amount), the evaluation team wishes that they
be taken over-after the necessary amendments-by the PAGE, the objective of which is "to
strengthen competencies, capacities and performances of civil servants involved in the
management of the national economy". The latter solution would limit the number of projects
while ensuring the necessary continuity between the PPI and the PAGE, which are managed by
the same Project Unit. It is recommended that the Borrower and the Donor jointly assess the
feasibility of this arrangement in a pragmatic way prior to proceed-preferably in the context of
a mission of identification and programming of IDA assistance- with the detailed description of
the activities of the post-project phase.
In case it would be decided that the scope of the PAGE could not be extended to take over all the
above activities, the evaluation teamn regrouped them under two separate categories.
The first category would include activities-other than studies-which were not completed
under the PPI and which are within the scope of the PAGE. This requires (i) to broaden the
audience of the PAGE (presently restricted to the two macro-economic ministries, six sectoral
ministries and partly the MFPTRA) to all ministries; and (ii) to extend the project beyond
December 31, 1998, which is already agreed in principle. This category would include, but
would not be necessarily limited to, the following activities: training, operational and
institutional support to the DNPP and creation of an information center for studies.
For the sake of continuity, the training activities would target all the actors of the
Planning/Sectors link and particularly the DPPs. They would cover the following themes:
improvement of the decision-making process, design and preparation of TORs, sectoral
assessments and strategies, the "Public Expenditure Review" approach...
It is important that the post-PPI phase focuses specifically on the operational and institutional
strengthening of the DNPP to ensure that the latter fully and sustainably carries out its
responsibility to improve the efficiency of the links between MPREPE and the DPPs. This
requires not only to monitor the execution of the studies included in the Public Investrnent
Program (PIP), but also to monitor the implementation of their conclusions and
recommendations.
In that respect, DNPP should be able to intervene to promote or even decide on "strategic
investments" and on sectoral economic policies whenever such actions of the public sector would
be a prerequisite or would facilitate investments and employment generation by the private
sector.



Annex B - Borrower 's Evaluation Report - Executive Summary                       S
The scope of the PAGE likely includes the strengthening of the SES, which is responsible for
helping ministries to formulate the sectoral strategies with which investment projects have to be
consistent. Therefore, it would be appropriate to schedule-as part of the strengthening of
DNPP/MPREPE-a specific support (training, equipment) to the operational setup of
SES[MPREPE.
The establishment of an information center / library for studies is a logical prerequisite to
improving their use by the private as well as the public sectors.
The second category would include studies (pre-investment and sectoral strategies) that
uphold more directly the stamina of public investments (and indirectly of private
investments); they would be carried out within an institutional framework (to be determined) that
would take into account the following prerequisites:
(i) prior knowledge (from data available in SPS/MPREPE which is responsible for preparing the
PIP) of the total cost of studies corresponding to the projects included or to be included in the
PIP and of the amount of resources available from the donors community to finance them;
(ii) strengthening the consensus between donors and the Government on the studies to be carried
out in the first year of the PIP so that, during the second year, the execution of the PIP will be
focused on sectoral priorities agreed and supported by studies carried out in a consistent fashion.
One of the objectives is to optimize the ratio between the cost of studies and the cost of
investments by identifying at the study stage the operator (public or private) that will be
responsible for implementation;
(iii) strengthening the communication between the public sector and the private sector so that the
latter becomes a genuine "proposal force" and contributes to the formulation and the
implementation of the sectoral strategies.
The pursuit of study activities in the post-PPI phase would have two development objectives.
First, to contribute to restructuring the economy, in order to avoid that scattered development
initiatives would lead to under-utilize resources. Second, to consolidate the dialogue between the
public sector and the private sector, whereas at present, each of the two alleges the weaknesses of
the other as a justification to perpetuate its isolation.
