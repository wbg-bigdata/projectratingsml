INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION OF TiHE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
GODAVARI BARRAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of India (GOI) for the equivalent of
US$45 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for completing
the construction of a barrage across the Godavari river. The proceeds of
the credit - except for the preparation of command area development projects
in other States of India (US$0.3 million) - would be channeled to the Govern-
ment of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) in accordance with the Government of India's
standard terms and arrangements for the financing of State development
projects.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(402-IN dated May 7, 1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 20, 1974. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and the difficulty of its economic conditions. India's
economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, many of which are
attributable to the open political system, where the reconciliation of con-
flicting political views tends to inhibit optimal economic solutions; others
are due to the sheer magnitude of the task facing the Government. Governing
a country divided into more than 20 States with a population of some 580
million and over 60 languages is an extraordinary responsibility. The
country's poverty and poor natural resource endowment, supplemented by a
net transfer of external resources averaging in recent years well below
US$1 per head per annum, have imposed sharp limitations on the rate of
growth. Any judgment of India's economic performance must take these under-
lying circumstances into account. So, also, must account be taken of the
uncertainties imposed by the erratic availability of water. A bad monsoon,
which is inevitable from time to time, has a pervasive influence over the
entire economy and wipes out the results of years of effort.
4.        In the past 25 years, national income has grown at nearly 4 per-
cent per annum, which compares very favorably with the average annual growth
rate of less than 1 percent during the preceding 50 years. Population has
also grown faster in the past two decades than previously, but per capita
income has nevertheless risen from a more or less stagnant level in the first
half of this century to achieve an average growth of roughly 1 percent a
year since independence.



- 2 -
5.        Progress has been impressive on many fronts, but disappointing on
others and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs. The
growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education, health
services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved at high
cost and has yielded results of variable quality. Many industrial and agri-
cultural investment schemes have been highly successful, but others have
taken excessively long to be completed and have operated well below full
capacity. In some regions of the country growth and structural change have
been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many other parts of
the world, but in other regions there has been stagnation and possibly even
decline. Despite these improvements and although the distribution of income
in India is relatively even by comparison with many other countries, there
has been little impact upon the living standards of the vast masses of the
urban and rural population. The Government has become increasingly concerned
about the plight of the lower income strata, which - conservatively measured -
consist of some 200 million people with incomes of less than US$60 per head
per year, and has initiated in recent years a variety of programs specifically
designed to alleviate poverty.
6.        The structure of the economy has been slow to change.    Agriculture
remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 43 percent of national pro-
duct in the early 1970s compared with around 49 percent twenty years previously.
The share of output contributed by the industrial sector has increased only
slowly and since the late 1960s has remained approximately constant at a
level of 23 percent. There has, however, been a shift in the composition of
industrial production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital goods now
contributing about one-third each, compared with an overwhelming preponderance
of consumer goods production 25 years ago.
7.        The economic report of May 1974 contained a review of the immense
difficulties confronting the Indian economy as the Fourth Plan period drew
to a close. The final year of the Plan, 1973/74, witnessed a severe deterio-
ration in India's terms of trade which was led by, but by no means restricted
to, the dramatic increase in oil prices. The resulting balance of payments
difficulties were compounded by the need for food imports following the
drought of 1972/73, in order to sustain the public distribution system on
which the poorest section of society is particularly dependent. Given India's
pervasively agricultural economy, the drought also had the effect of causing a
general slow-down in economic activity which was further aggravated by
infrastructure constraints, particularly widespread power shortages and
labor problems of Indian Railways. Food shortages and other scarcities
touched off an unprecedented inflationary spiral fueled by large budgetary
deficits which were at least partly attributable to mounting expenditures
for drought relief. The inflation in turn contributed to labor unrest while
efforts to cope with it through budgetary cuts affected, among other things,
the level of real expenditures for development programs.



-3-
8.        Thus, at the commencement of the Fifth Plan period (1974175-1978/79)
the most urgent tasks facing policy makers were: to get agricultural pro-
duction moving again; to bring inflation under control; to reduce India's
dependence on oil imports by compressing energy consumption and by formulating
and implementing programs to develop domestic energy sources; to boost export
earnings and to tap additional sources of aid in order to sustain imports;
and, finally, to maintain a minimum investment program so as to avoid economic
standstill in the longer run. Even in the best of times, it would have been
extremely difficult to pursue simultaneously such a variety of potentially
inconsistent objectives.
9.        Events since the preparation of the last economic report provide
little encouragement. For the second time in the last three years, the weather
has let down India's farmers with the result that the khariff (fall) crop
recently harvested is believed to be considerably below last year's (about
60 million tons as compared with 67 million tons). The outlook for the next
rabi (spring) crop is uncertain in view of continuing shortages of power
for irrigation pumps and possible fertilizer shortages. The reduced avail-
ability of foodgrains, the depletion of official food stocks, India's
balance of payments difficulties, the inflationary setting and frequent
changes in the Government's food procurement policy have led to hoarding for
both speculative and insurance purposes. Procurement for public distribution
has become extremely difficult. The public kitchens established in some of
the worst-affected areas (Bihar, Bengal, Orissa) bear evidence of the serious-
ness of the situation as well as of the Government's determination to prevent
extreme hardship.
10.       The spectre of massive food import requirements hangs over an
already very difficult balance of payments situation in the current year.
The need for six to seven million tons of foodgrains imports appears evident,
and considerably more than half this amount either has been delivered already
or has been purchased. There is little evidence of a major break in the
prices of other commodities imported in substantial quantities by India (e.g.
oil, fertilizers, steel, rock phosphiate).
11.       One of the few bright spots in the balance of payments picture
has been the growth of export earnings. Export earnings recorded an un-
precedented increase of 22% in 1973/74 and are expected to rise again by
29% in 1974/75. While these increases - particularly that in 1973/74 - are
primarily attributable to unit value increases caused by worldwide inflation,
there is greater willingness to take advantage of export opportunities, as
illustrated most dramatically by the recent diversion of sugar from domestic
consumption to exports.
12.       Nevertheless, despite the increase in export earnings, India is
expected to run a massive trade deficit this year - probably of the order
of US$1,800 million as compared with US$560 million in 1973/74 and a negli-
gible one the previous year. Moreover, despite the magnitude of the current
deficit, it is unlikely that India's imports, excluding foodgrains, will be



- 4 -
as large in volume as in 1972/73. In addition to financing a trade deficit
of this order, India will have to meet debt service payments of about US$730
million. These financing requirements will be partly offset through Consortium
assistance and Non-Consortium aid (including assistance from oil producing
countries), which are together expected to reach disbursement levels of
about US$1,750 million in 1974/75 compared with about US$1,175 million in
1973/74. Nevertheless, these various sources of financing fall short of
India's current requirements. India will have to draw on her foreign
exchange reserves, which, at about US$1,400 million, are currently
equivalent to less than three months of imports. During Fiscal Year 1974/75,
India has drawn down her First Credit Tranche in the IMF for $282 million,
as well as her Gold Tranche for $91 million. The Government has also taken
advantage of the Oil Facility, from which $240 million was drawn in October,
out of an entitlement of $773 million.
13.       On the domestic front, the Government's present efforts are con-
centrated primarily on maximizing production in key sectors through a system
of priorities in the allocation of scarce resources and through careful
monitoring of developments and performance. In agriculture this entails
provision of power on a priority basis for minor irrigation and fertilizer
production and allocation of adequate foreign exchange for as much fertilizer
as can be imported from the limited world supplies. Similarlv, efforts are
made to identify production bottlenecks in such sectors as fertilizer pro-
duction, coal mining and power generation; and special arrangements exist
for meeting expeditiously the foreign exchange requirements of these sectors
for such items as captive power units where appropriate, spares and replace-
ment parts. The railways are also tied into this system and accord priority
to the movement of goods required by these sectors. In the fertilizer, coal
and power sectors, senior officials are provided on a continuing basis with
detailed production figures along with explanations for production shortfalls.
Attempts are also being made to rationalize the administrative machinery of
the Government in these sectors, as evidenced by the October 1974 decision
to bring irrigation under the wing of the Food and Agriculture Ministry
and to regroup power generation and coal mining under an Energy Ministry.
14.       In the short term, however, there are limits to the extent to which
India's dependence on oil imports can be reduced and production of domestic
sources of energy can be stepped up. Insofar as the compression of demand
for oil products is concerned, these limits are determined, on the one hand,
by the relatively small proportion of oil products used for private con-
sumption (possibly one-sixth) and, on the other hand, by the limited avail-
ability of domestic substitutes (i.e. coal and power). The 13 million tons
of crude oil plus 3 million tons of product imports planned for the current
year probably represent the lower limit beyond which these imports cannot be
curbed without serious repercussions on domestic production. Had consumption
been allowed to grow in line with recent trends, the present level of crude
and product imports taken together would probably be of the order of at least
18 million tons.



15.       A major effort is being made to use existing capacity as fully as
possible throughout the economy. To this end, despite the serious balance
of payments problem described above, the Government is pursuing a relatively
liberal policy toward imports of raw materials required by industry. Never-
theless, it is hard to get away from the current infrastructure constraints
and particularly the shortage and unreliability of power supplies which,
though somewhat eased, continue to affect production. Fiscal and monetary
policies, including the cutback in budgetary expenditures and limitations
on bank credit, are also restraining industrial output; and there is some
evidence that, due to rapidly rising food prices and the consequent erosion
of real purchasing power, the demand for some consumer items and industrial
projects is being affected. Given the various constraints, there is likely
to be little or no industrial growth in the current year which, in combination
with the current agricultural situation, makes it unlikely that there will
be any GNP growth either. In regard to inflation, the Government has made
impressive efforts to curb budgetary expenditures and to tap additional
sources of revenue. In spite of continuing food shortages and other scarcities,
these actions appear now to have achieved some results as the rate of inflation
had declined to 23% by the end of November 1974.
16.       In present circumstances the Draft Fifth Plan, published in late
1973, has not been finalized. In real terms investment in the current Annual
Plan is about 30% below the annual level implicit in the Draft Fifth Plan,
and even this is unlikely to be reached. To adjust to reduced resource
availability a number of investments are being postponed. Expenditures on
some of the social sectors such as education and family planning are un-
fortunately also affected. The focus once again is primarily on investments
in key sectors such as fertilizer, coal, power, and steel, and quite rightly
within these sectors the emphasis is on completing ongoing investments
before committing resources to new schemes.
17.       In the long run, given her groundwater, coal, hydroelectric, iron
ore, non-ferrous metals and human resources, India undoubtedly has the
capability to overcome her present difficulties. It is, however, clear that
to overcome them and to resume the interrupted process of economic develop-
ment, India will require substantially larger capital inflows than foreseen
by the authors of the Draft Fifth Plan. It is equally clear that as large
as possible a proportion of these requirements should be provided on con-
cessional terms. However, even on very optimistic assumptions regarding
India's success in narrowing her resource gap and the response of both
Consortium and other donors, a gap will remain between external financing
requirements and the availability of concessional aid.
18.       India's external public debt outstanding on March 31, 1973, stood
at US$9.9 billion. As a consequence of world-wide inflation and its effects
on India's export earnings, service payments of about US$730 million due
on this debt in 1974/75 are expected to be equivalent to about 17% of merchan-
dise exports as compared with about 26% in 1972/73. However, substantial
additional debt will have to be incurred as a result of increases in the
prices of India's imports. In the future, therefore, the debt service ratio
is likely to rise, given the magnitude of India's requirements and the un-
avoidability of having to finance part of these on non-concessional terms.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
19.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 42 loans and 62 development
credits to India totalling US$1,229 million and US$2,880 million (both net of
cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$661 million has been re-
paid, and US$1,063 million was still undisbursed as of November 30, 1974.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of November 30,
1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$42.3
million, of which US$7.6 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$20.8 million, US$13.7 million
represents loans and US$7.1 million equity. A summary statement of IFC opera-
tions as of November 30, 1974 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
21.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting minor
irrigation and other on farm investments through agricultural credit operations.
Major irrigation, marketing, and seed development are other agricultural
activities supported by the Bank Group. In recognition of the importance of
adequate fertilizer supplies for agricultural output, the Bank Group has been
active in financing the expansion of fertilizer production. Apart from
investments in fertilizer plants, the Bank Group has lent support to the in-.
dustrial sector through its sizeable assistance to development finance
institutions, in a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-
scale enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and components
for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating better
capacity utilization in these sectors. The Bank Group has also been active
in supporting infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and
railways. Family planning, education, water supply development, and related
urban investments have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
22.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remains highly
relevant. The priority of the agricultural sector has been further enhanced
in the present world commodity situation. Thus, projects designed to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs such as
credit for on-farm investments, command area development of existing irriga-
tion schemes, fertilizer and seeds form an important aspect of the Bank
Group's program for the next years. Special emphasis will be given to
projects designed to increase the productivity of small farmers and landless
laborers. Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial investments
will focus on energy-related projects. Repeater credits for power and rail-
ways have high priority in this context, and discussions are under way with
the Government in an effort to identify and prepare proiects specifically
designed to facilitate coal production and coal transport. Lending for
fertilizer projects, which has been an important feature in recent years,
is expected to continue to occupy prominent place in the future program.



23.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic reports
and of the discussions within the India Consortium. The need for readily
usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time when
output and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different price
situation. Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial raw
materials and components continues to be an essential element within the
overall program of assistance. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agriculture,
education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make an
appropriate contribution to the financing .of projects in these sectors, it
is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
24.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly.   In 1969/70 the Bank Group
accounted for 34 percent of total commitments, 13 percent of gross disburse-
ments, and 12 percent of net disbursements as compared with an estimated
35 percent, 27 percent and 37 percent, respectively, in 1973/74, and the
contribution of the Bank Group is expected to continue growing. Whereas on
March 31, 1973, the Bank Group share of India's outstanding external public
debt was 21 percent, by 1979 it is projected to account for about 25 percent.
Because Bank Group assistance to India is predominantly in the form of IDA
credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise slowly. In 1973/74 about
12 percent of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank Group.
PART III - AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION IN INDIA
General
25.       Agriculture is the most important sector in India; it engages
70 percent of the labor force, has recently contributed an average of about
45 percent of GNP, and accounts for a major share of exports. Consequently,
investments in agriculture have been given priority, especially since the
mid-1960s, and deserve continued emphasis over the next five years.
26.       Since independence, the overall growth rate of agricultural pro-
duction has averaged about 3 percent per annum. This low overall rate of
growth in the agriculture sector obscures considerable variations over
shorter periods of time, between crops, and between regions. The overall
rate has been very much affected by the serious droughts in 1965 and 1966
and again in 1972 and 1974. At the same time, the success of high yielding
varieties of wheat produced increases in wheat production of about 20 percent
p.a. between 1967 and 1971. Other foodgrain crops, notably rice, have not
enjoyed anything like the same success, as the introduction of high yielding



- 8 -
varieties has encountered difficulties arising from local climatic and
ecological conditions. The effects of the green revolution, which primarily
affected wheat, have been concentrated in north western India, very largely
on account of the advanced state of agriculture in that area and the avail-
ability of irrigation.
27.       Despite the progress made in many aspects of food production,
India's agriculture remains heavily dependent upon the vagaries of the weather.
A major factor in reducing this dependence will be the rehabilitation and
expansion of irrigation and the more effective use of existing investment in
irrigation facilities. The Government is also placing emphasis on the improved
supply of inputs such as seeds and fertilizer, agricultural credit, and exten-
sion services.
Irrigation
28.       Over the first half of the twentieth century, the area under irriga-
tion in India increased by only about 1 percent p.a. to reach slightly more
than 20 million hectares in 1950/51, or about one fifth of India's cultivated
land. Out of these 20 million hectares, about half was served by major and
medium irrigation works.
29.       Irrigation development has appropriately received increased atten-
tion since independence, and substantial resources were devoted to it through-
out the four Five Year Plans. Outlays for irrigation development during the
first three Plans and during the three Annual Plans 1966-69 totalled Rs 26.8
billion, and the fourth Plan allocated Rs 16 billion to irrigation. While
minor irrigation (other than groundwater utilization) increased only slightly
from 6.4 million ha to 7.5 million ha, the area covered by major and medium
svstems had more than doubled to 21.4 million hectares compared with an
estimated ultimate potential for irrigation of 57 million hectares. But of
the new additional acreage of about 10 million ha, only 80 percent was being
utilized, and much of that inefficiently.
30.       The Second Irrigation Commission of 1972 and the National Commission
on Agriculture, which reported in 1973, found that the under-utilization of
irrigation potential was attributable to the lack of integrated development
in the irrigated areas, insufficient farmer training and extension service,
and laclc of administrative coordination. It has been unofficially estimated
that the major part of recently completed irrigation projects require
additional investments of between US$200 and US$500 per ha before they can
become fully productive. Accordingly, for the Fifth Plan period (1974-1979)
various measures have been designed to improve utilization, and a Command
Area Development Department has been set up in the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture to coordinate work on a list of high priority projects.
31.       In view of the substantial investment that has already been made
in major irrigation works, the economic return on investment which facilitates
the most effective use of the water provided can be very high. Consequently,
command area development has been given high priority under the Fifth Plan



- 9 -
proposals, and a relatively large proportion of public sector investment in
irrigation has been allocated for this purpose. Further funds, doubling this
allocation, will be made available from institutional sources for credit.
In addition, major institutional changes have been proposed affecting the
coordination of services in command areas and the administration of credit.
Agriculture and Irrigation in Andhra Pradesh
32.       Andhra Pradesh, with an area of 27.5 million hectares and a popula-
tion of about 43 million, is one of the largest States in India. In terms
of size and population it compares with Italy. It is a predominantly agri-
cultural State, 82 percent of its population being rural. About 40 percent
of the total area of the State is cultivated. Rice, millet, pulses, and
groundnuts are the major crops. A quarter of the total cultivated area is
under irrigation. The rest depends upon rainfall, which ranges from 500 mm
annually in the southwest to 1100 mm in the northeast.
33.       The main source of irrigation in the State are two major rivers,
the Godavari and the Krishna, and their tributaries. Numerous irrigation
canals branch from these rivers. The upland areas use rainfed tanks and
groundwater for irrigation.
34.       During the past 25 years, Andhra Pradesh State has invested heavily
in irrigation projects. However, the returns have been rather low, mainly
because the available resources have been spread over too many projects,
resulting in long construction and gestation periods and delayed benefits.
Two major projects, Nagarjunasagar and Pochampad, are presently under
construction, the latter with Bank Group assistance. When completed, they
will benefit about one million hectares.
35.        Progress of the Pochampad Project, for which IDA lent US$39 million
in 1971, was satisfactory during the first two years of project implementation,
and both, construction work and credit disbursements, were ahead of schedule.
However, as a result of acute shortages in building materials and explosives,
which occurred in 1973, completion of essential project parts are likely to
fall more than one year behind schedule. A Bank mission which visited the
project site in October 1974 reported that dam construction is now progress-
ing satisfactorily and that some water has been impounded behind the dam for
the first time. Land development, however, is increasingly lagging behind
water availability in the Pochampad command. The Government, aware of the in-
adequacy, has prepared a Command Area Development project for the Pochampad
area and requested IDA financing. This project is tentatively scheduled for
appraisal in 1975/76.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.        In January 1969, a Bank Group Irrigation Reconnaissance Mission
visited India at the request of the Government of India. It identified
eight irrigation projects including the Pochampad Project and the proposed



- 10 -
Godavari Barrage Project. For the latter, preparatory work in the Bank came
soon to a halt due to the issue that arose over the requirement of interna-
tional competitive bidding for the civil works included in the project. In
April 1974, on the basis of the new Bank Group policy regarding preferences
for local contractors, the Government of India asked for IDA assistance in
implementing the project. The project was appraised in June 1974 after
preparatory work by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
37.       A credit and project summary is given in Annex III.    A report
entitled "India - Appraisal of the Godavari Barrage Project" dated January 10,
1975, Report No. 525-IN, is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors.  Negotiations were held in Washington from December 19 to 31,
1974. The Borrower was represented by Messrs. V.N. Rajagopalan, Director,
iMinistry of Finance, and K. C. Goyal, Member, Central Water and Power Com-
mission. The Government of Andhra Pradesh was represented by Messrs. M.
Gopalakrishnan, Secretary, Public Works Department, and C. D. Murray, Chief
Engineer.
The ProjeLt
38.       The proposed project is the construction of a barrage across the
lower Godavari river at Dowlaiswaram, which would secure irrigation water
for a command area of about 400,000 ha in the districts of West Godavari and
East Godavari. The barrage would replace an existing weir, which is in danger
of collapse. The existing weir was completed in 1852 and has deteriorated
with the passage of time, in spite of continuous maintenance efforts. In 1965
a high-level committee of GOI reviewed the state of the weir and recommended
immediate construction of a new barrage.
39.       The new barrage would be located 24 meters upstream from the old
weir and would use the existing structure as its downstream protective apron.
The barrage would be 3,600 meters long and would consist of four sections,
separated by small islands. It would be divided into 175 bays, each of
which would be equipped with a spillway gate. The gates would raise the
pond level one meter higher than the level of the existing weir. Three
main canals serve the command area in the Godavari delta.     Some 160,000
holdings, with an average farm size of 2.5 ha, are supplied with water from
the weir. About 65 percent of the farms are owner-cultivated. Average
annual farm income is about Rs 7500 due to the intensive cultivation under
perennial irrigation.
40.        The Godavari delta is one of the most productive agricultural areas
of eastern India. The most important crop is paddy, which covers more than
90 percent of the area in the wet season (kharif) and about one third of the
area in the dry season (rabi).   About one half of the klarif crop and 80%
of the rabi crop are high-yielding varieties of rice. Average paddy pro-
duction in the area during the last five years was about 1.4 million tons.
Other crops in the command area are sugarcane (perenniallv) and pulses,
edible oilseeds and chillies (in the dry season on residual soil moisture).
Cropping intensity is approximately 150%. Total net value of production in
the area is estimated at Rs. 900 million. The proposed new barrage would
help safeguard this production.



41.       Agricultural extension services are well organized and adequatelv
staffed. In both districts of the command area, a Deputy Director of Agri-
culture, assisted by specialists, is in charge of agricultural extension
services at the district level, while Village Development Officers provide
extension services in the villages. Two modern seed processing units serve
the area. Fertilizer and pesticides are distributed by the Department of
Agriculture, the Cooperatives Department and private traders. These various
services are well organized and adequately staffed.
42.       The project includes also the execution of a technical study in
preparation for a second phase project that would concentrate on command
area development in the Godavari delta, particularly modernization of irri-
gation and drainage, groundwater development and on-farm works. In addition,
it would include assistance to GOI for the preparation of command area devel-
opment projects in other States of India.
Project Implementation
43.       Site exploration for the whole barrage, hydraulic model studies
and detailed designs for part of the structure are complete and are sufficient
for the tendering of the whole structure. Design standards are satisfactory.
Responsibility for the preparation of working drawings, construction
specifications, negotiation of contracts, and supervision of construction
rests with the Public Works Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh
(PWD). The Department, which has been in charge of several major construction
works during the last two decades (including the Pochampad Project), is fully
competent to carry out this task.
44.        Construction of the Ralli section of the barrage, where failure of
the old weir is most imminent, started in 1971, but progress has been slow
due to lack of funds, and at present the completed portions equal only about
5 percent of the total works. The quality of construction of these portions
is satisfactory. Parts of the Ralli section that are already completed or
contracted are not included in the proposed project.
45.        The project work would be divided into portions of such size that
foundation excavation, sheet piling or construction of the curtain walls,
placement of concrete and construction of piers to above high water level can
be completed in one working season, which lasts from November to June. As
soon as a sufficient number of bays have been completed, the vertical gates
and hoist arrangements would be installed. A plan for emergency repairs to
the existing weir during the construction of the new barrage has been prepared
and equipment and materials would be kept ready near the weir to enable repair
work to start immediately in case the weir should breach. 1/
46.       Project implementation would take place against the background
that the old weir may fail. Not only would such a failure have serious
1/   See Section 3.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement.



- 12 -
repercussions for agriculture in the area, but also from an engineering
point of view it would make more difficult and more costly the task of
completing the new barrage. The Association has emphasized the need
to minimize the construction period. GOI and GOAP have agreed to this,
and the construction of the barrage and the installation of 130 gates
covering the weaker sections of the weir would be implemented within three
and a half years and be completed by June 1978. The remaining 45 gates
would be installed, and the project would be completed, by June 1979.
Project Costs and Financing
47.        The estimated total cost of the project is US$70 million, including
US$20 million (29 percent) in foreign exchange if all contracts under the
project are won by local bidders, or US$32 million (46 percent) in foreign
exchange if foreign bidders win. The principal cost components are: Civil
Works (US$26.1 million), mechanical engineering works (US$10.5 million),
engineering and supervision (US$5.9 million), preparation of a second phase
project (US$0.4 million), technical assistance to GOI for the preparation of
command area development projects in other States of India (US$0.9 million)
and contingencies (US$26.2 million).
48.       The proposed credit of US$45 million would cover 64 percent of the
total project cost. It would finance the total foreign exchange component and
34 to 50 percent of local costs depending on bidding results. The proceeds
of the credit would be used to finance: Civil Works 1/ (US$28.2 million),
mechanical engineering works 1/ (US$13.7 million), engineering and supervision
(US$0.6 million) 1/, preparation of a second phase project (US$0.1 million),
financial assistance to GOI for project preparation in other States of
India (US$0.3 million), and physical contingencies (US$2.1 million). The
credit would be made to the Government of India and - except for the preparation
of command area development projects in other States of India - would become
part of GOI's contribution to the Government of Andhra Pradesh for the
financing of State development projects. Project costs not covered by GOI's
contribution would be financed by GOAP from its development budget. GOAP
would finance operation and maintenance costs for the barrage from its
regular budget.
Procurement, Disbursement
49.       Contracts for civil works amounting to US$24 million and for the
manutacture and installation of the gates amounting to US$12 million would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines. Local contractors participating in the bidding
for civil works would be entitled, for bid evaluation, to a preference of
7.5 percent in accordance with the Bank Group policy approved by the Executive
Directors on January 22, 1974 (R73-291). For gate manufacture and erection,
the usual preference of 15 percent, or the prevailing customs duty if lower,
would be extended to local manufacturers for the evaluation of bids. Tender
documents would clearly specify preferences and the manner of their application.
1/ Including Price Contingencies.

For civil works, PWD would procure buildiI1g materials (cement, structural
steel and sneet piling) in accordance with GOAP's general procurement
provisions, wiiich are acceptable. Contractors would use these materials,
which P4D would make available to them at fixed prices, as would be stated
in the tender documents. Octler civil works to be carried out between
FeL)ruary and June 1975, before thke contract is awarded, and tne dismantling
of tl)e old weir's crest, after completion of the-new barrage, would ue done
by force account.
S0.       Equipment and vehicles, estimTated at US$0.6 million (net of price
contingencies) and required by P1WD for project preparation and implementation,
would be unsuited for international tendering because of low unit prices and
small quantities per item and for reasons of standardization; tihey would he
procured directly from local-suppliers. PWD would observe the general pro-
curement provisions of the Covernnent of Andhra Pradesh, which are acceptable.
GUI would allocate cement required for thie project as part of the annLual
allocationi to Andhra Pradesh and, if necessary, earmark tile necessary aniount
for the project.  GOI would also arrange for tlhe import of steel if steel
cannot be obtained locally as needed 11.
1.        Tsie proceeds of the credit woultd be dJisbursecd agai st the Cif price
of directly imported equipment and materials or against tlhe ex-factory pirice
of goods procured locally. ]isbursermeits for civil wnrkl; .nd for gate
installation would be on a percentage basis (90% of expenditure for contractcC
civil works, 30i. of expenditure for force account work, and 90,Zt of expenditttre
for gate installation) . 1eirbursemnents for force account wor'. would boe r1ade

sections will b reach probably during the nQet fervJ yTurST. Collapse of the
old w:ei r would be a major setback for thic economy of tihe area. Tlhe inet
value of crop prodluction would be reduced from tLli current `s. 930 riiIiion
(L:S$112.J millioni) to about Rs. 100 miillioil (US$12.3T million).  Average

would sJrink to about Ths. 2030 (US$250).

command area, presently about 1.4 million tons under irrigated cultivation,
would drop to an estimated 100,000 tons under rainfed conditions. Production
of sugarcane, now 2.2 million tons, would cease entirely. In addition, the
loss of agricultural production potential would cause unemployment for much
of the agricultural labor force and be followed by a depression in the
region's service industries.
54.        Since 1969, when GOAP approved the construction of the new barrage,
farmers in the weir's command area have been subject to an advance betterment
levy for the replacement of the weir.   Rates are fixed at a total of Rs. 125
per ha, in addition to the regular operation and maintenance charges, and
would yield a total amount of Rs. 50 million. Rs. 35 million have so far
been collected. This represents only a fraction of project cost. GOAP
would make arrangements to levy and collect from beneficiaries of the barrage
all investment cost, including interest of at least 5 percent annually, over
a period of not more than fifteen years 1/.
55.       The project's economic rate of return depends on the probability
of the old weir's failure. Based on the estimated probabilities of weir
failure and on conservative estimates for resulting production losses, the
economic rate of return on investment in the new barrage would be about
44 percent. Even if construction costs were to be 20 percent higher than
estimated, production losses 20 percent lower and the probabilities of weir
failure substantially lower, the expected rate of return would still be
20 percent.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-"
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are below.
The level of disbursements was $368 million in FY74 or 83% of Bank Group
commitments in that year. The undisbursed pipeline of $1,063 million as of
November 30, 1974, corresponds roughly to commitments over the preceding
24-month period and reflects the lead time which would be expected given the
mix of fast and slow disbursing projects in the India program.
Ln. No. 789    Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$60.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
Ln. No. 902    Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June 8, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. Loan789-IN is fully committed;
and disbursements under Loan 902-IN are ahead of schedule. An eleventh loan
to ICICI is tentatively scheduled for Board presentation in July 1975.
Ln. No. 614    Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing
Date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in the
development of seeds of high-yielding varieties. The Corporation is working
efficiently and has developed a reputation for excellent seed quality. Seed
production is meeting targets. Implementation problems over processing plant
construction and land-leveling have been resolved although, as a result of
these delays, an extension of the closing date by two years has been neces-
sary. Expansion of an existing processing plant is in progress, and tenders
for a new plant are under preparation. Large-scale land-leveling demonstra-
tions have stimulated demand for such work and orders are to be placed
shortly by contractors for imported machinery.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 176    Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9     970
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam. The
project also includes field channel construction, land-leveling, drainage
works and roads, and a program to support agricultural development.    The
project will be completed about two years behind schedule because of delays
in dam construction.   The agricultural components of the project are also
behind schedule.   Some of the delays in implementation have occurred at the
start of the project before major investments have been made.    These will
not affect the economic justification of the project. Further delays have
occurred as a result of building materials shortages. The Government has
recently intervened and made adequate quantities of building materials
available. Progress is now satisfactory.
Cr. No. 268    Pochampad Irrigation;   US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to
some 100,000 ha. It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-
lined main canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads.
Until mid-1973, overall performance on the project was satisfactory with
construction and credit disbursements progressing ahead of schedule. Acute
shortages of construction materials, especially explosives for the canal
excavation, have hampered progress. As a result, construction of the main
canals has now fallen about one year behind schedule. This is likely to
delay the introduction of irrigation to over 40% of the project area. Land
development is presently haphazard and increasingly lagging behind water
availability in the project. Government is aware of the inadequacy of the
credit operation for land development and has requested IDA financing for
a Command Area Development Project, to be implemented by a Central Authority
for all farmers in need of land development. Construction of the dam, which
was also affected by temporary shortages of building materials, is now
progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 191    Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit of
June 3, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Cr. No. 203    Punjab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit of
June 24, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975

credit of June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Cr. No. 440    Bihar Agricultural Credit Project; US$32.0 million credit
of November 29, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The above agricultural credit projects total US$319.9 million.
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization equipment
only, all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long- and medium-
term credit to farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm invest-
ments as imported tractors, minor irrigation and land-leveling. Disbursement of
these credits started slowly. So far as the minor irrigation components were
concerned, the main difficulties stemmed from the institutional requirements,
in particular the introduction of changes in lending criteria and lending
terms and the strengthening of institutions responsible for assessing ground-
water availability. These constraints have been overcome and disbursements
are on schedule. Tractor procurement was delayed following clhanges in both
the supply and demand situations after the projects were originally appraised
which prompted GOI to request that indigenous, as well as imported models
should be eligible for IDA financing under these credits. The Executive
Directors approved this request in December 1973 and those credits whichl have
tractor components have been amended accordingly. Tractor procurement is
now in progress. Some funds earmarked for land levelling and tractors have
been reallocated to minor irrigation components.
Cr. No. 267    Wheat Storage; US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
This credit, which provides storage facilities in India's wheat
belt, comprises construction of 10 warehouses (100,000 tons capacity) and
10 silos (200,000 tons capacity) and an all-India grain storage study.
Warehouse construction is about 75% complete. The Government Food Ministry
has selected a local research institute to conduct the study. Admininstrative
problems, substantial cost increases, and technical difficulties in the
selection of silo sites have hampered the execution of the silo component.
A supervision mission has recently assessed the situation and will shortly
recommend appropriate action.

This project was designed to promote the development of apple pro-
cessing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh and comprises roads, cold storage,
juice processing, and marketing facilities. The project entity, the H.P.
Horticultural Produce Processing and Marketing Corporation (HPMC) has been
established and key senior staff recruited, including the Managing Director.

pansion program over the last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74). Pro-
curement for delivery of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed.
Production problems in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about
6-9 months.  However, production has now picked up and as of November 30,
1974 US$59.7 million had been disbursed under the credit. Telecommunications
V had a slow start, but procurement is now under way.
Cr. No. 242    Power Transmission II; US$75.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;

Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million credit of
May 9, 1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Power Transmission II, which is a continuation of the project
financed by Loan 416-IN, was designed to assist in financing the purchase
of equipment and materials required to develop a power transmission program
in nine states under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred
because of problems associated with preparing bid documents suitable for
international bidding and the analysis of the very large number of bids
involved, but all contract awards have now been made. For Power Trans-
mission III, specification and tendering procedures are progressing.
Tenders received so far indicate substantial cost overruns.

Cr. No. 520    Sindri Fertilizer Project; US$91 million credit of
December 18, 1974; Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is intended to help finance the
expansion of fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. The project is
now proceeding about 21 months behind schedule due, in large part, to labor
and procurement difficulties. Procurement problems have been largelv over-
come and most of the equipment is either at the site or at the Cochin port.
Another factor which has contributed to the delay has been technical problems
in the commissioning of the Cochin I plant, which has required a disproportion-
ate amount of management attention.  Credit No. 481 contains funds for a Plant
Operations Improvement Program which will be used in part to overcome these
problems; the use of these funds has been identified on a plant-by-plant
basis and procurement has been initiated. The engineering design for the
Gorakhpur project is well advanced and virtually all the equipment has been
ordered. Although delivery of some equipment may take longer than forecast
during appraisal, the project is progressing without serious difficulties,
and disbursements are expected to be complete by the March 1975 closing date.
Engineering work and procurement for the Nangal Fertilizer Project are
proceeding satisfactorily. The Trombay IV Credit was signed on June 19, 1974,
and was declared effective on August 21, 1974. The Sindri Credit was signed
on December 18, 1974.

credit of May 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with establishment of whole-
sale markets in a number of towns in Bilhar and Karnataka. Progress under the
projects has generally been satisfactory. Markets construction in Bihar was
delayed due to legal challenges arising out of the state's acquisition of land
for market sites; however, these difficulties have been satisfactorily
resolved. Market construction in Karnataka is expected to be on schedule.

INDIA - GODAVARI BARRAGE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 India, acting by its President.
Beneficiary:              State of Andhra Pradesh
Amount:                   US$45 million
Terms:                    Standard
Relending Terms:          Repayable by the State of Andhra Pradesh to India
according to established GOI policy of lending to
States on terms prevailing at the time.
Project Description:     The purpose of the project is to ensure continued
availability of perennial irrigation water in the
400,000 ha command area of a 120 year old weir,
which is in danger of collapse. The project will
avert the imminent danger that the net value of
agricultural production in the area declines from
the present level of Rs. 900 million to about Rs. 100
million. It will safeguard farm incomes and employ-
ment for the area's agricultural labor force. The
project consists of the completion of a new barrage,
which would replace the old weir. The barrage has
four sections, totalling 3600 m in length, across
the four branches of the river. It is divided into
175 bays, each equipped with a spillway gate, and
will raise the pond level to 13.64 m.
The project includes preparatory studies for a
second phase project, which would concentrate on
command area development, and technical assistance
to GOI for the preparation of command area develop-
ment projects in other States of India.
