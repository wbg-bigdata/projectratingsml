IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
IBURKINA FASO
OUAGADOUGOU WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING CREDIT (CR 2519-BUR)
PREFACE
The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Ouagadougou Water Supply
Engineering Project (Credit 2519-BUR) was approved on June 22, 1993, in the amount of SDR
3.0 million (US$ 4.25 million equivalent) and declared effective on April 12, 1994. Co-
financing was provided by the Agence Frangaise de Developpement (AFD) for an amount of FF
15.0 million (about US$ 2.9 million).
The Credit 2519-BUR was closed on March 31, 1998, after two extensions of 12 and 9
months. The final disbursement took place on July 30, 1998 with a balance of SDR 0.1 million
left for cancellation.
This ICR was prepared by Yao Badjo, Senior Sanitary Engineer (AFTU2) and Gerard
Tenaille, Consultant, and reviewed at a meeting dated September 21, 1998 chaired by Mr. Hasan
Tuluy, Country Director for Burkina Faso.
Preparation of this ICR began during a final supervision/completion mission to Burkina
Faso in April 1998. The ICR is based on materials in the project files, correspondence, the Staff
Appraisal Report, and the Credit Agreement. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the
ICR with their own project implementation report and comments on the draft Bank ICR.
Comments were received from the co-financier, AFD.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BURKINA FASO
OUAGADOUGOU WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING CREDIT (CR 2519-BUR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.    This Implementation Completion Report evaluates the Ouagadougou Water Supply
Engineering Credit implemented by the Office National de P'Eau et de /'Assainissement
(ONEA). This was the Bank's first investment in the urban water supply sector aimed at laying
the foundation for a major future investment operation.
Project Objectives
ii.    The objectives of the Ouagadougou Water Supply Engineering Credit were to: (i) finance
studies and technical assistance needed for preparation of the future Ouagadougou Water Supply
Project (OWSP); (ii) lay the groundwork to improve the quality at entry of this project and for
its successful implementation; and (iii) test the commitment and ownership of the Government
and the capacity of Office National de 1'Eau et de l'Assainissement (ONEA) to improve water
sector management before making further substantial investments.
iii. The components designed to meet these objectives consisted of: Studies (a) final design
and preparation of bidding documents for the OWSP; (b) assessment of the future environmental
impact of the OWSP comprising a mitigation plan, a resettlement plan, and a review of riparian
issues related to dam construction; Institutional Strengthening (a) establishment of a project
unit within ONEA; and (b) provision of technical assistance, training, office equipment and
vehicles to strengthen ONEA's capacity in project design and management. However, it should
be noted that the bulk of the assistance in terms of broader capacity building of ONEA was
provided by bilateral donors.
Implementation Experience and Results
iv.   Studies. The engineering credit largely achieved the criteria established for preparation
of the OWSP within the expected three-year timeframe. It laid the groundwork for improvement
of quality at entry, and successful implementation, through the preparation of final design
studies, bidding documents, an environmental assessment, and a resettlement plan. Even though
the studies started late, they were successfully carried out and completed by 1997.



ii
v.    ONEA's Institutional Strengthening. The Institutional Strengthening objective to test
the commitment and ownership of the Government and the capacity of ONEA to improve water
sector management before making further substantial investmnent, was not met. Evaluation of
the technical assistance provided by GTZ during the past few years has confirmed the shortfalls
of the current assistance strategy. It is now expected that the managerial capacity of ONEA
would be supported and improved with continued support from donors and with private sector
involvement.
vi.   Project Costs.  Actual costs amounted to SDR 4,700,866, compared to the SDR
4,760,173 estimated at appraisal.
vii.   Major Factors affecting the Project. In 1996 the Government altered the structure of
the project implementation unit and created a new project unit under direct technical supervision
of the Ministry of Water and financial supervision of the Finance Ministry. This was contrary to
the terms of the project. This situation was eventually reversed after two years of discussion,
and the project unit was put again within ONEA's control. It contributed to the postponement of
the OWSP appraisal mission, scheduled for December 1996, and a deterioration of the
relationship between the Government and the donors.
Project Sustainability
viii.  Studies. Project sustainability is likely with respect to the studies. The engineering
design studies were well done and provide a solid basis for future implementation of the OWSP.
Dam construction has already started, financed with Arab Funds. The Resettlement Action Plan
and the Biophysical Impacts Mitigation Plan will address the long term environmental
sustainability of this project. All efforts have been made to maximize the economic benefits and
minimize the economic costs.
ix.   Institutional Strengthening. Evaluation of the technical assistance provided by GTZ
has confirmed the shortfalls of the current assistance strategy. It is expected that the managerial
capacity of ONEA would improve with continued joint support from the donors through private
operator involvement in the sector. Project sustainability is unlikely with respect to institutional
strengthening, unless steps are taken to support management with some form of private sector
participation.
Bank and Borrower Performance
x.    The project was prepared in a relatively short time having benefited from preparatory
work financed by donors already in the sector --identification in March 1993, appraisal in April,
negotiations in May, and board presentation in June 1993. Although institutional strengthening
was an objective of the project, its achievement was mainly dependent on parallel financing
from other donors. Achievement of this objective was not satisfactory. Supervision missions
were adequately staffed. At the same time, however, the Bank failed to take corrective action
when it became apparent that the Government was in default of specific clauses of the DCA
(para 21). The Bank's performance is rated unsatisfactory.



iii
xi.   The Government created a new project unit that not only disrupted the project's
implementation, but also went against the project's objectives to give ONEA full responsibility
for project implementation. In addition, by delaying the necessary tariff increases in 1996 and
1997, the Government contributed to a deterioration in ONEA's financial performance.
Therefore, the performance of the Borrower is considered unsatisfactory.
Project Outcome
xii.   Engineering designs and studies related to construction of the dam (viz. environmental
assessment, resettlement action plan and biophysical impacts mitigation plan) were successfully
completed and a committee was set up to deal with riparian issues. This work provides the basis
for the multi-donor support for the future operation. Although this is a positive outcome,
planned capacity building was not achieved. Overall, therefore, the outcome is not considered
fully satisfactory.
Future Operation
xiii.  Engineering studies financed by the Credit formed the basis for a future operation,
OWSP. The future project has 13 partners and, it is expected that during the project, a strategic
framework for sector development will be agreed upon. We recommend that through the future
operation an agreement be reached with the Government on a private operator involvement in
the sector in the form of a lease contract (affermage). Discussions with the Govemment are
ongoing with respect to the OWSP, and appraisal is planned for FY2000. The new project with
a cost of approximately US$ 200 million, is expected to satisfy water demand in Ouagadougou
through 2010.
Summary Findings and Key Lessons Learned
xiv.  The findings from the Credit suggest that:
*  The use of an engineering credit is an appropriate vehicle for financing preparatory
studies leading to a complex future operation;
*  It is possible to have an integrated environmental assessment done well ahead of
project start-up that effectively addresses the requirements for a large infrastructure
project and to have it financed through an engineering credit; and
*  Long-term technical assistance does not necessarily guarantee long-term institutional
strengthening of a public water supply company. In retrospect, if the Bank had been
fully involved in the institutional strengthening, the lessons of the recent past learned
from other countries could have been applied to preparation of the new project, that
is, to engage the Borrower in major sector restructuring leading to the introduction
of private sector participation.



iv
xv.   The key lessons are: (i) when making a significant sector investment, the Bank should
pay closer attention to sector management and not just engineering; (ii) when several donors are
involved in a sector, donor coordination, including definition of roles and responsibilities should
be clarified well ahead of project startup; and (iii) the Bank must not set project objectives that
are not matched by components. In this case, broad capacity building was an objective, but this
was left to bilateral donors to achieve, and there was no clear coordinated sector strategy with
the donors. The future Ouagadougou Water Supply project would ensure that ONEA's
operating, commercial and financial capabilities are adequately addressed through a sound
institutional arrangement to be set up with private operator involvement.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BURKINA FASO
OUAGADOUGOU WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING CREDIT (CR 2519- BUR)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   INTODUCTION
1.    A sector wide investment program for Burkina Faso was prepared with the support of
bilateral donors. In preparation for an investment operation, the Bank agreed to finance an
engineering credit in order to adequately prepare and cost the proposed investment. This was the
Bank's first intervention in the urban water supply sector in Burkina Faso.
B.   STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
2.    The objectives of the Ouagadougou Water Supply Engineering Credit were to:
(i)   finance studies and technical assistance needed for the preparation of the future
Ouagadougou Water Supply Project (OWSP);
(ii)  lay the groundwork to improve the quality at entry of this project and for its
successful implementation; and
(iii) test the commitment and ownership of the Government and the capacity of
OfficeNational de I 'Eau et de I 'Assainissement (ONEA) to improve water sector
management before making further massive investments.
3.    These objectives were in line with the Government's goal of ensuring sustained sector
development through strengthening ONEA, enabling it to administer the sector more effectively,
achieving financial discipline, and accomplishing financial self-sufficiency of the urban water
supply sub-sector. The first two objectives were clear and realistic. The third objective was not
clearly articulated and the project was not designed to support its full achievement.
Project Description
4.    The following components were designed to meet the above objectives:
Part A: Studies
0  designing and preparing final bidding documents for the OWSP;



2
assessing the future environmental impact of the OWSP, comprising a mitigation plan, a
resettlement plan, and a review of riparian issues related to the dam construction.
Part B: Institutional Strengthening
*  establishing a project unit within ONEA responsible for implementation of water supply
projects;
*  providing technical assistance, training, office equipment and vehicles to strengthen
ONEA's capacity in project design and management.
5.    The Credit financed most of Part A except for treatment plant and distribution network
studies which were financed by AFD; financing of part B by the Credit was limited. The broader
capacity building, described in para. 2 (iii), was jointly financed by KfW, DANIDA and AFD.
C.   AcHEvEMENT OF OBJECTWES
Studies
6.    Implementation of the engineering credit started very slowly because ONEA staff were not
familiar with Bank procedures, both for studies and procurement, which resulted in a one-year
delay.  Nevertheless, even with the initial delay, the engineering studies were satisfactorily
completed in 1997 and resulted in the following outputs: (i) final design and bidding documents for
the dam and transmission main; (ii) final design and bidding documents for the water treatment plant
and the water distribution network (financed by AFD); and (iii) an environmental assessment and
resettlement plan for the 2,500 people to be displaced as well as a mitigation plan. The outputs are
being used to prepare the new project, for which appraisal is planned for FY2000 (para. 24).
7.    The Environmental Assessment of the future dam formed the basis for development of the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the Biophysical Impacts Mitigation Plan (BIMP). Both the
RAP and the BIMP fully met their objectives in that they were prepared in a participatory manner
and addressed the critical issues of relevance to the affected population with respect to:
(i)   The RAP:
the required socioeconomic infrastructure for human development;
financial resources for agricultural intensification on the replacement fields;
market gardening activities in the draw-down areas of the dam;
small-scale credits of the social fund type for micro-projects and rural economic
equipment;
road and community infrastructure in the host communities;
fishing activities compatible with the functional objectives of the lake;
livestock sustaining measures for the herders;
a support program for women's activities to improve the quality of life in the project
impacted area;



3
* literacy and bookkeeping classes for the local communities; and
* target job creation during project implementation to benefit the PAPs and host
communities.
Socioeconomic surveys and stakeholder analyses were undertaken to provide credible
benchmarks for monitoring and follow-up of the RAP.
(ii)   BIlV
* changes in bidding documents to minimize conflicts that could arise during the works;
* land use measures around areas that could potentially flood in the future;
* monitoring indicators of the main project impacts on the biophysical environment.
8.    The BIIVP would help to ensure the project's long term environmental sustainability for the
benefit of the local population who use these natural resources. The Government has agreed to take
appropriate actions to maximize the economic benefits and minimize the economic costs of this
Mitigation Plan.
9.    With respect to riparian issues, a technical committee was set up to oversee these issues as
they affect both Burkina Faso and the Republic of Ghana. There are no outstanding difficulties.
Institutional Strengthening
10.   The Institutional Strengthening objective to test the commitment and ownership of the
Government and the capacity of ONEA to improve water sector management before making further
substantial investment, was not achieved.
(a) Government Commitment
11.   Prior to project appraisal (between 1983 and 1991), the water tariffs had not been adjusted,
resulting in huge financial losses. A tariff study, financed by KfW in 1990, recommended annual
tariff increases to gradually reduce the losses and increasingly cover costs as follows: 64% of costs
in 1991, 69% in 1992, 76% in 1993, 90% in 1994 and 100% in 1995. Following these
recommendations, tariffs were annually increased through end-1994 which influenced the Bank and
donor decision to support further institutional strengthening rather than restructure with private
participation (which the Government did not support). Adherence to a performance contract was
made a condition of effectiveness.
12.   Starting in 1995, however, the Government failed to honor the performance contract which
led to a decline in ONEA's financial situation. ONEA proposed tariff increases to the Govemment
in July 1996 for the period 1997-2000. However, the increase approved by Government was below
the initial request, and implementation was delayed to December 1, 1997. Due to a continued
decline in revenue generation, the Bank and donors involved in the sector requested ONEA to carry
out a tariff study aimed at restoring financial equilibrium in ONEA. This study is underway. It will
determine the long-term cost of water and propose the stepwise introduction of tariff adjustments for



4
meeting the target of full cost recovery. The new tariff policy will most likely increase the monthly
account maintenance charge which has not changed since 1991, further increase tariffs among the
different consumer categories, and eliminate cross-subsidy for non-household water consumption.
(b) ONEA's Management Capacity
13.   ONEA's management, particularly their financial operation, continues to be weak. This
weakness could increase in the coming years when the country embarks on implementation of new
water projects to increase access to safe water services in major urban centers. The evaluation of the
technical assistance provided by GTZ over the previous years has confirmed the shortfalls of the
current assistance strategy. In addition, the 1997 audit was heavily qualified and revealed serious
deficiencies in ONEA's systems and processes. We recommend that the future Ouagadougou Water
Supply project ensures that ONEA's operating, commercial and financial capabilities are adequately
addressed through a sound institutional arrangement to be set up with private operator involvement.
(c) Project Unit's Capacity
14.   The limited objective to establish and strengthen capacity of the project unit to implement
the future OWSP was achieved. The project unit, Bureau du Projet Ziga (BPZ), composed of three
engineers with expertise in hydraulics, dam hydrology and environment, was established and
managed by ONEA's technical director. BPZ was located in ONEA's office space and supported by
a technical assistant from January 1995 to February 1997. BPZ's activities were financed by the
Credit. All BPZ members attended seminars abroad to strengthen their knowledge of project design
and management. On the whole, BPZ performed well and supervised the consulting firms that
carried out final design and environmental assessments.
15.   Problems arose when the Government decided in April 1996 to create a new project unit
called Maitrise d'Ouvrage de Ziga (MOZ) to replace the BPZ, under direct technical supervision of
the Ministry of Water and financial supervision of the Finance Ministry, without Bank's
concurrence. Even though the Bank insisted that this went against the project objectives, the
Government formalized its decision with Decree No. 96-346 of September 24, 1996. This decision
was one of the reasons why the OWSP's appraisal mission, originally scheduled for December 1996,
was postponed and the relationship between Government and the main donors deteriorated. Finally,
after lengthy and difficult discussions, a ministerial Decision No. 97-015 was issued on December 9,
1997 reorganizing MOZ within ONEA.
D.   MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
16.   Factors generally subject to government control: Terms of the Performance Contract (PC)
as specified in the Development Credit Agreement were not fulfilled by the Government. ONEA
was bound to the PC, but was not given the necessary support to apply the terms of the contract.
Specific items which were affected include: (i) delay in approving recommended tariff increases;
and (ii) delay in implementing an action plan based on good accounting procedures to restore



5
ONEA's financial management, including the replacement of the financial director who was
recruited in September 1995.
17.   Another factor affecting the project was the Government's decision, in 1996, to create a new
project unit (MOZ) under the direct, technical supervision of the Ministry of Water and financial
supervision of the Ministry of Finance (see para. 15), without the Bank's agreement. This also
contributed to delaying progress toward appraisal of the OWSP.
18.   The devaluation of the CFA Franc, vis-a-vis the SDR, in January 1994 had a positive impact
at the beginning of the project. It led to an increase in available funds/resources.
E.   PROJECT SUSTAINABILrrY
19.   Sustainability of the engineering credit can be considered likely for the following reasons:
(i)   Studies.  The engineering studies have been well prepared and constitute a
satisfactory basis for the OWSP to be fully implemented. Dam construction has
already started with financing from Arab Funds. The Resettlement Action Plan and
the Biophysical Impacts Mitigation Plan will help ensure the long-term
environmental sustainability of the follow-on OWSP.
(ii)  Institutional Strengthening. The Institutional Strengthening objective to test the
commitment and ownership of the Government and the capacity of ONEA to
improve water sector management before making further substantial investment, was
not achieved.
F.   BANK PERFORMANCE
20.   At the beginning of the project, the Bank responded relatively quickly as confirmed by the
short preparation time: identification in March 1993, appraisal in April, negotiations in May, and
board presentation in June 1993. This was helped by the availability of preliminary work carried
out by donors in the sector. However, the Bank did not pay adequate attention to broad capacity
building issues. Strengthening of sector capacity within ONEA was left to the donors while the
Bank narrowly focussed on MOZ. This is a design shortcoming which is not intended to be repeated
in the proposed follow-on project.
21.   With respect to supervision, there were 7 missions in a 4-year period which were adequately
staffed to handle project issues. During the period of difficult relations with the Government, the
Bank was able to maintain close cooperation with the other cofinanciers. At the same time,
however, the Bank failed to take corrective action when the Government remained in default on the
DCA clauses with respect to the Performance Contract. There are procedures in the DCA which
could have been invoked. The Bank's performance is rated unsatisfactory.



6
G.   Borrower Performance
22.   In 1996, Government created a new project unit under direct, technical supervision of the
Ministry of Water which disrupted the pace of project implementation and also contradicted the
project's objectives to give ONEA full responsibility for project implementation. It took twenty
months of discussions to reverse this action. According to the Borrower's Contribution (Annex 2),
"If the institutional recovery of ONEA has not been accomplished, that is because the process is still
underway and requires a certain time. In our opinion the project is satisfactory." On the financial
side, the Government defaulted on the terms of the Performance Contract and delayed approval of
required annual tariff increases (1996 and 1997). ONEA was unable to provide timely and
unqualified financial statements.  For these reasons, the Borrower's performance is rated
unsatisfactory.
H.   ASSESSMENT OF OurcoME
23.   The outcome of the project can be considered unsatisfactory. Although engineering designs
and studies related to the dam construction (viz. environmental assessment, resettlement action plan
and biophysical impacts mitigation plan) were successfully completed and a committee was set up to
deal with riparian issues. The key institutional strengthening objective was not fully achieved.
I.    FUTuRE OPERATION
24.   The engineering studies financed by the Credit formed the basis for a future operation. The
future project has 13 partners and it is expected that during the project a strategic framework for
further investments in the sector will be agreed upon. The success of the future project will depend
on the extent to which all partners collaborate and support sustainable institutional arrangements.
ONEA's management, particularly its financial operations, continues to be weak. This weakness
could increase in the coming years when the country embarks on implementing this new water
project worth $200 million. Discussions with the Government are ongoing with respect to the
OWSP and appraisal is planned for FY2000. The new project is expected to satisfy water demand
in Ouagadougou through 2010.
25.   The evaluation of the TA, provided by GTZ over the previous years has confirmed the
shortfalls of the current assistance strategy. It is recommended that, through the future operation, an
agreement be reached with the Government on private operator involvement in the sector perhaps in
the form of a lease contract (affermage). Such an agreement would have the best chance of turning
ONEA's operations around and also ensure ONEA's financial performance improvement so that the
envisaged self-financing portion of the project would materialize. Under such a scheme, ONEA
would retain title to all fixed assets and debt servicing and an operation company would be set-up
with private/public ownership. This should alleviate ONEA's and Government's concern on issues
of sovereignty of the proprietor company. The operator would be selected on a competitive basis
and remunerated on performance. Such an arrangement should also reduce the risk of ONEA's poor
management performance to an acceptable level. The responsibilities involved would include:
meeting the debt service and implementing the project with MOZ on behalf of the Government of



7
Burkina Faso. The financial arrangements between these two companies would, inter alia, ensure
that the owning company is remunerated in time to meet the debt service requirements.
J.    FINDINGS AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
26.   The findings from the Credit suggest that:
*  The use of an engineering credit is an appropriate vehicle for financing preparatory
studies leading to a complex future operation;
*  It is possible to have an integrated environmental assessment done well ahead of project
start-up that effectively addresses the requirements for a large infrastructure project and
to have it financed through an engineering credit; and
*  Long-term technical assistance does not necessarily guarantee long-term institutional
strengthening of a public water supply company. In retrospect, if the Bank had been
more involved in technical assistance, the lessons from past experienced could have
been applied to preparation of the new project, that is, to engage the Borrower in major
sector restructuring leading to introduction of private sector participation.
27.   The key lessons are: (i) when making a significant sector investment, the Bank should pay
closer attention to sector management and not just engineering; (ii) when several donors are
involved in a sector, donor coordination, including definition of roles and responsibilities should be
clarified well ahead of project startup; and (iii) the Bank must not set project objectives that are not
matched by components. In this case, broad capacity building was an objective, but this was
primarily left to bilateral donors to achieve, and there was no clear, coordinated sector strategy with
the donors. The future Ouagadougou Water Supply project would ensure that ONEA's operating,
commercial and financial capabilities are adequately addressed through a sound institutional
arrangement to be set up with private operator involvement.

Annex 1
BURKINA FASO
OUAGADOUGOU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Aide-memoire
Introduction
1.    A World Bank mission, consisting of Yao Badjo (Task Manager) and Gerard Tenaille
(consultant), visited Burkina Faso from April 5-13, 1998 to prepare the completion report for Credit
2519-BUR and to prepare the Ouagadougou Water Supply Project segment starting at the Ziga dam.
The mission wishes to thank the Government of Burkina Faso, in particular, the Office of the
Director General of ONEA, for its welcome and cooperation. This aide-memoire summarizes the
discussions held and conclusions reached during the mission. It will be confirmed by the World
Bank in the near future.
Purpose of the Mission
2.    The mission's purpose was twofold: (a) to gather information needed to prepare the
completion report for Credit 2519-BUR; and (b) to review the status of preparations for the Ziga
project with the Government and determine what obstacles must be overcome before moving ahead
with plans for the appraisal mission.
Meetings
3.    The mission and the Resident Representative of the World Bank were received by His
Excellency Soma Baro, Deputy Minister of Water, and worked in close cooperation with Mamadou
Lamine Kouate, Director General of ONEA; Idrissa Ouedraogo, Director of MOZ; and Mr. Soalla,
Technical Director. The mission was also joined by Athanase Compaore, Hydraulics Manager in
the Ministry of Water and President of ONEA, as well as by the GTZ mission currently in
Ouagadougou in connection with the study on capacity building in ONEA. The mission also met
with Mr. Chahinian and Mr. Berton, CFD officials in Ouagadougou.
Technical Visits
4.    On April 11, 1998 the mission, accompanied by Idrissa Ouedraogo and Florent Ouedraogo,
visited Ziga and the sites proposed for the Boudtenga treatment plant and storage facility. It also
visited the sites of the main installations planned for the area north of Ouagadougou, particularly
storage facilities RA and RB.



17
Project Costs
5.    The mission updated the project costs, calculating the cost of each component as of January
1, 1998, taking into account actual market figures for bid components already awarded, i.e., the dam
and its ancillary works, as well as supervision. A 5 percent physical contingency factor was
included for the dam and ancillary works to allow for the risks inherent in such projects. A
breakdown of estimated costs has been annexed to this aide-memoire showing, on the left, base costs
as of I/1/98, and, on the right, final costs, including contingencies and revised costs. The resulting
final total is CFAF 112 billion (not including phase 2 of PGIAE). The mission would like to receive
MOZ's own estimate of project costs as well as its comments on the above figures.
Financing Plan
6.    A financing plan dated December 15, 1997 was submitted to the mission. It includes two
important items for which the Government and ONEA are responsible:
(a)  Package 2, CFAF 2.541 billion, for water supply lines. The mission would like ONEA
to note that these funds must be provided in foreign exchange during the first year of the
project; and
(b)  Training, initially funded by UNDP, is now the responsibility of ONEA, and will cost
CFAF 1.374 billion. ONEA is advised to determine whether one of the donors already
involved in the project would be willing to finance this training. The mission believes
that the World Bank would respond favorably to such a request.
7.    The mission drew up a financing plan (attached hereto) in which training is financed by IDA,
with actual costs arrayed on the right side of the table. The calculations of IDA financing are based
on actual costs. Since contributions from other donors were not changed, there is a funding gap of
CFAF 1.374 billion. ONEA should negotiate a reduction of the gap with each donor for each
component. Like the cost estimates, this financing table does not include phase 2 of PGAIE, to cost
CFAF 2 billion, with funding from UNDP and Belgium. The mission would appreciate receiving an
official financing plan showing the amounts approved by the donors.
Package 2
8.   It was previously agreed that IDA would finance the discharge main and KfW would fund
the Boudtenga storage facility and gravity lines, the two subpackages costing CFAF 7.5 billion and
CFAF 12 billion, respectively. It is now proposed that KfW should pay for the gravity lines and
associated installations and IDA should finance the laying of pipes and construction of the
Boudtenga storage facility. The two subpackages will now cost CFAF 14.2 billion (KfW) and
CFAF 5.35 billion (IDA). These new arrangements prompt the following observations:



18
(a)  The bidder prequalification process resulted in the selection only of construction
contractors, for both the KfW and the IDA subpackages. This list of contractors cannot
be used to select the supplier. MOZ, working with KfW, should draw up a list of
suitable manufacturers for this purpose; and
(b) When the bidding documents were first drawn up, the consultants were asked to
consider the use of either cast iron or concrete pipes. MOZ appears to have forgotten
this latter alternative. The mission believes it is essential to invite bids for concrete
pipes in order to encourage more competition.
North Branch
9.    On November 17, 1997 the consulting firm SEURECA provided a new analysis of the
distribution networks dependent on the North Branch (the new RA and RB storage facilities). The
distribution networks had been designed to accommodate maximum daily flow on the year's day of
maximum use, which is 2.6 times higher than average flow on the maximum day. This new analysis
(variants V2A and V2B) was based on average flow on day of maximum consumption, the
installation of two booster pumps, and reinforcement of the lines running from Paspanga.
10.   Simulations show that pressure throughout will exceed 15 m until the year 2010, except at
three locations in zone A, where it is predicted that pressures will drop to 14.86 m, 13.36 m, and
14.39 m. US$15 million in overall savings are expected. Since this component will be financed at
6.55 percent over 15 years, its impact on the internal rate of return will be considerable. The
mission is interested in receiving the comments of MOZ and its reasoned decision.
Electric Power Line
11.   There is only partial justification for including a power line in the project, and for some time
the Bank has been calling for an agreement between ONEA and SONABEL in this regard. ONEA
cannot pay for the line when it is first installed and then again amortize the cost through tariffs. The
mission would like the results of discussions with SONABEL to be forwarded to the Bank, along
with a copy of the signed agreement.
Technical Assistance to MOZ
12.   As a matter of urgency, bids should be invited for securing technical assistance for MOZ.
This will be financed by CFD. It was proposed at the Round Table that the technical assistance
finance specialist should take on financial monitoring and auditing tasks, and this would appear to
be a good solution. The mission would like to receive the terms of reference approved by CFD.
13.   A Manual of Procedures for MOZ is needed urgently. The firm Mazars et Guerard, which
prepared an organizational study of MOZ in 1996, could be asked to help with this.



19
Institutional Strengthening of ONEA
14.   The institutional strengthening of MOZ is currently the major obstacle to planning the
Bank's appraisal mission. The mission attended a presentation by the GTZ exploratory mission,
which envisaged a number of possible options. Unfortunately, its conclusions were somewhat vague
and the consultants' recommendations will not be available until their final report is ready in a few
weeks. As soon as it is received the Bank will examine it thoroughly and convey its observations to
ONEA and the other donors.
Tariff Study
15.   A new tariff schedule has been in effect since December 1, 1997. The increase over previous
tariffs was deemed inadequate by a number of donors. In particular, the tariff for the lowest service
level and standpipes rose only 2.5 percent, or CFAF 4, a figure far below the inflation rate for
January 1995-1998, which was approximately 20 percent. In addition, the second service level, for
delivery of between 11 m3 and 25 m3, increased from CFAF 320 to 338, still far below cost, which
is around CFAF 400. Given that the vast majority of subscribers consume less than 25 m3/month,
the gap between the water tariff and the cost of water is obviously widening.
16.   The audit report on the project's interim accounts status as of June 30, 1997 clearly
illustrates the gravity of the situation, with sales totaling CFAF 4.5 billion and operating costs of
CFAF 8.9 billion. A balance was restored only by drawing upon reserves, mainly the reserves for
covering exchange risk, a measure that cannot be resorted to year after year.
17.   The mission went to see some of the standpipes and concluded that it is pointless to attempt
to favor low-income persons by applying very low standpipe tariffs (CFAF 178/ m3). On-site
inquiries indicated that water supply attendants sell water for CFA 5 per 20-liter container to
individuals and CFAF 50 per 200-liter barrel to resellers, who then sell the water to their own
customers for over CFAF 1000/ m3.
18.   It is also paradoxical that users with private connections who consume the lowest volumes (0
to 10 m3/month) pay less than standpipe customers, i.e., CFAF 168/ m3 compared to CFAF 178/ m3.
The next time tariffs are adjusted, charges for the lowest service level should be raised to very close
to the actual cost and charges for the next level of service. However, the rate for the highest level of
service (currently CFAF 860) should be decreased once Ziga is in operation in order to encourage
customers to consume what will then be an abundant supply of water.
19.   A thorough tariff study is needed immediately to clarify all these issues and enable the
Government to take the required decisions as quickly as possible. CFD is likely to be willing to
finance the study from its unspent credit balance. The mission wishes to be consulted regarding the
terms of reference and would like the study to lead to automatic annual tariff increases based on
reliable published data. This will require a decision of the Government, and such a decision will
undoubtedly be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.



20
20.   Clearly, tariff increases will be acceptable only if the utility's productivity also rises. In this
connection, the mission wishes to recall earlier missions' suggestions that were never followed up:
(a)  other firms should be permitted to install connections;
(b) water meters should be read quarterly but monthly billing should continue; and
(c)  Chlorine gas should be used for sterilization at Ziga instead of calcium hypochlorite,
which is twice as expensive.
Economic Study
21.   In 1996/97, the firm ICEA prepared an excellent economic study.  Since this firm is
currently updating the financial projections, it would be a good idea to have it update the economic
study as well. This study will be essential for project appraisal.
Conclusion
22.   The mission would like to receive the study on the institutional strengthening of ONEA as
soon as it is available. Once the study has been reviewed, in consultation with ONEA and the other
donors, a date can be fixed for the appraisal mission. Since July and August are fast approaching
and it will be difficult to mobilize all the personnel needed for the appraisal, the mission cannot be
scheduled before September or October 1998.

ENGINEERING PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUNEMARY
I.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the project are to execute detailed studies and other activities with a view
to increasing drinking water production and distribution capacities for the city of Ouagadougou in
order to meet the population's basic needs and to strengthen and improve ONEA's capacity by
means of:
- The preparation of detailed preliminary engineering designs and bidding documents for the
Ouagadougou water supply project.
- The making of an environmental impact assessment of the project, including a plan for
mitigating undesirable impacts and a plan for resettling the project-affected people, together with a
review of all the riparian issues raised by the construction of the dam on the Nakambe river.
- The establishment in ONEA of a unit to be responsible for the coordination and execution
of the project.



22
- The setting up of technical assistance, personnel training and equipment procurement so as
to strengthen ONEA's management capability and its capacity for implementing major projects.
2.    EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
Engineering Project Management Unit
A project office was set up in ONEA in 1994, made up of supervisory staff seconded from
ONEA (3) and executive personnel (3) recruited by the project. It has received support from a
technical assistant experienced in the management of large-scale projects. New equipped premises
were placed at its disposal. From March 1994 to September 1996 this office supervised the
consultants responsible for the construction plans and the studies of the environmental impact.
Detailed preliminary engineering and bidding documents
The detailed preliminary engineering and bidding documents have been prepared and are
available for the following packages:
- Package No. 1: Dam and ancillary works
- Package No. 2: Transmission main
- Package No. 3: Treatment station
- Package No. 4: Primary system
- Package No. 5: Pumping and distribution
- Packages Nos. 6 & 7: Distribution system
- Package No. 8: Power line
Environmental impact assessment
An environmental impact assessment was made in 1994/95, which constituted an excellent
basis for the preparation of the Governmental Plan for Mitigating Environmental Impacts (Plan
Gouvememental d'Attenuation des Impacts sur l'Environnement - PGAIE), which will be the first
plan of its type to be put into effect in conjunction with the execution of a large-scale project.
Performance contract
A performance contract governing the relations between the State and ONEA was signed in
1993, which served to clarify the company's relationship with the State.
Technical assistance
Technical assistance was set up in 1995 with the aim of providing support for the project
management in the technical, administrative and financial spheres. This technical assistance was
found to be particularly valuable in the technical and administrative fields.
Training
The training program for the project office staff focused on:
pressure surges;
project management and control;
accounting and contract award procedures;



23
initiation in use of accounting and management software.
The training given was profitable for the staff: it accomplished its objectives.
Institutional strengthening
This component, which consisted of technical assistance, training and procurement of
equipment utilizing Credit 2519-BUR with the aim of strengthening ONEA's project management
and execution capacities, was completed in full.
The "System Management Study" component setting out the main thrusts of ONEA's future
development to enable it to assume responsibility for the new facilities is still in progress.
The national party is not in agreement with privatization, because some clear examples
demonstrate that ONEA is performing better than many privatized companies. Moreover, ONEA is
being restructured to make it an efficient, modern and thriving company able to honor all its
commitments to all its partners.
3.    IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE PROJECT
Studies
Some new and unforeseen studies have been made during the course of the project
(additional economic studies, additional geotechnical studies, financial analyses, network models,
revisions of the preliminary engineering and bidding documents...), which have increased the real
cost of the studies originally planned. Taken overall, the studies are of excellent quality.
Dam safety
A panel of independent experts commissioned by the Government has given its opinion on
the safety of the dam. The panel's recommendations have been conveyed to the consultant who has
incorporated them into the bidding documents. This has delayed the starting of the dam works, but
the outcome has been that the safety of the dam has been enhanced.
The North Branch of the primary system
The World Bank has suggested on several occasions that the implementation of the North
Branch be deferred because demand is low in that area. The national party differs strongly on this
point because it views the area as a potential development zone. The financing for that part of the
system has moreover already been obtained from the West African Development Bank.
The Governmental Plan for Mitigating Environmental Impacts (PGAIE)
The Government drew up the PGAIE on the basis of the environmental impact assessment.
In the course of the 1995 and 1996 supervision missions the Bank drew attention to the need
to prepare the plan, stressing that the matter should be approached with the greatest care because it
was the most sensitive point of the project and could reopen the entire question. The PGAIE was
prepared between May and October 1996 and was submitted to the donors before the December

1996 missions. It has been enriched on the basis of the different partners' comments and the final
version is currently available.
Its implementation is a good thing and all the parties involved have high expectations of it.
Integrated management of the Nakambe watershed
The donors require that an integrated management system for the Nakambe watershed be set
in place. The Government is in agreement with the principle of integrated management of the
watershed and has already taken steps to mobilize resources for the purpose by submitting a request
to DANIDA. The final documents for this project are currently available.
Contractor preselection
The procedure was started as of July 1996 and the results were communicated to the donors
during the December 1996 missions. Some conflicts with certain donors, mainly the Bank, have
prevented publication of the results so far, though this may be done in 1998.
Works supervision
The procedure for consultant selection was started as of September 1996, which was when
the preselection required by the Bank was organized. The committee selected nine consultants, but
the Bank had the number reduced to four.
After rejecting the report and requiring that additional analysis be made the Bank, after a
protracted exchange of correspondence, did not allow the procedure which led to the choice of the
consultant after the opening of the financial bids to go forward until September 1997.
Financing of the project
The financing terms and conditions of the different donors directly affected the retumr on the
project. While the most favorable loan conditions are obviously desirable, actual conditions and
rates proposed are not always the most concessional. In addition, certain financial packages which
need to be mobilized swiftly could well be permanently lost if matters continue to drag as they have
been doing. This would seriously impact the project's feasibility.
Tariff-setting
It has not always been possible for tariffs to be raised as recommended by the tariff study.
The last tariff increase went into effect on December 1, 1997. The Bank considers that these
increases are well below the required levels and cannot enable ONEA to achieve financial
equilibrium.
Performance contract
The second ONEA/State performance contract has been in effect since September 1997.
Some significant changes have been introduced compared with the first performance contract, so
that the roles of each partner are more clearly defined.  This will further facilitate the
implementation of the project.

Maitrise d'Ouvrage de Ziga
The Maftrise d'Ouvrage de Ziga (MOZ) was created by decree of the Council of Ministers
of September 24, 1996 (after the draft version of the decree had been amended by CFD), and a
director was appointed to head the structure set up at the same time. A study was made of the
organization and operation of the MOZ. The national party has followed the recommendations of
the study and of the donors, but certain donors, including the Bank, have not yet expressed their
final opinions regarding this structure.
Accounting and financial management (audit and certification of accounts)
The donors, headed by the World Bank, consider thdt ONEA's performance as regards
financial management and accounting is not of the best. Efforts are underway to remedy this, but
results are slow in materializing.
4.    SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROJECT
The studies financed by the World Bank (Engineering Credit 2519-BUR) and AFD (former
CFD) have resulted in the preparation of the preliminary engineering and the bidding documents for
seven packages of works, one package of supplies and two packages of services. The package No. 1
works were started with financing from Arab Funds in April 1998. The feasibility of the project is
now recognized by all.
5.  PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK AND OF ONEA
As long as the working climate was unruffled, the Bank was most responsive to all our
requests. It supervised the project by means of missions made up of several persons who came out
to us regularly every three months on project business (ten missions in all). Subsequently, however,
matters took the form of a constant battle because even questions we had thought settled were re-
examined all over again by the Bank and the project suffered every time.
The start of work on package No. 1 financed by Arab Funds confirms our impression that the
Bank had not really seen to the heart of the matter.
Aside from the tariff increases which, as noted, could not be put into effect, the borrower
made itself available in all circumstances and gave attentive consideration to all reasonable
recommendations.
The performance of the two parties can be considered acceptable but no more, since only one
package has been started.

6.    GLOBAL EVALUATION OF THE CREDIT
The project only achieved a part of its objectives. If the institutional recovery of ONEA has
not been accomplished, that is because the process is still underway and requires a certain time. In
our opinion the project is satisfactory.
7.    FUTURE OPERATIONS
We have already been informed three times that the Bank is ready to appraise the project, but
this has been deferred three times. Two conditions remain to be met: sector reform and training.
There are conditions with extensive and undetermined ramifications. We, too, are accordingly also
entitled to ask questions, this time once again about observance of the appraisal date. Technically,
the project has been ready since 1996.
8.    KEY LESSON
In overall terms, the type of credit (engineering credit) has by its nature enabled us to
accomplish the essentials of the objectives assigned to the project. It must be borne in mind,
however, that for the smooth running of a project of this scale it is necessary to establish frank
partnership relations which ought to enable each party to contribute on the basis of its experience to
accomplishment of the project objectives. This has not always been the case. One hopes that the
implementation of the future project will take place in a much more tranquil climate. The actions
undertaken by the national party recently are aimed in this direction and should clear the way for
appraisal of the project by the World Bank.
