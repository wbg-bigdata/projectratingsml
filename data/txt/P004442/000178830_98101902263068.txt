REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR
A SECOND GRAIN PROCESSING PROJECT THROUGH THE
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
1.        I submit the following   report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for an equivalent of $11.5 million.
The loan would have a term of 18 years, including five years of grace, and
an interest rate of 8.5 percent per annum. Of the proceeds of the loan, $11.2
million would be relent to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) on
the same terms as those of the Bank loan for on-lending to the private sector
for specific grain processing enterprises and the balance would finance a
post-harvest grain losses study to be administered by the Department of
Agriculture.
PART I - THE ECONOMY i'
2.        A basic economic mission visited the Philippines in April/May 1975
and its report, "The Philippines: Priorities and Prospects for Development,"
is expected to be distributed to the Executive Directors in the next few days.
Paragraphs 3-21 below are a summary of that report. The previous economic
report "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the Philippines"
(No. 568-PH of November 7, 1974) was circulated to the Executive Directors
on November 11, 1974. Annex I of this President's Report contains country
economic data.
3.        During the 1960s, the economy grew in real terms at the rate of
5-6 percent per annum. However, the rate of growth was less than the level
that might have been achieved if the considerable natural and human resources
of the Philippines had been ex)loited more effectively. Moreover, the bene-
fits of growth were not distributed widely, and unemployment rose. Low levels
of taxation resulted in inadequate public investment in necessary infrastruc-
ture and social services. Relatively weak export performance, combined with
a failure to reduce the import dependence of domestic industry, resulted
in a steady deterioration in the balance of payments position.
4.        During 1970-72, the authorities adopted policies of monetary and
fiscal restraint in order to lay a firm basis for future growth. With
assistance from the Consultative Group, they succeeded in improving substan-
tially the maturity structure of the external public debt. Real GNP during
that period increased at about 5 percent a year. In 1972, the Government
initiated a series of social and economic reforms in the country including
an agrarian reform program, tax reforms, and an administrative reorganiza-
tion. These programs are beginning to show results.
1/   This part, except for paragraph 11, which has been added, is the same
as in the President's Report for the Chico River Irrigation Project -
Stage I (Report No P-1783-PH) dated March 11, 1976.

of their official duties Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



- 2 -
5.        In 1973 there was a sharp Increase in the level of economic acti-
vity in the Philippines. This upsurge was led by the international commodity
boom, which resulted in higher export incomes in the Philippines, a strong
recovery in agricultural and industrial production for the domestic market
and an expansion in public and private investment. The growth in real GNP
doubled to 10 percent.
6.        Like most countries, the Phillppines was profoundly affected by
the tumultuous events in the world economy that began with the jump in the
prices for food and petroleum in late 1973. With international trade the
equivalent of almost half of its GNP, the Philippines proved quite vulner-
able to the impact of world inflation, the increase in oil prices and the
prolonged recession in the industrialized countries. This sequence of
events has temporarily frustrated the Government's attempt to accelerate
the rate of development, and in 1974 GNP increased by only about 6 percent
in real terms. While adverse effects of the recession were cushioned some-
what in 1974 by a modest improvement in the external terms of trade, the
Philippines has been even more seriously affected in 1975 by the continued
rise in import prices and reduced demand for Philippine exports.   The real
growth of GNP in 1975 is estimated to have been at about the 6 percent rate
of the previous year. Improvement in the growth performance in 1976 can be
expected only if recovery takes place in the economies of the Philippines'
main trading partners.
7.        Agricultural production has grown at an averaoe rate of 3.2 per-
cent per year during the 1970s, a period which has been affected by unusually
adverse weather conditions. Rice production increased by 25 percent in
1973-74, but due to serious damage by typhoons, it grew by only 1 percent in
1974-75, and the Government had to import 200,000 tons in the first half of
1975 to ensure adequate stocks. However, initial indications are that the
outlook for rice production in 1975-76 is bright. The Government is giving
the highest priority to increasing agricultural production and has initiated
a'number of programs designed to expand the use of fertilizer, irrigation and
supervised credit. It has also intensified efforts to expand social services
needed in rural areas, including rural electrification, health and family
planning services as well as small-scale road and irrigation projects.
8.        Although progress has been slower than initially planned, the
Government has made some progress with Its agrarian reform for the nation's
one million tenant farmers who grow rice and corn. By December 1, 1975, the
Government had issued Certtficates of Land Transfer in respect of 208,000
of the 424,000 tenants on holdings of over 7 ha; thus, title to 366,000
ha of the total of 825,000 ha farms occupied by such tenants has been trans-
ferred. The Government has raised the cash portion of the compensation pack-
age to landlords to reduce their resistance to land reform, but strong ad-
ministrative efforts will be necessary to ensure continued progress in the
implementation of the program.
9.        Industry accounts for almost 30 percent of net domestic product,
one-third of total fixed investment and 15 percent of total employmeent.   In-
dustrial production, whi-h grew hy 12 percent in 1973, was adversely affected
in 1974 by the world-wide economic slowdown and grew by only 3.6 percent in



1975. This decline is primarily a result of depressed demand for Philippine
exports on the part of the country's main trading partners and the concomitant
slowdown in the rate of economic growth in the Philippines. Nonetheless, the
long-term prospects for industrial growth are favorable because of the natural
and human resource endowment of the Philippines and a very active private
sector.
10.       The Government has made significant progress in increasing public
investment. The ratio of public investment to GNP is currently about 3 per-
cent compared with 1.8 percent in FY72. The Government has also implemented
a series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in tax administration.
These reforms, aided by the increased economic activity, the boom in export
incomes, and domestic inflation, resulted in a 36 percent increase in national
government tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47 percent in FY74. As
result, the ratio of national government tax revenues to GNP has increased
from an average of 9 percent in recent years to an estimated 12.3 percent in
FY74 and stayed at this level in FY75.
11.       Significant financial reforms have also been enacted.    At the begin-
ning of 1976, the Central Bank issued circulars designed to help rationalize
the level and structure of deposit and lending rates, and deposit rates were
raised for the second time in 18 months; long-standing statutory ceilings on
the long-term lending rates of banking institutions were increased from 12-14
percent to 19 percent per annum, and the ceilings on short-term lending rates
were also raised. Efforts were also made to control short-term money market
operations and strengthen the organized banking institutions. These actions
are important steps in improving the mobilization and allocation of domestic
resources in the Philippines.
12.       In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines and in 1974 consumer prices rose by almost 40 percent. The
rise was caused by the large increase in liquidity that came with the export
boom in 1973-74, and by a number of cost-push factors, including the higher
rate of world inflation. To deal with this problem, the Government adopted
contractionary monetary and fiscal policies, and attempted to reduce the
impact of inflation on consumers by subsidizing such essential goods as wheat,
imported rice, and cooking oil. As a consequence of the Government's measures,
the annual rate of inflation decreased to less than 20 percent at the end of
1974 and less than 10 percent in 1975.
13.       The rapid inflation in 1974 exacerbated the decline in real wages
which had begun in 1970. Overall, there was a decline of about 20 percent
in real wages during 1974. In order to offset the deterioration of real
wages in urban areas, the Government increased the salaries of Government
employees and directed private firms to grant emergency cost of living ad-
justments to employees earning less than P 600 per month. Nevertheless
real urban wage incomes declined and reduced the demand for manufactured
products, which contributed to the poor performance of the manufacturing
sector in 1974. The depression in the urban areas was partly offset by the
improvement in rural incomes that stemmed from continued high prices for
agricultural commodities.



14.       On the external side, the Philippine balance of payments bene-
fitted considerably from the international commodity price boom during 1973.
High prices for the country's chief exports, including coconut products,
sugar, copper and wood products resulted in a 70 percent boost in export
earnings and a balance of payments surplus of about $670 million. Since
mid-1974, the external trade position has deteriorated, due to the sharp
increases in the prices of oil and other imports, less favorable prices for
Philippine exports, and reduced volume of some exports resulting from the
recession in the economies of the Philipines' main trading partners. As a
result, the overall balance of payments surplus fell to about $100 million in
1974, and a deficit of about $400 million was recorded in 1975. International
reserves stood at around $1.1 billion at the end of 1975, the equivalent of
about three months imports.
15.       The outlook for 1976 is for exports to increase by about 12 percent
in real terms on the assumption that there will be some international economic
recovery. Imports will need to grow by about 7 percent in real terms in order
to maintain the growth of the economy. Due to a modest deterioration of the
terms of trade, the current account deficit may reach about $1.0 billion
compared to $860 million in 1975. Medium and long term capital inflows are
expected to finance most of this deficit, producing an overall balance of
payments deficit of about $200 million. Such a deficit can be managed without
serious pressure on reserves through utilization of IMF facilities and by
short-term foreign borrowing by the Central Bank.
16.       The overall level of debt of the Philippines is expected to remain
within reasonable limits, as the ratio of debt service payments to exports
and non-factor services would average about 16-17 percent during the rest of
this decade. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is
about 10 percent and its share in debt-service is about 4 percent. These
shares are expected to increase somewhat in the years ahead.
17.       Foreign assistance on concessional terms will be essential to help
to finance the larger investment expenditures which will be necessary for the
country's development. In order to ensure that disbursement of external
assistance reaches levels commensurate with the level of development expend-
itures which will be required during the latter part of the decade, total
commitments of official assistance will need to be maintained in real terms
at least at the level of about $500 million which was achieved in 1974. The
Consultative Group for the Philippines at its meeting in Paris on October 1,
1975, agreed that it would be reasonable for the Philippine Government to
seek aid commitments of about $600 million during 1976; another meeting of
the Consultative Group has been called for June 15 and 16, 1976 mainly to
review prospects and needs over the next 5-10 years, which were analysed in
the Bank's most recent economic report.
Growth Prospects
18.       Despite the slowdown in the growth of the economy, which is primarily
a result of worldwide economic conditions, the Government remains committed



to regaining the growth momentum which began in 1973 to provide for a con-
tinued increase in incomes and employment. High priority must be accorded
to expanding employment opportunities - in the short-term as well as the
long-tenm - because unemployment and underemployment are still high, and the
labor force continues to grow at 3 percent a year.
19.       Priority must also be given to expanding food production for the
domestic market, to expanding industrial export production and to accelerating
development of local energy resources. The difficulties experienced during
the last two years In importing sufficient quantities of food at reasonable
prices, especially cereals, have increased the Government's resolve to
achieve self-sufficiency in rice and corn as soon as possible. The Govern-
ment rightly recognizes that the increased cost of petroleum and other
imports cannot be financed indefinitely by borrowing abroad, and it is active-
ly encouraging both local and foreign investors to expand the productive
capacity of export industries and to undertake major new import-replacing
investments. Because it will take time for these investments to have an
impact on the balance of payments, the Government is seeking increased
support from the international financial community to help carry out its
development program and to ease the adjustment to higher petroleum and other
import prices. Because of the substantial easing of the external debt burden
which has taken place in the last several years, the Philippines now has the
capacity to borrow externally larger amounts of capital on appropriate terms
to support its development program.
20.       Given the likely availability of resources and the expected growth
in various sectors, it is reasonable for the Government to plan for a longer
term growth in GNP of about 7 percent a year in real terms. To achieve
this objective, increased investments will be necessary in a wide range of
industries. Public investments also need to be increased. A new public
infrastructure program is being prepared, and the Government is putting
emphasis on developing nuclear and indigenous power sources and on irrigation,
feeder roads and other projects to support increased food production. The
Government has made considerable progress in recent years in building up the
capacity of public sector agencies to prepare and execute projects. However,
there will be a need for continued efforts to strengthen this aspect of
administration. The ratio of public investment to GNP will need to rise
from the present level of 3 percent to at least 5 percent by 1980. To support
this level of investment, the Government will need to intensify its tax efforts
so that the ratio of national taxes to GNP continues to rise from its present
level of 11-12 percent to 14 percent by 1980.
21.       The Government's ambitious development program will continue to
require foreign resources in addition to the capital which would become
available for the financing of the foreign exchange component of develop-
ment projects. Some financing of local costs is justified, especially for
projects of economic and social importance which need only limited amounts
of foreign exchange. In view of the Philippines balance of payments and ex-
ternal debt position, and taking into account the country's performance in
economic development and its relatively low per capita income, the Philip-
pines is considered eligible for Third Window loans from the Bank. One Third



- 6 -
Window loan of $25 million for the Third Education Project has already
been approved by the Executive Directors, and one additional Third Window
loan of $10 million is proposed as part of the financing for the Manila
Urban Development Project.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
22.       By April 30, 1976, the Philippines had received 35 Bank loans and
3 IDA credits totalling $886.7 million, net of cancellations. About 33 per-
cent of the Bank/IDA lending, $293 million, has been for infrastructure proj-
ects in power, transportation, and water supply and $63 million has been for
population and education projects. Of the remainder, about $280 million has
been for agriculture and about $250 million for industry. There has been a
marked improvement in the way Bank financed projects in the Philippines have
been executed in the last three years, compared with experience in the 1960s,
when shortages of peso counterpart funds combined with poor administration to
cause serious problems. All on-going projects are now being implemented
reasonably well. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1976 and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
23.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to continue to support
the Philippine development effort with its particular emphasis on agriculture
and infrastructure. Shortages of domestic revenues led to low investment for
these purposes in the past. The last three years have seen major changes which
have helped to overcome these constraints and both the ambitious Philippine
development program and the Bank's lending program have been designed to make
good past neglect and to meet future needs. Commitments of $165.1 million in
FY74 and $208 million in FY75 compared to an average of about $30 million a
year in the preceding five years.
24.       Five loans totalling $212 million have so far been approved in
FY76. This proposed loan for the Second Grain Processing Project, which is
being presented at the same meeting as a proposed loan for the Second
Fisheries Project, and proposed loans for the Manila Urban Development
Project, which may be also be presented before the end of this month, are the
last loans for the Philippines scheduled for consideration during this fiscal
year. Loans for a highways and a power project may be ready for presentation
to the Executive Directors in the first half of FY77.
25.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $76.2 mil-
lion for investments in 13 companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of March 31, 1976, $19.1 million had been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $3.7 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $53.0 million. On the
same date, all commitments were fully disbursed. Preliminary proposals
have been received for an aluminium smelter and other projects in the pulp
and paper, dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilidng fields.



PART III - THE AGRIACULTURAL SECTOR
26.       Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy
accounting for approximately one-third of the gross national product, about
one-half of total employment and about 70 percent of export earnings. Over 70
percent of the total land under cultivation is used for production of cereals,
almost exclusively rice and corn. Much of the remaining land is taken up by
export crops including sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapples and tobacco.
27.       The performance of the agricultural sector will be crucial in
determing whether the Philippines can increase income both rapidly and equit-
ably.  At present, the domestic market for industrial products is const-r-led
by relatively low rural incomes. Although in recent years there has been i
substantial change in the internal terms of trade in favor of agriculture the
problems of poverty and income distribution continue to be particularly acute
in the rural areas; of the 15 million people in the bottom 40 percent of the
income scale, 12 million live in rural areas at or below the minimum sub-
sistence level 1/. The Government is aware of these problems and is dealing
with them by increasing investment and institutional support in the agricul-
tural sector, implementing the land reform program and initiating a number of
other rural development programs.
28.       A major Government objective is to increase rice and corn produc-
tion as a means of increasing incomes of small farmers and attaining national
self-sufficiency in foodgrains. Rice production increased rapidly in the
1960s, primarily due to the introduction of high yielding varieties (HYVs),
but production was adversely affected during the early 1970s by unfavorable
weather conditions and crop disease. In the past two years, rice yields have
recovered and production has increased. Attaining self-sufficiency in rice
will depend to some extent on bringing additional land under cultivation, but
largely on improving yields through expansion in the area under irrigation,
increased use of HYVs and other agricultural inputs and the provision of
adequate credit and supporting services. Corn production, which is con-
centrated in Mindanao, has increased by about 5 percent a year during the
1970s, mainly due to the expansion in the area under cultivation. The
Philippines has long been self-sufficient in corn for human consumption,
but has become a steady importer of corn for animal feed.
29.       Rice and corn mills in the Philippines are predominantly privately
owned, although the National Grains Authority (NGA) is starting to build
up its own capacity. The millers are virtually all small- to medium-sized
local entrepreneurs, operating usually one and seldom more than two or
three mills. Even the larger mills are generally family operations. The
two main types of entrepreneurs are the very small millers, who process grain

minimum subsistence level in 1971 was estimated to be $140 equivalent.



- 8 -
for a fee, and the larger millers, who trade in grain. The latter often
provide credit to farmers and small grain traders as a means of helping
ensure an adequate supply of grain for their mills. Because there are many
relatively small mills, which need to procure adequate grain for efficient
operation, the industry is competitive in most areas of the country.
30.       To support the Government's rice and corn production programs,
substantial investments in grain processing facilities will be necessary to
provide the drying, milling and storage capacity needed to accommodate in-
creased production and to reduce the very substantial losses which presently
occur between harvest and final consumption. When harvests are good, trans-
portation bottlenecks develop and grain storage shortages are severe, partic-
ularly in the southern areas of the country. At present, about 95 percent of
grain is sun dried, which often results in high grain losses. Small mecha-
nical grain driers are not viable financially and the best means of expanding
mechanical drying is to introduce larger units in the rice and corn mills.
Overall rice milling efficiency is low because 35 percent of paddy production
is milled by the oldest type of mechanical mill (kiskisan) 1/, which provides
recovery rates of only about 60 percent compared to the more modern types of
mills (cono 2/) with recovery rates of 65-69 percent. About one-third of corn
milling is done by traditional grinders and the remainder by more efficient
roller mills. Total corn milling capacity is adequate for present production,
but additional milling capacity will be needed where corn production is
increasing rapidly, especially Mindanao.
31.       The Philippines has developed efficient cono rice mill and roller
corn mill equipment manufacturing industries. Domestic mills cost approxi-
mately half as much as comparable imports; however some components, including
rubber hullers, are still imported.
32.       In February 1971, the Bank made a loan of $14.3 million to the
Government for a first Rice Processing and Storage Project (Loan No. 720-PH)
to assist the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) initiate a program
of long-term lending to help expand and modernize the grain processing in-
dustry. The project was originally designed to help finance construction of
integrated modern rice processing mills, including bulk silos and automated
grain handling facilities. Sub-loan demand initially did not materialize
because the integrated mills proved to be too large and too capital intensive
for the Philippine context. Furthermore, grain production fell sharply during
the first two years of project implementation, which contributed to a reduction
in the demand for sub-loans for grain processing. The project was revised
in March 1972, and in May 1974 to permit sub-loans for improvement of existing
rice and corn mills, financing of other post-harvest equipment, smaller sub-

2/   A cono mill performs hulling and polishing in two separate operations.

loans and sub-loans for certain public entities (SecM 74-244). Since mid-1974,
sub-loan approvals have been made at a rapid pace. As of February 20, 1976,
DPB had approved 132 sub-loans amounting to about $12 million, had disbursed
$4.4 million, and had 30 outstanding applications for sub-loans totalling
$4.3 million. The Bank loan is expected to be fully committed by June 30,
1976 and fully disbursed by the revised Closing Date, June 30, 1977. Of the
total amount of sub-loans approved, 49 percent is for three large corn silo/
feed mill complexes, 39 percent is for rice mills, 10 percent for corn mills
and 2 percent for small feed mills. Most of these sub-projects are being
successfully implemented.
33.       Under the first project, DBP has developed considerable expertise
in lending for grain processing and thus has become the major source of the
long-term credit and technical assistance needed to foster the development
of the industry. The project has met the need for bulk silos for feed mill
complexes and enabled rice and corn production to expand into new areas,
particularly in Mindanao. In addition to helping to expand and modernize
milling, drying, and storage facilities, the project has supported the develop-
ment of the domestic rice and corn mill equipment manufacturing industry. The
proposed second grain processing project would help DBP to improve and expand
further its lending program for grain processing and thus help support the
Government's grain production program. As a result of the experience gained
through the first project, several changes have been made in the proposed
project. It would de-emphasize large integrated grain mills and bulk silos
which initially formed the core of the first project, and would concentrate
on raising milling efficiency through the financing of more conventional,
medium-size mills equipped with improved milling and ancillary equipment.
Any unanticipated future need for large bulk silo facilities would be met
under another Bank-financed project, the Second Industrial Investment Credit
Project (Loan 1190-PH), approved by the Executive Directors on December 16,
1975 (SecM 75-239). Small on-farm driers have also been excluded for the
present because they remain financially unviable due to high operating costs
caused principally by the increase in oil prices. The proposed project
would also assist DBP to establish an improved reporting system and to
improve sub-loan collections.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
34.       The purpose of the proposed project is to help provide the milling,
drying, storage and transportation facilities needed to increase the supply of
rice and corn in the Philippines by reducing post harvest losses and inducing
increased production in areas now without adequate processing facilities.
Some of the rice mills would replace old inefficient mills, and the balance
of the rice mills and the corn mills would help meet the milling requirements
of areas with rapidly increasing grain production and areas with inadequate
milling capacity. The project would help improve rural incomes by providing
more secure and competitive outlets for farmers' products. It would also help



- 10 -
DBP to continue to improve the standards of its lending operations in this
sub-sector. The project was prepared by DBP. A Bank mission appraised the
Project in August/September 1975, and negotiations were held in April 1976.
His Excellency Eduardo Z. Romualdez, the Philippine Ambassador to the United
States, led the Government's negotiating team. The Appraisal Report
(No. 1045b-PH) on the proposed project is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. Annex III provides a loan and project summary.
Description of the Project
35.       The project is expected to finance about 135 rice mills and 20
corn mills and associated mechanical and solar driers, warehouses, trucks
and ancillary equipment. The distribution of mills by size is expected to
be similar to those financed under the first project. About one half of
the rice mills would be in the medium-size range of about one ton per hour
capacity, and the remainder divided equally between half-ton and two-ton
mills. All of the rice mills would be cono types and all of the larger
ones would be equipped with more efficient rubber hullers, in addition to
the traditional stone hullers. The bulk of the corn mills would also be in
the one-ton range, but about six would have five-ton capacity. All rice and
corn mills would have solar driers, and the larger mills would also have
mechanical driers. All mills would have their own warehouses, and all,
except the half-ton mills, which would be designed to serve an immediate
local area, would have their own transport facilities. The rice mills would
be fairly widespread geographically, while most of the corn mills would be
in Mindanao.
36.       The rice mills are expected to operate about 2,000 hours per year,
about the national average for cono mills. Their combined throughput would
be about 300,000 tons of paddy per year, which is about 4.3 percent of pro-
jected 1979 rice production in the Philippines or 33 percent of projected
incremental production between 1976 and 1979. The corn mills would operate
about 2,500 hours per year, and would mill about 110,000 tons of corn per
year, which is about 3.7 percent of projected 1979 corn production or
37 percent of projected incremental production between 1976 and 1979.
37.       The project would also include assistance to the Department of
Agriculture to undertake a study of post-harvest grain losses, which would
identify more precisely the causes and extent of grain losses between harvest
and final consumption and would recommend a program of action to reduce these
losses. The terms of reference for the study would be agreed with the Bank
and the findings submitted to the Bank for review (Section 3.09 of the
Loan Agreement).
Project Execution
38.       As under the first Rice Processing and Storage Project, the credit
component of the proposed project would be administered by DBP, a wholly
Government-owned development bank which operates in all sectors of the eco-
nomy. It is the largest and most important institutional source of long-term
finance in the Philippines. Since its inception in 1958, it has provided



financial assistance, including ioan guarantees, totalling nearly $3 billion
and, as of June 30, 1975, its total assets amounted to $1 billion equivalent.
DBP's lending operations have increased parttcularly rapidly in FY75 and
reached a level of $320 million, compared to $39 million in 1974. This
increase more than offsets a deliberate reduction in DBP's guarantee opera-
tions, which decreased from $373 million in FY74 to $106 million in FY75.
Equity investments, mainly in Government enterprises, were approved total-
ling $28 million in FY75, a much higher level than in the previous year.
The volume and diversity of its operations give it a prominent and unique
role in financing development programs. DBP has administered a number of
Bank-assisted projects in the industrial, shipping, and agricultural (fish-
eries, livestock, and rice processing) sectors; the implementation of these
projects has been satisfactory.
39.       DBP's overall capabilities and financial position were described
in detail in the President's Report (SecM 75-239) on the proposed loan for
the Second Industrial Investment Credit Project (Loan No. 1190-PH), approved
by the Executive Directors on December 16, 1975. Since then DBP's present
management has continued successfully to strengthen the institution and raise
the standards of its operations. As a result, noticeable improvements are
taking place in the functioning of individual departments and in operational
and financial planning. DBP has a total staff of about 3,000, over half of
whom are located in branch offices. The calibre of the staff is generally
good, although there still remains a need for greater depth at the middle
management level.
40.       DBP's financial position is reasonably sound.     Its liquidity
position is secure (current ratio 2:1) as is its long-term capital structure
(long-term debt-equity ratio 4.5:1). In order to increase DBP's long-term
domestic resources, the Government is taking actions, agreed with the Bank,
to increase DBP's equity and convert $53 million of short-term Treasury
deposits into a loan with a five-year maturity. DBP's net income for FY75
was $10 million, a decline of 21 percent from the previous year. The dec-
line in income reflected mainly a decline in collections, as a result of
the effects of the economic downturn in FY75 on many of DBP's clients. To
improve its financial position, as agreed with the Bank, DBP in January 1974
increased interest rates, penalty charges and fees; is now introducing prompt
reminder procedures for overdue accounts and is planning steps both to improve
its system of reporting and recording arrears and to improve its collection
performance on industrial accounts.
41.       The Grain Processing Division (GPD) in the Cereals Group of DBP
would be responsible for the processing of sub-loans financed under the project.
It has a division chief and a staff of four engineers, two financial analysts
and one economist. Three of the engineers began work in early 1975 in line
with the recommendation of a Bank supervision mission. Although GPD's ap-
praisal standards have improved considerably, it needs additional trained
staff in order to improve the analysis of the economic and marketing aspects
of sub-projects; GDP is taking steps to recruit additional staff in these
areas of expertise to fill positions recently authorized. The proposed pro-
ject would entail only a very moderate increase in the rate of sub-project



- 12 -
commitments experienced under the first project and GPD should therefore be
able to carry out the proposed project effectively. A summary of operating
policies and procedures for sub-loan administration under the project is set
out in Schedule 3 of the draft Loan Agreement.
42.       Loan collection has been a serious problem in DBP's operations in
the grain processing sector due in part to poor appraisal work and inadequate
collection efforts. As of December 31, 1975, DBP had 806 loans outstanding
for grain processing totalling $13.3 million equivalent, of which $7 million
equivalent or 54 percent was overdue. DBP has also had to advance $6.6 mil-
lion on two rice mills whose supplier credits it guaranteed, and is liable for
an additional $1.3 million. DBP is aware of these problems and has undertaken
to review its grain processing portfolio, prepare a detailed plan of action
for reducing arrears by June 30, 1977 for discussion with the Bank, to im-
plement the plan thereafter in accordance with a timetable to be agreed with
the Bank and to provide arrears information to the Bank with DBP's regular
quarterly reports (Section 4.06 of the Loan Agreement).
43.       To improve its overall reporting and monitoring systems, GPD is
introducing a system of reports from all project sub-borrowers showing, on a
monthly basis, the utilization of milling, storage and drying facilities
(Section 3.08 of the draft Loan Agreement). The form of these reports has
been discussed with the Bank and summary information would be forwarded to the
Bank. In addition to the information on the utilization of project facilities,
DBP's quarterly reports to the Bank would also include summary data on sub-
loans applications, approvals, disbursements and repayments; working capital
loans; and civil works and equipment procurement (Section 3.07 of the Loan
Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
44.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be $28.5 million,
including working capital requirements of $3.8 million; the estimated foreign
exchange cost is $11.2 million. Cost estimates include price contingencies
amounting to 31 percent of base line costs to take into account the effects of
international and domestic inflation expected during the project implementation
period. The proposed Bank loan of $11.5 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange cost of the sub-loans made by DBP under the project and the
full amount of expenditures to be agreed between the Bank and the Government
for the post-harvest grain losses study, including the cost of local consul-
tants. These agreed expenditures would not include normal Government bud-
getary costs associated with administering and carrying out the study. The
loan would have a term of 18 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The
loan would be made to the Government, which would relend $11.2 million of the
proceeds to DBP on the same terms as those of the Bank loan. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk. The execution of a subsidiary loan
agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed loan (Section 5.02 of the Loan Agreement). The balance of the
loan of $300,000 would be used by the Department of Agriculture to finance a
study of post-harvest grain losses.



- 13 -
45.       DBP would lend the proceeds of the Bank loan, together with funds
from its own resources, to private individuals and corporations with prior
experience in the grain industry. Each sub-borrower would contribute from his
own resources at least 20 percent of the investment cost of each sub-project.
Sub-loans would have a maximum repayment term of 14 years, including a maximum
of two years of grace. DBP would provide out of its own resources working
capital loans needed by sub-borrowers to finance their requirements during the
sub-project implementation period (Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement).
Sub-loans, including working capital loans to the same sub-borrower, of more
than $600,000 would be subject to the prior approval of the Bank and the
minimum sub-loan size would be $4,000. It is expected that with this free
limit about 10 percent by number and 30 percent by amount of the sub-loans
would be subject to the Bank's prior approval. Interest rates on sub-loans
and working capital loans would be in accordance with DBP's interest rate
policy; at present DBP charges 12 percent for loans secured by land and 14
percent for loans secured by other forms of collateral but an increase in
these rates is being considered in close consultation with the Bank. In
addition, subloans over $400,000 equivalent would be subject to a service
charge of up to 2 percent per annum of amounts outstanding to cover DBP's
costs of sub-loan appraisal and supervision.
Procurement
46.        Civil works contracts of more than $200,000 would be awarded by
sub-borrowers on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines. As under the first project, DBP would be permitted
to prequalify contractors after international advertisement and would update
its lists of prequalified contractors at intervals of not more than eighteen
months. Civil works contracts of between $100,000 and $200,000 are not ex-
pected to attract foreign bidders because the works are small and geographic-
ally scattered; sub-borrowers would, therefore, award such contracts on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with acceptable
procedures. For civil works contracts of less than $100,000, sub-borrowers
would select contractors through ordinary commercial channels with due regard
for economy and suitability.
47.       Procurement of equipment and materials would not be suitable for
international competitive bidding because of the need to take into account
sub-borrowers justified preferences for particular types of equipment and to
permit them to purchase spare parts and additions to their existing equipment.
To reflect sub-borrowers preferences for equipment and to take advantage of
competition among suppliers, procurement would be on the basis of quotations
received from prequalified suppliers. For this purpose, DBP would advertise
internationally, inviting firms to indicate their capabilities and interest
in being included in the list of prequalified suppliers for goods likely to be
financed under the project; the list would be updated annually. For equipment
estimated to cost over $20,000 DBP would send the full list of prequalified
suppliers to all sub-borrowers, and require them to obtain written quotations
from at least three of the prequalified suppliers on DBP's list and to justify
to DBP any selection other than the lowest bidder. In addition, for equipment



- 14 -
estimated to cost $100,000 or more, DBP and the sub-borrower would together
establish the design criteria and performance specifications required.
Equipment estimated to cost less than $20,000 would be procured through
normal commercial channels with due regard for economy and suitability.
Disbursement
48.       The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over four and one-half
years. The Bank would reimburse 56 percent of DBP's disbursements for sub-
loans (excluding working capital) to project beneficiaries, against support-
ing evidence of disbursements by DBP; and would disburse against 100 percent
of the agreed expenditures for the post-harvest grain losses study.
Benefits and Justification
49.       The proposed project would continue the process of replacing old
or inefficient mills by modern, high recovery mills, and would help pro-
vide the milling, drying, storage and transport facilities needed to support
increased rice and corn production in the Philippines. The proposed project
would also help improve rural incomes by providing more secure and competi-
tive outlets for farmers' products. It would cause virtually no degradation
of the environment.
50.       At full development, the 135 rice mills and 20 corn mills to be
financed under the project would produce annually 207,000 tons of milled
rice with a wholesale value of $48 million, 72,000 tons of milled corn with
a value of $11.4 million and 60,000 tons of by-products (mainly bran) with
a value of about $7 million. The improved facilities would reduce post-
harvest grain losses by an estimated 17,000 tons of grains per year, would
increase rice milling recovery rates resulting in a net increase of about
7,000 tons of milled rice per year, and induce increased production of about
21,000 tons of grains in areas now without adequate processing facilities.
The project is expected to result in foreign exchange savings of about
$11 million per year. The estimated financial rates of return on invest-
ments vary from 25 percent for one ton capacity rice mills to 28 percent
for the corn mills, with a weighted average of 27 percent. The correspond-
ing economic rates of return range from 16 to 30 percent, with an overall
weighted average for the project of 28 percent.
51.        In addition to these quantifiable benefits, the project would
continue to help DBP's Grain Processing Division to improve further its
appraisal and supervision procedures and its collection performance. During
the project implementation period, particular emphasis would be given to
improving the economic and marketing analysis of projects, reporting and
monitoring procedures and loan collection methods. The post-harvest grain
losses study is expected to assist Government in identifying more precisely
the causes and extent of such losses and to develop long-term programs for
reducing them.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft reso-
lution approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. A subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to the Bank,
would be entered into between the Borrower and DBP, and its execution would
be a condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The draft Loan Agree-
ment conforms to the pattern for previous loans for lending programs carried
out by DBP. The operating policies and procedures governing the onlending of
the proceeds of the loan are set forth in Schedule 3 to the draft Loan
Agreement.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Ln. No. 637-PH       Upper Pampanga River Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan
of August 18, 1960; Date of Effectiveness: October
15, 1960; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area.
The project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future
irrigation development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the
1972 floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule.
Most of the work has been completed and the loan is expected to be entirely
disbursed by the Closing Date. Project costs have increased 40 percent over
appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the effects of
successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam (which
accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). The increase in costs is
being financed by the Government. However, as a result of the close coordina-
tion established between irrigation and agricultural support services, the
project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion of
construction, instead of 13 years which was the appraisal estimate. Also,
nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by including lands
which were formerly under a private irrigation system. Finally, there has
been a considerable increase in the projected world market price of rice.
As a result, the estimated rate of return is now more than at appraisal.
Ln. No. 720-PH       Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: May 10, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modern-
ization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities. Due
in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be
small, and, as explained in the President's Memorandum dated June 8, 1972
(R72-40), the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to
rehabilitation of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the
project made little progress. The loan agreement was amended again in April,
1974 basically (i) to expand the scope of the project to include corn in
addition to rice, (ii) to enable local governments and the National Grains

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Authority to borrow funds under the project, and (iii) to streamline pro-
curement procedures (President's memorandum SecM74-244 of April 15, 1974).
As a result of these amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactori-
ly and the loan is expected to be fully committed by June 30, 1976, and
fully disbursed before the revised Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 731-PH       Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Date of Effectiveness: July 23, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976
The project is financing the construction and improvement of the
Cotabato - Digos road in Mindanao (160 km). Construction is only 55 percent
complete based on the original scope of works, the delay being mainly due
to civil disturbances and army activity on part of the road representing
about 20 percent of the total roadworks. As there is little chance of the
contractor being able to enter this area, the Bank has agreed to a Government
proposal to delete this stretch of the road from the contract and eventually
execute the work by force account; the undisbursed amount of the loan fund
will be applied to the balance of works which-can be completed by contract.
The total cost of the reduced project is estimated to be about US$16.4 million
compared to appraisal estimate of US$15.8 million. The increase in cost
is due to a rise in construction costs which has been substantial since oil
price increases in late 1973. The roadworks have been completed in December
1975. The other components of the project including UNDP-financed feas-
ibility studies were completed in 1973. The closing date has been extended
from May 15, 1975 to June 30, 1976. Technical assistance to the Department
of Public Highways is continuing with Bank financing under the Second High-
way Project.
Ln. No. 809-PH       Fifth Power; US$22.0 and US$10.0 million Loan
and                  and Credit of April 3, 1972; Date of Effectiveness;
Cr. No. 296-PH       July 1, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is proceeding satisfactorily,
and the unit is expected to be commissioned during the second quarter of
1976. The erection of transmission lines has been somewhat delayed due to
unfavorable weather and poor soil conditions and is now expected to be
completed in June 1976. A tariff increases was approved, effective
July 1, 1974, and a new tariff increase is under active consideration.
Ln. No. 823-PH       Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of Mtay 25, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: November 9, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the
Philippines. The start of DBP lending operations was delayed by about six



ANNEX II

months because of late appointment of technical staff. Sub-loan commitments
were slow therefore but they improved so that all funds were fully committed
by December 1975. The project has expanded the agricultural credit capability
of DBP into a new and important field thus meeting a previously unsatisfied
demand for loans for small to medium scale livestock projects.
Cr. No. 471-PH       Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Credit of
May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974;

Ln. No. 984-PH       Auroroa-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Loan of
May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This is the second irrigation development and rehabilitation pro-
ject In the Philippines to be financed by the Bank. The project diverts
water from the Aurora basin into the Pantabangan Reservoir, to provide year-
round irrigation for 25,300 ha of rice land in Central Luzon. The project
also includes an Irrigation Development Study for Central Luzon to inventory
water, land, and other resources and identify priority irrigation projects.
Although there has been some delay in constructing the two diversion dams
because of the need for more extensive foundations and abutment area grouting
than originally expected, most difficulties have been overcome and the work is
progressing satisfactorily. Diversion of 75 percent of Aurora water into
Pantabangan Reservoir was achieved in September 1975, one year ahead of the
appraisal schedule. In the area served by the project, lack of competition
and high bids have delayed awarding of contracts. Urgent work is being done by
Government force account. Project costs have increased about 54 percent over
appraisal estimates, largely as a result of inflation.      There would be added
benefits from early diversion, however, resulting in additional water for
irrigation sooner than planned, but the rate of return is expected to fall
from 17 percent at appraisal to 14 percent.
Ln. No. 998-PH       Industrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-farmers:
US$50.0 million Loan of June 12, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: September 9, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The proceeds of the loan are being relent to the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of the loan (US$48 mil-
lion) is being used by DBP to finance direct imports for medium and relatively
large industrial projects. DBP is using the balance (US$2 million) to finance
about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming project. As of March 31,
1976 commitments for sub-loans totalling $44.7 million had been made. The
project is progressing satisfactorily.

Ln. No. 1010-PH      Third Rural Credit; US$22.0 million Loan of June 17, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: August 27, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The Central Bank relends the proceeds of the Loan (except for
a small amount for an evaluation study) to participating banks. These on-
lend the funds to farmers and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment
in farm mechanization, on- farm transportation, farm support facilities
and equipment, coastal and inland fisheries, small-scale livestock development
and cottage-scale agro-industry. The project also provides for a review
of the effectiveness of the First, Second and thiis project. The loan became
effective on August 27, 1974, and is expected to be fully committed in 1976.
Collection of arrears by about 200 participating banks from beneficiaries
under the first and second projects is not satisfactory. This is being
watched closely by Bank staff and appropriate steps are being taken by the
Central Bank to improve such collections.

Date of Effectiveness: November 15, 1974; Ciosing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100 MW hydro plant at Pantabangan and transmission lines £or the
further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by consultants
for a future power project. Major equipment for the plant has been con-
tracted and project commissioning is expected in January 1977 - three months
ahead of original schedule. The transmission component of the project is
proceeding in stages. Some lines are under construction and others are being
procured. The design work has been delayed due to NPC's heavy construction
program.   It is now expected that this part of the project will be completed
by the end of 1978, i.e. one year behind schedule. NPC raised Lts tariffs on
July 1, 1974, and a new tariff increase is under active consideration.
Cr. No. 349-PH       Second Education; US$12.7 million Credit of January 5,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: April 11, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The Credit is helping to finance a project for development of
technical and vocational education and for improvement in curriculum de-
velopment and teacher training. Construction has been about 11 months
behind schedule mainly due to delays in the finalization of design/drawing of
buildings and recruitment of specialist services. This delay is being
reduced through effective management by the project unit. Procurement of
equipment is on schedule. Both the program and schedule of technical
assistance have been revised to suit the current needs of project institu-
tions and to expedite implementation. Disbursements are ahead of the

The project is helping the Government to implement its program
of construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads,
by financing the construction, improvement and rehabilitation of 1,400 kms of
roads in Luzon. Work has begun on all 14 contracts, 10 of which were awarded
to local contractors. Costs have increased sharply, but price adjustments are
being awarded to contractors by the Government to offset the sharp rises in
costs of basic materials, fuels and labor. The UNDP financed Road Feasibility
Studies (Phase II), for which the Bank is executing Agency, have been completed
and a possible Third Highway project is now being appraised. Execution of
other minor project items is proceeding generally on schedule.
