PREFACE
This is a performance review of the Second Grain Processing Project
in the Philippines, for which Loan 1269-PH of $11.5 million was approved on
May 13, 1976.  The loan was fully disbursed and closed on November 17, 1983-
This report consists of only the Project Completion Report Overview
(PCRO) prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Projects Department.  The
detailed Project Completion Report (PCR) which was prepared by the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP) is available on request from the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED). The Project has not been subject to audit by
OED.
Comments on the PCR from other agencies involved in project imple-
mentation and the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) are incor-
porated in the final PCR which was submitted to the Bank in February 1984.
Attachment III reproduces NEDA's comments sent to DBP on the draft PCR.
Copies of the Bank-prepared PCRO were sent to the Borrower in October 1984.
Comments received from NEDA have been incorporated and are reproduced as
Attachments. DBP sent a telex stating that it was generally in agreement with
the Overview, and therefore offered no further comments. A copy of the telex
is also included as Attachment II.
The data and analyses in the PCR provide an accurate presentation of
the project's performance, and the PCRO, while it summarizes the project's
salient features and performance, also discusses the Bank's role in project
implementation.

HIGHLIGHTS
The project was designed to increase the supply of rice and corn in
the Philippines in continuation of the first Crain Processing Project (Loan
720-PH). It proposed to do so by providing credit througlh DBP for construc-
tion, rehabilitation and acquisition of milling, drying, storage and transport
*           facilities, tlhereby inducing increased production and reducing post-harvest
grain losses.
The project contributed to the much needed physical facilities of
the country for grain processing and storage; however, recovery rate ;and use
of installed capacity are below expectation (PCRO, para 16) accounting for
subproject financial rates of return below appraisal estimates. Poor subloan
recovery and high overhead have contributed to the adverse financial position
of DBP. While this loan had been fully disbursed, factors extern.al to DBP's
agricultural lending operations have caused DBP to stop all subproject lending
including its lending for grain processing and storage.
Although project impact on the economic condition of the country has
not come up to the level expected during appraisal (PCRO, para. 17), the
majority of the subborrowers are optimistic about prospects of their invest-
ment (PCRO, para 25).
One of the lessons learnt from this project further reinforces the
findings of the audit mission for the First Crain Processing Project, Dn thc
importance of adequate project planning and preparation. There were short-
falls in three areas of project preparation for the Second Grain Processing
Project. First, there was an overestimate on the forecast nf credit demand
for grain processing and storage. Second, there was no anticipation of
alternative sources of credit supply, i.e. an implicit tnderestimate of the
forecast of credit supply. This was because there were funds made available
from private non-institutional sources. Third, there was inadequate m;arket
survey/research on potential sub-borrowers which resul ed in an underestimate
of pre-operating expenses and working capital requirements. On the other
hand, another lesson learnt from the First Grain Processing Project had been
successfully applied in this Second Project. This lesson is to have flexibil-
ity during implementation. Several amendments were made to the loan agreement
*           which successfully brought about accelerated subloan disbursements. The amcnd-
ments included one that enabled expansion of end-uses and end-users as well as
one that enabled financing of working capital and completed works started not
more than a year from the date of the subloan applications.  These amendmcnts
directly addressed and corrected for preparation shortfall of insufficient
provision for working capital and pre-operating expenses.

PHIL I PPLNES
SECOND GRAIN PROCESSING PROJECT (LOAN 1269-PH)
Overview of the Project Completion Report
Introduction
1.        The ProjecL Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Grain Processing
Project in the Philippines was prepared on behalf of the Government, by the
Agricultural Supervision Department (ASD) of the Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP).  Draft copies of the PCR were sent for review internally by
DBP's departments involved in implementation of the project. the Agricultural
Loans Dep:artment (ALD) arid the Branches and Agencies Departments (BAADs). The
PCR was also reviewed by the co-implementing agencies of the non-credit compo-
nents ot the project, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the National Post
Harvest Institute of Research and Extension (NAPl1iRE), as well as the National
Economic Development Authority (NEDA), and the National Food Authority
(NFA). Review responses were incorporated in the finai report which was
approved by DBP Board of Governors on January 18, 1984, and submitted to the
Bank on February 6, 1984. seven (7) months after the closing of the loan on
June 30. 1983.
2.        The project is a continuation of the First Rice Processing and
Storage Project (Loan 720-PH) which was approved by the Board on January 26,
1971, and became effective on May 10, 1971, and for which a PCR was circulated
on November 1. 1982. The Bank has made a total of 17 lines of credit to DBP
since 1971. of which eight (8) have been for industrial investment, eight (8)
for agricultural investments, and one (1) for inter-island shipping. Within
the Bank. responsibility for broad institutional and financial supervision of
DBP is assigned to lhe Industrial Development and Finance (AEPID) Divis on,
with participation of the Philippines Agriculture (AEPA2) Division as warran-
ted.  Agricultural supervision activities, thus, center solely on DBP's agri-
culLural lending and reltLed supporting operations.  This PCR focuses on DBP's
leniding Ifor the Second Grain Processing Storage Project analyzing project-
related impact oDl DBIP and the Philippines economy.
E'roject Objuctives and Achievements
3.        Thle purpos.- of the projc:t was Lo increase the supply of rice and
corn in Lhe Philippines by: a) providing the needed milling. drying, storage
and transport zacilities:  b) inducin2 increased production in areas then
without ade'qua.e proce:;sing tacilitie:;: and c) reducing post-harvest grain
losses.  The. proiect. prepared by DBP. was appraised in August/September
1975.  Nenotiations took place in April 1976.  Board approval was in May 1976,
and the pro  ct becam.' e2ecti:e on November 12. 1976.
4.        Th. projoect was *xpecl:-d to finance about 155 rice and corn mills
and a.1soc:aLted m-chanicai .ind ;ular driers. warehouses. trucks, and ancillary
cquipment.  'n actualitv. DBP t.nanced a tota' a  340 subprojects, with the
numher u: r c.  mills iI nanced  ar excoedintg the estimate. and the number of
corn mil!s inanced ar 90 of the est_imate. Table I summarizes and compares
appraisal and actuai number and investment amount of subprojects financed by
DBP.

5.        Although the number of subprojects far exceeded appraisal estimate,
total related investments were below estimate. This was because relatively
few subprojects put up all the physical facilities prescribed in the appraisal
models, resulting in a smaller than anticipated average subproject size.
Table 2 shows average cost of rice mills and corn mills at 44% and 24Z of
their respective estimated costs at appraisal.

6.        Geographical locations of subprojects were as expected ut
appraisal.  Of total rice mill subprojects, 49% were in l.;zon, 5Z in Visayas,
and 36% in Mindanao.  Most of the corn mills (82%) were in Mindanno.
Project Financing
7.        The sharing of subproject financing was substantially ditterent trom
appraisal estimate. Table 3 compares appraisal and actuaL subproject financ-
ing. Total costs of the credit component exceeded appraisal estimate by 39:
because DBP financed a larger number of subprojects than was expected at
appraisal. Subborrowers had to finance 31Z of total costs, instead of the
estimated 17Z. This is because the appraisal mission did not take into
account pre-operating expenses nor made sufficient provision for working
capital in its estimate of subproject costs. The expenses shortfall were
ultimately provided by the subborrowers. thereby substantially increasing
their financing share. Moreover. project subborrowers whose ubloan
collateral was deemed deficient (per DBP lending guidelines) had to put up
more equity than otherwise required.

17.       The PC'. appropriately adjusts the subproject financial cash flows
removing taxes and duties, applying shadow prices for foreign exchange and
labor to arrive at net benefit streams for economic analyses. PCR's calcula-
tion of ERR differs from the method used in the SAR where benefits were
defined to include only reductions in post harvest spoilage, increase in mill-
ing recovery and inducement of corn production. In the PCR, benefits included
are income from operations, therefore, appraisal versus actual ERRs shown in
Table 5 are not directly comparable. However, since actual FRR is well below
appraisal FRR, it is most likely thac actual ERR would also be below appraisal
ERR (if the same definition of ERR had been used in both cases).

18.       The project is expected to provide 7,277 seasonal and full time
jobs. This far exceeds the appraised target of 2,921 jobs, primarily because
of the larger numbers of subprojects financed and the relatively larget- mills
which will need to hire more workers.
Commodity Study Component
19.       This component has enabled the Ministry of Agriculture to conduct
pilot projects on (a) coconut land-use matrix planning; (b) multi-storey
cropping; (c) coconut product and by-product utilization; alLd (d) accelerated
irrigated area development. Results from these pilot projects will form
groundwork for further project preparation.

P.st Harvest Grain Loss Study Component
20.       The National Post-Harvest Institute for Research and Extension
(NAPHIRE) conducted eight (8) studies on two topics: (a) on-farm and off-farm
grain deterioration and (b) non-conventional sources of energy for grain
drying. Findings of these studies and other research data were disseminated
through various seminars and training as well as a regularly published news-
letters targeted to farmers.  Success of this component has attracted                          E
financing from other regionaL and international agencies for NAPHIRE's
continuing research and extension projects.
The Bank's Role During Project Implementation
21.       In terms of the frequency of Bank supervisions and the staff time
devoted to this task, it might appear that the project was not adequately
supervised during the first two years. However, Grains I was still not
complete in October 1976 when Grains II became effective, and since
disbursements for a single large loan under Grains I continued well after
Grains II das launched, the supervision of the former continued, and provided
an opportunity to review the rather limited developments under Grains II. In
the meantime, the unexpected steep decline in the demand for DBP funds to
finance rice mil;: resulted in a slow start for Grains II, and consequentLy
disbursements of the Bank loan started only in 1979. During this period, more
intensive or frequent supervisions would not have been justifiable.
22.       Actual disbursements during the first four years of the project
amounted to only 16.5% of the appraisal estimates. During this period, DBP
confronted an unusual situation insofar as borrowings from DBP for rice mills
were quite limited, although new mills were being established by the private
sector through other financing and existing mills were being rehabilitated.
The Bank repeatedly urged DBP to investigate this anomoly and to make such
adjustment in the use of loan proceeds as might facilitate a more expeditious
utilization of the loan. This was eventually accomplished by DBP's decision
(approved by the Bank) to finance working capital as well as spare parts and
equipment for mills. Although this did contribute eventually to improved loan
withdrawals, the lack of support for these items did not appear earlier to DBP
or the Bank to be significant.
23.       Both in the period before and after the project became effective,
the Bank was involved in a major dialogue with DBP concerning various
problems which were affecting the Latter, particularly the deterioration in
the quality of its portfolio, its growing arrears and its ass:umption of
responsibility at Government's urging for loans which had been made at the
latter's behest.  However, the Bank did not see the project itself as a
vehicle -or addressing institutional questions. This was because there were
several other projects which seemed a more appropriate setting for such
discussion. Moreover, Grains II was envisaged as a vehicle for meeting the
financial needs largely of established entrepreneurs, and there were no
significant policy issues to be addressed specifically in the context of the
project. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate to conclude in hindsight that
the Bank's dialogue with DBP would have produced better results if it had
pressed its points in the context of all the projects it supported.



- 9 -
24.       The PCR comments that Bank staff could have been more helpful in
dealing with distressed projects. While this is a legitimate borrower
expectation and the Bank should always be prepared to extend maximum
assistance to borrowers in this regard, the project itself did not present an
unusual number or variety of problems, barring the general one of slack demand
for funds. In fact, borrower deliquencies were fewer, and repayment
performance generaLly better, than in other DBP projects. The Bank might have
done well to identify somewhat sooner the working capital constraints
affecting some subborrowers. However, as noted above, this was not the
principal problem facing the project.
Conclusion
25.       While the project has contributed to the much needed physicaL facil-
ities of the country for grain processing and storage, its impact on the
economic condition of the country has not come up to the level expected during
appraisal. However, the majority of the subborrowers (73%) are optimistic
about prospects for their investments. Failures among small borrowers have
been more frequent than among large ones mainly due to small borrowers'
inaccessibility to working capital. The PCR recommends that DBP be more
selective in its appraisal of new grain processing and storage subprojects
because it feels that the Philippines now has adequate milling capacities,
especially for rice. It also stresses the need for effective subproject
supervision. These are both valid points. Although there is a continuing
need for rehabilitating and modernizing rice and corn mills ADB is supporting
a project for this purpose.
26.       DBP has prepared a useful PCR which covers adequately the project's
salient aspects and its results. In preparing the PCR, DBP undertook a useful
field review of subprojects leading to a more thorough understanding of
subproject operations and problems.
27.       In the meanwhile, DBP has practically stopped all subproject lending
due to its financial problem, particularly its lack of liquidity.
28.       There will be no follow-up project to the one which has been
completed. Instead, the Region is proposing to support agricultural credit on
a consolidated basis through the AgricuLtural Credit Project (ACP) which was
appraised in October 1984. The project will provide for long-term agricul-
tural credit funds to be drawn on by any financial intermediaries which meet
the criteria prescribed by the Central Bank, unlike the project under review,
where a single institution was the financial intermediary.

Dear Mr. Watanabe:
Re: Project Completion Report on the Second Grain
Storage and Processing Project (Loan No. 1269-PH)
We thank you for sending us a copy of the draft Project Completion
ReDort (PCR) on the abovementioned project for our review and comment.
The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). the project's imple-
menting agency, submitted to us the same draft report in November 1983
for our comment which we are attaching for your reference. In addition,
we would like to make the following comments on the Bank's overview on
the project with reference to the following paragraphs.
On Project Planning and PreDaration (Para 10)
The exnerience under this Droject reveals the importance of
adequate project planning and oreparation. Poor forecast in demand
for DBP sub-loans contributed to a low disbursement rate during the
period of initial imDlementation of the Droject. The exDerience gained
in the implementation of the first Grains Processing Project (Loan No.
720-PH), where the same type of problem was also encountered, may not
have been sufficiently taken into account in the planning and pre-
paration of Grains Processing II. It was one of the findings of the
Audit Mission for Grains Processing Project I that the appraisal of
said project failed to carrv out a serious market research of the
potential sub-borrowers, thus, contributing to a delay in the imple-
mentation of tbe project and a low disbursement rate.
Perhaps the appraisal mission for Grains Processing Project IT
did not take into account pre-onerating expenses nor adequate working
capital requirements, resulting in the sub-borrower having to shoulder
the full pre-operating expenses, thereby substantially increasing the
sub-borrower's share in the financing scheme. This became more evident
when the disbursement rate increased after amendments were made in the

loan agreement to include financing for working caDital and for
comnleted works started not more than a year from the date of the sub-
loan anplication.
Moreover, the availability of credit from other sources at less
onerous terms than that offered by the DBP may have contributed to
the slow loan availment.
This nroblem could have been avoided or minimized if adequate
information on the tvve of credit facility demanded had been available
during Droiect planninR staee and if promotions were undertaken.
On Institutional Imnact (Dara. 3)
We feel that the need for more intensive oroject monitoring and
supervision not onlv on the nart of the borrower but also on the part
of the Bank should be emphasized and be given adequate consideration.
We have noted that this ;roblem is not project specific but more of an
institutional oroblem of DR', mainlv attributable to budgetary and
staffing constraints. In this connection. DBP has exerted efforts at
reorganizing and strengtheninR its nroject monitorine and evaluation
system. Moreover, under the Bank-financed Third Livestock Project
(Loan No. 1894-PH), Drovision has been made for technical assistance
for the expansion and ungrading of PBP's monitoring and evaluation
system.
We appreciate your giving us the onportunity to comment on the
aforementioned draft overview and we hone that the above comments will
be helpful in its finalization. We would also welcomne onportunities
us to assist you in your Dost-evaluation activities in the PhilipDines
as Part of our continuing liaison with your office.
Best wishes for the Christmas season.

BORROWER'S COMMENTS
December 1, 1983
Mr. Jose Tengco, Jr.
Vice-Chairman
Developuent Bank of the Philippines
Makati, Metro Manila
Dear Mr. Tengco:
Thank you for sending our office a copy of the draft Project Completion Report
(PCR) on the Second Grain Processing and Storage Project (Loan No. 1269-PH)
for our review and comments. We have reviewed the document and noted with
great interest the report's substantial findings with which we concur in
general. We only have a few comments on the following aspects of the said
report.
On the Project Implementation Schedule
We agree with the PCR's finding that the Project would have been better
designed if the Credit Line granted by IBRD was made after the loans under
Grains Processing I had already been fully committed. DBP should have anti-
cipated this at the time of its proposal for a second loan to IBRD which
should have guided the latter in the appraisal of the project. The need for a
follow-up of the first project because of its success was justifiable, however
the matter of right timing is also a vital consideration.
On the Physical Facilities Prescribed
Relatedly, and as indicated in the PCR, the project was approved even before
an evaluation of the actual performance of sub-projects financed under the
Grains Processing I was undertaken. The results of such an evaluation would
have somehow indicated at an early stage that a number of physical facilities
such as grain transport, mechanical driers and ancillary equipment were either
already owned by some sub-borrowers or that more practical and less expensive
substitutes were available. Thus, the demand for the said facilities could
not have been as projected, had adequate information on actual conditions been
acquired earlier.

On the Business Operation of Sub-Projects Financed
Unfavorable performance of subprojects financed based on the results of a
survey of sample sub-projects has been attributed to, among others, the
inadequate assessment by DBP of the various criteria for the selection of sub-
projects to be financed. While we agree that those projects which show high
degree of success especially as regards managment capabilities of proponent
and location should be considered, it is likewise deemed essential that an
assessment of the quality of technical assistance available to sub-borrowers
be undertaken to help farmers get better returns.
On the Need for Supervision and Monitoring
We endorse DBP's move to give full emphasis to improving project supervision
and monitoring for grain processing and storage sub-projects. Indeed, the
steady downward trend of the collection ratio during the period of 1979-1982
and the consequent increase in arrears call for closer supervision activities
for the sub-projects. This undertaking could be further strengthened with the
support of the Bank. The PCR did not cover an assessment of the Bank's super-
vision efforts.
We hope that the above comments would be useful to the final PCR on the
Project.
Very truly yours,
/s/
