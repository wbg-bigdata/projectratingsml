                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There has been good progress on the part of rural communities in investing in improved natural resource management (NRM) and sustainable livelihoods in a manner that is self-
                         sustaining, being replicated, providing leverage to draw in other investments, and is integrated into broader community development processes. The PDO rating has been upgraded
                         as a result of increased disbursements, and improvements in aspects of program management by the Recipient. This includes improvements in the Monitoring Information System,
                         and as a result, a more accurate picture of program progress. Beneficiary targets have been exceeded (except for the number of households deriving energy from Micro Hydro
                         Power), with 912,000 individuals (of which 456,000 are female) benefiting from over US $26 million in Block Grants for environmentally sound NRM sub-projects implemented by
                         communities.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         PNPM Green would benefit from greater integration with PNPM Rural, and the focus of activities in 2013 will be on incorporating lessons learned from PNPM Green into PNPM
                         Rural. A new BETF is being established to progress the integration work. There will be no extension to the RETF and the Task Team looks forward to management support in
                         closing down the current phase of PNPM Green.

                         There has been no restructuring to date.
