1. INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF
RECOMMENDATIONS
This Vulnerable Community Development Plan (VCDP) addresses social exclusion in health
services in Nepal and the effects and implications for vulnerable people for the Nepal Health
Sector Program- Implementation Plan (NHSP-IP). The NHSP-IP is the five year operational
guideline for the Health Sector Reform Strategy - An Agenda for Change'. His Majesty's
Government of Nepal (HMGN) is committed to bringing about tangible changes in the health-
sector development process. The health sector's vision is:
"A health system in which there is equitable access to coordinated quality health
care services in rural and urban areas, characterized by: self-reliance, full
community participation, decentralization, gender sensitivity, effective and efficient
management, and private and NGO sector participation in the provision and
financing of health services resulting in improved health status of the population ".2
The key outputs3, of the NHSP-IP focus on achieving this vision by providing an equitable, high
quality health care system for all citizens regardless of their gender, caste, ethnicity, economic
status and location through:
a.     Prioritised Essential Health Care Services,
b.     Decentralised Management of Health Facilities
c.     Public -Private partnerships
The foundation of the NHSP-IP was set in the objectives of the Second Long Term Health
Plan 1997-2017: "Improve the health status of population particularly those, whose health
needs often are not met: the most vulnerable groups, women and children, the rural population,
the poor, the underprivileged and the marginalised population".
In Nepal's diverse yet hierarchical society, previous experience suggests that citizens' access to
public facilities and resources is highly dependent on social identity (caste, ethnicity and
gender), economic status (landowner, sharecropper or business person) and physical location
(urban, rural or remote rural). A significant proportion of the total population of Nepal are
women, Dalits and indigenous people (recent estimates from the 2001 census suggest 16 %
Dalits and 36.4 % indigenous population). Due to an absence of reliable data and an institutional
reluctance on the part of earlier governments to implement reforms that fundamentally address
structural inequality, a number of groups have been excluded from mainstream health policies.
The excluded groups are predominantly women and girls, indigenous peoples and occupational
castes. Because they inhabit all regions and districts of Nepal covered by this broad national
health project, a Vulnerable Communities Development Plan is an essential prerequisite for
achieving the stated objective of social inclusion in basic health services as set out in the NHSP-
IP Document.
'This Health Sector Strategy is the outcome of considerable work that has been carried out by His Majesty's Govemment of Nepal
(HMGN), the NGO and private sectors and External Development Partners (EDPs) over the past three years. This process
started with a joint review of the sector in autumn 1999 and has continued through a series of workshops and consultations
led by the Health Sector Reform Committee (HSRC) chaired by the Health Minister and a core group. The strategy draws
on several key HMGN health sector documents: The 1991 National health policy; the second Long Term Health Plan 1997-
2017; the strategic analysis to support that plan (May 2000); the Medium Term Strategic Plan to operationalise that plan
approved in 2001; the draft medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the first three years of that plan and the
policy documents for specific programme areas developed by the Department of Health Services, including the 10th plan
concept paper or Health Approach paper - a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of the Government of Nepal.

1.2   Social inclusion
is defined in the World Bank Social Analysis Sourcebook as 'the removal of institutional
barriers and the enhancement of incentives to increase the access of diverse individuals and
groups to development opportunities' (as cited in Bennett 2003. 4). The Ministry of Health has no
definition of the disadvantaged or socially excluded. The Ministry for Education and Sports
(MOES) presents the following definition of the disadvantaged/marginalised: "inclusive
education is to 'incorporate learning needs of socially marginalized groups, children with
disabilities, indigenous children and children living in difficult circumstances with special
needs". MoES further defines 'disadvantaged children' as children with disability, girls, Dalit
(23 disadvantaged groups) and other marginalized groups4.
The VCDP assesses NHSP-IP compliance with accepted safeguard policies, primarily The
World Bank's Operational Directive (OD) 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples. This directive requires
that vulnerable people benefit from development projects and that potential adverse effect on
these vulnerable communities resulting from Bank-assisted activities are at best completely
avoided or at least mitigated. It includes the following components, as per recommendations for
a thorough Vulnerable Community Development Plan: a presentation of the legal framework for
Indigenous People, baseline data, analysis and critique of the proposal under discussion,
strategy for local participation, technical identification of development or mitigation activities,
institutional capacity, implementation schedule, monitoring and evaluation, cost estimates and a
financing plan. Although the directive on Involuntary Resettlement (8) Operational Directive
4.12, is not applicable for the present loan, a separate section details how any sales or donations
of land involved in the programme should be dealt with to ensure that poor or vulnerable
households do not suffer any loss of livelihood due to such sale or donation.Both these World
Bank Directives are in line with Government Policies.
The spectrum of health issues confronting vulnerable people in Nepal is vast and complex.
Within a holistic framework of health, this development plan for vulnerable people focuses on
priority health issues that marginalised groups of people such as women, dalits and Janajatis are
most vulnerable to. These include: Child Health and communicable diseases, Adolescent
Reproductive Health, Safe motherhood and Sexual and Reproductive Health of women,
HIV/AIDS and STD infectious diseases, and the impact of conflict.
For the present plan, and for the successful implementation of the NHSP- IP, understanding the
effects and implications of the Maoist insurgency on Nepal's health system         is essential.
According to a USAID report5 and the experiences of HSSP/GTZ6, harassment and threats by
both Maoists and security forces have exacerbated the chronic lack of qualified health staff in
remote communities, thus decreasing service delivery in many areas. Health workers have
requested reallocation, but there are no hard figures to indicate whether this is more than usual.
The mobility of health workers has decreased, due to reluctance to travel. Outreach clinics are
defunct in affected areas. In some districts the security forces have stringently restricted the
provision of medicines to rural areas, reducing the availability of appropriate treatment. (Source:
NSMP. Impact of Conflict on Accessibility of EOC Health Services, By Monique Beun and Basu Dev Neupane, June 2003
1 76/96/DFD).
1.3   Consultation, Participation and Disclosure
This plan draws on qualitative and quantitative data from primary and secondary sources which
have been carried out for an intensive social assessment of the health sector. A series of
meetings and interviews were conducted with a wide range of professionals and scholars
In the Nepalese context this includes women, former "low caste" or Dalits and Indigenous Peoples or Janajati. The latter two
groups especially fir the World bank description in its Operational Directives. i.e. "ethnic minorities. linguistic minorities.

working in the field of health, language development, gender, conflict, anthropology and social
exclusion issues as part of the consultation. Members of community organisations representing
socially excluded groups, indigenous people and linguistic minorities were interviewed. (Refer
Annex I for list of people met). This document draws extensively on the Vulnerable Communities
Development Plan prepared for the Education for Al17 for the Ministry of Education and Sports
in February 2004. On January 8, 2004, separate meetings were held with key national
stakeholders from the activist communities representing women, Janajatis and Dalits followed
by high-level consultation with line ministries and I/NGOs along with representatives. Given
that the root causes for gender and social exclusion of vulnerable groups in particular, Janajatis,
Dalits, and women as a cross- cutting concern for most sectors, these consultations provided
valuable insight for the social assessment for this VCDP.
Specifically for the health sector a Stakeholder Consultation was organised to promote further
public participation, and discuss, inter-alia, the project objectives and activities, focusing
particularly on the findings and draft recommendations of the VCDP. The workshop was
successful with the active participation of key stakeholders, about 60 participants, including
HMG/N officials, NGOs, academic institutions and Community Based Associations working in
the health sector. The recommendations of the VCDP were well endorsed. The feedback and
recommendations from the consultation were incorporated into VCDP.
1.4  Social safeguards
Indigenous people social safeguards cover two issues: (i) Indigenous people; (ii) Involuntary
settlement. The current document is devoted to ensuring that the recipients of OD 4.20 on IPs
are fully met by the NEFA lending operation.
Safeguard related risks and measures proposed: Based on findings of the Social Assessment
Team's review, the program will not entail any involuntary resettlement or land acquisition. The
project does not envisage any land purchase. Land for the construction of public health centres
in Nepal is not purchased; rather wealthier members of the community donate it or health
centres are built on public land that is not owned by any individual. Therefore this program does
not trigger the OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement.
However, OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples does apply. After conducting a separate and detailed
study, the Government prepared this Vulnerable Communities Development Plan (VCDP).
The VCDP lays out a number of steps that the MoH will take to comply with OD 4.20 on
Indigenous People by ensuring that the program not only will not have negative impacts on IP
and other vulnerable groups, but that it also provides the necessary measures to insure that they
get equal access to project benefits. (See recommendationsfor details).
Rules of taking possession of land: DDC will not resort to any involuntary land acquisition.
All donations and purchases will be voluntary. Mechanisms will be developed not only to
ensure that any land donations are fully voluntary, but also that such donations do not involve
physical displacement or any significant adverse impacts upon incomes of the donor household.
All voluntary land transactions will meet the following criteria:
(i)  The land in question will be free of squatters, encroachers or other claims of
encumbrances;
(ii)  Land will be chosen by the community after ensuring that it will not be disturbing any
other land related resources available in that particular piece of land;
(iii) Verification of the voluntary nature of land donations in each case;
(iv)  Land transfers will be completed through registration, with land title vested in the SMC;
(v)  Provision will be made in DDC procedures for redressal of any grievances related to the
land acquisition.

Procedure: Lands will not be accepted from such land owners whose holding will be less than
the minimum economical viable stipulated size. This size of land might vary from one locality
to another. In this case, an agreement of minimum stipulation size will be determined by the
SAs in the local context.
Land to be used may also not be registered with government (Ailani) and the possibility that
such land may have been occupied by landless (Sukumbasi) is high. If Ailani land is occupied, it
will not be accepted for the project.
All land transactions will be subject to registration (as per market transactions) under the
ownership of SMCs of community health centres that are involved in the project and will be
done only after ensuring that water will indeed be available in that particular piece of land.
Essentially, Social Analysis will arrange for field verification of all cases of land purchases in
such a way as to ensure that land has not been taken under any psychological, social, and
economic domination and that the above obligations and criteria have been fulfilled. Where
such land donation involves vulnerable household, the DDC may wish to seek assistance from
local organisations for field verification. The DDC Portfolio Chairman should visit the field and
consult with the community for final verification. Information obtained from the community can
be used to verify that the correct procedures for the land acquisition have been carried out by the
local organisations and the community.
2. LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK
2.1  Background
There has been considerable commitment by HMGN in investing in the health of its people and
extending better health services to the Nepalese populace. Nepal became a party to the 1978
global declaration on "Health for All by 2000" and since then significant policy and programme
developments have been implemented to meet the challenge of improving the health status of
the people despite poverty, wide socio-economic disparities and a difficult geographical terrain
and health indicators that at present are among the worse in the world. A brief overview of the
legal and policy framework of Nepal's commitment to International obligations and national
policies relating to women, Dalits and ethnic and linguistic minorities is presented below.
2.1.1 Janajati Communities
The Nepalese Constitution and HMG/N's policies indicate the government's increasing
emphasis on the development of Nepal's Janajati groups. The 1990 Constitution defines Nepal
as a 'multiethnic, multilingual, democratic, independent, sovereign, Hindu and Constitutional
Monarchical Kingdom', officially recognising Nepal's ethnic diversity. The Constitution also
makes 'promot[ing] the interests of economically and socially backwards groups' a key
directive principle of the state. Furthermore, a proviso to Article 11, Rights to Equality, states
that 'special provisions may be made by law for the protection and advancement of the interests
of ... those who belong to a class which is socially, economically or educationally backward.'
This proviso accords recognition to positive discrimination for disadvantaged groups8.
Article 6 of Part 1 of the constitution, relating to the 'Language of the Nation', states: (1) The
Nepali language in the Devanagari script is the language of the nation. The Nepali language
shall be the official language. (2) All the languages spoken as the mother language in the
various parts of Nepal are the national languages of Nepal.
Article 18 of Part 3 (in the section on Fundamental Rights) states that: (1) Each community
residing within the Kingdom of Nepal shall have the right to preserve and promote its language,
' NEFEN: Janajati Empowerment Project, Project Document Submitted to Enabling State Programme 3 February 2004
5                              VCDP Health June 2004                    10/06/2004



script and culture. (2) Each community shall have the right to operate schools up to the primary
level in its own mother tongue for imparting education to its children.
The Government formed the National Committee for Formulating Cultural Policy and Programs
in 1992 to conceive and realise concrete plans to help preserve and promote Nepalese culture. In
order to implement the provision of the 10th Plan, the Nepali Parliament issued an Act in 2002 to
establish the National Foundation for the Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN) which
had a broad mandate to ensure the social, economic and cultural development and upliftment of
indigenous peoples, as well as their mainstreaming and equal participation in national development.
While these policies do highlight the rights for indigenous people, the real concern is the
implementation modalities and political climate that enables socially excluded people to access these
rights.
2.1.2 Dalit communities
Dalit communities have not witnessed much change since the fall of the Rana regime during
which they were the most religiously, culturally, socially and economically oppressed
population of Nepal. An exception was the introduction of the New Legal Code (Naya Mulki
Ain) in 1963. According to this Code, nobody could claim inferiority or superiority on the basis
of race, caste and creed; everybody was equal before the law. Two recent measures, the Local
Self-Governance Act, 1999 and the establishment of the National Dalit Commission, aim to
increase Dalit participation in governance with improved protection of rights. Despite this, and
the signing of other national and international acts and conventions (in particular CERD), caste
ideology has continued to exert a strong influence on Nepalese society and Dalits, particularly
Dalit women and girls, continue to have the lowest social, economic and political indicators.
Life expectancy of Dalits is 50 years when the national average is 59.
2.1.3 Policies on Women's Development and Gender mainstreaming
Nepal continues to present poor improvement in the HDI for girls and women in most sectors in
spite of significant efforts at all levels to confront gender-based inequality and discrimination.
This is indicative of the deep-rooted socio-cultural norms and practices of a patriarchal society
that both government and civil society continue to struggle with. Nepal has been signatory to
numerous International Conventions (Beijing Platform for Action, CEDAW and CRC) and is
providing increasing policy reform and resources for women's development and gender
mainstreaming. Recent policy reform includes Laws guaranteeing women's right to property,
rights against sexual offences, the formation of the National Women's Commission. Laws
relating to abortion, which was liberalised two years ago to ensure the availability of safe and
accessible abortion, have been passed. The Tenth Plan, building on the efforts of the Ninth Plan,
has a specific focus on social inclusion that has created a strong and positive policy environment
for the empowerment of women and girls.
2.1.4 People Living with Disabilities
Disabled Persons (Protection and Welfare) Act is the only comprehensive legal arrangement
made for the welfare of persons with disabilities. It spells out specific rights of PWDs such as:
Right to health - Free medical check ups in all governmental health service institutions; Right to
equality in all matters and right to live with dignity; Right to Education; Priority in government
and semi-government jobs and free legal aid.
2.2  International Policies
Over the past few decades the international development agenda has witnessed rapid progress in
policy reform on health. There has been a shift from traditional centre driven targeted delivery of
health services to an attempt at introducing a more rights based holistic approach to meeting the
health needs of all. Among the main components of the rights-based approach are: gender equity and
equality; sexual and reproductive rights and client-centred health care. The rights-based approach
6                              VCDP Health June 2004                    10/06/2004



to sexual and reproductive health emerging from the International Conference on Population and
Development (ICPD) in 1994 reflects a new global policy consensus on the relationships between
population policy and sexual and reproductive health and rights: if women are empowered and
people's needs for sexual and reproductive health are met, population stabilization will be achieved
by virtue of choice and opportunity, not coercion and control. The rights-based approach was
reaffirmed and extended at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, and
again at the Beijing +5 and ICPD+5 review in 1999. The World Social Forum and the Millennium
Development Goals reaffirm the global commitment to priority for addressing rights of marginalised
men and women. (Refer Annex 2for details)
2.3   National Policies
Historically Ayurvedic medicines, and different forms of faith healing, were the principal means
of treatment amongst Nepal's traditional communities. Numerous alternative beliefs, knowledge
and practices of health and non-formal medical traditions have been in practice. Despite these
traditional systems and the subsequent establishment of a government public hospital in
Kathmandu, access to public health facilities for the common people was extremely restricted.
The new Constitution of 1990 established Nepal as a much more inclusive state by explicitly
describing it as "multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and democratic country". A number of key reforms
have been introduced to strengthen the focus on equity and decentralisation, most significantly
the Local Self-Governance Act, 19999.
2.3.1 The Tenth Five Year Plan
The Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-2007), Nepal's Poverty Reduction Strategy, is the first national
plan to have social inclusion as one of its four pillars. It has recognized gender-based disparities
in income and human development as important elements of the poverty profile in Nepal. The
Plan also gave priority consideration to major social variables, such as gender, ethnicity, and
caste related differentials, which exacerbate the intensity and depth of poverty for the affected
groups. The PRSP has identified: (1) the sociological factors that constrain women's access to
household income and resources in male-headed families and that the absence of this access is a
crucial factor for women to receive health services. (2) the many indigenous ethnic (Janajatis)
and caste (Dalits) groups that have been historically disadvantaged. (3) the health sector as a
critical area of human development, improving living standards in rural areas for mainstreaming
marginalised groups and communities. (4) that service delivery remains weak due to lack of
trained staff, drugs and medicines and inadequate or misallocation of resources. (4) that women
development has been regarded as cross cutting theme across the four pillars (P-155)
PRSP's health sector objective is to extend Essential Health Care Services (EHCS) to all,
especially to rural, remote, and poor populations. In order to mainstream the marginalised
groups and regions, the plan has emphasized access to health facility within one hour's walk to
all, and to prioritise special programs in the Mid and Far Western regions as it presents specific
challenges to women and vulnerable communities. The plan sets explicit objectives of reducing
existing gaps between these groups and the rest of the population through monitoring
mechanisms of targeted programs to ensure equal attention to the deprived communities through
the Ministry of Local Development, together with Nepal Dalit Commission and National
Academy for the Upliftment of the Indigenous People.
However specific strategies for behaviour change of health personnel towards the poor women
and socially excluded groups for service delivery and representation of the women and
marginalised groups in the management committees of Health posts are not clearly stated
increasing the risk of limited social inclusion.
9 LSGA Governance Act 1999: The LSGA, 1999 stipulates that representatives from 'socially and economically backward tribes
and ethnic communities, downtrodden and indigenous groups' shall be nominated to each village, municipality and district
council. This clearly includes the Dalits. Clause 43 (3) of the act requires VDCs to prioritise projects that provide 'direct
benefits' to the so-called 'backward classes' (Dalits)

2.3.2 Medium Term Expenditure Framework 2002
HMG/N's Medium Term Expenditure Framework 2002 has categorised public health activities
with Essential Health Care Services as a first priority. HMGN is implementing an annual
Immediate Action Plan for priority reform and has initiated an incremental transfer of sub-
health posts to local management committees and contracting out of district hospitals. In all the
policies, decentralisation is presented as a core strategy with health to be managed locally with
increased community participation.
2.3.3 The Local Self Governance Act (LSGA), 1999
The LSGA has emphasized priority areas of local bodies to "enhance the living standards,
income and employment of, and render direct benefits to, the village people and contribute to
poverty alleviation". This Act has sanctioned authority to village committees to operate and
manage health centres, health posts and sub health posts, primary health care services including
family planning and maternity and child care services. It has made the provision of
representation of women, economically backward tribes, ethnic communities and indigenous
people at village and ward level development committees The Act has directed the bodies to
allocate funds earned from their sources in the health sector on a priority basis'°.
Social analysis: the LSGA in its provisions does not address issues of inequity and vulnerability
as a result of gender, caste or ethnicity. Directions to recognize and address specific barriers
faced by such vulnerable groups, are absent. The absence of such specific directives has resulted
in very few women being elected to executive positions of local institutions" with only
marginal representation of women in elected institutions except for the reserved grass roots
positions. There were no women mayors, vice mayors or DDC chairpersons (Bhusal, 1998 and
Shrestha, 1998). Both VDCs and municipalities do not have gender-disaggregated data of their staff,
beneficiaries, user groups, development project and services to women. (Gender Budget Audit; Meena
Acharya)
The Gender Budget Audit carried out recently, has found that the VDCs and DDCs budget
formulation process has negligible involvement of women, Dalits and Janajatis. (Refer Annex-6for
details on VDCs and DDC budgetformulation process). Among women, 71% (compared to 57 percent of men)
have little or no involvement in planning village health programmes and 67 per cent of women
(compared to 59% of men) are only marginally involved in implementation. A sharper gender
differential is found among the Dalits: 75 per cent either do not participate or participate very
little in the planning of village health services, compared to 58 per cent of the advantaged
groups (largely Brahmin and Chettri men.) This difference parallels that of implementation
where non-participation is 74 per cent for Dalits compared to 56 per cent for the advantaged
groups. (Neilson)
2.3.4 First Long Term Health Plan
The government prepared The First Long Term Health Plan (1976-92) to address the major
health requirements of the population. Though a comprehensive strategic document, this Plan
was never operationalised. Primarily a centre driven plan, it was not developed through a
participatory approach and was not shared and disseminated with the concerned partners and
failed to bring the desired results.
"' A Manual Prepared for Transfer and Operation of Local Health Institutions 2060 (2004) His Majesty's Govemment, Ministry Of
Health, Department of Health Services
Only 289 women were elected as ward chairpersons in a total of 35217 wards, where election was completed. Among nearly eight
thousand chairpersons and vice chairpersons only 26 were women. Only one woman had managed to be elected to the
position of vice chairperson of DDC. Altogether, only three women had fought for the DDC chairperson and vice
chairperson positions. Among 26 women who had fought for DDC membership, only eight got elected. This was less than
nine percent of 924 members in the 75 DDCs to which election had been completed in 1997. (Meena Acharya: Gender

2.3.5 National Health Policy
The National Health Policy (1991) provided the key guiding instrument for the policy
framework for health sector development in Nepal. Its objectives include: (i) extension of basic
primary health care services up to the village level; (ii) provide opportunity to rural people to
enable them to obtain the benefit of modem medical facilities; (iii) Priority targets for women
and children (MMR, IMR and TFR). It focuses on local resource mobilization to reach people
with special needs. It has directed for the adoption of micro planning process in health planning
to target all groups with special efforts to reach the underprivileged
However, the policy lacks recognition of the rights of women dalit, and ethnic groups and no
mechanisms to ensure representation of these groups in the planning process. It also lacks any
commitment to the need to develop a data base and monitoring systems of disaggregated data by
gender, caste and ethnicity.
2.3.6 Second Long Term Health Plan
Building on the National Health Policy and to further guide health sector development the
Second Long Term Health Plan (SLTHP)-1997 - 2017) was developed. The SLTHP has
considered health as a human rights issue12 and emphasized improvement in the health status of
the population particularly those, whose health needs often are not met: the most vulnerable
groups, women and children, the rural population, the poor, the underprivileged and the
marginalised population. However, strategies and clear mechanisms of service provision for the
economically and socially deprived populations including people living with disabilities and
women are again not clearly stated.
2.3.7 Health Sector Strategy - An Agenda for Reform, 2002
The Health Sector Reform Strategy draws on key HMGN health sector documents including the
1991 National Health Policy; the Second Long Term Health Plan 1997-2017; the Strategic
Analysis to support that plan (May 2000); the draft Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF), and the policy documents for specific programme areas developed by the Department
of Health Services as well as the 10th plan concept paper or Health Approach paper - a Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of the Government of Nepal. There is considerable
commitment by HMGN and its EDPs to poverty reduction and achieving the millennium
development goals (MDGs). The key issues identified for reform are: Ensuring access of the
poor and vulnerable to EHCS; Ensuring that public health services are run in a most efficient
manner; Ensuring services out side the EHCS with the provision of safety nets; Monitoring and
tracking sector performance.
Strengths for Social Inclusion: Major equity issues are related to gender, age, caste, ethnicity,
income and area of residence. Transportation cost causes significant restriction to the poor
accessing health care in remote areas and the largest equity discrepancies relate to area of
residence. The document focuses in particular on how the health sector would make its
contribution to poverty reduction and to improving health outcomes for the poor and those
living in remote areas. Health expenditure is very low in Nepal in spite of some real increases
over recent years. The strategy has emphasized the importance to ensure that pubic finance
would be directed to the EHCS and the poor and vulnerable. This would only be achieved if
alternative financing schemes for these services are developed along side resource allocation
policies for pubic finance that target the EHCS and the poor and vulnerable.
There are serious concerns about access to services by the poor. Access to both public and
private inpatient facilities varies considerably by income group with the wealthier having higher
utilization of both public and private facilities. Need of monitoring data from benefit incidence
studies as to which socio economic groups are accessing health care at all levels is.

Challenges for Social Exclusion
*    The strategy is silent about the ongoing political conflict and its implications on the
health sector - the requirements of children, widows, female headed households
particularly from dalit and Janajati households have been excluded due to conflict.
*    There had been many policy commitments in the past but were not translated in to
practice due to lack of realistic implementation plan. In the present strategy too these gaps
are evident and may inhibit full implementation.
*    Though the strategy has emphasized for the implementation of decentralisation in the
sector, the required process has not been defined.
*    During the process of developing the strategy there was no involvement of stakeholders at
the district and level below.
Review of NHSP - IP
The Nepal Health Sector Programme -Implementation Plan's (2003-07) key focus is to
"ensure access by the poor and vulnerable to EHCS": increase the coverage and raise the quality
of EHCS, with special emphasis on improved access for poor and vulnerable groups (pp-7).
Selected outputs are directly related to social inclusion strategies (pp-16) and one key indicator
states: "by the end of 5 years (in 2006/7) XX% of the poor and vulnerable groups are
utilizing the prioritized EHCS" (pp-23).
Systems for priority access to poor and vulnerable groups have been outlined in the project
document in major areas: to develop criteria to identify the poor, expansion of EHCS,
subsidized drugs and services, safety net, rehabilitation (of the conflict affected), and
participation (pp-23). For the implementation of NHSP-IP a, "Statement of Intent" to guide the
partnership for health sector development in Nepal, has been signed by major External
Development Partner (EDP) representatives in health and the Ministry of Health. The
framework suggests that all support will be consistent with HSRS.
Strengths for social inclusion
NHSP -IP has clearly outlined social inclusion strategies. Systems for priority access to
poor and vulnerable groups have been detailed.
*     It emphasises the need to ensure that the poorest people, receive the greatest share of
public subsidies for essential services (i.e. services which produce the greatest reduction
in health burden)
*    NHSP has outlined five Sector Management Outputs to ensure effective implementation.
*    The emphasis of the reform strategy is on outputs and health outcomes. The HSRS is
reqarded as a move towards strateajic pIanning and a sector-wide approach (SWAP).

levels and is based on various studies including one on social assessment13.
Challenges for social inclusion
*    Lack of conceptual clarity on social inclusion: A review from the perspective of gender
and social inclusion reveals that conceptual clarity on gender and mainstreaming is still
lacking, and a substantive rights based approach is absent.
*    Clear recognition of the specific needs and concerns of Dalits and Janajatis is absent in
NHSP-IP. While it states that criteria to identify the poor will be finalised and
incorporated in the decentralised reform actions, it has not defined who the vulnerable are
and lacks a clear definition of vulnerability with relevance to by gender, caste or age.
*    The indicators in the NHSP-IP are not disaggregated by gender, caste and ethnicity and
thus specific initiatives necessary for social inclusion of women, Dalits and Janajatis may
not occur.

*    While the NHSP has recognised the health needs for rehabilitation due to the ongoing
conflict it has not provided the necessary resources or strategic plan to manage the impact
of conflict on non-functioning of health facilities, the rising needs for curative services,
psycho-social consequences and infrastructure. The special health concerns of conflict
affected children, widows, female-headed households and resource poor families of
Janajati and Dalits in remote locations have not been recognised.
The NHSP-IP explicitly reflects a poverty focus, coherent with the HSS, both in policy
statement and strategy. However, both the HSS and NHSP-IP make no reference to the current
conflict in the country. While arguably this may be justified for a "long term" strategy, it would
be highly relevant to include reference to the conflict and the negative consequences on
implementation of services and reforms over the next 3 years. The NHSP-IP generally does not
address other types of inequity and vulnerability in depth. such as by gender, caste, or age. The
few explicit references to services for vulnerable groups are found in the Output 1 statement
("Clear systems in place to ensure that the poor and vulnerable have priority for access"), in the
HIV programme emphasis, and in the Disaster Management activities. However, lacking a
detailed Annual Work Plan and Budget, it is difficult to judge how these statements are to be
made real. (Joint Review of the Nepal Health Sector Programme - Implementation Plan, 15-26 March 2004)
Social analysis of other health policies
HMG/N has developed various national policies and strategies for different health components.
Those relevant to the prioritised areas of this VCDP are child and adolescent health, national
reproductive health strategy (NRHS), 1998 and national HIV/AIDS strategy (2002-2006). (Refer
Annex 3for details).
3. PARAMETERS OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND HEALTH IN NEPAL:
FACTORS IMPACTING EXCLUSION OF WOMEN, DALIT AND
JANAJATIS
This section includes specific primary and secondary data on the types of barriers that different
social groups of Nepal face, the socio-cultural framework including structures, which govern
rural economic life, and the key factors of social exclusion, which impact the health of the
people of Nepal.
3.1  Barriers to Social Inclusion
Barriers to social inclusion in all facets of life in Nepal include gender-based social
stratification, which in turn must be placed in the prevailing ethnic, and caste based hierarchies
that structure econornic and social relationships in Nepal. This defines how the lives of girls and
boys, men and women will be shaped according to the caste and ethnic groups they are born in,
their religion and the location of their community and the rules and norms that these social
structures define. These social structures govern all spheres of an individual's daily life. The
health status of the people in Nepal remains low on account of four main barriers: economic,
social, physical/mental, and geographical.
3.1.1   Economic barriers: Nepal is predominantly an agricultural country, drawing about
40 percent of its Gross Domestic Product from this sector with approximately 85 percent of its
population still earning their living from farming. The annual per capita income of Nepal is now
USD $240 and around 42 percent of the population are estimated to be living in poverty. The
majority of the population is rural-based, where poverty is at its worst, particularly in the mid-
western and far-western regions of the country which are beset by the double problem of
continuing food shortages and the ongoing impact of the State-Maoist conflict. Poverty presents
many disincentives for families to invest in health seeking care, especially for girls and women
who are historically less valued and hold a lower social status than men and boys in almost all
communities. The user charge, levied to provide additional income for the hospitals, generally
discourage children, elderly and the low-income groups from seeking care because of the
11                             VCDP Health June 2004                   10/06/2004



unavailability of money during sickness. (Public Expenditure Review of the Health Sector in Nepal, HEFU, MoH,
2003, page 18). There are certain systematic associations between social identity and economic
status. Ninety percent of Nepal's Dalits live below poverty line with an average per capita
income of only $ 39.60.
3.1.2 Geographic barriers: Nepal is one of the poor est and most mountainous countries in
the world with great diversity in terrain that presents a range of challenges for access and
infrastructure. Significant geographical variations mirror the existing income poverty
differentials. The HDI for urban areas (0.616) far outstrips that for rural areas (0.446), because
of better access to services, resources and opportunities. Similarly, there are significant
differences among ecological zones. The HDI for mountains (0.378) is well below that for the
hills (0.51). The broad scattering of communities in the mountains limits access to services and
resources and severely disadvantages people who live there. Human development in the hills is
higher than in the Terai (and the national average). The central and eastern regions of the
country have the highest proportion of indigenous peoples, but the data overwhelmingly
indicate that Janajatis primarily occupy the hilly and mountainous regions of Nepal, and that
these districts are often remote and accessible only by foot.
All available data in Nepal suggest that poverty is deeper and more severe in rural areas
especially in the mid and far Western regions.   Hill districts with a high concentration Hill
Dalits are Surkhet, Kailali and Kaski; Terai districts with a high concentration of Dalits are
Siraha and Saptari. Gender-based development indicators are low in almost all these same
districts.
Poverty is more extensive in the hills and the mountains as compared to both urban areas, as
well as the (rural) terai. Over 90% of the poor live in rural areas. Poverty in both the Terai and
the Central Hills is close to the national average, but is much higher (56%) in the Mountain
region. The poverty rate is the highest in the more remote rural areas-the Mid-Western and
Far-Western hills and mountain regions where it is as high as 72%. The highest proportion of
people with disability without access to education was found in the mountains (77%) as compared to
the hills (58%)14. Relative to people in other parts of the country, residents of rural and remote
areas in Nepal have lower life expectancy and suffer more from chronic and acute illness. As a
result, the impoverished populations of the underserved areas depend heavily on public sector
facilities, which are most deficient in those very areas. These regional disparities are among the
worst in the world. (Report No. 19613 Nepal Operational Issues and Prioritization of Resources in the Health Sector June 8,
2000 Health, Nutrition and Population Unit, South Asia Region)
Drinking water containing high amounts of arsenic has adverse affects on human health,
including increased risks for cancer, diabetes and heart disease. (http://www.south-asia.com/USA/
hub_arsenic.html) In Nepal no medical case of arsenicosis has been reported15 so far. But arsenic
contamination has been detected in 11 Terai districts of Nepal.
3.1.3 Mental and Physical Barriers for children with special needs: Children with
disabilities are the most visible group of those targeted in the MoES definition of disadvantaged
people and there is a specific focus on special needs education. WHO estimates that 10 percent
of the total population of Nepal suffers from disability with the number being higher in women
and comparatively worse in the case of women above 25 years of age 35% were under 19
years of age (UNICEF 2003, Lansdown). More than 50 percent of disabilities are seen in children
below five (A Situation Analysis on Disabilityv in Nepal, 2001).
In rural Nepal, many girls suffer disability due to lack of timely access to vaccine for polio and
other related diseases. A study of eight surveyed districts in 1995 indicated that 12.4 percent of
the population was mentally retarded with many cases being acquired retardation caused by
neglect of disease, especially high fever, severe diarrhea, typhoid, pneumonia, measles, polio,
encephalitis and paralysis (A Situation Analysis of Disability in Nepal, 2001. Chitrakar, 2004)

Studies done on disabilities so far have traditionally used a gender-blind approach. (Dhungana,
2003). Absence of barrier-free development is a fundamental need of disabled people and they
need access to these services (Hema 1966; Ototake, 2000; Maqbool, 2003).
3.1.4 Barriers caused by Maoist conflict: In the most severely affected areas, Maoists have
reduced health service availability since health staff have often left their postings due to
harassment. The security forces have restricted delivery of medicines. The conflict has had a
major impact on transport during the night, when curfews are imposed and mobility is severely
restricted. The number of male household members has been significantly reduced, leaving the
decisions concerning health expenses to the female household members.
Since the Maoist conflict started more than 35 thousands pregnant women have died and post
partum haemorrhage is the main cause of maternal death. (The Space Times daily newspaper dated 01 April
04). Particularly at night, it has become more difficult to ask advice from relatives, neighbours,
and nearby TBA and FCVH who would otherwise be consulted before taking major steps
involving financial expense. Uneducated, poorer, low-caste people in particular, are not aware
that they can get permission for night travel (Source: NSMP: Impact of Conflict on Accessibility of EOC Health
Services, By Monique Beun and Basu Dev Neupane, June 2003 176/96/DFD). A new emerging concern is the
growing number of physically handicapped children who will require special health care. Those
separated from parents and families in the midst of conflict are amongst the most vulnerable. It
has been estimated that 2000 children have lost at least one parent and over 4000 have been
displaced from their villages in the conflict-affected areas and forced to migrate.
Impact of conflict on women, Dalits and Janajatis: The insurgency has had several
consequences on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. The safety, livelihood and status of
women and girls have been especially negatively impacted, with a sharp rise in male migration.
Dalits too have become victims as both the warring parties and the general public treat them
with suspicion. Forces have committed violent acts, including gang rape, torture and murder
against women who were believed to support Maoists or who were hiding information
concerning their husbands or sons- there are 24 documented cases of pregnancies caused by
rape.
Psycho social impact: Ongoing research16 has revealed that out of 37 respondents (of whom 25
were women and 16% Janajatis), 31 (84%) have admitted to behavioural disturbances such as
sleeplessness, anxiety disorders, and feelings of guilt and sadness. Three quarters of the
population was in substantial emotional distress (74%).
Given the far-reaching impact of the conflict it is unrealistic to speak of a "National" Health
plan where whole districts are without more than a few functioning health facilities. His
Majesty's Government of Nepal's most immediate task must be to seek a speedy and complete
resolution to the present conflict. Without this, NHSP-IP may be implemented in Kathmandu
but will remain a distant dream in most of rural Nepal.
3.1.5 Social Barriers: Social barriers include gender-based social stratification, which in turn
must be placed in the prevailing ethnic and caste-based hierarchies that structure economic and
social relationships in Nepal. The lives and opportunities of girls and boys and men and women
are shaped according to the caste and ethnic groups into which they are born, their religion and
the location of their community and the rules and norms that these social structures define.
These social structures govern all spheres of an individual's daily life.
3.2   Exploring the social barriers to health for vulnerable groups
The primary focus in this analysis is to understand the various barriers for exclusion of people
from improved health status. Past research has concluded that social exclusion occurs due to
inequality in:

Gender relations: How the given socio- cultural structures in a particular community define the
formal and informal rules for men and women, boys and girls for equal opportunity in decision-
making, access, control over resources and participation and the resultant impact on their social
status.
Caste: How the social stratification by caste hierarchies prescribes the degree of exclusion and
inclusion of specific caste groups and the discriminatory norms and practices that results
between higher and lower castes.
Ethnicity: How the norms and socially defined practices of dominant ethnic groups define the
degree and form of discriminatory practices towards disadvantaged Janajatis
Language: How communities speaking the dominant language have more possibility for
inclusion and the resultant inequality between Nepali speaking people and other minority
mother tongue languages.
3.2.1 Gender-based exclusion
Though women are the backbone of Nepal's agrarian economy, their access to productive resources,
education, informnation, training, and other opportunities is extremely limited. Their social status and
privileges are comparatively much lower than of men. Nepal's development indicators starkly
dernonstrate this. While average life expectancy for women has finally surpassed that of men in urban
areas, women in rural areas still die younger than men in contrast to the nonnal pattem observed
worldwide. A study17 on 53 women in Kathimandu prison convicted of "infanticide" has revealed that
42% were from ethnic groups (including Newars), 23% were Dalits and 20% Chettri. Evidence also
shows a glaring health disparity based on caste and ethnicity.
Even in better off households, a woman's share in household assets and income including basic
food security is less than that of a man's. Given the social stratification in Nepal, women and
girls are often the first victims of resource poor households. Although the structure of gender
relations varies significantly among different social groups, generally it is men who traditionally
inherit family land, and who, for the most part control the allocation of household income and
assets. In addition customs and social practices create greater vulnerability for women and girls
than for men and boys.
Women's limited decision-making and bargaining power affects their ability to seek health care
for themselves and their daughters/children and mostly have to consult the head of the
household and /or whoever controlled the cash/family finances before seeking care. In a study
covering about 650 women of different caste/ethnic groups (Newar; Magar, Gurung, Rai and
Tamang; Yadav, and Ahir; Damai, Sarki and Kami; Bralman and Chhetri) in 5 districts, 51.2
percent consulted their husbands and 44.5 percent consulted their mother in law or sister in law
for seeking health care. Women who earned money through self-employment or PCRW credit

sometimes used their earnings to pay for health care, but most women would only seek care on
their own accord if services were free. (World Bank: Understanding Access, Demand and Uitlisation of Health
Services in Nepal and their Constraints, June 2001)
Neglect: The same study states that in all districts women were recognized to be ill by family
members only when they were bedridden or unable to perform their daily tasks. Family
members and women themselves place a very low value on women's lives, thus women's health
is often ignored. Fear of domestic violence contributed to women's reluctance to voice their
need for healthcare services.
Janajati women: Women's position relative to men varies by caste and ethnic group. Ironically
women from the dominant "high caste" groups are among the most severely restricted in terms
of access to assets, opportunity and voice. The status of women and girls among the ethnic
groups speaking Tibeto-Burman languages and among the lower caste Hindus is much higher
than among the dominant high-caste Indo-Aryan groups (Bennett 2003). Janajati women are
relatively better off in terms of gender equality within their own communities as compared to
upper caste Hindu women. Janajati women are in the paradoxical role of being at once
oppressed by state and national forces yet relatively better off in terns of gender equality within
their own communities as compared to caste Hindu women. However, education and literacy
are particularly low among Janajati women, while literacy in Nepali - a language which is a
mother-tongue for very few - is lower still.
Dalit women: Dalit women constitute 50.6 percent of the total population of Nepal, as per the
1991 census. It is estimated that more than 98 percent of the Dalit women live in the rural areas.
Dalit women's literacy is much lower to that of Dalit men. The literacy rate is more than 3 times
higher among Hill Dalit women (14.7%) than among Terai Dalit women (4.0%). Dalit women
face triple discrimination in their daily lives -as a woman, as a Dalit, and as a Dalit woman.
Dalit women have to face more discrimination than men in places like water taps, markets,
training centres, wage payment and food distribution for agricultural work. The majority of
trafficked girls and women are from the Dalit and Janajati community.
Women with special needs: Women and girls with disabilities in Nepalese society experience
additional discrimination because of their disabilities as they are exposed to greater risk of
physical and sexual abuse, denial of reproductive rights and reduced opportunity to enter
marriage and family life. Apart from birth affected disabilities, women and girls in Nepal also
become disabled due to discriminatory social and economic practices and issues of gender based
violence. Service delivery programs largely ignore these social dimensions of disability.
3.3   Operational linkages between social structure, cultural norms and health service delivery
Gender, caste and ethnicity -along with geographic location and distance from the seat of power
in Kathmandu - remain highly correlated with poverty and vulnerability in Nepal'8. Available
data demonstrates how the presence of several barriers (e.g. poverty, residence in a remote area
(especially in the Mid and Far Westem Hills), being a girl, being from a Dalit or Janajati group
and being disabled) can lead to multiple exclusions and compounded disadvantage. Yet
membership in some sorts of excluded groups can actually help to reduce other forms of
exclusion. For example, Janajati children face a linguistic barrier and often suffer from low
enrolment and high drop out rates because of their unfamiliarity with Nepali as the medium of
instruction. Yet districts with a high Janajati population are found to have a lower gender gap in
literacy. Conversely, although children from districts with a high proportion of Hindu Caste
populations (both high and low) who grow up speaking Nepali do not suffer linguistic
disadvantage, girls from these districts face the highest gender-based barriers. Those districts
where the Hindu caste population is dominant (clustered in the mid and Far Western regions)
also have the highest gap between male and female. (Refer to Annexes 11, 12 and 13 for geographic
distributions of ethnic groups and representations of barrier linkages in the Far West Region and Siraha district)

3.4   Caste and ethnicity based social exclusion
The Dalits, as historically disadvantaged groups, lag behind in their income and asset levels, in
their education and other human development indicators - and in the extent to which they are
represented in the power structure. There are 205 types of caste-based discrimination currently
practiced against the Dalits that have been documented in a recent national survey. The national
average Dalit literacy rate for 6 years and above is only 23 percent (12 percent for Dalit women
and 33 percent Dalit men) and only 30 percent of Dalit children go to school.'9
The Dalit children outnumber other groups in the worst form of child labour prevalent in Nepali
society. U5MR (Under 5 Children Mortality Rate) was 171.2 compared to 79 of the national
average (per 1000 live births) in 1996 (NEsAc, 1998). IMR (Infant mortality rate) was 116.5
(compared to 52.5 for Brahmin) per 1000 live births in 1996 (NESAC, 1998). Immunisation
coverage on Dalit children is 43 per cent, which is less by 20 per cent than the national average.
Regarding the young age mortality, the child mortality was reported 15 out of 33 from the Dalits
(TEAM Consult. 1999: Table A4.2a: 256).
3.4.1 Nepal's indigenous peoples
Various definitions20on indigenous people exist (Cohen 1999. Gurung 2001). On basis of the National
Academy for the Upliftment of Indigenous People/ Nationalities Act, 2058 (2001) the law has
identified 59 indigenous peoples, which may be changed after periodic review.
Of the estimated 300 million indigenous peoples of the world, 8.27 million live in Nepal.
Currently, there are 59 cultural groups identified as indigenous nationalities or Adibasi Janajatis
by the government. The indigenous peoples possess distinct identities, cultures, languages,
religions, histories, institutional structures (Human Rights Yearbook, 2004), health care practices,
medication practices, utilization of specific shaman healers, worshiping, health seeking
behaviours with spiritual relationship to their land and with their unique customary laws,
knowledge system, values and world views, the indigenous peoples from different societies
apart from those with rigid hierarchy of the Hindu caste system in Nepal.
The discrimination and exclusion, which is often structural and systematic, based on their
ethnicity, language or religion, has barred the indigenous peoples from exercising their
individual and collective rights for non-discrimination, and to effective participation and
cultural identity. The failure to observe civil and political as well as economic, social and
cultural rights is a major concern for promoting an equitable, inclusive and peaceful society in
Nepal (Human Rights Yearbook, 2004). Of the estimated 300 million indigenous peoples of the world,
8.27 million live in Nepal. Currently, there are 59 cultural groups identified as indigenous
nationalities or Adibasi Janajatis by the govermnent. Discrimination and marginalization of
indigenous peoples represent a major threat to the rich diversity and democracy in contemporary
Nepal. Janajatis are disadvantaged due to. Nepali, the 'language of the nation' is the  only
'official language', which is reportedly spoken as a mother tongue by 48.61 percent of the total
population (CBS 2001) There are also large populations in the Terai who are not Janajati but who
speak Maithili, Hindi or other distinct languages as their mother tongue. If health service
providers are not conversant with the languages, access for Janajati people becomes constrained.
Family poverty - especially among disadvantaged Janajati groups -leads children to seek work
and exposes them to health risks.
Representatives of indigenous population groups consider language as one the most severe
access barriers experienced by indigenous people in accessing basic health care, - even bigger
than barriers connected to economic and resource limitations. The language barrier is therefore
perceived as leading to significant under-utilization of public health services.
'9 Situational Analysis of Dalits in Nepal, 2002
20 Definition on indigenous peoples relies on the three variables: I) language, 2) self-perception, and 3) geographical concentration.
These variables are used in different combinations and are given different priorities depending on the country under investigation.
The definition has been applied in World Bank investigation on poverty among indigenous peoples of Latin America. (Cohen 1999)

Chepang: Chepangs, also known as 'Prajas' have depended on forests and forest
products for food for generations. With decreasing natural resources, they are
caught in a vicious cycle of insufficient food, increasing poverty, chronic starvation
leading to various types of illnesses.
*  Distance: Living high up on mountains, slopes, Chepangs are far from health
service centres and other facilities. In Chit wan, they have to walk for seven
hours before they can reach a sub-health post or a school. The strain
sometimes results in their contracting other illnesses, leading to more
complications of arranging emergency funds. Disillusioned with the available
services (no medicines, no health workers) most Chepangs today are unwilling
to make the effort.
*  Language issues: Most health workers are not Chepangs making language a
huge barrier. In Chit wan, out of 20 teachers, only two (kept locally by the
Chepangs themselves) were Chepangs.
*  Discrimination: The humiliating language and the discriminatory behaviour of
the health workers are additional barriers, forcing them to prefer their traditional
methods. Women find it more difficult to access health centres because of
gender specific constraints.
This state of starvation and ill health bears direct impact on children's education.
Only when children are able to cope with staying hungry and walking long distance,
which usually only be adolescents, can manage do they start aKtending schools.

4. PROGRAMME COMPONENTS
Selected   initiatives  of the  Government and      other agencies    supporting   the programme
components of NHSP-IP are reviewed from a social inclusion and gender perspective in this
section. The progranime components are linked to those included in the PAD and categorised
accordingly.
4.1    Essential Health Care Services (EHCS)21
4.1.1 Family Planning
HMG/N's long term goal in famnily planning is to reduce fertility and under -five mortality.
Programme strategies are (i) increasing demand for services through Behaviour Change
Communication (BCC); (ii) increasing access to integrated family planning and reproductive
health services; (iii) improving care quality with counselling, infection prevention and
management of side effects and complications; and (iv) increasing access to condoms through
multiple channels. DOHS's Family Health Division (FHD) implements the program.
Challenges for social inclusion
Contraceptive Prevalence Rate22: Nepal continues to experience high levels of population
growth (2.27 per annum). Numbers of women of reproductive age is projected to increase upto
71 percent (Nepal Health Profile on Women, Health and Development 2001, Planning and
Foreign Aid Division, DoHS/MoH) indicate the need for massive FP services in the future.
2 The Program will support the expansion and/or strengthening of eleven priority cost-effective services by: (i) developing and
implementing technical standards to improve service quality;(ii) providing in-service training to upgrade the technical skills of
about field workers; (iii) ensuring drug availabilitv in health facilities by improved drug procurement and distribution; (iv)
using behaviour change communication (BCC) to inform the public about services; to promote healthy behaviours; and to
promote a client focused, gender-sensitive attitude among providers; (v) improving outreach activities especially in the Mid
and Far-Westem Regions; (vii) contracting NGOs for service deliverv in eight municipalities; and (viii) conducting Service
Deliverv Surveys (SDS) to obtain client and provider experience of and perceptions about the quality and adequacy of health
services(PAD, World Bank April 2004)

More men than women are well-informed about family planning methods due to men's access
to information and mobility being higher than women's across geographic, age, caste and
ethnicity diversity. However, contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR), which is a direct indicator of
people's conscious efforts to control fertility, is 38%23 in Nepal with forty-nine districts having
CPRs below the national average24.
Women have poor access to sexual and reproductive rights National studies indicate that despite
92% men agreeing that contraception is not a woman's responsibility alone; almost 70% men
believe that male sterilization is the same as being castrated (NDHS 2001). The most widely used
form of sterilization is female sterilization, which is 15% among currently married women while
male sterilization is only 6%. Data reveals that only about 24% of men are among new FP
acceptors. In fact Voluntary surgical contraception of men has increased in the MWR and
FWDR, but has actually decreased nationally over the past three years as per the latest DoHS
annual report. New acceptors of different spacing methods have decreased except for condom
use. Wide differences exist between districts in the range and quality of FP services provided
(e.g. IUCDs and Norplant are available in 60 and 55 districts only).
Womens unmet need: There is a high unmet need25 with two in every three Nepalese women
demanding FP services but only three/fifths are receiving it. Approximately 35% of teenagers
26
have an unmet need for FP services , and the wanted fertility rate amongst adolescents is 2.5.
These factors lead to unwanted pregnancies, sometimes leading to abortions, which until
recently was illegal.
Social exclusion impact on Total Fertility Rate:
(1)   A strong linkage between education and fertility has been clearly established. While
women had a TFR of 4.8, women with some secondary education had a TFR of 2.3 (NDHS 2001).
The total fertility rate27 estimated at 4.1 per woman is quite high. There are vast geographical
disparities with urban TFR (at 2.1/woman) and rural (at 4.4/woman) and the TFR is the highest
in the mountain- 4.8 births/woman.
(2)   The under-5-year mortality rates for children of uneducated mothers in Nepal is 121 per
1000 births, 64 per cent higher than for children of mothers who have some primary education
and nearly double that of children of mothers who have some secondary education (DIIS 2002).
Compared with children of mothers with SLC and above children of uneducated mothers have 8
times higher risk of dying. Reducing one key social risk exposure - such as lack of education -
might decrease the vulnerability of women to the effects of other health risks (WHO 1998, Ostlin et al
2001). (Refer Annex 5, Figure 3for correlation between mother 's education and U5MR.)
Research has indicated that contrary to other population groups in Nepal, Dalit women have not
experienced any progress in indicators such as use of family planning devices, girls attending
schools and increases in life expectancy in recent years (Koirala 2002).
Social norms: In Nepalese society women are often viewed as a biological means of human
reproduction. Various socio-cultural, socio-economic, religious cultural and political factors
have been influencing the women's health and relevant attitudes, traditions and behaviours
(Rajbhandari et al., 1998). These factors are deeply rooted in our social structure, where women have
subordinate status resulting in low self-esteem. There is lack of knowledge among wide
population groups, particularly rural women, about women's health concerns. Indigenous
knowledge, technology, experience and plant resource of medicinal values have been gradually
disappearing and at the same time resorting to health facilities is very low in rural areas. Muslim
women for example, face religious constraints in the use of FP services. Mobility constraints
23 NDHS 2001: The respondents in the NDHS survey were: Brahman/Chhettri/Newar: 31 %; Janajati: 24%; Occupational castes:
21%, Muslim: 4.6; Rajbhanshi/Yadav/Ahir:10%; Others: 10%
24 Differences between districts: Maximum: Kathmandu: 77.42%, Kalikot: 7.87%
25 Unmet Need: Women who want to wait before another child but are not using any contraceptive are considered to have an unmet
need.

also hamper their access.28 Social realities in Nepal would constrain access to FP services for
unmarried women, especially girls.
Discussion within couples about contraceptive use is still uncommon due to women's poor
bargaining power. One in two married women has stated that their husbands alone have the final
say in the wife's health care (NDHS 2001). 16% of women, who have no say in household
decisions, are using a modern method of contraception compared to 42% women who actively
participate in household decisions. Use also varies with attitudes towards wife beating. 36
percent of women who believe that a man is not justified in wife beating are using modern FP
methods compared to 26 percent of women who believe otherwise. Thus women's status is
strongly linked to access to family planning services (NDHS 2001). Research by Engender health29
has indicated that while men take majority of the decisions, they are not informed decisions
because men are unaware of FP/RH issues. Due to unavailability of disaggregated data, the
specific issues of Dalits and Janajatis could not be identified. [Responses of government and other agencies
(Please refer to annex ... for examples)]
Gender, Caste and Ethnic issues: Various I/NGOs and projects are supporting the Family
Planning programme of HMG/N. But apart from SCF US, specific strategies or guidelines to
reach the socially excluded have not been adopted. While gender concerns have been addressed
to a certain extent, needs and interests of Dalits and Janajatis have not been consciously
recognized.
Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) have become key delivery agents and many
activities are focused on increasing their skills. Most FCHVs are from families, which have a
more secure economic background than others in their community. Due to the work without
pay, some examples of FCHVs facing domestic violence from husbands and mothers-in-law
were found where the women were beaten for attending meetings30.
The overall caste ethnicity disaggregation of the 47000 FCHVs is unavailable but it is generally
recognized that most FCHVs are of Brahman/Chettri caste and very few are Dalits or
Janajatis31. Lower caste representation can be found only in areas with a high concentration of
lower caste people. Poor people were found to have more trust in FCHVs, and those who were
further from health facilities consulted them more often. People with education did not consult
FCHVs as they had better access to health services
4.1.2 Safer Motherhood
The FHD's National Safe Motherhood Plan (2002-2017) plans, over 15 years, the establishment
of basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care (B/CEOC) in all 75 districts, skilled
attendance at all births and increased access to emergency fund and transport services. NHSP-IP
will establish CEOC in 10 hospitals, place midwives at the village level and improve basic
obstetric care with competency based training to outreach female providers.
Prioritised Health Service Achievers and Social Exclusion
Gender based inequality results in several additional constraints for women and girls that cause
maternal death and several illnesses. Women 15-44 years old experience a 26 percent higher
loss of DALYs than men in the same age group. Much of this excess loss is related to problems
related to pregnancy.
*    Heavy workload: No rest during pregnancy and after childbirth.
*    Deprivation: Inadequate food during pregnancy and after delivery; deprived of love and
care during pregnancy and during the adolescent period; deprive of education, health

Significant effects on women's reproductive health amongst women workers were identified,
including over bleeding, miscarriage, loss of reproductive capacity, high infant mortality, under
weight child, and disabled baby. The agriculture sector showed the highest effect followed by
the tea sector, mainly from over bleeding and miscarriage. 27.2 women workers have suffered
from over bleeding, 13.3 from loss of reproductive capacity, 20.3 from miscarriage, 13.4 from
under weight children, 13.3. from high infant mortality and 10.8 from disabled children.
(Gefont/KAD Study Report on Women Worker issues, Searchfor Alternatives, 2003)
Heath seeking behavior is deeply influenced by caste and ethnicity with some traditional
practices providing treatment based on natural remedies and indigenous knowledge (see chart
below). The findings of a study in Baglung revealed that the Mangol and Dalit population as a
proportion of the total population in Baglung (29% and 25% respectively) are relatively higher
in comparison to the national proportion. However, their representation of the population using
caesarean section is disproportionately small (only 10% & 13% respectively). Conversely the
percentage of caesarean sections by the Brahmin, Chhetri and Newar is disproportionately high.
(NSMP/DFID: Assessing the quality of Comprehensive Essential Obstetric care using an audit of the 100 Caesarean sections in
Baglung District - Pandit Upendra*; Clapham Susan). Refer to Annex 4 for table Women's Major Health
Problems in Rural Nepal and Effective Health Remedies
Challenges for social inclusion
Nepal has one of the highest maternal mortality rate in the world (539 per 100,000 women) and
neonatal mortality rate of 39/1000 live births. Around 50% infant mortality is due to deaths
during neonatal and perinatal periods. Delivery conducted by trained health personnel is 13%
only. Antenatal and post natal care is very limited (NHsp-Jp).
Nepalese women of reproductive age comprise 23% of the population. Women 15-44 years old
experience a 26 percent higher loss of DALYs34 than men in the same age group. Much of this
excess loss is directly related to pregnancy complications. 70% women are anaemic. 90%
deliveries take place at home, most deaths occurring at the community (79%) and 21% at the
health institution levels. Only 28% women receive care from doctor, nurse or midwife or ANM;
11% from health assistant, AHW; 3% from MCHV; 6% from VHW (NDHS 2001).
Abortion complication is a major problem and 20-27% of maternal deaths in the hospital are
due to complication of abortion (Maternity' Hospital, 1993). The Maternal Mortality and Morbidity
study in 1998 showed that in the community 5% of the deaths are due to abortion. 46% maternal
deaths are due to bleeding (NFHP).
Disparities based on geographic access and education have been documented e.g. 23 percent of
rural adolescents have begun childbearing as compared to 13 percent in urban areas for the same
age group (Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 20001). The number of pregnancies among women who
had attended school compared with those who had never attended school was 2.1 vs. 4.4 in
Achham district and 2.5 vs. 3.7 for Doti. (GTZ/UNFPA: Reproductive Morbidity - A Neglected Issue?)

Social norms and practices have a profound effect women's health. Young mothers are forced to
follow food restrictions during critical periods, such as pregnancy, menstruation and lactation.
Practices like Chhaupadi goth (cowsheds where women are kept in isolation during childbirth and
menstruation) in the Mid and Far Westem Regions expose women to high risks of infection, mental
trauma and even increase sexual vulnerability (there have been many cases of rape reported)35.
While largely undocumented, discriminatory behavior within communities and by health service
providers has been stated by women and men from different vulnerable groups and increase the
constraints faced by Dalits and Janajatis.
Significant gender specific effects on women's reproductive health were identified in a study on
women's work and occupational hazards. Women workers suffered from over-bleeding,
miscarriage, loss of reproductive capacity, high infant mortality, under weight and giving birth
to children with disability. The agriculture sector showed the highest effect followed by the tea
sector, mainly from over bleeding and miscarriage. Carpet and hotel show the highest % of
infant mortality; agriculture, tea and construction show the highest % of disabled children. In
the garbage sector, 66.7% women suffered from over -bleeding.
A  review   of Tharu and Magar obstetric practices36 revealed that there was only fragmented
documentation about birthing practices, decision-making, and sources of information, health
care-seeking beliefs and behaviour, and other related aspects of social organisation in many
ethnic groups in the different parts of Nepal. But considerable ethnic differences exist37, enough
to highlight the importance of understanding localised knowledge to the increasing access
component of the project. [Responsefrom Government and other agencies (Please refer to Annex 8for examples)]
4.1.3 Child Health
The DOHS's Child Health Division (CHD) implements child survival programs with priority
focus on ARI, Immunisation and Nutrition. The programme faces an enormous challenge of
reaching preventive and curative services to women and children.
CDD, ARI, Immunization, Nutrition are being integrated with the community based integrated
management of child illnesses (CB-IMCI). The ARI Control Programme covers 75 districts,
with 10 having the community-based IMCI.
Prioritised Health Service Achievers and Social Exclusion
Gender inequality affects girls throughout the life cycle. Female children are more likely to be
stunted (52% for girls, 49% for boys) or severely stunted than male children (24 for girls, 19 for
boys) due to neglect and less access to food, care and timely treatment. (NDHS, 2001). Children in
rural areas are more likely to be stunted i.e. 52% than those in urban areas: 37%, children in
mountain areas are more likely to be stunted (61%) (NDHS, 2001) 43.7 percent of adolescent girls
are currently married of which 23 percent of female adolescents in rural Nepal have begun
childbearing as compared to 13 percent in urban areas for the same age group and percentage of
adolescent mothers and pregnant mothers is highest in Terai as compared to hill and mountains.

37 The role of the traditional healer (lamajhankri among Magars, and guruwas among Tharu) is central. Apart from the traditional
healers, the most common additional sources of help and information are the private medical shop, and the untrained
traditional birth attendant, rather than trained govemmental health service providers. Decision-making is characterized by
many different types of delay at all stages of the process, from the woman's first recognition of something abnormal to a
decision to her take to the hospital. Men generally showed little awareness of women's obstetric and menstrual problems,
but some, especially the younger men, did express an interest in leaming about it. For their part, women were largely
skeptical of any benefit of increasing knowledge of these issues among men. Some traditional systems that can operate to
organise and provide help in emergencies were found. (NSMP: Obstetric Health Perspectives Of Magar And Tharu

Challenges for social inclusion
The highest risk groups are children under five, particularly girls, who account for 52.5 percent
of all female deaths. One in every 11 children born dies before reaching age five (NDHS 2001).
Although children under 5 years old represent only 16 percent of the population, they account
for over 50 percent of the total DALYs lost from all causes and 80 percent of the under-five
deaths are due to causes in Group I.
The statistics regarding children's health bear evidence to the double impact of poverty and
exclusion. One in two Nepalese children under five years is stunted; 10% wasted; 48%
underweight and 27% women fall below cut-off for body mass index. One-third children with
diarrhoea are not given any treatment at all and one in four children is taken to health facilities
for treatment of ARI symptoms (NDHS 2001). Evidence suggests that only 60% of children aged
12-23 months are fully vaccinated (2002)38. Cases of respiratory infection and diarrhoeal
diseases are found to confront people from all age groups. Only in four children is taken to the
health facility for treatment of ARI symptoms (NDHS 2001).
More than 50% of children suffer chronic malnutrition and stunting, forever crippling their
potential for growth, development and productivity.39. The proportion of malnourished children
is 14% in Nepal, with the highest in the FWR at 16.4%. Prevalence of anaemia among the
preschool children was higher (78%) and the highest was among the infant age 6-11 months
(90%) (DHS Annual Report 2001-2002). One in four Nepali women suffers from malnutrition.
Girl children under five face violent assaults more than twice as many than boy children. A very
significant proportion of the children who run away from home are actually escaping violence
and brutality at home (Gerison, 2003). Of 200,000 women trafficked: 20% girls below 18 years;
Age group most vulnerable for trafficking40 is 11-18 for girls and 6-12 for boys. A higher
number of girl children, mostly ex-Kamaiya Tharu girls, work as domestic servants. 43 percent
of women convicted for infanticide41 were adolescents.
The limited data that is available about Dalit children reveals that U5MR was 171.2 compared
to 79 of the national average (per 1000 live births) in 1996 (NESAC, 1998) and IMR was 116.5
(compared to 52.5 for Brahmin) per 1000 live births in 1996 (NESAC, 1998). The immunization
coverage on Dalit children is a mere 43 per cent, which is less by approximately 20 per cent
than the national average.
In a study on Dalits in Siraha, 20 cases of disabilities were found out of the sample population
of Dalits in Siraha whom 16 were male and 4 were female. The 'Chamars' seemed to have the
highest instances of disability followed by Danuwars and Teli/Sudi and Musahars.
Over the period of five years, there were 52 deaths cases of whom 15 were reported to be
children. The highest number of cases of children's death was found to be among Musahar caste
groups. The Muslims, Musahars and Chamars comprised the largest proportion of those who did
not take vaccines due to lack of immunisation. the instances if not taking TT among the
untouchable castes group. Dalit children outnumber all other groups in the worst form of child
labour prevalent in Nepal (Situational Analysis of Dalits). The caste/ethnicity of child labourers in the
carpet sector is highest of Tamangs with 34 percent boys and 24 percent girls. Though these
children (of 14-16 age groups) work for an average of 15 hours a day, their earnings are
controlled by relatives. And this is more so for girls (36.1 %) than for boys (22.2%) (Child Labourers
ILO)
According to field information, there are several components of the EPI programme that are
currently dysfunctional throughout the country. Some of the difficulties can be attributed to the
conflict in a direct or indirect way, but some others are due to dire and chronic lack of

maintenance of equipment or to local decisions based on personal interest. Dissolution of the
locally elected bodies resulted in reduced funds and inadequate coordination as VDC funds,
leaders and members were the key for the coordination of volunteers as well as for the provision
of information to the community and of food and shelter for the EPI teams in hilly and
mountainous districts. (Martinez and Koirala) [Responsefrom Government and other agencies (Please refer ta annex ... for

4.1.4 Communicable disease control
Tuberculosis and Leprosy has impacted poor households, more and within these, girls and
women are worse off.
Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS/STI: Strategies include: (i) preventing STIs and HIV
among the high-risk groups; (ii) ensuring safe blood supply; (iii) preventing infections among
the young; (iv) ensuring care and support for persons infected and affected by HIV/AIDS; (v)
improved monitoring and evaluation; and (v) establishing an effective management system.
Challenges for social inclusion
There are 60,000 people suffering from HIV/AIDS in Nepal of whom 26% are women. 2400
AIDS related deaths have been recorded. Amongst the high-risk group, 40% are migrant
labour42, and 18%    are clients of sex-workers. Knowledge of preventive measures was found
lowest amongst Dalits and Tharu migrants and their wives. Ethnicity, education and marital
status were found to be significantly associated with sexual behaviour43 and vulnerability to
HIV AIDS.
Girl child workers suffer sexual harassment which puts them at an increased risk of HIV
infection (CWJN 2000). Women and girls vulnerability is four times greater than that of men and
boys. 64 men, 143 women were HIV affected in the age group 14-19 years, in 2000 (NCASC).
17.3% prevalence of HIV among female sex workers in the Kathmandu Valley 62% of female
sex workers range between 20-29 years in age.44; Males make the decision to use condoms
HIV/AlDS prevalence consistently exceeds 5% in one or more sub-groups (Source: NHSP - IP, 2003).
Nepal's epidemic is beginning to show signs that it may be on the verge of becoming
generalized in some communities, especially among those in the Far-Western45 and Western
regions of Nepal where heavy migration to India occurs. Stigmatization and discrimination of
those infected with HIV have become commonplace - and acceptable. PLWHA have limited
access to care and support services, treatment, and opportunities to create sustainable livelihood
and to participate in decision-making regarding the HIV response.
STI and Gender dimensions: Women are still stigmatised with regard to STI treatment and
care. Almost all health workers, FCHVs and peer educators stated that many of the men, mostly
those from elite and educated groups, are unwilling to support their wives in the treatment of
STIs. It was observed that partner treatment for the ML group was particularly difficult, since
the men live in India for more than six months in a year (SC, STI Prevalence Study: 2001) and
are thus also hard-to-reach for project interventions.. The vulnerability of MLWs has been
fuelled by economic and social subordination and limited access to information and education.

It is harder for them to afford the cost of STI treatment, which is, on average, Rs5OO to Rs800,
and some have had to borrow money for the purpose. In addition women are looked down upon
if they are known to suffer from such diseases as STI. Because of the social stigma and fear of
the apprehension of their husbands, MLWs do not like to keep a stock of condoms in their
house. A few of the MLWs noted that it creates mistrust between husband and wife, and
breaches the relationship, if the husband finds his wife is keeping condoms when he returns
home. It is the males who make the decision to use condom during sexual intercourse. The
males thought that talking about condom and sexual health is not necessary because they were
having sex with their wives. [Responsefrom Government and other agencies: (Please refer to annex ... for examples)]
4.1.5 Strengthened Outpatient Services
Strategies are (i) expanding the Community Drug Programme (CDP); allowing public facilities
to charge for drugs to have these in stock; (iii) switching to a "pull" system of drug ordering and
local purchasing under central price negotiation; and (iv) improving staff motivation by
decentralizing some personnel functions. MOH will promote rational drug use; implement
standard treatment schedules and essential drug lists through training, monitoring and
supervision; and ensure essential infrastructure, repair and maintenance.
The existing situation: Hospital use data indicates that women access hospital services far less
than men. Even for women above 70 the use of public hospitals is far less than that of a man
(Male: 8; Women: 5).
4.2    Decentralisation46
His Majesty's Government has introduced one of the world's most progressive legislation for
decentralization in the world devolving primary responsibility for local development to elected
local authorities. The Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) has given authority to the local
bodies (VDC, Municipality and DDC) to operate and manage health centres, health posts and
sub health posts, primary health care services, perform public health related works including
toilet construction, protection of water sources, family planning and maternity and child care
services. The LSGA has emphasized priority areas of the local bodies to "enhance the living
standards, income and employment of, and render direct benefits to, the village people and
contribute to poverty alleviation ". It has directed the bodies to allocate funds earned from their
sources in the health sector on a priority basis. (A Manual Preparedfor Transfer and Operation of Local Health
Institutions 2060 (2004) His Majesty's Government, Ministry Of Health, Department of Health Services).
Government policy with regard to health is consistent with the decentralised and participatory process
of decision making and inplementation, and hence in keeping with the LSGA. However, in
implementation, there is lack of clarity as to the functions and responsibilities of government health
agencies and local bodies. The problem is compounded by gaps in the provisions of the LSGA and the
way health services are currently administered by the public sector agencies.47
While the LSGA mandates local government bodies to manage and supervise S/HP and their
functioning, local committees and VDC and bodies like HMC should control resources and
management of S/HP. Another discrepancy is the allocation of responsibilities without any
provision for the required resources. These differences in rules and regulations between LSGA,
46 Greater local authority and responsibility over service provision (IDA, GTZ, DflD, SDC): The Program will support capacity
building for the decentralized management of health services. By the conclusion of the five year Program, responsibility
and authority over health posts and sub-health posts throughout the country will be handed over to Local Bodies (i.e., local
government structures). The program will articulate roles and functions of the Local Bodies in the health sector and provide
training in leadership, setting local priorities in health, personnel management, performance appraisal, planning, budgeting,
financial accounting and controls. MOH officials at all levels will receive orientation and guidance regarding their roles in
supporting Local Bodies (Project Appraisal Document, World Bank,April 2004)

10th Plan and MoH guidelines and the role of local bodies (VDCs and DDCs) are a major
concern for enhanced community ownership of S/HPs.
The 'Health Sector Reform Strategy: An Agenda for Change' authorizes local bodies to be
"responsible and capable of managing health facilities in a participative, accountable and
transparent way with effective support from the MoH and its sector partners" (MoH 2002). The
HSRS recognizes that management of health facilities requires transfer not only of budgets but
also of responsibilities for planning and implementation of health service development within
the districts and has implications for a new relationship between the Ministry, DDCs and VDCs.
Indicators of progress have also been identified.
Current progress in implementation of decentralization has been the following: (Joint Review of the
Nepal Health Sector Programme - Implementation Plan, 15-26 March 2004)
Hospital Autonomy: Hospital Development Boards have been formed for all government
hospitals above the district level. This has recently been extended to 12 district hospitals. In
addition to grants from MOH, Hospital Development Boards have to generate there own
resources to recover some portion of the recurrent cost through user charges. According to
Public Expenditure Review of the Health Sector (2003) financial cost recovery rate varies
considerably, but on average the zonal hospitals recover around a third of the total costs. In
addition to resource general function, Hospital Development Boards have the responsibility to:
.    oversee the day-to-day running of the hospital,
*    undertake assessment and subsidy for those unable to pay,
*    ensure smooth functioning of the hospital, and
*    hire staff.
Sub-health post handover: Since 2002 the MOH has handed over responsibility for the
management of 922 sub health posts to communities. According to the Guidelines developed by the
Ministry of Health for orientation of Health Committees, handover has two broad objectives, i.e.:
*    To ensure quick, timely and effective health services in the local level by ensuring
transparency and good governance, and
*    To mobilize the available local resources to its possible extent.
Currently Village Development Committees receive central government grant of which 25% are
earmarked for social services including health. In addition, VDCs can generate additional
resources to cover the services. No extra central government funds accompany the new
arrangements under SHP handover. While the committees have the responsibilities to oversee
and monitor the functioning of health staff, they have no responsibility for their hiring and
firing, which remains under the MOH.
The chair of the SHP health committee is the VDC chairman when in post. In the current
climate the chairman is the VDC secretary. The guidelines state that the committee must have
four women as members and two candidates have to represent the dalit/Janajati community
(with one being a woman). The SHP Management Guidelines outline the functions of the
SHPMC but no role or responsibility to address gender and social inclusion concerns are
stated. The functions are stated in a neutral manner, based on the assumption that services will
reach all the members of the community. Experience has indicated that unless directives are
established, access of Dalits and Janajatis remains limited (Refer Annex 9 for a detailed review of the Local
Institution Health Operation and Management Committee).
A report of Sub-Health Post Decentralisation Process Review pointed out that the MOH's
responsibilities should not end with the mere handover of local health facilities to local
communities and giving orientation to its committee members, but continue to provide support,
guidelines, build their capacity and monitor their performance. But feedback from informants
has been that the handing over is as yet not effective as the required financial and human
resources have not been transferred.
Decentralisation and EDPs: Decentralisation presents a major challenge to the process of aid
coordination, hannonisation, and sector wide programming, partly because of the absence of
25                             VCDP Health June 2004                    10/06/2004



detail , but also because many EDPs have a strong presence at district level. However neither
the draft harmonisation paper, nor the NHSP-IP addresses how EDPs are to engage with
government at the different levels. On the one hand there is the need to for EDPs to engage at
central level to promote decentralisation plus all the other reforms, and to engage in sector
dialogue. On the other hand there is the reality of a strong EDP presence at district level
engaged with capacity building for planning and other interventions which necessitates
discussions between local authorities and EDPs about their current and future support. It is not
clear at this stage how this issue can be addressed, but considerable thought needs to be given to
it to ensure that EDPs do not just relocate their highly project focussed debate from the centre to
the districts. This will then need to be reflected in a revised Code of Conduct or Memorandum
of Understanding between MoH and EDPs.
The social issues which affect decentralization include:
. High level of poverty and its impact on health needs;
. low per capita funding for health care;
. relatively limited role of the private health care sector;
. problematic allocation of resources in the health sector in the existing
epidemiological and demographic profile;
. poor technical efficiency of the government health sector; inequality of the
system particularly in the urban/rural and rich/poor relationship;
. ethnic composition of the country and the regional and federal aspirations of
some political groupings;
. domination by local elites
. existence of an important network of self-help groups
4.3   Public Private Partnerships48
Private sector contributes to about 76% of the total health expenditure (NHSP-IP). This sector
and NGOs already make an important contribution to health provision in Nepal. Various
agreements and operating modalities exist between MoH and NGOs and private providers, and
in many cases these are vital for supporting EHCS programmes and directly providing curative
care that cannot be covered by public expenditure. HMG/N has rightly identified the potential
for developing this contribution further. The HSS states that the 'public sector will develop a
major new role in working with the private / NGO sector', and identifies four areas where this
will operate:
1)   sustainable financing
2)    providing an integrated approach to delivery EHCS;
3)    quality assurance by government; and
4)    pharmaceuticals, other consumables and new technology.
The joint review of the NHSP -IP has carried out an in- depth review of the Public Private
Partnership. Detailed recommendations for addressing the future challenges to improve Public
Private Partnership are presented in Annex-10.
Social Protection Measures for Health
Nepal's middle-income group and the mainly urban, formal economy workforce have been the
beneficiaries of existing social security provisions (e.g. provident fund, maternity leave, medical
care). At present, the formal social security systems (provident fund and citizen's investment
fund) cover mainly civil servants, army, police, and teachers. In total, about 400,000
government officials are covered. The Government is the single largest employer in the country.
48 The MOH will appoint a focal point for PPP. The Program will support the development of guidelines, contract standards and
regulatory frameworks, and provide training. New service provider agreements/contracts will be defined with NGOs and
the private sector. Large district/zonal hospitals will be made autonomous, and NGOs/private sector will be contracted to
manage others (Project Appraisal Document, World Bank, April 2004)
26                               VCDP Health June 2004                        10/06/2004



Any private enterprise with more than 10 employees can join the provident fund on a voluntary
basis. All enterprises can join the retirement plan under the citizen's investment fund. However,
there is no mandatory social insurance provision for the private sector.
The Labor Act and regulations provide some special rights for women workers, who are legally
entitled to equal pay for similar jobs, maternity leave, breast feeding time and creche facilities.
But women have to be on a permanent pay roll, which is often not the case. There is no
recognition that the poor, caste and ethnic disadvantaged require specific provisions.
Government, employers' organizations, trade unions, community groups and women's
cooperatives as well as families, caste based and occupation based groups and communities are
implementing different social protection schemes. Apart from the formal sector social security
provisions, there are various informal, partly traditional, community-based insurance
arrangements (micro-insurance). (For details on impact on vulnerable communities, see Annex 8 on social protection).
5. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND CAPACITY BUILDING
One of the tasks of a successful Vulnerable Community Development Plan is to identify the
institution or institutions who should and can take responsibility for implementing the
suggestions contained in this report. In many developing countries, government institutions
assigned the responsibility of supporting disadvantaged groups are weak and thus unable to
provide the level of engagement, which vulnerable people deserve. Assessing the track record
and capabilities of these institutions is fundamental to assessing what they can deliver both in
terms of the availability of funds for investments and field operations, the adequacy of
experienced and trained professional staff, the ability of vulnerable peoples' own organisations,
local administration authorities and NGOs interacting with government institutions and
stakeholders groups, and the ability of the executing agency or agencies to mobilise other units
to successfully implement the NHSP-IP vision and the recommendations contained within this
Vulnerable Community Development Plan.
5.1  Institutional capacity of the State
The following institutions should be involved in the successful implementation of the NHSP-IP vision
and the recommendations contained within this Vulnerable Community Development Plan. Their
specific tasks will involve the development of a working system and skilled and motivated staff to
support social inclusion in primary health centres throughout the nation. More than rles, a shift in
attitudes and behaviour are called for to bring social transfornation in health centres.
5.1.1 Ministry of Health (MoH)
With the lead responsibility from the government to manage and oversee the national health
service program, the Ministry of Health (MoH) is best positioned to take the leading role in the
successful implementation of NHSP-IP and the recommendations of this VCDP. With
numerous departments and sections, a large human resource and skilled employees as well as
ongoing donor support, the Ministry has the potential to galvanise interest and support across a
wide range of institutions in government. In order to effectively implement the Vulnerable
Community Development Plan, it will be necessary to establish:
(1)  policy directives for increased social diversity in staff;
(2)  capacity building for improved attitude behaviour and skills towards woman, Janajati and dalits;
(3)  more effective partnerships with NGOs for improved responsiveness to vulnerable
communities and their social exclusion from health services
5.1.2 Department of Health Services (DoHS)
The department has the primary responsibility for delivery of all the national health service
programs. It comprises of five divisions, three centres and two sections and has full
27                             VCDP Health June 2004                    10/06/2004



administrative and financial authority to coordinate wide range of technical functions for health
service development programs. It is directly responsible for all program planning,
implementation and monitoring and is therefore the most critical agent of change and
implementation. A unit in charge of the successful implementation of the VCDP must be
established in the DoHS which can liaise with the ministry and District Health Offices.
DoHS is largely limited in concept and scope to is not a conducive framework for holistic
health. Institutional exclusion brings many negative consequences. Such traditional divisions
within institutions result in less resources, leverage, status and value than mainstream technical
units. More so, such segregation reduces accountability of others towards these specified clients.
It is the classic dilemma of finding the right balance between special structures for special
groups of clients and mainstreaming.
Human Resource Development: Ministry of Health
Staff Profile: A review of the staff profile reveals that a total of 30186 posts (administration:
9236 and technical 20,950) has been sanctioned for the MoH. Of a sample of 21,805 staff, 28%
are women and 72% men (HuRDIS). There are a significant number of women in the health
sector but most of them are occupying peripheral and assistant level technical positions with
very few in managerial, programming and policy level decision making positions. A gender
assessment review49 had identified that in the Ministry of Health, 85% were men and 15%
women. Of the 11 women, none were gazetted class I, II, III officers and only one was of
special class. Most were peons or equivalent and non-gazetted. Similarly the DoHS staff had
81% men and 19% women. Of the 55 women, 35 were non-gazetted/peon equivalent. The
Regional Directorates have 76% men staff. Figure 4 in Annex 5 for gender representation in
health services.
The disaggregation reveals that a majority of the women staff are posted as nurses while the
male presence is highest in Paramedics/Profession Allied to Medicine and in admin/support
staff. Caste and ethnic disaggregation of health ministry staff has not been done and was
unavailable with HurDIS.

Human Resource Issues: NHSP-IP recognizes that the implementation of the Health Sector
Reform Strategy requires re-definition of roles, responsibilities and powers of the MoH, the
Department of Health Services and the Regional Directors and a re-modelling of roles through
out the health system. The public sector bed to population ratio is I bed to 5,435 populations.
This becomes worse by the reported under-staffing and hence under utilisation of district beds.

28                                VCDP Health June 2004                         10/06/2004



Staff vacancies and absenteeism are widespread - only 60% of sanctioned posts are filled. The
total number of staff in proportion to the population is extremely low.
A Strategic Plan for Human Resources for Health has been prepared by MoH covering the
period 2003-2017. This introduces new policies and operational mechanisms to improve the
ability of the Ministry to manage systematically the deployment, utilisation, development and
careers of its staff50. The overall distribution of staff in terms of the mix of skills shows a
deficiency in the middle technical grades. There is currently a large number of unskilled staff
support (35% of the total work force). These unskilled staff along with other low level staff
makes up 70% of the workforce. (Strategic Plan for Human Resources for Health)
The MoH has started recently upgrading MCH workers by providing ANM scholarship in 500
VDCs and plans to place ANMs in all VDCs. The fact that MCHWs are being upgraded to
ANMs leading to a decrease in support staff from 70% to 45% and an increase in the mid-level
from 18% to 38% is a positive shift. The issue here is of representation of Dalits and Janajatis as
it can be assumed that MCHWs5' are mainly from the dominant castes. The shift from 12% to
17% in the high-level staff also raises the issues of gender and social inclusion as representation
of women is minimal at the higher levels.
The strategic plan identifies the need to produce more graduate nurses. While a caste/ethnicity
profile of the nurse students was unavailable52, a micro-survey of four Medical Colleges in
Kathmandu reveals that out of a total of 758 students for MBBS, only five were Dalits (see Annex 4
table 7for details).
The Institute of Medicine has started its own undergraduate programme to prepare medical
graduates who will have the skill, knowledge and attitude to work in Nepal's varying
environments. Stronger emphasis has been placed on community medicine.
It is estimated that 47,949 medical staff will be recruited between 2003 and 201753. Of these the
highest number is that of ANMs, followed by certificate/staff nurses. This can be used as an
opportunity for recruiting representatives from the dalit and Janajati groups, increasing the
diversity of the staff profile.
The staffing proposals for health posts and sub-health posts reveal that a nurse and an ANM will
be added to HP. In sub-health posts, one MCHW will be upgraded to ANM, an additional
MCHW will be added along-with one support staff, taking the total number of service providers
at the sub-health post to 6. This again can provide the space for inclusion of Dalits and Janajatis
so that issues of caste and language are addressed.
This Strategic Plan for Human Resources has not identified any policy or strategies for increase
of women in decision making positions, when data indicates that there are very few in the
gazetted class in higher positions. There appears to be no recognition of the need to adopt
alternative strategies to recruit and retain staff from dalit and Janajati caste/ethnic groups. The
projected staff requirements do not include measures for caste and ethnic disadvantaged group's
inclusion or address gender issues.
Retention of core health staff - especially women - at the level of health facilities due to lack of
motivation is a major concern. Most of the time, health workers are absent in the health posts
and sub-health posts, limiting the availability of critical safe motherhood and reproductive
health related services. Only peons and clerks are available to provide services, which further
constrains of women as they are reluctant to consult male health workers especially when a
gynecological examination is required. (World Bank: Understanding Access, Demand and Utilisation of Health
Services in Nepal and their Constraints, June 2001)

5.1.2.1 District Health Office (DHO): DHO is responsible for planning the delivery and
management of all national programs on education at the district level. Potential goals include:
the handing over of public health service centres to the community and the coordination and
cooperation with traditional health centres. All DHOs are overstretched and are constantly
challenged with far too may targets to complete. Social accountability will be close to
impossible for DHOs without technical support from civil society groups. DoHS needs to do
two actions to enable this. First, provide directives on the 'how to' for setting up agreements
with NGOs/local groups. Second, facilitate workshops with NGO/local partners to discuss
modalities and create a culture for effective partnership.
5.1.2.2 Sub Health Post Management Committees (SHPMCs): With the meaningful
involvement of parents of women, Dalits and Janajatis of vulnerable groups, Sub Health Post
Management Committees (SHPMCs) and local conmmunities should be given responsibility in
actual practice of managing the health centres and the health service it provides at the local
level. The Rules and Regulations for SHPMCs do not provide sufficient practical guidelines for
enhancing SHPMCs to address social inclusion. Without capacity building on these social
factors, SHPMCs will face difficulty in making the strategic shift as the lead body for
addressing social inclusion in primary health centres.
FCHVs and TBAs: The 47,873 Female Health Volunteers54 (FCHVs) and 12,682 Traditional
Birth Attendants55 (TBAs), being unpaid volunteers are not part of the Health Ministry staff. At
the bottom of the service provider hierarchy and closest to the community, it is on them that
many health programs rely for service delivery. FCHVs are increasingly the entry point for
many lINGO supported initiatives and have been acknowledged as the prime contributors for
the success of programmes such as Vitamin A distribution. There is an ongoing debate about the
use of women as volunteers since it reinforces the belief that women are secondary earners and
have the "time" to volunteer. While one recent study56 indicates that FCHVs claim they are
happy doing "dharma", their need to eam and the lack of remuneration has often been cited as a
major de-motivating factor (see box belowfor details).
There is an ongoing discussion about the voluntary status of the FCHVs with one argument
stating that it is better to be an unpaid volunteer than to be the poorly paid lowest member of the
staff67. The Ministry made the policy decision early in the programme not to make them part of
the staff due to lack of funds for sustained remuneration of such large numbers.
5.1.3 National Health Education, Information, Communication (Acting)
The NHEICC plans, implements and reviews the Health Education Programme, the Family
Health Programme, the Control of Diarrhoeal Diseases/ Acute Respiratory Infection
Programme, and the Health Literature and Library Information System. The main activities
carried out by this centre are: (a) Production and distribution of printed materials; (b)
Presentation of regular weekly and periodic audio-visual programmes; (c) Dissemination of
health messages through mass media, mobile video shows and cinema slide shows; (d)
Facilitation of seminars/workshops. The centre coordinates with other GOs and I/NGOs to
support district and central level IEC programmnes. It would have a lead role in developing
materials in all languages of the nation for Janajati population to be less excluded.
5.1.4 National Centrefor AIDS and STD Control (NCASC)
This centre could critical role in coordinating the establishment of community based adolescent
and youth centres for reproductive health and sexual rights and peer support. This centre could
also coordinate with development of life skill based package for training of peer educators.

5.1.5 National Health Training Centre (NHTC)
HRD has been a core part of health services delivery programme and the revision of MoH
services structure in 1993 brought the institutional leadership in HR training. NHTC manages a
training network of regional and district training centres and in addition works closely with
I/NGO , private sector and donors to provide technical training to health officials at different
levels. Numerous types of trainings are organised by NHTC in 2002/03 a total of 7,741 health
staff were trained achieving 94% of the target at the central level. At the district level as well
over 80,000 FCHVs received training. The cumulative target over the 9h Five year Plan,
average target of 75,000 health workers was achieved. A quick review of the central level
training programme in 2002/03 indicates a very strong focus on bio medical information and
practically no inclusion on the social dimensions of health. To address social exclusion it would
be essential for service providers at all levels to have conceptual clarity on gender and social
inclusion and the socio-cultural dimensions of health. The NHTC and the district training
institutions would need first capacity building themselves before they can facilitate effective
partnerships with NGOs for introducing training for field service providers on gender -social
inclusion and health.
Budget Review of Health Sector Finances: The planned allocations for MoH over the next
two years of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), through 2005/06, are
expected to increase to 5.5 percent by 2005/06. This suggests a strong governmental
commitment to health, as there has been a sharp increase in security and defence budgets,
leaving the govemment with little funds. (Refer to Annex 6 for details on Health Expenditure
Budget)
The previous trend has been of the regular budget of HMG being fully spent, but the
government and donor development budget remaining heavily under utilized, with the
utilization rate of donor fund decreasing from 61% to 27% over the period from 1999 to 2002
(HEFU, pg 8). This is mainly due to the low absorptive capacity of the government and the
different budget release rules of the EDPs. The proportion of government recurrent funding has
increased. Much of the increase (77%) has been used to finance wages which have increased
from 48 to 55%. Trends suggest a decreasing share of funding going to rural areas. They
benefit from only 50% of the spending.
MOH expenditure on secondary and tertiary care facilities increased from 14.6 percent of the
health budget in 1991/92 to 37.5 percent in 1997/98 while the share of spending on primary care
decreased from 76.8 percent to 57.25 percent over the same period. In addition, the portion or
resources spent on hospital construction over the last five years has increased three times
from 3%    to 11%   (Maskay et al 2002, NHEA 2002). These tendencies indicate an urban vis-ai-vis rural
resource allocation bias58. Since the most disadvantaged populations live in the rural areas this
urban/rural allocation bias indicates a de facto policy which contradicts the stated political
commitment to primary care since initiation of the National Health Policy of 1991. (Social
Assessment of the Nepal Health Sector Reform Submitted to World Bank, Nepal Office (draft
130503) Nielsen et al)
Despite the fact that Nepal spends 5 percent of its GDP on health, most of Nepal's expenditures
come from private out-of-pocket contributions, which in 2000 accounted for approximately 70
percent of total health expenditures. This, as the NHSP-IP recognizes, constrains the poor and
disadvantaged from accessing health services as they are less capable of private out-of-pocket
contributions.
58 This needs to be evaluated more in detail since there has been an increase in expenditures to district and below health services (as
a proxy for Essential Health Care Program) which can be seen as a compensation for the indicated recent tendency of urban
bias. But dominance in power structure on the basis caste hierarchy is one potential explanation for the discrepancy
between enunciated policy and actual performance. All but 8.8% of the individuals occupying the top political, bureaucratic
and executive positions in Nepal in 1999 are recruited from high caste Hindu groups (92.2%) (Gurung 2002). People with
IP and Dalit identity held respectively 8.4% and 0.3% of total top positions with potential influence on policy enunciation.
Political marginalisation of IPs and Dalits is based on social discrimination and is therefore considered a main reason why
these groups are deprived of economic, educational and overall social well-being (Gurung 2002)
31                                    VCDP Health June 2004                               10/06/2004



Approximately 14 percent of total health expenditures in Nepal are channelled through the
Ministry of Health and an additional three percent is spent by other ministries (e.g., MoF, MLD,
and MoE), autonomous bodies (e.g., universities) and local bodies (DDC, VDC and
municipalities). Direct expenditures by external development partners (EDP) account for
another 13 percent of health expenditures. (NHSP-IP)
Donor contributions are roughly the same size as HMG contributions to public health
expenditures. Direct EDP assistance is 90% as technical and financial assistance goes directly to
MoH and funds are self-executed by donors (for details see Annex-li). This indicates less money
available in the government treasury.
A gender assessment of government programs and budgetary allocation in health
sector revealed the following:
* Budgetary allocations (for the health sector) that are was allocated to programs
exclusively targeted to girls and women - such as allocations made to Maternity
Hospital, Mid-wife (Sudeni) Program, Women Health Volunteer Programme and
Mother and Child Programme in Ramechap and Dolkha Districts was, during
the period 1998/99-2000/2001, only about 1.5 to 1.7 percent of the total budget
of the Ministry of Health
* Programmes that did not exclusively target women but contained such
components that benefit women more than other programs60, had about 16 to
18 percent of the total budget of the Ministry of Health in 1998/99-1999/2000.
However, this share decreased to only 8 percent in the budget for 2000/2001
due to a large gap between the allocation and actual expenditure under
Population and Family Health programs.
* The rest of the allocations in the health sector amount to roughly about 80 to 90
percent of the total health budget allocated (on average during 1998/99-
2000/2001) to programs that did not target either male or female in particular.
(New Era 2001:39). UNIFEM/UNDP: Gender Budget Audit, Meena Acharya, Gender Issues in
Health Sector Budgeting
This assessment study also reports that budget inadequacy is not a major issue at the central
level but that management deficiency is the problem. The health budget was found to be highly
insufficient at the village and the district levels.
Another review of the health budget from a gender perspective covering the period from
1995/96 to 2001-0261 found that exclusively women programmes had 1.5 percent of the budget
of 2001-02. Primarily women programmes had 2.0% and programmes benefiting both women
and men had 96.4% (Source; MGEP, Gender Assessment of Health Sector, pg 41).
Women's share of the total health budget is estimated at 50 percent but maternal health
problems form a very large proportion (11 %) of the total disease burden which indicates a
severe gender bias in potential needs. Gender difference in susceptibility, exposure and social
consequences of ill health argues for an increased share in the health budget to be allocated for
women health (Neilson et al)
Dalit and Janajati concems are not reflected in the budget. Interviews indicated that next years's
budget will reflect such concerns especially for trafficking and nutrition62
NHSP -IP has presented Resource Envelope estimates for the health sector as well as for EHCS
under different scenarios. This is an estimate of the overall resource envelope that will be
available to the health sector over the Tenth Plan period. The projections have been made fewer
than three alternative scenarios based on the assumptions regarding the GDP and revenue

expenditure allocation to health and to basic health care packages. Three alternative scenarios
were set out - a base case (felt to be the most realistic one), a high case (the most optimistic
scenario) and a low case (a more pessimistic worst) scenario. The key assumptions involved in
making the projections are provided. The base case assumptions are the prevailing situation
(2000/01) as indicated by major macro economic indicators. For the base case, it is assumed that
the present situation will continue in future as well. (The three alternative scenarios presented are given in Table
3 in Annex 6.)
According to the budget estimate for 2001/2002, an amount of Rs. 224 (US $3) roughly will be
spent on average on a person in the public sector. This is an extremely low amount of
expenditure. According to an estimate, a developing country should spend around US $ 10-12
for ensuring the primary health care package alone (New Era, 2001:3 7).
In Nepal health expenditures external to government is not reported (as much as 85%) and
therefore significant donor contributions are not reflected in the government's budget system
(Maskay 2002). Nevertheless, HMGN is gradually incorporating more and more direct funding in
the health budget. This lack of transparency constitutes a major barrier when planning and
analyzing impact.
A major gap in the allocations and the discussions about the budget is the complete absence of
resources necessary for addressing the issues of gender and social inclusion. As has been
repeatedly identified, there is a persistent inequity in the use of services by girls and women and
for non-maternity care. Boys benefit significantly more from public hospital care than girls; if
maternal care is excluded, the overall balance service provision favours men and boys within
almost every age group (Public Expenditure of the Health Sector in Nepal 2003, HEFU/MoH). Issues concerning
Dalits and Janajajtis have not been recognized at all. To increase access of these groups to
health services, various innovative strategies will be necessary. Funding for such issues needs to
be planned for.
Another gap has been the complete ignorance of the effects of conflict on health services and
the emerging need to address issues like psycho-social issues, curative services: and
orthopaedics.
5.1.6 Operational Challengesfor MOHfor implementation of VCDP
Although the health policy of the government emphasises three key aspects, namely,
decentralisation of planning at the lowest level, decentralisation of health service management,
and integration of vertical programs for effective service delivery, the existing system has not
been able to make progress on all three counts.
Nepal's institutional capacity for strategic planning, policy development, resource mobilization,
and coordination of external donors and national stakeholders is extremely limited. Skills in
planning, management, health economics, and financial analysis are lacking. Responsibilities
within MoH and DoHS are poorly delineated. The Ministry of Finance lacks an effective
mechanism for monitoring and coordinating domestic and external resources that flow into the
health sector. Programs are inadequately integrated, resulting in duplication of effort and
inefficient implementation. Planning, budgeting, operations and monitoring functions remain
overly centralized. Both quality and quantity of outreach services are diminished by lack of
drugs, supplies, and qualified health care providers and the problem of staff absenteeism,
especially in remote areas. (Nepal Operation Issues and Prioritization of Resources in the Health Sector, World Bank,
June 2000). Whilst health policy, health provision and health finance are all Kathmandu centered
there are still weaknesses in terms of communication and engagement. Leadership of the health
sector programme by HMGN is a critical requirement; that leaderships needs to be confidant,
robust and open to the involvement of all stakeholders. Health workers have been confined to
district headquarters. Confidence in the service and its accessibility needs to be maintained.
Political dissonance of whatever kind undennines the institutional integrity of services whoever
happens to be the provider.

Financial constraints: The main constraint seen in the institutional options available to HMGN
in the health sector is finance. Maximizing efficiency, accessing new resources, focusing public
funds on a limited range of cost-effective interventions and acknowledge the continued
requirement for personal expenditure on health will all be part of the financial strategy;
tempered with pragmatism. Based on relatively optimistic assumptions regarding the growth of
both Government and EDP resources, the 10t Plan envisages per capita public expenditure on
health increasing from $2.58 to reach just $3.50 by 2006-7.
The main institutional constraints on staff performance are low pay scale, very seldom
recognition of good work, weak supervision and management and lack of sharing of reform
vision at all levels. (Institutional Assessment of Nepal Health Sector, World Bank, Verulam Associates for Core Group of
Health Sector Reform Committee, 2002- Page 5)
MOH and related government institutions who are assigned responsibility for the health of
vulnerable sub-population groups, like indigenous people, are found to have weak capabilities
for dealing with these matters. In order to enhance the institutional capacity for appropriately
addressing issues related to indigenous people, support of the following activities are relevant:
(i) Assessing the track record, capabilities, and needs of those institutions is a fundamental
requirement. Other institutional issues that need to be addressed through Bank assistance are the
(ii) availability of funds for investments and field operations; (iii) adequacy of experienced
professional staff; (iv) ability of indigenous peoples' own organizations, local administration
authorities, and local NGOs to interact with specialized government institutions; (v) ability of
MOH to mobilize other agencies involved in the plan's implementation; and (vi) adequacy of
field presence. (World Bank social safeguards and the Social Assessment of HSS)
5.1.7 Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare (MWCSW9
MWCSW is an important national voice for most of the socially excluded groups and can
provide valuable policy reform for inclusion in the national agenda. It has been appointed the
gender focal point for all government programs but the Ministry has poor resources and
visibility in spite of extensive technical support from several donor agencies. Coordination with
Ministry is critical for MOH for implementation of the VCDP as gender is a crosscutting
concern for all socially excluded groups.
5.1.8 Ministry of Local Development (MLD)
The MLD has lead accountability for the management of local bodies and decentralization. The
linkages with the education sector are essential given the recently approved 7h Amendment of
the Education Act. The MLD has in the past been pivotal in supporting primary health centres
through District funds and its role needs to be strengthened for this. Harmonisation of the
current discrepancies in legal frameworks is an urgent immediate task.
5.1.9 National Commissions
Commissions such as the National Women's Commission, National Dalit Commission, National
Committee for the Development of Nationalities and the National Federation of the Disabled
have been working intensively, becoming a strong national voice for their constituencies.
Councils and other bodies representing the interests of women, Dalits, and Janajatis and
children have also been established. All these would be key partnership for addressing several
of the VDCP recommendations. However they are largely young organisations and would
require capacity building, resources and improved accountability measures for improved
functioning.
5.1.10 Local bodies
VDCs, DDCs and associations like Association of District Development Committees, Nepal
(ADDC/N) advocate the cause of decentralization. Directives for social inclusion and community
monitoring need to be developed and coordination mechanisms need to be established.
34                              VCDP Health June 2004                      10/06/2004



Common to all such government agencies would be sustained dialogue and reflection on issues
of social inclusion, affecting women, Dalits, Janajatis and other disadvantaged groups to enable
an attitudinal shift towards inclusion.
5.2  Civil society
The past two decades have witnessed steady progress in civil society responsiveness to the
development of the socially excluded. National bodies, district networks, community groups
have mushroomed to respond with commitment and perseverance to getting their daughters into
schools and their women literate. With easy access to donor aid and huge demand for advocacy,
training, research and technical support, a growing number of NGO's have taken up community
health issues as their priority development program.
5.2.1 Women's development organisations: Nepal at present has a vast network of
community-based groups that have demonstrated a rich range and wide coverage of work by
women groups in several critical development sectors. At national, district and community
level, there are several thousand women's groups and many federations who could be valuable
partners in advocating social inclusion of girls and disadvantaged children and women. Many of
these groups have demonstrated how to work successfully with communities on issues of gender
and caste discrimination, equal representation in local bodies, more equitable resource
allocation and children's and women's well being.
5.2.2 Janajati institutions: The Nepal Federation of Nationalities (NEFEN) is as an umbrella
organisation and advocacy forum for Nepal's vulnerable peoples, legally recognized as the
representative organisation of vulnerable communities. In order to implement the provision of
the 10th Plan, the Nepali Parliament issued an Act in 2002 to establish the National Foundation
for the Development of Vulnerable Nationalities (NFDIN) which had a broad mandate to ensure
the social, economic and cultural development and upliftment of vulnerable peoples, as well as
their mainstreaming and equal participation in national development.
5.2.3 Dalit organisations: The movement of Nepali Dalits against discrimination and social
injustice began more than five decades ago. There are today over 60 agencies in Nepal working
on Dalit issues. All political parties have sister Dalit organizations though these are more
governed by political interests. At the national level, the Nepal Dalit Sangh is lobbying the
passing of a Bill in favour of Dalits. The National Dalit Council and Dalit Commission play a
lead role in advocacy for policy and legislative reform to address Dalit rights. Others like the
Dalit Welfare Council and many grassroot NGOs target specific Dalit communities for support
through scholarships, incentives, literacy and skills development programs.
5.2.4 Children's organisations: There are hundreds of examples of children's clubs and
organisations across Nepal, where children have been actively engaged and taken leadership in
improving community efforts on critical social inclusion issues such as increasing enrolment of girls
and Dalit children, confronting child labour and trafficking, challenging child marriage and
participating in health centres management. Child clubs, Child Rights Forums and Child Rights
Awareness Groups have been formed in many schools and through these forums, children are being
involved in the decision making process of health related activities. Similarly, child clubs have
started playing a dynamic role in VDC meetings. Over the years, children have been actively
participating in the electronic media particularly on Frequency Modulation (FM) Radio and TV, as
well as print media.
5.2.5 Special interest groups: A large number of welfare organisations provide service for
varied disabilities. Support is mostly institution based and in a welfare mode with very limited
examples of social inclusion.
The weakness of Nepali NGOs and the dominance of international NGOs and EDPs in service
delivery are in part functions of organizational culture and the relationships within and between
NGOs and NGOs and HMGN. The private sector is also institutionally young. Networks are not

strong and there is heavy reliance on external connections particularly with India. (Institutional Assessment
of Nepal Health Sector, World Bank Verulam Associates for Core Group ofHealth Sector Reform Committee, 2002- Page 4)
5.3  International agencies
Numerous I/NGOs in Nepal support district and community program for girls and Dalits
education. Furthermore agencies such as PLAN, Action Aid have made significant contribution
to social inclusion. The results all confirm that communities have the capacity to mobilise
themselves, if the process is right.
5.4  Multilateral and bilateral agencies
Development aid for health today is rising both in quantity and diversity. Amongst the UN agencies,
UNIFPA is a lead player with women's and girls' reproductive and sexual health and rights as the
number one global priority for the agency. Similarly, strategic shifts of UNICEF towards
decentralization has enabled effective convergence with the local governance structures and the
DACAW program today is well established in 15 districts demonstrating a positive example of
mainstreaming the interests of the poor and marginalized particularly children and women.
The World Bank has been a major donor for health care service, providing loans to HMG for national
health programs. A exceptional contribution has been the policy advocacy for social inclusion in the
Tenth Plan and the support for further analysis to provide the frame work for ensuring that the needs of
socially excluded groups are addressed appropriately in all planning and sector interventions. DFI) is
also a lead agency and along with the Bank, has supported HMG for social assessment and has been
supporting other programs for social inclusion. This project follows a SWAp where donors have ????
resources in an effort to achieve a more cohesive pragmatic synergy and greater impact. UTNDP has
been the lead player in Nepal for decentralization and has established programs in 60 districts building
capacities of local bodies and setting up local development funds. Gender mainstreaming and social
development is the second major area of support.
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1  Monitoring and evaluation
Since this plan focuses on social issues, it is essential that monitoring and evaluation assess
process and progress as well as output and outcome indicators. Indicators can come in two
forms: (1) technical and (2) self-reflective indicators using a community-owned and operated
monitoring system. The main recommendation regarding monitoring and evaluation is that
progress on the VCDP and various other interventions be evaluated during the first year of
implementation as a basic requirement for scaling the project up. The monitoring framework
and indicators presented in section 9 would provide baseline fro monitoring and evaluation.
Therefore in the first year a baseline survey should be carried out as per the information
collected by Community Health Information Management System carried out by the NGOs.
Health Management Information System (HMIS) must collect data disaggregated by gender,
age, disability, caste (Dalit/non-Dalit) and ethnicity (Janajati/non-Janajati). (Refer to section
8.2.3 for further details). Strong monitoring and evaluation is critical for the government and
donors to assess the progress of VCDP, to learn from past experience and to actively improve
the output performance.
VCDP: The MoH and its various offices are responsible for monitoring the VCDP
recommendation and the indicators. While disaggregated data for caste and ethnicity is not
available as yet, in order to correctly monitor outcomes of the Health Monitoring Information
System (HMIS) must produce such disaggregated data for all levels in Nepal. (Please refer to
Monitoring Framework for VCDP implementation, Section 9.)
36                              VCDP Health June 2004                      10/06/2004



To monitor social development, inclusion and unintended negative effects, annual external
evaluations must be conducted. The evaluation team should include social development experts,
health experts, anthropologists and gender specialists. The annual extemal evaluations should be
supplemented by independent evaluation by a group of indigenous and dalit representatives.
Such evaluation must also include the 'process' aspect of the program's implementation and
performance. For the overall monitoring of health centres management, SMCs and local
communities must be given responsibility. District and local level NGOs and dalit and
indigenous people's organisations may be included in monitoring inputs and outputs and can
assist local communities and inexperienced MCs in the formulation of rigorous and culturally-
appropriate monitoring techniques.
Mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the agreed plan: Health Management
Information System (HMIS) data and appropriate M&E systems will be developed/strengthened
and implemented to ensure accountability of all stakeholders. HMIS will collect data
disaggregated by gender, disability, caste (Dalit/non-Dalit) and ethnicity (Janajati/non-Janajati)
and use social inclusion indicators (e.g. issues such as shifts in decision making patterns, gender
relations, inter-caste behaviour). At the health centres level, there may be need for more detailed
classification of gender, caste and ethnic categories. These can be aggregated into user -friendly
key categories for the central level reports.
Community Managed Information System (CMIS) data will support HMIS under MOU with
local groups for collection of disaggregated data. Mechanisms such as social audits and social
mapping will track health centres participation and drop out rates by gender, caste and ethnicity
of children and women from socially marginalised communities, monitor discriminatory
behaviour/practices, support local women recruitment and feed such information to the CMIS
system.
6.2  Implementation
Vulnerable Community Development Plan should include an implementation schedule with
benchmarks by which progress can be measured at appropriate intervals. Pilot programs may be
needed to provide planning information for phasing the project component for Dalit and
indigenous peoples with the main investment. The aim must be the long-term sustainability of
project activities subsequent to completion of disbursement. It is anticipated that almost all the
activities will be initiated within Year 1. National policies, regulations, guidelines and directives
will be reviewed, revised, and implemented within the first year of the project.
(A) Funding at the Community Level: (i) NRs. 100,000 as a one-time incentive will be
provided to all community-managed health centres. (ii) All government-managed health centres
will get an initial basic grant for the first year. In order to receive the basic grant during year 2,
the Management Committee (MC) will need to follow the health centres grants plan. In
addition, health centres will be eligible for higher levels of funding if they are able to go beyond
the basic level of accountability (audited account statements) and fulfil the higher accountability
requirements for level I or level II. Which should be developed in consultation with key
stakeholders.
(B) Funding at the Central Level. Central funds will be used (probably on an outsourcing
basis) for: (i) providing technical expertise on integrating positive images of diverse socio-
cultural and religious groups into the ongoing BCC, IEC and capacity building and curriculum
development process; (ii) It is recommended that development of the program should be
initiated in Year 1 developing a framework for sanctions against discrimination which will be
carried out within six months by the Monitoring and Inspection Section of the MoE.

Note: (a) Gender and social inclusion tasks must be stated in the job descriptions of identified health
officials both in written form and during orientation. (b)Evaluation procedures of job performance must
incorporate tasks performed for gender and social inclusion. (These recommendatons are in addition to the
recommendations made in the Gender Assessment in the Health Sector prepared by MWCS W, MGEP/UNDP report of January 2002.)
7.1    Core recommendations for actions at the community level
The present effort of handling over the Sub-Health Posts to Local Management Committees
(LMCs), a form of de-concentration, is a first step towards the eventual devolution to the local
bodies. The MoH will deepen the present de-concentration by transferring further
responsibilities an resources to the district health office. It will work with the Ministry of Local
Development in developing a decentralisation strategy to gradually increase the role of the local
bodies/Local Management Committees to take on additional responsibilities of overseeing the
new arrangements. ( Draft Aide Memoire and Wrap up meeting of Joint World BanklDFID Appraisal Mission of Nepal
health Sector Program Project, June 8, 2004)
7.1.1 Establish block grants to Sub Health Post Management and Operation Committee
(SHPMC) for support from CROs particularly women's and adolescent community
groups for implementation of NHSP-IP
SHPMC would sign MOUs with community groups to fund them to carry out the following
actions for social inclusion:
(1)    Social mapping of catchments area: all households would be identified in terms
of their caste/ ethnic identity and households with specific health constraints for
women and children (i.e. HIV/AIDS/STD/FPI/TB/disability).
(2)    Establish formal linkages with other local women groups for networking and
advocacy on local specific gender issues.
(3)   Establish   community     based  Adolescent Reproductive Health         Counselling
Centre (See chart "Communitv Based Reproductive Health Servicesfor Young People "for details).
Establish adolescent girls and boys groups for:
a)    Peer educators on gender and RH rights: Sensitise girls and boys selected
from Dalit and Janajati communities on leadership and information on basic
health issues and RH issues
b)    Life skills based training to

c)    Motivators   in   vulnerable  communities    for   improving   health-seeking
behaviour
d)    Providing information to vulnerable communities
(4)   Orientation of SHPMC on gender, reproductive health and sexual rights of
women and girls.
To reduce gender inequality, men and women positions of authority require
orientation on the gender dimensions of health. Health professional in particular
need to be sensitised on the social and non-biological aspects of health. Orientation
should include:
a)    Understanding how different gender and socio-cultural factors impact women
and girls health.
b)    The consequences of women and girls gender roles and socio-cultural belief
and practices on access, participation and decision-making regarding their
health.
c)    Conceptual clarity and tools to address reproductive and sexual rights of girls
and women and the violations of these rights (violence and abuse, forced sex
and pregnancies, denial of access to information and services)
(5)   Training to local Dalits and Janajati women and adolescent girls through PLA
as part of the NFE programme. Given the strong linkage between women
education, increased family planning and child survival, women and girls from
vulnerable communities should be enrolled in NFE classes through a special grant.
Curricular would focus on reproductive health issues and gender linkages with
education are essential for cross-sectoral linkages.
(6)   Social audit64 of funds and activities to enable community members to be more
informed on:
*     Access of vulnerable households specially women and children            from
Janajati, Dalit families to services and special benefits
*     Discriminatory behaviour and practices by service providers, community
members to girls and women and members of Dalit families
*     use of grant funds from    VDC    and other special entitlements for Dalits,
Janajatis and women
*     review of decision-making process within SHPMC to ensure inclusion of
representatives from vulnerable households and their specific concerns.
(7)   Documentation of local traditional healing practices for curriculum       of health
workers: collect and document local information on the history and culture of
Dalits, Janajatis and linguistic minorities, specially their health related practices,
myths and belief patterns related to women and child health
(8)   Identification of local women volunteers from Dalit/Janajati groups: Assisting
SHPMCs to identify and recruit local women for access to information and services

64 Social audit is a framework which allows an organisation to build on existing documentation and reporting and develop a process
whereby it can account for its social performance, report on that performance and draw up an action plan to improve on that
performance, and through which it can understand its impact on the community and be accountable to its key stakeholders. The
essence of social auditing is therefore: accountingfor what we do and listening to what others have to say so thatfuture
performance can be more effectively targeted at achieving the chosen objectives. http://www.cbs-network.org.uk/socacaud.html

(9)  Community based Health Management Information System (CMIS): tracking
local specific health issues by gender, caste and ethnicity of children, adolescents
and women from socially marginalised communities. Child and Adolescent Clubs
would be particularly appropriate for carrying out baseline surveys.
(11) Advocacy against discriminatory practices: raising awareness and sensitising
health care providers, local bodies, school authorities, teachers and youth on social
inclusion issues and on national policies and directives for sanctions against
discriminatory behaviour and practices against girls and women and Dalits
/Janajatis seeking health services. Social audit by community-level groups would
identify gender based violence, discriminatory behaviour and practiced against
girls and women, Dalits and Janajatis by health service authorities, teachers and
community members.
These will be reported to the relevant grievance cell for action and then be
monitored for implementation by enforcing sanctions against discriminatory
practices and behaviour.
(12) Honouring good practices in social inclusion: acknowledge and honour local
bodies, health posts, teachers, students and others who have demonstrated initiative
and good practices in social inclusion in health services:
*    developing criteria for good practices and informing SHPMCs on selection
process
*    arranging for wide media coverage on honoured persons
(13) Set up local support group on gender based violence both with men and
adolescent boys on confronting all forms of violence against girls and women.
Initiate community based meetings at regular intervals to dialogue on:
*    Gender roles and socially prescribed practices and rules that support unequal
relationship between men and women, girls and boys
*    Orientation on gender and health- basic information on Pre and anti natal
care, child birth and fathers' role/support
*    Develop and introduce BCC on gender specific health consequences for
women and girls particularly:
*    All forms of violence
*    RH and sexuality
*    Labour
*    Access to health information
*    Decision making on health issues
*    Include men and boys in social mapping and audit, per educators for school
awareness programmes
*    Design male leadership campaign for promoting girls education and female
literacy through NFE using successful models of PLA
7.1.2 BCC in bilingual languages
The Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) of 1999 and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers
(PRSP) both empower local administration together with civil society, NGOs and relevant
ethnic and linguistic foundations, committees or commissions to support language and cultural
preservation activities. This VCDP takes the view that the responsibility for ensuring access of

non-Nepali speaking community members to the health services recognizes and celebrates
diversity should be shared between the state (central and local governments) and society.
In communities where a large minority/or majority speak another language:
(1)  Ensure that at least one sub health post staff is fluent in local language and
available to assist in communicating patients' health problems to health provider
and in communicating instructions from health providers to patients. If the
language has a script ensure that signs and key health communication materials are
available in that script.
(2)  develop the necessary training modules in the use of local languages to support
BCC through bilingual medium of instruction to increase sensitivity to culture,
language health practices and specific issues related to health of indigenous people,
(3)  identify and accredit national and local NGOS to deliver these modules and
(4)  bring multilingual, multi ethnic and multi cultural representation in all BCC
materials
(5)  Ensure reaching these campaigns to all socially excluded Janajatis and Dalits
particularly women
(6)  Provide funding these organisations to go to districts to train local health workers
where communities have demand for bilingual instruction.
Civil society, non-governmental organisations and local government would have the
responsibility to work together to develop modules based on local languages and cultures for the
community to use. While the State is therefore involved in the formation of an inclusive and
equitable national health policy, society must configure this in a locally meaningful way and
take charge of the culturally sensitive fine-tuning and the successful implementation at a
community level.
(1)  Collecting and documenting information on their own history and culture for
use in the National training curriculum and text books of health staff at all
levels. It is suggested that the National Dalit Commission or the National
Federation of Nationalities (Nepal Janajati Mahasangh) be provided with some
funds to enable them to make modest grants to communities wishing to do this.
7.1.3 HMIS disaggregated data
(1)  Health Management Information System (HMIS) must collect data disaggregated
by gender, age, disability, caste (Dalit/non-Dalit) and ethnicity (Janajati/non-
Janajati). At the sub-health post level, there may be a need for a more detailed
classification of categories. These can be aggregated into user-friendly key
categories for the reporting mechanisms.
(2)  Use HMIS data collected by local groups under Moue with SHPMCs for baseline
information in the collection of disaggregated data.
(3)  Public private partnership: Partner with philanthropic association and business
houses to support sub health post/PHCC for drugs and facility
