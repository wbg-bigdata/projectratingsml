I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The development objective of the project is to provide a reliable, affordable and sustainable water supply service
and improve the sewerage and sanitation services in area served by the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority
(DAWASA) that includes Dar es Salaam and part of the Coast region . This will help improve public health and
well being in a city prone to cholera outbreaks or other water borne diseases and support productive activities of the
country's main economic centre. This will be achieved by
*   Rehabilitating existing DAWASA drinking water production, transmission, storage and distribution facilities
and waste water collection and treatment facilities that have lacked maintenance over the years;
*   Extending piped water supply service to unserved areas through a balanced program of construction of primary
and secondary distribution pipes and implementation of a commercial policy that will favor connections of
households;
*   Upgrading DAWASA commercial operations to industry standards, reducing physical and commercial
unaccounted for water (UfW) and increasing collection of water and sewerage bills through the sub-contracting
of operations to a private "Operator"; and
*   Enhancing DAWASA financial situation by raising the Customer Tariff to a level that would initially cover
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, service long term debt and contribute to the capital expenditure
program and eventually compare with the Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of the service
I.A.3. Project Description:
Component 1: Rehabilitation and Extension of Water Supply Facilities. This component will include: (a) a
"Priority Work Program" focusing on the urgent rehabilitation of production units and transmission lines; (b) a
"Non-Delegated Work Program" focusing on the full rehabilitation of the three water production units, the two
transmission lines, rehabilitation of two main reservoirs and construction of a new 5000 m reservoir, and

rehabilitation of the main distribution network; (c) a "Delegated Work Program" focusing on the rehabilitation and
extension of secondary distribution pipes and connections (including the construction of about 900 km of small
diameter pipes, the rehabilitation of about 135,000 connections and the construction of 35,000 new connections), (d)
the "Supply of 173,000 Meters"; and (e) construction supervision. DAWASA will be fully responsible for
implementing sub-component (b); DAWASA has already awarded the construction and supply contracts for
sub-components (a) and (d) to the Operator; the Operator will, under its Lease Contract be responsible for
implementing sub-component (c) as project manager on behalf of DAWASA. DAWASA is currently selecting the
construction supervision consultant (CSC) so that it mobilizes soon after effectiveness.

Component 2: Rehabilitation and Extension of Wastewater Facilities. This component will include: (a) the
rehabilitation of 140 km of existing sewers, 3,100 manholes, 15 waste water pumping stations, nine waste water
stabilization ponds and an existing ocean outfall; and (b) the construction of 26 km of new sewers All construction
activities will be supervised by the CSC This component will be fully implemented by DAWASA as part of the
"Non Delegated Work Program".
Component 3: Community Water Supply and Sanitation Program. This component, aiming at providing a
minimum service to low income communities that may not immediately benefit from the piped water network, will
include the construction of about 50 sub-projects, such as schemes based on point sources, community piped water
supply systems relying on a bulk supply from the main network or stand alone systems; and on-site sanitation
facilities; it will also include community management training and hygiene promotion. This component will be
implemented by DAWASA with the assistance of specialized NGOs.
Component 4: Institutional Strengthening. This component will support all activities associated with the
improvement of the operation of the WSS service and includes: (a) financial assistance to the Operator to help
finance start-up activities, (b) technical assistance to DAWASA: engineering, financial, legal, assets revaluation,
audits, communication, environmental monitoring and activities aimed at prevention of HIV/AIDS; (c) training of
DAWASA and MWLD staff; (d) transitional expenses and supply of operational equipment; and (e) technical
assistance to the Wami/Ruvu Basin Agency. DAWASA will implement all components. MWLD will have oversight
over sub-component (e)
Component 5: Preparation of the Medium Term WSS Development Program. This component, aiming at
preparing the medium term water supply and sanitation extension program, will support the preparation of (a)
studies for the selection of the future raw water source for Dar es Salaam, in association with a comprehensive
regional environmental assessment; (b) an assessment of the ground water capacity in the Dar es Salaam vicinity; (c)
feasibilities studies of the extension of the water production, transmission and distribution systems; and (d) a
strategic sanitation plan
I.A.4 Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas )
Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, is a coastal city built on a low lying plain with relatively uniform
relief. It is the largest and most important commercial and industrial centre in Tanzania. The city
contributes about 18% to the National Gross Domestic Product. The population of Dar es Salaam is
currently estimated at about 2.5 million with a growth rate of about 4.3 %. The water supply service area
also exends to the coastal towns of Bagamoyo and Kibaha. The water supply is largely from two
abstraction and treatment works along the Ruvu river. Less that 10 percent of the city is sewered. The
ensuing sewage from the limited network is disposed of in nine stabilization ponds into the ocean through
a marine outfall. The septage from numerous septic tanks and pit latrines in the city is also treated in the
9 stabilization ponds before discharge into receiving waters at various points in the city. The city does
not encompass any protected areas or sites or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments No major irreversible environmental impacts identified or suspected in the project.
The proposed project has been reviewed, screened and designated for Category B consistent with the
provisions of OP/BP/GP 4 01. The project will have a significant positive impact on people's health
and the quality of their lives. There are no major negative social or environmental issues involved.
Impacts and mitigation measures will be site specific. The quality of water sources must be checked to



4
ISDS
confirm water quality standards are met. Water sources must be protected, wastewater disposed of
properly, and individuals compensated for lost property, crops and other means of income generation as a
result of the construction of water supply and sanitation facilities. There are not expected to be issues related to
indigenous people or cultural heritage The project will not have a significant impact on international
waterways.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. I a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Environment
The advanced stage of disrepair of water supply and waste water facilities causes extensive pollution and
health hazards. Currently water quality in the water mains is suspect due to the numerous leakages in the
system. Septage and sludge arising from the sewer network, septic tanks and the numerous pit latrines do
not receive adequate treatment. The project is thus basically a rehabilitation project. Nevertheless, the
two potential safeguard issues identified during the EA centered around (i) excessive abstraction of bulk
water supply and (ii) impacts associated with the rehabilitation and construction activities
Social
Four social safeguard issue were identified during the preparation of the project. These were (i) potential
retrenchment of DAWASA sfaff, (ii) ressettlement of families illegally installed on transmission lines,
(iii) potential disconnection of illegal users along the transmission lines and (iv) affordability of water
and sanitation services by the poorer segments of the city. The issues are not seen as having long-term
irreversible negative impact but nevertheless need to be addressed to provide comfort to affected
families. The extent of the problem and mitigation measures are presented below.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Not Applicable

ISDS
Il.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No potential long term impacts envisaged.
II.D.2. In light of ], describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
The project's overall objective is not only to improve the provision of water, but also to improve
environment, social and health conditions. Extensive reflection of the most rational altematives were
discussed during the environmental and social assessment as well as during the preparation of the
resettlement framework paper. All alternatives considered pointed to the need for urgency in the
implementation of the rehabilitation program to ensure that residents benefit from the positive impacts of
clean drinking water and environmental protection but to carry out the massive rehabilitation in a
structure manner to mitigated short term shocks to affected families and disruption in peoples order of
life.
Il.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
*   Bulk Water Supply Regulation of the Ruvu river, Dar es Salaam main source of water, is being considered to
support low flows during the dry season. The project will not include any regulation works, but rather include
an environmental assessment of their potential impact, as part of a regional EA of the Ruvu river watershed and
of the Dar es Salaam water distribution area and coastal offshore area. Three main alternatives are currently
being considered: bunded reservoirs located close to the treatment plants, the Kidunda dam and the Ngerengere
and Mgeta dams; another alternative considers a transfer from the Rufiji basin.
*   Construction - Water Supply: The project will include works to dispose sludge of the Ruvu water treatment
plants in an environmentally safe way and to secure proper drainage at all public water distribution outlets.
Waste Water The project will rehabilitate and upgrade sewers and stabilization ponds as well as the ocean
outfall, adding 100 meters to its present length. The project will also include works for safe disposal of sludge
from the stabilization ponds. The project will not rehabilitate the existing landfill site. The Dar es Salaam City
Council plans to commission a new site that meets the desired public health and environmental standards with
bilateral assistance The project will finally monitor the rehabilitated waste water systems to avoid renewed
deterioration. During construction, safety equipment will be provided, and people safeguarded near work sites to
avoid accidents and temporary pollution damages
*   Redeployment of existing DA WASA staff. The 1,500 existing DAWASA employees will be employed by
either DAWASA or the Operator. The selected IPP has indicated that the Operator it will become the majority
shareholder of will not retrench any staff; some of the staff would however be reassigned to sub-contractors
employed for construction activities Consultation with representatives of DAWASA staff took place prior to
appraisal; GOT, the Operator and DAWASA staff have agreed on the selection and reassignment procedures,
*   Resettlement offamilies illegally settled on tlre transmission lines. Over the years, DAWASA did not prevent
illegal construction in the rights of way of its two transmission lines, in particular in the downstream part of the
Upper Ruvu line. Illegal constructions also exist very close to the perimeter of stabilization ponds. While this
has not created a major problem so far, it may be expected that the Operator will request DAWASA to ensure
that access to key equipment of the pipes (wash-out, air valves) is guaranteed to perform routine maintenance
tasks. Resettlement is expected mostly from improved operations rather than from construction activities and
therefore will be limited. Due to the large nature of the construction program, a Resettlement Framework Paper
(RFP) prepared by DAWASA allows an annual assessment of the construction program, the identification of
affected families, the preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan and the payment of eligible compensation, if
need be, before construction is initiated The DAWASA Resettlement Framework Paper has been reviewed by
the Bank, found acceptable and will be publicly disclosed;
*   Disconnection of illegal users along the transmission line. Offtakes along the transmission lines contributes to
the reducing the quantity of water available at Dar es Salaam main reservoirs. Leaks and offtakes accounts for
possibly up to 40% of the production at the treatment plants; DAWASA is already rationalizing connections on
transmission lines under the ongoing USRP. The Operator is likely to disconnect customers using drinking



6
ISDS
water for irrigation purposes DAWASA will offer them an alternative by helping them to develop their own
water supply system under the Community WSS component,
*   Affordability of thie WSS service by low income households. The project will support implementation of a tariff
structure that will allow small domestic customers to connect to piped water (if a distribution pipe exists nearby)
at low cost the social connections will be financed by the Connection Fund replenished by a surcharge on the
Customer Tariff. Beneficiaries will be required to pay a deposit of Tsh 20,000 (US$21) and receive a free
connection valued at an average Tshl45,000 (US$150). The tariff structure will also provide for a lower
Customer Tariff for the first 5m3/month (Tsh322/m3 equivalent to the Operator Tariff), the usually accepted
lifeline consumption in African cities. Finally the Community WSS component, to be implemented with
assistance from specialized NGOs, will provide financial assistance to communities that cannot be served by
piped water to develop their own supplies;
* Oliter Affected Groups Providers of substitutes to piped water, such as small water vendors or larger tankers
will see their business reduced as a result of an improved public WSS; they will only gradually be affected since
improvement will not happen overnight. Illegal users of the WSS service (illegal offtakers on the transmission
lines or on the distribution network or bad payers) or illegal providers of service (artisans building illegal
connections) will also be affected by the project whose main objective is to institute rational operation and
discipline.
*   Monitoring: DAWASA will employ a full time environmental supervisor to supervise the environmental
performance of DAWASA and the Operator. The environmental supervisor will monitor the implementation
and functioning of the rehabilitated systems, and he/she will also establish and maintain a regular reporting
system and a data base.
II D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
During project preparation, GOT and DAWASA carried out a consultation of key stakeholders affected by the
project. DAWASA main challenge is now to carefully manage expectations that may be high after a very long
preparation period; obviously the quality of the WSS service cannot improve overnight with the mobilization of the
Operator. Minutes of meetings with the following groups highlights the project features that take valid concerns into
account. (a) DAWASA staff; (b) households that could potentially be resettled along the transmission lines and near
the stabilization ponds; (c) environmental groups; (d) water tankers and water vendors; (e) commercial customers; (f)
institutional customers; (g) representatives of domestic customers, (h) current customers along the transmission lines,
(i) NGOs; and (j) the media. During project implementation, EWURA will be mostly responsible for sharing
information with the public at large and channelling customer concerns to DAWASA and the Operator EWURA
will issue an annual report on the execution of the Development, Lease and Customer Contracts based, in particular,
on informal or structured stakeholder surveys
NGOs have been associated with the design and will be engaged as advisors for the implementation of the CWSS
component. NGOs were also consulted on the EA and offered significant inputs to the design of aspects of the
project during the stakeholder assessment NGOs will also be consulted by EWURA during informal or structured
surveys to be carried out in low income communities on evolution of the quality of service and WSS budget of
households
The National Environmental Management Council (NEMC) and various groups concerned with environmental and
other safeguard issues have been consulted and their comments have been incorporated in the final EA, EMP as well
as the Resettlement Framework Paper. These documents will be publicly disclosed in leading English and Swahili
newspapers in Tanzania, copies will be available in MWLD, the offices of the participating Dar es Salaam City
Council, the National Library, the library of the University of Dar es Salaam and NEMC offices. For the potentially
affected people, detailed arrangements have been set out in the RPF which include specific disclosure measures and
compensation arrangements. These provisions and arrangements will be shared with the potentially affected people
in a medium and language that they understand.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, is a coastal city built on a low lying plain with relatively uniform
relief. It is the largest and most important commercial and industrial centre in Tanzania. The city
contributes about 18% to the National Gross Domestic Product The population of Dar es Salaam is
currently estimated at about 2.5 million with a growth rate of about 4.3 %. The water supply service area
also exends to the coastal towns of Bagamoyo and Kibaha. The water supply is largely from two
abstraction and treatment works along the Ruvu river. Less that 10 percent of the city is sewered. The
ensuing sewage from the limited network is disposed of in nine stabilization ponds into the ocean through
a marine outfall. The septage from numerous septic tanks and pit latrines in the city is also treated in the
9 stabilization ponds before discharge into receiving waters at various points in the city. The city does
not encompass any protected areas or sites or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: No major irreversible environmental impacts identified or suspected in the project.
The proposed project has been reviewed, screened and designated for Category B consistent with the
provisions of OP/BP/GP 4.01. The project will have a significant positive impact on people's health
and the quality of their lives. There are no major negative social or environmental issues involved
Impacts and mitigation measures will be site specific The quality of water sources must be checked to

ISDS
confirm water quality standards are met. Water sources must be protected, wastewater disposed of
properly, and individuals compensated for lost property, crops and other means of income generation as a
result of the construction of water supply and sanitation facilities There are not expected to be issues related to
indigenous people or cultural heritage. The project will not have a significant impact on international
waterways

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Environment
The advanced stage of disrepair of water supply and waste water facilities causes extensive pollution and
health hazards. Currently water quality in the water mains is suspect due to the numerous leakages in the
system. Septage and sludge arising from the sewer network, septic tanks and the numerous pit latrines do
not receive adequate treatment. The project is thus basically a rehabilitation project. Nevertheless, the
two potential safeguard issues identified during the EA centered around (i) excessive abstraction of bulk
water supply and (ii) impacts associated with the rehabilitation and construction activities.
Social
Four social safeguard issue were identified during the preparation of the project. These were (i) potential
retrenchment of DAWASA sfaff, (ii) ressettlement of families illegally installed on transmission lines,
(iii) potential disconnection of illegal users along the transmission lines and (iv) affordability of water
and sanitation services by the poorer segments of the city. The issues are not seen as having long-term
irreversible negative impact but nevertheless need to be addressed to provide comfort to affected
families. The extent of the problem and mitigation measures are presented below.
II.D.lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

ISDS
II.D I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No potential long term impacts envisaged.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
The project's overall objective is not only to improve the provision of water, but also to improve
environment, social and health conditions Extensive reflection of the most rational alternatives were
discussed during the environmental and social assessment as well as during the preparation of the
resettlement framework paper. All alternatives considered pointed to the need for urgency in the
implementation of the rehabilitation program to ensure that residents benefit from the positive impacts of
clean drinking water and environmental protection but to carry out the massive rehabilitation in a
structure manner to mitigated short term shocks to affected families and disruption in peoples order of
life.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
*   Bulk Water Supply Regulation of the Ruvu river, Dar es Salaam main source of water, is being considered to
support low flows during the dry season The project will not include any regulation works, but rather include
an environmental assessment of their potential impact, as part of a regional EA of the Ruvu river watershed and
of the Dar es Salaam water distribution area and coastal offshore area. Three main alternatives are currently
being considered: bunded reservoirs located close to the treatment plants, the Kidunda dam and the Ngerengere
and Mgeta dams; another alternative considers a transfer from the Rufiji basin.
*   Construction - Water Supply: The project will include works to dispose sludge of the Ruvu water treatment
plants in an environmentally safe way and to secure proper drainage at all public water distribution outlets.
Waste Water: The project will rehabilitate and upgrade sewers and stabilization ponds as well as the ocean
outfall, adding 100 meters to its present length. The project will also include works for safe disposal of sludge
from the stabilization ponds. The project will not rehabilitate the existing landfill site. The Dar es Salaam City
Council plans to commission a new site that meets the desired public health and environmental standards with
bilateral assistance. The project will finally monitor the rehabilitated waste water systems to avoid renewed
deterioration. During construction, safety equipment will be provided, and people safeguarded near work sites to
avoid accidents and temporary pollution damages.
*   Redeployment of existing DA WASA staff The 1,500 existing DAWASA employees will be employed by
either DAWASA or the Operator The selected IPP has indicated that the Operator it will become the majority
shareholder of will not retrench any staff, some of the staff would however be reassigned to sub-contractors
employed for construction activities. Consultation with representatives of DAWASA staff took place prior to
appraisal; GOT, the Operator and DAWASA staff have agreed on the selection and reassignment procedures;
* Resettlement offamilies illegally settled on thle transmission lines Over the years, DAWASA did not prevent
illegal construction in the rights of way of its two transmission lines, in particular in the downstream part of the
Upper Ruvu line. Illegal constructions also exist very close to the perimeter of stabilization ponds. While this
has not created a major problem so far, it may be expected that the Operator will request DAWASA to ensure
that access to key equipment of the pipes (wash-out, air valves) is guaranteed to perform routine maintenance
tasks. Resettlement is expected mostly from improved operations rather than from construction activities and
therefore will be limited. Due to the large nature of the construction program, a Resettlement Framework Paper
(RFP) prepared by DAWASA allows an annual assessment of the construction program, the identification of
affected families, the preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan and the payment of eligible compensation, if
need be, before construction is initiated The DAWASA Resettlement Framework Paper has been reviewed by
the Bank, found acceptable and will be publicly disclosed;
*   Disconnection of illegal users along the transmission line. Offtakes along the transmission lines contributes to
the reducing the quantity of water available at Dar es Salaam main reservoirs. Leaks and offtakes accounts for
possibly up to 40% of the production at the treatment plants; DAWASA is already rationalizing connections on
transmission lines under the ongoing USRP. The Operator is likely to disconnect customers using drinking



6
ISDS
water for irrigation purposes. DAWASA will offer them an alternative by helping them to develop their own
water supply system under the Community WSS component;
*   Affordability of the WSS service by low income houselholds The project will support implementation of a tariff
structure that will allow small domestic customers to connect to piped water (if a distribution pipe exists nearby)
at low cost the social connections will be financed by the Connection Fund replenished by a surcharge on the
Customer Tariff Beneficiaries will be required to pay a deposit of Tsh 20,000 (US$21) and receive a free
connection valued at an average Tsh145,000 (US$150) The tariff structure will also provide for a lower
Customer Tariff for the first 5m3/month (Tsh322/m3 equivalent to the Operator Tariff), the usually accepted
lifeline consumption in African cities. Finally the Community WSS component, to be implemented with
assistance from specialized NGOs, will provide financial assistance to communities that cannot be served by
piped water to develop their own supplies;
*   Otiher Affected Groups. Providers of substitutes to piped water, such as small water vendors or larger tankers
will see their business reduced as a result of an improved public WSS, they will only gradually be affected since
improvement will not happen overnight. Illegal users of the WSS service (illegal offtakers on the transmission
lines or on the distribution network or bad payers) or illegal providers of service (artisans building illegal
connections) will also be affected by the project whose main objective is to institute rational operation and
discipline
*   Monitoring: DAWASA will employ a full time environmental supervisor to supervise the environmental
performance of DAWASA and the Operator. The environmental supervisor will monitor the implementation
and functioning of the rehabilitated systems, and he/she will also establish and maintain a regular reporting
system and a data base.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
During project preparation, GOT and DAWASA carried out a consultation of key stakeholders affected by the
project. DAWASA main challenge is now to carefully manage expectations that may be high after a very long
preparation period; obviously the quality of the WSS service cannot improve overnight with the mobilization of the
Operator. Minutes of meetings with the following groups highlights the project features that take valid concerns into
account (a) DAWASA staff; (b) households that could potentially be resettled along the transmission lines and near
the stabilization ponds; (c) environmental groups; (d) water tankers and water vendors; (e) commercial customers, (f)
institutional customers; (g) representatives of domestic customers, (h) current customers along the transmission lines;
(i) NGOs, and (1) the media During project implementation, EWURA will be mostly responsible for sharing
information with the public at large and channelling customer concerns to DAWASA and the Operator. EWURA
will issue an annual report on the execution of the Development, Lease and Customer Contracts based, in particular,
on informal or structured stakeholder surveys.
NGOs have been associated with the design and will be engaged as advisors for the implementation of the CWSS
component. NGOs were also consulted on the EA and offered significant inputs to the design of aspects of the
project during the stakeholder assessment. NGOs will also be consulted by EWURA during informal or structured
surveys to be carried out in low income communities on evolution of the quality of service and WSS budget of
households.
The National Environmental Management Council (NEMC) and various groups concerned with environmental and
other safeguard issues have been consulted and their comments have been incorporated in the final EA, EMP as well
as the Resettlement Framework Paper These documents will be publicly disclosed in leading English and SwahilI
newspapers in Tanzania; copies will be available in MWLD, the offices of the participating Dar es Salaam City
Council, the National Library, the library of the University of Dar es Salaam and NEMC offices. For the potentially
affected people, detailed arrangements have been set out in the RPF which include specific disclosure measures and
compensation arrangements. These provisions and arrangements will be shared with the potentially affected people
in a medium and language that they understand.
