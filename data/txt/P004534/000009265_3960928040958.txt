MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON THREE PROPOSED LOANS,
ONE LOAN TO THE NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION,
A SECOND LOAN TO THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY,
BOTH LOANS BEING GUARANTEED BY THE REPUBLIC OF
THE PHILIPPINES, AND A THIRD LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR AN
ENERGY SECTOR PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on three proposed loans
for an aggregate of US$390 million is submitted for approval. The proposed
loans would be extended respectivelv to the National Power Corporation (NPC)
in the amount of US$200 million, the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) in
the amount of US$150 million and the Republic of the Philippines in the amount
of US$40 million, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with 20 years'
maturity including five years of grace. The Republic of the Philippines will
guarantee the loans to NPC and PNOC. The NPC loan, together with a US$150
million equivalent parallel financing arrangement from the Export-Import Bank
of Japan (Eximbank), will finance investments in the power sector. PNOC will
onlend to its subsidiaries, the Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC), and
PETRON Corporation (PETRON), US$147 million, and the balance of US$3 million
will be used by PNOC itself on institutional strengthening. The loan to the
Republic will be allocated to the Office of Energy Affairs (OEA), Energy
Regulatory Board (ERB), and the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) in the
form of budgetary support, and to the National Electrification Administration
(NEA) in the form of equity contribution.
2.       Background.  The Philippine economy is going through a major
restructuring and reorientation. During the 1970s, economic growth was rapid
but distortions in the incentive systems produced inefficient patterns of
investment, slow growth in employment, high rates of inflation and low levels
of domestic savings. Heavily dependent on imports and foreign capital, the
economy did not adjust well Lo the external shocks of the Post-1979 period and
experienced declining growth rates, a deteriorating balance of payments and a
large accunmulation of external debt. Political instability and a global
recession led to a payment crisis, forcing the Government to embark on a major
stabilization effort in 1983. Overall, the stabilization program has been
successful and has provided a basis for a healthy recovery, starting with
impressive growth rates of 5.7% and 7.OZ for 1987 and 1988, respectively, and
a good outlook for continued growth over the next several years.
3.       The energy sector faces a number of challenges as the country
refocuses its efforts on sustained economic growth. First, energy demand,
which had consistently declined during 1979-85, has erperienced a growth of
about 40% during 1986-88; this indicates an immediate need for the expansion
of energy supply capabilities, particularly power generating capacity.
Second, the productive capacity of the energy sector, which was adversely
affected by the limitations imposed by the stabilization program on investment
and maintenance expenditures, was further reduced by a Government decision in
1986 to mothball the 620 MW nuclear power plant.  Third, erratically



- 2 -
fluctuating international energy prices have introduced considerable
uncertainty regarding the economics of domestic energy and the development
policy of the energy sector. Fourth, the Government's decision in 1986 to
abolish the Ministry of Energy has substantially weakened the coordination of
energy sector activities, and, tn particular, has created a bottleneck in
planning and timely implementation of development, pricing and operations
decisions.
4.       To assist the Government in addressing these issues, the Bank carried
out an Energy Sector Study in 1988, which concluded, inter alia, that the
country should redirect its energy strategy toward rapid development of
geothermal resources. The study also developed specific recommendations
regarding investment, pricing, finance, operational efficiency and sector
coordination. The Government is now seeking the Bank's assistance to
implement an action program aimed at pursuing these recommendations e.s well as
further policies in privatization, energy regu.ation, energy demand management
and environmental monitoring of the energy sector.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The energy sector, especially the
power subsector, is viewed as a key bottleneck to sustaining the economic
recovery, begun in the last two years. The sector impinges on economic
growth in three ways: first, the present generating capacity is insufficient
to meet increasing electricity demand; second, the sector is so capital-
intensive that it is likely to drain a large portion of the economy's
resources; and third, the high cost of energy in the Philippines adversely
affects the international competitiveness of the country's industrial sector.
Therefore, a comprehensive plan to develop productive capacity while
increasing the efficiency of resource allocation, utilization and mobilization
is crucial to the sector. The changes agreed under the proposed project are
fundamental in nature and wide ranging in scope. These qualitative changes
will help create an environment for optimizing returns on investment in the
energy sector. Further, through its past operational involvement and in the
course of preparing the Energy Sector Study, the Bank has developed a
constructive relationship with various sector entities which has been
important in facilitating coordination among them. Consequently, the Govern-
ment, with the assistance of the Bank, prepared a comprehensive statement of
its strategy in developing the country's energy supply with due regard to
strengthening the technical capabilities of the sector entities, fuller
development of domestic resources, increasing efficiency and improving
competitiveness within the energy sector. The policy component of this
strategy, which has been translated into a detailed action plan (SAR,
Annex 3.2), fits well into the Bank's overall strategy for the country for
revitalizing economic growth and improving the efficiency of public
corporations. The investment component of the strategy supports the Govern-
ment's macro-economic objectives by providing much needed investment funds in
order to meet the increasing energy needs for economic recovery.
6.       Project Objective, Description and Implementation.  The proposed
project would help finance the first phase of a reoriented development
strategy for the Philippines energy sector aimed at minimizing the cost of
energy supply. The components of this strategy are: (a) a least-cost
investment program wnich has been agreed upon by all participating agencies;



- 3 -
(b) development of a sector-wide capability to plan and coordinate policy and
project implementation in the energy sector; (c) encouragement of private
sector participation through joint-ventures, build-operate-and-transfer
schemes, etc.; (d) consolidation of regulatory activities into an integrated
system for monitoring the quality of service and consumer prices of petroleum,
coal and electricity; (e) implementation of long-run marginal cost pricing for
electricity; (f) development of technical capabilities to assess, manage and
monitor the environmental impact of energy projects; and (g) implementation of
measures to improve operational efficiency of the power sector by reducing
electricity losses and rehabilitating aging plants.
7.       The proiect would comprise components from the least cost investment
program for the 1989-93 period, including: (a) NPC's investments in
generation and transmission amounting to US$2,722 million; (b) PNOC's
investments in geothermal resource appraisal arnd development, and debottle-
necking of refinery facilities amounting to US$741 million; (c) a US$26
million component of the National Electrification Administration's (NEA)
rehabilitation and loss reduction program; and (d) the institutional
strengthening programs of the Office of Energy Affairs (OEA), the Energy
Regulatory Board (ERB) and the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB). The
total investment program which would qualify for partial financing under the
sector project is US$3,509 million, of which the foreign cost component is
about US$2,455 million. In order for the pa:rticipating agencies to utilize
effectively other sources of financing, flexibility has been provided to
revise the list of investments to be financed by the loan on an annual basis,
from within the overall agreed sector investment program and to seek optional
financing packages while pursuing Bank's ptocurement guidelines. The World
Bank and Eximbank loans to NPC and the World Bank loan to PNOC may also be
utilized to finance the shares of NPC and PNOC in investments in joint
ventures and other schemes with the privatf sector provided that Bank procure-
ment guidelines are followed. Retroactive financing up to US$23 million is
recommended to cover expenditures on eligible goods and services incurred
after April 30, 1989. OEA would supervise the timely implementation of the
development strategy and consolidate the monitoring activities of the invest-
ment program. A Project Implementation Committee, with members from all
participating agencies, will be established to monitor the implementation of
project components. Components, notably from PNOC and NPC investment programs
and totalling around US$100 million, are already at an advanced stage of
design and bidding preparation.
8.       A breakdown of the project costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and Lhe
disbursement schedule are sho-.n in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps are attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8049-PH, is being distributed separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements and understandings
were reached that: (a) the Government will implement the proposed energy
policy and its corresponding action plans according to a schedule agreed with
the Bank; (b) NPC and PNOC will conduct, in consultation with the Bank, an
annual review and update of their investment plans for the forthcoming year



- 4 -
and the following four years; (c) NPC will implement no later than December
31, 1990 the first phase of a marginal-cost pricing system; (d) NPC and PNOC
will maintain catisfactory financial performance in accordance with the
financial covenants agreed with the Bank; (e) no later than June 30, 1990, NPC
and PNOC will prepare training programs for their staff in engineering,
operations and maintenance, and management; and (f) PNOC will appoint
independent international consultanto to assist in geothermal assessment and
implementation of the petroleum component of the proposed project. During
negotiations, the Government confirmed the understanding that to improve
environmental assessment of energy projects, the Department of Environmental
and Natural Resources will be invited to provide input at an early stage of
project preparation. The Government confirmed also the understanding that a
Project Implementation Committee will be established prior to the date of loan
effectiveness.
10.      Environment.  All investments financed under the project will be
eyscuted with due concern for their environmental impact. Environmental
impact assessment reports will be prepared by the implementing agencies for
each subproject after the completion of the feasibility study and prior to
design and bidding preparation. The Bank will review each environmental
impact study before agreeing to the use of IBRD resources for the
corresponding subproject. The subsequent compliance certificate to be issued
by EMB on completion of each subproject will also be reviewed by the Bank. In
addition, the project would assist the Government in (a) rationalizing
environmental monitoring activities by establishing clear roles for NPC, PNOC
and the newly formed EMB; and (b) strengthening the institutional and
technical capabilities of the EMB to carry out its monitoring tasks. The Bank
is expected to play a major role in the design and implementstion of the
streamllned environmental monitoring system by reviewing the current practices
and assisting the Government to establish a coherent program of action.
Benefits
11.      Risks.  The project provides for development of 610 MW of geothermal
resources, 1,650 MW of power generating capacity and substantial expansions in
transmission and distribution systems during 1989-93. The physical risks in
the achievement of this capacity is small, limited to the low probability that
the steam reserves in the Luzon fields to be commissioned during this period
could turn out to be smaller, after field appraisal, than presently estimated
on available geoscientific data. However, there are two areas of concern
regarding the implementation of the project and disbursement of the loans.
First, there is an overall concern with regard to the implementation
capability of various agencies in view of the fact that most of the agencies
have not had significant investment projects during the last five years; this
risk has been minimized by careful preparation of implementation schedules,
creation of a Project Implementation Committee and a plan for project super-
vision by the Bank. Sezond, there is some uncertainty with regard to the
availability of other scurces of financing and therefore with regard to the
disbursement schedule of the loan. By design, the proposed mode of operation
provides that for certain items the beneficiaries may search for other
sources of financing while minimizing the cost by using International
Competitive Bidding. As a result, the Bank loan may be disbursed more slowly



- 5 -
or faster than scheduled depending on the availability of other financing
sources.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loans.
