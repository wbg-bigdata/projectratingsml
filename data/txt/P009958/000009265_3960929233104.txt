MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL AND FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN/CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR Au AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - TAMIL NAQU
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Loan of US$20
million equivalent and Credit of SDR 64.1 million (US$92.8 million equivalent)
to India is submitted for approval. The Loan would be for 20 years, including
a five-year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The
Credit would be on standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity. The Loan and
Credit would help finance an agricultural development project in the State of
Tamil Nadu. The proceeds of the Loan/Credit would be passed by the Government
of India (GOI) to the Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) in accordance with its
standard arrangements for developmental assistance to the states. GOI would
assume the foreign exchange risk.
2.    Bankground.  Tamil Nadu, situated in south-east India, has an area of
130,000 km2 and a population of about 50 million. About 60% of the population
are rural, and 40% live below the poverty line. Agriculture accounts for 30%
of state GDP, and employs 60% of the labor force. Geographically, the State
is bounded to the north by the state of Andhra Pradesh and to the West by the
states of Karnataka and Kerala. Rainfall is erratic and averages about 945
mm. Soils are suitable for a large variety of crops. About 5.8 million ha
are cultivated with an average cropping intensity of 115% (total cropped area
is 6.7 million ha), The remaining land is in forests and tree crops (2.4
million ha), and fallow and wasteland (3.0 million ha). Irrigation covers 2.4
million ha, with the total cropped area under irrigation being 3.2 million ha.
About 80% of farm holdings have less than 2 ha, and they are often fragmented.
The main crops are paddy (2.4 million ha), millet and sorghum (1.6 million
ha), oil crops (1.1 million ha), and pulses (0.6 million ha). Since the
1960s, yields have almost doubled for paddy and cotton, but increases have
been much less impressive for rainfed crops. Production of food grains since
1970 has expanded more slowly than the population, and in drought years grains
have been imported from other states. With the shrinking per capita
availability of land and water, future crop production increases will have to
come from higher yields in both irrigated and rainfed areas, through improved
technologies including better use of land and water. Livestock are an
integral part of the state's farming systems, with about 10 million cattle,
3.2 million buffalos and 11 million sheep and goats.  Further increases in
milk production will have to come from improved breeds, and better nutrition
and health care. About 600,000 ha of forest reserves are degraded and need
protection and rehabilitation.
3.    Within the Secretariat of Agriculture, the Directorate of Agriculture
(DOA) has overall responsibility for extension on food crops (mainly cereals),
seed production and training; the Department of Horticulture has
responsibility for horticulture activities including horticultural extension;
and the Department of Oilseeds has responsibility for oilseed activities, also
including extension. The separate extension services by each of these
agencies causes unnecessary duplication. To render the service more
effective, the project would consolidate and broaden the base of extension
advice. The Secretary of Agriculture, who is also the Agriculture Production
Commissioner (APC), coordinates the state's agricultural activities and allied
services across directorates and departments. Allied services include animal



husbandry and forestry. Agricultural research and education are the
responsibility of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.
4.    Five-year and annual plans for agriculture are prepared by the State
Planning Commission of the Department of Planning and Development, in
consultation with DOA. The plans are consistent with national production
goals and the availability of funds. Supporting economic analysis and
assessment of investment priorities in the state, however, are sometimes
inadequate.  A perspective plan, written by GOTN as part of project
preparation, lists the state's goals for agriculture as follows: (a) to
increase productivity and farm incomes; (b) to conserve natural resources,
particularly land and water; (c) to promote the development of human resources
and protect the environment and ecology; and (d) to develop the potential of
rainfed agriculture.
5.    RatiE nale fo- Bank Involvament.  The strategy for Bank assistance to
India is to support policies and investments that promote economic growth and
equity in the context of macro-economic stability. The emphasis is on
efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector and
appropriate targeting and delivery of support to the poor. The proposed
project fits well within that framework. Building on experience from previous
projects, it would address the main constraints to increasing agricultural
productivity and growth in Tamil Nadu. These constraints are variously
technical, financial, economic and institutional. The project would help
accelerate the introduction of improved technologies, particularly for
watershed management in rainfed areas, livestock, forestry and seed
production, and the provision of rural roads and village water supplies. It
would facilitate the transfer of production and distribution of improved seeds
and the distribution of semen and pesticides from the state to the private
sector. Agricultural extension would be made more cost effective and relevant
to the needs of diversified farming. Many smallholders would benefit from
these improvements. In addition, the analytical capacity of planners and
decision makers across the sector would be strengthened. As such, the project
would encourage better assessment of investment priorities and of public
policy with respect to reducing public expenditures and encouraging expansion
of private sector activities. Not least, GOTN would eliminate state subsidies
for the production and distribution of seeds and semer. This broad, statewide
approach to supporting agricultural development would be -..he first of its kind
in India, and should serve as a model for similar projects in other states.
6.    Proieat ObJeetiyes.  The underlying objective of the project would be to
assist GOTN introduce policy and institutional reforms for greater technical,
financial and economic efficiency in the sector. The project would: (a)
improve GOTN's capability to analyze development constraints, establish
investment priorities, make informed policy choices and rationalize public
expenditures in agriculture; (b) develop cost-effective services to farmers,
including women; (c) help finance selected priority public investments in the
sector; and (d) encourage an expanding role for the private sector in the
provision of services to agriculture. Proposed investments would help
increase farm productivity and incomes, improve income distribution, and
sustain the resource base and the environment, especially in rainfed areas.
7.    Project Descript4nn.  The project, to be implemented over seven years,
would comprise eight investment components: (a) agriculture planning, through
technical support for strengthening GOTN's planning capabilities and the



- 3 -
coordination and monitoring capabilities of the Office of the APC; (b)
agricultural extension, through consolidation, broad-basing and training; (c)
seed production, through improvement of breeder and foundation seed production
facilities (and transfer to the private sector of certified seed production);
(d) watershed development in pilot areas; (e) livestock development, through
strengthening of artificial insemination and disease diagnostic services,
semen production facilities, and promoting fodder production; (f) forestry
development, through upgrading of reserve forest and reserve interface areas
near adjoining villages; (g) rural roads, through upgrading of about 800 km of
existing zoads; and (h) rural water supply, based on handpump technology.
8.    The project would finance civil works, watershed and forestry
development, vehicles, equipment, goods, furniture, technical assistance,
training and incremental operating costs. Total cost is estimated at US$133.3
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$10.3 million (8%).
The proposed Credit and Loan of US$112.8 million equivalent would finance 86%
of total project costs, net of taxes. A Special Account would be established
in US dollars in the Reserve Bank of India with an initial deposit of US$5
million. To facilitate an early start to the project, retroactive financing
up to US$3.0 million would be provided for eligible expenditures from June 30,
1990 to Loan/Credit signing. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule, are in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map, IBRD No. 22663, and Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 9080-IN, dated January 31, 1991, are attached.
9.    I glementation.  The project would be implemented by GOTN's line
agencies responsible for the respective components. Overall coordination and
monitorin,, would be entrusted to the APC, assisted by a Project Coordination
Committee. Participation of beneficiaries, including women, would be
extensive, particularly in the watershed and forestry components where
participatory planning and common property resource management are important
features, and in extension activities as contact farmers and in the
maintenance of water supply installations. In addition, there would be
substantial participation by Non-Government Organizations (NGOs). Supporting
activities would include preparation of a base-line survey in year one, a mid-
term review by the end of year three, semi-annual progress reports by each
agency, and a post evaluation within three months of the Credit closing date.
10.   A4=ged Actei=n.  Agreements reached with GOTN at negotiations include:
(a) by end September 1991, the status of the agriculture working group at the
State Planning Commission would be changed to a standing committee and its
membership would be expanded; (b) by end September 1991, DOA would develop a
detailed training plan for extension staff and terms of reference for a
personnel policy study; (c) by end September 1992, the personnel policy study
would be completed and forwarded to the Bank for review; (d) by end March
1993, DOA would phase out of pesticide and seed trading (except as may be
required to deal with natural calamities in the case of pesticides, and as may
be required by GOI to implement national programs in the case of seeds); (e)
DOA would calculate, on an annual basis, the production and distribution costs
of seeds; by end June 1992 would complete a study of its seed pricing policy
and its impact on private sector; and by end March 1993 would eliminate state
seed subsidies; (f) the Directorate of Animal Husbandry (DAH) would calculate,
on an annual basis, the production and distribution costs of semen, and by end



July 1994 would fully recover the costs; (g) upon project completion, the
Department of Forestry would deploy catchment areas incremental staff to other
catchment areas in the state; (h) rural roads would be maintained
satisfactorily; (i) annual progress reports would be submitted to the Bank for
review before end June each year; (j) by end September 1994, a mid-term review
of the project would be undertaken; (k) the APC would coordinate and monitor
project activities; and (1) cost recovery and cost/benefit sharing
arrangements for watershed development, satisfactory to the Bank/IDA, would be
established. As a condition of effectiveness, GOTN would deploy key staff for
the recently established administrative units for project components.
11.   benefit!.  The main benefits to the project are expected to be
strengthened policy formulation and planning for the sector, more effective
coordination among government departments, better protection of the rural
environment, and improved quality of rural life. Annual production increases
attributable directly to the investment components would be about 1.0 million
tons of milk; 45,000 tons of food; 140,000 tons of fuelwood; and 61,000 cubic
meters of poles and timber.
12.   Risks.  The main project risk would be the timely strengthening of the
planning process and adequate implementation of the broad-basing of the
extension service. Government orders establishing the administrative
framework have been issued, and deployment of key staff would be a condition
of effectiveness. Nonetheless, because of the considerable changes to be
incurred by the departments involved, there may be delays in completing the
organizational arrangements. These developments would be monitored closely
during project implementation. Other risks would concern the timely
implementation of: (a) changes to GOTN's seed and semen pricing policies,
including reduction of subsidies and phasing out of GOTN's seed and pesticide
trading; (b) the animal nutrition and forage development program; and (c)
watershed treatments. These latter risks would be minimized by: (a) the
introduction of adequate costing procedures for seed and semen; (b)
strengthening the relationship between the DAH and DOA; and (c) introducing
consultative planning and community participation, assisted by NGOs. Further,
the mid-term review would allow for early identification of problems and for
adopting corrective measures.
13.   RecmmaendaLion.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan/Credit would
comply with the Articles and Agreements of the Bank and the Association and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan/Credit.
