THAILAND
ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF THE
BAN CHAO NEN HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
(QUAE YAI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the first phase of the Ban Chao Nen Hydro-
electric Project in Thailand, needed to meet a growing demand for power
and energy. Initial installed capacity will be 360 MW in three units with
an annual capability of 1,230 GWh. Provision will be made for the in-
stallation of two additional 180 MW reversible pump-turbine units in the
mid-1980's. The project also includes the erection of about 165 km of
230 kV transmission lines to link the scheme to the load center.
ii.       The project, essentially multipurpose, is a logical consequence
of a Bank Loan made in 1964 to finance the first stage (175,000 ha) of a
comprehensive Meklong Basin Irrigation Development Program downstream of
Ban Chao Nen. It will permit dry season irrigation of this first stage
but will also guarantee wet and provide for dry season irrigation of an
additional 230,000 ha.
iii.      The total cost of the project to be constructed in the period
1974-1979 is estimated at about US$181.0 million including interest during
construction. Parallel financing with the Japanese Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF) is envisaged. OECF has agreed to finance the
foreign exchange and some local costs of the hydraulic and electro-mechanical
equipment, transmission lines and engineering consulting services, estimated
at about US$41.0 million. Accordingly, the Government has requested a Bank
loan of US$75.0 million equivalent to finance the foreign costs of civil
works and interest during construction on the Bank-financed portion. The
inclusion of interest during construction is justified because of the
financial requirements of the Borrower. The balance of about US$65.0 million
equivalent or about 36% of the total costs would be financed by the Govern-
ment and the Borrower.
iv.       The Borrower would be the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (EGAT), established in 1968 by the merger of three existing
generating authorities. The proposed loan would represent the seventh loan
for projects involving power. Experience with previous loans has been
satisfactory.
v.        Economic growth was substantial in the 1960's, the increase in
real GDP averaging 8% per year. Growth slowed to 6% in 1970-71 and was
further reduced in 1972 by a drought that severely restricted agricultural



- ii -
production. For 1972-1976 the Government's target for GDP growth is 7%
annually and resumption of real growth at a rate of 6-8% is expected in
1974. Agriculture is the major economic activity (1/3 of GDP, employing
80% of the labor force, providing 70% of export earnings). Manufacturing
is small (1/8 of GDP, employing 4% of the labor force) but is growing
rapidly at 10% per annum.
vi.       The responsibility for the sector rests with three authorities:
EGAT, responsible for major generation; the Metropolitan Electricity
Authority (MEA), responsible for the distribution of electricity in the
Bangkok Metropolitan Area; and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA),
responsible for generation in remote areas and distribution in the rest
of the country. The sector as a whole is well-operated, investments are
adequate and reasonable, and future prospects are good,
vii.      By the end of 1972 EGAT had installed about 1,400 MW of generating
capacity and accounted for over 95% of all electrical energy generated in
Thailand and by 1982 will account for nearly 98%. Of the energy available to
EGAT for sale in 1972, direct sales to a number of industrial consumers
accounted for 7%; sales to MEA for about 70%; and to PEA for about 23%.
In 1982 direct sales are forecast to account for about 3.5%; sales to MEA
for 71%; and sales to PEA for 25.5%. From 1968-1972 EGAT's generation
requirements increased at an average annual growth rate of 21.0%.  For
1972-1982 a growth rate of 13.0% is forecast reflecting the substantially
larger base. Thus in 1982 maximum demand to be served by EGAT is forecast
at 3,260 MW and generation requirements at 19,250 GWH. In 1982 EGAT will
have in service about 4,000 MW of which about 3,800 MW will be dependable.
The project, therefore, represents about 13.8% of the capacity to be
installed between 1973-1982.
viii.     EGAT's planned 1973-85 expansion program includes investments
totalling about US$1,450 million for the 1974-82 period. The proposed
project would account for 13.0% of this total. Both MEA and PEA have
developed five-year expansion programs, their investments are considered
adequate and the relationship between generation and transmission, and
distribution is reasonable.
ix.       As previously mentioned, the project is essentially multipurpose.
Although it is justified on power alone, assurances have been obtained
from the Government in connection with the Chao Phya Irrigation Improve-
ment Project (Credit 379-TH), that consultants would be engaged to assist
in finalizing a feasibility study and in preparing a report on a Meklong
Irrigation Improvement Project with the objective of maximizing the
benefits to the economy made possible by the project. The economic rate
of return for the project, with all costs allocated to power, has a mean
value of at least 12.9% and with a reasonable allocation of common costs
to irrigation/agriculture, of at least 18.3%. As a multipurpose project the
rate of return varies on a sensitivity basis from not less than 12.3% to
21.7%. The computed rates are satisfactory. They are based on fuel prices
prevailing in July 1973. A recalculation utilizing current fuel prices
indicates that the 12.9% rate of return given above would increae to at
least 18%.



- iii -
x.        EGAT's tanagement is able, and its staff is competent.  Its
present financial situation is good. The rate of return has been about
9%; debt service coverage was better than 1.6; self-financing has equalled
30%; and the 58/42 debt/equity ratio indicates a satisfactory capital
structure. Its future financial situation, because of the substantial
investment program and rising fuel costs is not as favorable. Because of
the uncertainty as to fuel price development, a fuel adjustment clause
has been agreed to automatically pass on to the consumers any fuel price
increases subsequent to an increase in basic tariffs in 1974 to cover the
increased price of fuel oil since July 1973. Together with continued
exemption from income tax EGAT's forecast financial situation is satisfactory.
EGAT will provide for about 30% of all investments needed in 1974-82, the
rate of return will exceed 10% for 5 out of the 9 forecast years, will not
fall below 8%, and the debt/equity ratio will not exceed 59/41.
xi.       The proposed project would be a suitable basis for a Bank Loan
of US$75.0 million equivalent for a period of 26 years, including a period
of grace of 6 years corresponding to the construction period.

APPRAISAL OF THE
BAN CHAO NEN HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
(QUAE YAI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Thailand on behalf of the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT) has requested a Bank Loan of US$75.0 million
equivalent to help finance the Quae Yai Hydro-Electric project estimated
to cost about US$181.0 million equivalent including interest during con-
struction. About US$116.0 million would represent foreign exchange costs
and about US$65.0 million local currency costs. The Government has also
requested financial assistance from the Japanese Overseas Economic
Development Fund (OECF). OECF has agreed to provide a loan of about
Yen 11,600 million (equivalent to about US$41.0 million) on an untied
basis to finance the foreign exchange costs of all the electro-mechanical
and hydraulic equipment, transmission line, and engineering consulting
services required for the project, estimated to total about US$37.0 million,
plus local cost financing equivalent to about US$4.0 million. The balance
of about US$65.0 million equivalent would be financed through internal
cash generation, a Government contribution and local borrowings. Thus Bank
participation would be limited to the financing of the foreign exchange costs
of construction equipment and civil works (US$57.0 million); and interest
during construction on the Bank financed portion (US$18.0 million).
1.02      The potential for irrigation development and power generation in
the Meklong River Basin was recognized as early as 1903. The first major
development program was initiated with Bank Loan 394-TH of US$22.0 million
in 1964. This consisted of the first stage of a comprehensive Meklong
Basin Irrigation Development prepared by the Royal Irrigation Department
(RID). This project provided for the construction of the Vajiralongkorn
diversion barrage and navigation locks; canal headworks; flood protection
dikes; a main feeder canal and concrete lined main canals and lateral
systems to serve about 175,000 ha; 40 km of feeder roads; and drainage
canals. Benefits were based on wet season irrigation and flood control.
The proposed project is a logical consequence of this first loan, guaran-
teeing wet and providing for dry season irrigation of a further 230,000 ha
and enabling dry season benefits to be achieved on the original 175,000 ha.
Land use would average about 160%. (Further details on the possible irri-
gation project are given in Annex 1.)
1.03      In connection with the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project
of 1973 (Credit 379-TH), agreement was reached with the Thai Authorities
that consultants would be engaged by the Ministry of Agriculture to provide



-2-
technical assistance to finalize a feasibility study and to prepare a
report on a MekIong Irrigation Improvement Project for submission to the
Bank. This report has the objective of defining an irrigation project
in order to maximize the benefits to the economy provided by the proposed
project. The proposed project is, however, justified on power alone and
accordingly it is proposed that the loan be made to EGAT.
1.04      In 1966 the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA), EGAT's predecessor,
requested technical assistance under the Colombo Plan for investigations of
the hydro-electric potential of the Quae Yai River Basin. In 1967 a contract
was signed between YEA and the Electric Power Development Co., Ltd., of
Tokyo (EPDC) to prepare a feasibility report.
1.05      A feasibility report became available to the Bank in 1970 and
was discussed with EGAT and EPDC. The report was not convincing as
to the physical feasibility of the project and further investigations
were considered essential. These have been made and to assist and guide
such investigations EGAT appointed an international board of consultants
(ICB). At its last meeting in April 1972, the consultants concluded that
these supplementary investigations established the project's technical
viability beyond reasonable doubt. Design changes made in the interim
period further improved the project. (Further details on the ICB's
activities are given in Annex 2.)
1.06      The proposed loan would be the Bank's twenty-fifth to Thailand
and its seventh for projects involving electric power. The most recent
power loan (790-TH) was made in November 1971 to help finance thermal unit
No. 4 at South Bangkok. Prior to this a loan was made in early 1970
(655-TH) to help finance the Sirikit hydro-electric power project and thermal
unit No. 3 at South Bangkok. Construction of all three projects is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily.
1.07      This report is based on a feasibility report prepared for EGAT
by its consultants, on information provided by EGAT, and Qn the findings
of a Bank mission composed of Messrs. E. A. Minnig (Power Engineer),
A. N. Memon (Financial Analyst) and Messrs. T. Samuels, M. Ben David, and
P. Judd (Agriculture/Irrigation Consultants), which visited Thailand in
November/December 1972 and a reappraisal made by Messrs. Minnig and J. M.
Sneddon (Financial Analyst) in July 1973.
II. THE COUNTRY, TEiE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
THE COUNTRY AND THE ECONOMY
2.01      The Kingdom of Thailand is 514,000 km2 in area and had a population
of 38 million in 1972, which is growing at a rate of 3% per year. Per capita
GNP was about US$210 in 1972 and electricity generation amounted to 153 kwh
per capita. Economic growth was substantial in the 1960's, the increase
in real CDP averaging 8% per year. Growth slowed to 6% in 1970-71, largely



- 3 -
as a result of weak export demand, and was further reduced in 1972 by a
drought that severely restricted agricultural production. The Government's
Third Five-Year Plan (1972-76) establishes a target of 7% annual growth in
GDP, and resumption of real growth at a rate of 7-8% is expected in 1974.
Bangkok and the central region have developed more rapidly than the other
areas of the country, and one objective of the Third Five-Year Plan is to
promote the development of the less advanced regions.
2.02      Thailand is well endowed with land and water resources for agri-
cultural production. Agriculture is the major economic activity, contributing
about one-third of GDP, employing 80% of the labor force, and providing about
70% of merchandise export earnings. The manufacturing sector is small (13%
of GDP and 4% of employment) but growing fairly rapidly at about 10% per
year. Significant tourism development is also taking place, and tourism is
now a major source of foreign exchange earnings.
THE SECTOR
General
2.03      The development of the sector is carried out by three independent
authorities. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT); the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA); and the Provincial Electricity
Authority (PEA).
2.04      The power sector is well operated, investments are adequate and
reasonable, and future prospects are good. In 1972 electricity generation
totalled 5,990 GWh and maximum demand 1,117 MW. However, only about 17%
of the total population or 6.4 million, of which 3.6 million were within the
Metropolitan Area of Bangkok, directly enjoyed the benefits of electricity.
By 1982, Thailand's electrical energy requirements are forecast to total
about 19,700 GWh with a maximum demand of about 3,400 MW. It is estimated
that about 27% of the population would benefit from electricity in this
year and an increasing percentage of the total would be outside Bangkok.
Compared with average annual growth rates achieved from 1968-1972 of
20.5% for generation and 18.2% for maximum demand, the forecast growth
rates 1972-1982 are 12.6% and 12.0% respectively reflecting primarily a
larger base but also a lower economic growth rate. However, a substantial
rural electrification program would be undertaken during the period (see
para 2.14).
Energy Requirement and Resources
2.05      During the period 1956-1970 total energy consumption in Thailand
increased at an average annual growth rate of 13% p.a. to reach about 6.3
million tons petroleum equivalent in 1970. It is forecast that the past
growth rate will be sustained until at least 1990 and that by 1980 total
energy consumption will amount to 27.1 million tons petroleum equivalent
with petroleum products accounting for about 80%.



-4-
2.06      Thailand's energy resources consist of hydro-power, limited
petroleum and coal, large but as yet not economically exploitable oil
shale deposits, charcoal, wood, paddy husk, and bagasse. Its hydro-
potential totals about 11,300 MW and 40,700 GWh (excluding the potential
on two international rivers, the Mekong and the Salaween) of which only
about 520 MW or 4.6% is presently exploited. Coal deposits are
estimated at about 150 million tons of which about 65 million tons can
be commercially exploited. Proven reserves of petroleum total about
2.5 million barrels (estimated consumption of petroleum products in 1975
are 78.3 million barrels) but exploration is being carried out in the
Northeast and in the Gulf of Siam. Oil shale deposits are estimated at
about 2,700 million barrels which, if economically exploitable, could meet
Thailand's domestic requirements at the current rate of consumption for up
to 50 years. In 1970 coal, charcoal, wood, paddy husk and bagasse accounted
for only 10% of total energy requirements; the main energy sources were
petroleum (80%) and hydro power (10%) (further details are given in Annex 3).
2.07      A future potential source of power for EGAT could be from hydro
facilities constructed on the Mekong River. The hydro-electric potential
of this river and its tributaries is substantial. The first phase of the
135 MW Namn Ngum project on a tributary in Laos was completed in early 1972
and EGAT has been receiving energy from it since. The Pa Mong project on
the Mekong River about 18 miles from Vientiane, where it forms the border
between Thailand and Laos, has a potential of 2,800-4,800 MW. However, the
earliest date by which Pa Mong power might be available is in the late 1980's.
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)
2.08      EGAT was established in 1968 by the merger of three former
public electricity authorities: the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA);
the Northeast Electricity Authority (NEEA); and the Lignite Authority (LA).
YEA was established in 1957 as a condition of the first power loan to
Thailand. The purpose of the Act establishing EGAT was to increase the
efficiency of electricity supply throughout the country and to coordinate
the generation and transmission systems.
2.09      EGAT is now responsible for most generation and transmission in
the public sector. It accounted for 95.3% of all electrical energy
generated in Thailand in 1972, the balance being generated by PEA in
power systems isolated from the national grid (1.8%), and by private
generating plants (2.9%). EGAT sells energy in bulk to MEA, PEA, and
to large industrial consumers.
The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA)
2.10      MEA, a state enterprise, was established in 1958 with the
objective of supplying electricity to the provinces of Bangkok, Thonburi
Nonthaburi and Samut Prakon. In 1972 MEA was serving nearly 400,000 con-
sumers with a maximum demand of about 640 MW and sales of about 3,500 GWh
(67% of the national total). Of the energy sold, about 18% was used for
residential domestic purposes, about 81% by industrial and comercial



enterprises, and about 1% for street lighting. MEA, EGAT's largest
consumer, purchases all energy requirements from it and in 1972 accounted
for about 70% of EGAT's sales.
2.11      MEA's distribution investment program 1972-1976 totals about
1,800 million Baht or about US$90.0 million equivalent. It is designed
to meet the increasing demand for power and energy in the area presently
supplied and also to expand the system within the franchise area to areas
presently without service. Planned investment per kW of incremental
demand of about US$150 is considered reasonable and adequate.
2.12      MEA's financial situation is satisfactory with earnings forecast
to provide a rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation of
about 11% yearly for 1972-1976. Its average revenue in 1972 of about 1.97
US cents/kwh is forecast to drop to 1.8 US cents/kwh by 1976 primarily due
to two planned reductions of about 2% in 1973 and 1975 made possible by
economies of scale and improved load factor. The probable effect of the
recent oil price increases on MEA's tariffs is given in paragraph 3.11
(further details on MEA's operations are given in Annex 4).
The Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)
2.13      PEA, a state enterprise established in 1960, is authorized to
distribute electricity for residential, commercial and industrial use in
the whole of Thailand (service area of MEA excepted). PEA purchases
energy in bulk from EGAT and also generates electricity in areas that
cannot be economically connected to the EGAT system. In 1972, PEA
served about 570,000 consumers with a maximum demand of about 340 MW and
sales of about 1,200 GWh. Of its energy requirements, 88% were purchased
from EGAT representing 23% of EGAT's sales and 12% were locally generated.
Of the energy sold, 34% was used for residential domestic purposes, 65%
for industrial and commercial use, and about 1% for street lighting.
2.14      PEA's investment program 1972-1976 totals about 1,370 million
Baht or US$66.0 million equivalent. These investments, covering an
incremental demand of about 310 MW, are equivalent to about US$213/kW,
substantially higher than MEA's, but not unreasonably so given its vast
service area and the relatively high investments foreseen for rural
electrification (2,500 villages with 44 consumers each on average, total
initial costs about US$22.5 million or US$9,000/village).
2.15      PEA's financial position is reasonable given the nature of its
activities. Its tariffs, reflecting the higher cost of service, are
substantially higher than MEA's producing average revenues equivalent to
about US cents 3.24/kwh in 1972 or about 1.6 times higher than MEA's.
Nevertheless, since its establisthment in 1960, PEA has been able to lower
tariffs almost yearly because of economies of scale, substitution of low
cost energy from EGAT for diesel generation and an improving load factor.
The probable effect of the recent oil price increases on PEA's tariffs is
given in paragraph 3.11 (further details on PEA's operations are given
in Annex 5).

III. THE BORROWER
3.01      EGAT would be the Borrower and the Government of Thailand the
Guarantor.
Organization and Management
3.02      The 1968 Act establishing EGAT provides for a Board of Directors
consisting of a Chairman and not more than ten other members, including
ex-officio, the General Manager. The Chairman and other members of the
Board are appointed by the Council of Ministers for four year terms. The
General Manager, who is appointed by the Board subject to the approval of
the Council of Ministers, administers EGAT in accordance with policies
determined by the Board.
3.03      One important provision of the Act deals with the operation of
hydro plants associated with multipurpose projects. Section 30 of the Act
gives EGAT the responsibility for the operation of multipurpose dams and
requires EGAT and the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) to jointly issue
regulations concerning the storage volume to be retained and the volume
of water to be released from such storages. This is to reconcile the
sometimes conflicting water release patterns required for power and
irrigation and to optimize the joint use.
3.04      The existing Loan Agreements stipulate that repeal or material
amendment of the 1968 Act without the prior agreement of the Bank, would
contribute an event of default. A similar provision is included in the
Agreement for the proposed Loan.
3.05      At the end of 1972, EGAT had a total work force of 10,427 of
which 6,464 were permanent and 3,963 were temporary, mostly engaged on
construction. Of the permanent staff, about 900, or 14% are university
graduates and about 1,000, or 15%, are graduates of higher vocational
schools. A training program exists to develop the various skills required
(see Annex 6). EGAT's operational staff is well trained and competent.
Although the number of employees is slightly higher (7% - 10%) than
considered necessary, this is due to the transfer to EGAT of the staff of
its predecessors, a situation which, however, improves yearly due to
attrition and system expansion.
3.06      The General Manager is well qualified and exceptionally dynamic.
The organization functions smoothly, the working climate and personnel
relations are excellent, and as a result dedication to work is high.
EGAT's organization is shown in Annex 7.
3.07      The work load of the Financial Controller is heavy and there is
a need, as recommended by EGAT's financial consultants, Messrs. Cooper
and Lybrand, in their 1971 annual report, to strengthen the Accounting
and Finance Department by the recruitment of a second Assistant Controller.



-7-
The General Manager recognizes this, but efforts to recruit a suitable
person have failed in the past. Nevertheless, EGAT has agreed to renew
its recruitment efforts.
Accounting and Audit
3.08      The provisions of the Act and the way they have been administered
have been effective in maintaining the sound financial position which has
characterized EGAT's operations. EGAT follows the "Uniform System of
Accounts" established by the US Federal Power Commission. The accounts are
administered effectively and annual statements are prepared within the
period stipulated by the Act (90 days after the close of the Fiscal Year).
The Act also requires the appointment of auditors. Since 1966 an indepen-
dent accounting firm, Messrs. Cooper and Lybrand (UK) has been retained
by EGAT and its predecessors to assist the Government Audit Council, which
prepares the formal audit. This arrangement has been satisfactory and in
agreement with the provisions of previous Bank Loans. The relevant covenant
has been repeated in the proposed loan.
Tariffs
3.09      The 1968 Act requires that tariffs should cover (i) all operating
expenses including employees' benefits and bonuses, depreciation and
interest; (ii) amortization in excess of depreciation and increases in
the cost of asset replacement; and (iii) reasonable allocations to a
contingency reserve, and financing of a substantial portion of system
expansion investments. Loan Agreement 790-TH requires EGAT to self-
finance on average, 30% of its capital investment program. This has been
satisfactory in the past and a similar covenant has been repeated in the
Agreement for the proposed loan.
3.10      EGAT's tariffs, of the standard demand-energy type which charges
consumers separately for their demand (KW) and energy (kwh), are appropriate
for a supplier of bulk power. The average level of tariffs in 1972 was
29 stang/kwh (US cents 1.4/kwh) which was reasonable in view of the rela-
tively high cost of fuel even then (US cents 50/million BTU, including taxes).
3.11      Periodic reductions in the tariffs of EGAT, MEA, and PEA were
made during the last decade because of improved efficiency and increased
sales. They did not adversely affect the financial viability of the
organizations. However, in view of rising construction costs, the substan-
tial expansion program and recent currency exchange rate. changes, a tariff
increase of about 5% will be required to satisfy the 30% self-financing
target. This will be additional to a fuel adjustment surcharge designed
to recover all variations in fuel costs above the 1973 base. Present
estimates indicate that the surcharge will increase the cost per kwh sold
by EGAT during the second half of 1974 by about 55%, as compared to 1973.
As a result HEA's cost per kwh sold will increase about 40Z and PEA's about
25%, but these increases are not expected to apply uniformly to all consumers.
Small residential consumers may hardly be affected but rates to comercial



-8-
consumers (offices, hotels, entertainment, etc.) are likely to iAcrease
substantially. However, the bulk of the additional revenue required is
expected to come from industrial consumers. As the cost of electric
energy for most of these represents only a very small part of the cost
of production, even a doubling of industrial rates would have a relatively
small effect on the cost of the finished product.
Insurance
3.12      An existing covenant requiring EGAT to maintain reasonable
insurance coverage has been followed. This covenant is repeated in the
Agreement for the proposed loan.
Existing Facilities
3.13      At the end of calendar 1972 EGAT had a total of 1,424 NW in
service. Of this total 515 MW were hydro; 704 MW steam thermal; 165 MW
gas turbines; and 40 MW diesel. Transmission is carried out at three
voltage levels; 230 kV, 115 kV, and 69 kV, with a total length of 4,549 km.
69 substations were in service with an installed transformer capacity of
2,345 MVA. Of these, 8 serve MEA; 55 serve PEA; and 6 serve large
industrial consumers. Given the rapid expansion of EGAT's system, facil-
ities are new, modern, and efficient. Plant is well opeoated and mainte-
nance satisfactory.
3.14      At the end of 1972 EGAT had five generating plants under
construction with a total installed capacity of 1,024 MW (394 MW hydro
and 630 MW thermal). Annex 8 gives further details and the map attached
to the report shows the location of generating plant and the trapuwission
system.
Development Strategy
3.15      EGAT has prepared a program covering the years 1973-1965 to meet
its forecast market requirements. This program is reasonable, is based on
least cost solutions and provides adequate flexibility. The preent system
is subdivided into four regions identified on the attached map. Whilst
Regions 1, 2 and 4 are interconnected, Region 3 still operates in isolation.
In Region 1 and 4 base load is provided by oil thermal plants located to the
North and South of Bangkok, the major load center. Base load cap also be
provided by the Mae Moh lignite fired plant in the North. Hydro generation
(Bhumipol) covers intermediate load requirements, whilst gas-turbines and
diesel units located at load centers are used for peaking, thus reducing
transmission losses. Region 2 is mainly served by hydro generation and
surplus energy is imported through this Region from the Nam Ng"u Iydro-project
in Laos. In Region 3, all generation is presently thermal (lignite fired,
diesel, and gas turbines). To ease the situation brought about by the recent
substantial increases in the price of fuel oil, EGAT proposes to convert an
existing 75 MW oil-fired unit at North Bangkok to utilize local lignite apd
to advance the commissioning of the proposed New Mae Moh 75 MW lpigito fired
steam unit No. 2 by two years.



- 9 -
3.16      EGAT's system is expected to be interconnected by 1979 with
the completion of the Region 1 - 3 tie line. This will increase operational
flexibility and permit maximum economy in system operation.
3.17      The major hydro plants are operated from multipurpose reservoirs
with irrigation demand given priority. The mixed hydro-thermal system
has enabled EGAT to fully utilize hydro capability. Thus in the dry season
when irrigation demand is highest, hydro plants operate at a high plant
factor and the output of thermal plants is reduced. In the wet season
when irrigation demand is low and storage drawn down, the release of water
is minimal and hydro plants operate at a. low plant factor. Hydro power
capability can virtually be maintained throughout the year.
3.18      EGAT calculates its firm  capacity as dependable hydro capability
plus thermal installed capacity less the largest unit out of service for
maintenance. This is acceptable. The following illustrates the reserve
position:
1972           1982
Installed capacity (MW)            1,375.6        4,031.6
Dependable capacity (MW)           1,345.0        3,811.2
Maximum Demand (MW)                1,030.0        3,260.0
Reserve                              315.0          551.2
Operating Reserve (MW)               115.0          (48.8)
Operating Reserve as Z /1
of Maximum Demand /2           11.2%           (1.5) /3
/1   Reserve less largest unit down for maintenance.
/2   This percentage fluctuates from month to month. It
is highest when new capacity is added to the system and
decreases monthly until the next capacity addition.
/3   Capacity addition of 420 MW three months later.  An
acceptable risk.
3.19      EGAT's capital investment program through 1982 totals about
9 29,200 million (US$1,450 million). Incremental costs/kW amount to about
US$419, which is reasonable since investments include transmission and
substations in addition to generation. The proposed project accounts for
about 13% of investments up to 1982. Annex 9 shows EGAT's forecast demand
and the commissioning of new facilities in diagramatic form; Annex 10 gives
details of plant commissioning in tabular form; and Annex 11 gives the annual
construction expenditures for each project.

IV. THE PROJECT
The Project
4.01      The project, located about 80 km upstream of Kanchanaburi and
150 km Northwest of Bangkok, will consist of a 140 m high and 615 m long
rock-fill dam with a total embankment volume of about 13 million m3. The
reservoir, extending about 120 km upstream, will store about 17,000 million
m3.  Effective storage of about 4,400 million m3 will equal about 1 year's
average inflow. An open channel chute-type spillway controlled by five
radial gates will be located on the right abutment. The intake structure,
adjacent to the spillway, will have five intakes; three will be operational
in the first phase. Three 120 m3/sec capacity penstocks will lead to a
surface powerhouse located below the dam. In the first phase the power-
house will accommodate three 120 MW/140 NVA units.  A second phase (mid
1980's) will add two 180 MW reversible pump-turbine units. Transformers
will be located outdoors on the tailrace side of the powerhouse and a
switchyard will be provided on the left bank. The 360 MW station output
will be tied to the system grid over two 165 km long, 230 kV circuits.
Communication equipment, construction equipment necessary to carry out
preliminary works and resettlement, and engineering consulting services
complete the project which is scheduled for covmissioning in 1980. (Annex
12 provides further details.)
4.02      On attaining equilibrium operating conditions, the energy
capability of the project averages 1,230 GWh annually, giving an average
annual plant factor of 39%. The maximum monthly plant factor will be
about 90% (dry season, when irrigation requirements are high) and the
minimum monthly plant factor about 15% (wet season, when irrigation
requirements are low).
Financing Arrangements
4.03      The Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) has
agreed to finance, on an untied basis, the foreign exchange cost of all
hydraulic equipment (gates, valves, penstock, etc.,); electro-mechanical
equipment (turbines, generators, transformers, cranes, etc.,); transmission
line and substations; engineering consulting services; and associated
contingencies. In addition, OECF has agreed to finance some local costs.
The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of: (i)
construction equipment required by EGAT to carry out preliminary works and
resettlement; (ii) the main civil works; (iii) associated contingencies;
and (iv) interest during construction on the Bank financed portion. The
remaining balance covering local costs and interest during construction on
the OECF financed portion would be financed by the Government of Thailand
and EGAT. OECF agreed on February 20, 1974 to provide EGAT with a letter
of intent specifying the items to be financed prior to the conclusion of
a formal agreement(s). This is an acceptable arrangement and a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan would be the issuance of such a
letter of intent by OECF.
4.04      The following table summarizes the estimated project costs based
on exchange rates prevailing as of mid-February 1974:

The extensive physical investigations carried out during the past four years
(paragraph 4.10) have allowed project design to evolve to an advanced stage.
The cost estimate shown above results from a good understanding of site
conditions, a well honed design and benefits from the fact that bids for
the major civil works contract have already been received. The cost esti-
mate is significantly higher (about 90%) than an earlier estimate prepared
in 1968 and takes into account exchange rates prevailing at mid-February
1974. For items to be financed by the proposed Bank loan physical contin-
gencies represent about 12% of basic costs, subdivided as follows: (i) a
50% contingency for foundation treatment; (ii) a 5% overall contingency for
increased quantities; and (iii) a 3% overall contingency for environmental
considerations - rehabilitation of borrow areas (concrete aggregates and
earthfill) and quarries. The price increase contingency for items to be
financed by the proposed Bank loan is limited to about 5% of basic costs
since bid prices are fixed with unit rates not subject to adjustment.
Physical contingencies of about 5% and price contingencies of about 33%
of basic costs are included for items to be financed by OECF. The resulting
total contingency -- physical and price -- represents about 21% of basic
February 1974 costs and is considered adequate provided that exchange rates
do not fluctuate significantly from their mid-February 1974 level. A de-
tailed cost estimate is given in Annex 13.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.05      All materials, equipment and contractors' services will be pro-
cured on the basis of international competitive bidding with the exception
of contractors' services for preliminary works and resettlement. These
will be carried out by EGAT work force, supplemented by local contractors.
The Bank's Procurement Guidelines will be followed for items financed by
the proposed loan. Procurement Guidelines established by OECF will be
utilized for items financed by it. OECF's guidelines are similar to the
Bank's in all major respects. Disbursements from the proposed loan would
be made against c.i.f. cost of directly imported equipment and materials,
or 100% of total expenditures ex-factory for equipment and materials
manufactured locally, and 65% of total expenditures for imported equipment
and materials procured locally. Disbursements on the Main Civil Works
Contract would be at 60% of total expenditures representing the foreign
exchange component. Should there be any savings these would be cancelled.
A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 14.
Consulting Services
4.06      EGAT has contracted with EPDC to continue as its prime consultants
and proposes to retain the services of individual members of the Interna-
tional Consulting Board. These arrangements and the terms of contract are
satisfactory. Nevertheless, agreement was obtained during negotiations
that EGAT will continue to employ consultants acceptable to the Bank
throughout the construction period of the project.

Construction Schedule
4.07      Specifications and tender documents for the Civil Works contract
were issued with Bank approval in September 1973, bids were received on
December 19, 1973, and the contract will be awarded mid-April 1974. The
bid evaluation was reviewed and agreed by the Bank. For equipment contracts,
tenders would be issued in mid-1974 and contracts awarded in early 1975. It
is estimated that filling of the reservoir could commence with the 1977 wet
season. This is a critical date since missing this season would delay
commissioning by one year. Resettlement activities would be concentrated
over the years 1975-1978. The units are scheduled to be commissioned in
August and November 1979 and March 1980. Thus total construction time is
about 6 years and is considered reasonable. A detailed construction
program is shown in Annex 15.
Hydrology
4.08      Hydrology is based on a twenty-year period of record (1952-1971)
of 5 stream flow gauging stations. Available data were verified by com-
paring the simultaneous run-off at the various gauging stations. A good
correlation was established between average run-off and average rainfall.
Maximum probable flood calculations made using well recognized methods,
indicate a peak flood of about 7,100 m3/sec and a volume of about 3,800
million m3. (Further details are provided in Annex 16.)
4.09      The rate of reservoir filling is critical, because irrigation needs
have to be met prior to commencement of generation. An analysis made to
determine the probability of filling showed that the reservoir will first
reach its mean operating level with a 95% probability by March 1985, or
with a 50% probability in March 1982. This confirmed that the progress
rate assumed for agriculture development downstream and thus water release
patterns for irrigation were reasonable. (Further details are provided in
Annex 17.)
Geology
4.10      The design of the project is based on substantial investigations.
27 exploratory adits with a total length of 1,240 m were excavated and
45 drill holes with a total length of 2,740 m made. EGAT also carried out a
grout testing program from January - July 1973 to provide prospective bidders
with additional information to assist them in preparing realistic tenders.
4.11      Particular attention was given to a potential reservoir leakage
problem because of geological conditions. Extensive investigations showed,
however, that this was not a serious risk. Dam foundation conditions are
more critical. There is a large weak zone in the middle part of the left
abutment. Besides a grout curtain (up to 70 m deep) to prevent leakage,
blanket grouting will be carried out to improve the mechanical properties
of the foundation surface layer and a core cut-off trench will be provided.
In addition a foundation gallery will be provided for the lower parts of
the right and left abutments and under the river bed to serve maintenance
and inspection purposes. (Further details are given in Annex 18.)

Ecology
4.12      EGAT engaged the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) (Bangkok) in
1972 to carry out an Ecological Reconnaissance. A 35-man team covering the
following disciplines -- Fisheries, Acquatic Plants, Archaelogy, Forestry,
Social Science, Tropical Medicine, and Water and Agricultural Engineering
produced a preliminary report in November 1972. This exceptionally well-
prepared report dealt with Water Resource Management; Mining; Forestry;
River Basin Development; Resettlement; Health; Fisheries; Acquatic Weeds;
Archaelogical sites; Tourism; and Environmental Aspects. The report concludes
that "it is considered that there is no single ecological consequence, ot
combination of consequences, which is of sufficient importance to preclude
construction of the Project." The report, however, made certain recorenda-
tions and suggestions for further investigations which EGAT followed. A
subsequent report prepared by AIT entitled "Selected Ecological Surveys"
dated January 1974 covered: Dry Season Water-borne Parasitic Diseases;
Heavy Metal Pollution; Aesthetic Qualities of the Quai Yai Basin; and
Archaeology. During negotiations agreement was reached that all reasonable
measures would be taken to ensure that execution and operation of the
Project are carried out with due regard to ecological and environmental
factors and, in particular, the recommendations of the AIT reports.
4.13      A total number of 8,000 inhabitants will need to be resettled
and EGAT has included for this purpose a sum of $ 120 million or 3.7% of
total construction expenditure. This is equivalent to US$750 per inhabitant
and is considered to be adequate; it would be about 50% higher than the amount
contemplated for the proposed Pa Mong project on the Mekong River and about
three times the amount for the Volta river project in Ghana. It will be
essential to prepare a detailed resettlement plan, primarily to ensure that
the resettled population can earn a living under conditions at least equal
to those now existing. The preparation of this plan will be the responsibi-
lity of a coordinating committee consisting of, but not limited to: EGAT;
the Departments of Public Welfare and Public Health, Credit and Marketing
Cooperatives, Fisheries and Forestry, Land Cooperation and Development;
the Royal Irrigation Department; and the Ministry of Education. In addition
the plan will take into account the views of the population to be resettled.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that: (i) the Committee would
be established by May 31, 1974; (ii) the detailed plan will be submitted to
the Bank for approval by December 31, 1974; (iii) EGAT would be made responsi-
ble for the physical execution of the plan; and (iv) the Government would
provide any funds needed in excess of $ 120 million should this amount
prove to be inadequate for the purpose.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
The Power Market
5.01      At the end of 1962, EGAT's predecessors served a maximum
demand of 113 MW and generated 512 GWh. The average annual load factor



- 15 -
was 51.6%. ?en years later, in 1972, maximum demand had increased to
1,030 MW, generation to 5,711 GWh and the annual load factor had improved
to 63.3%. In the ten year period, there was a ten-fold increase in power
and energy requirements. Average annual growth rates were 25% for demand
and 27% for energy. These growth rates, which varied from year to year,
correlated closely with economic developments. Early stimulants were
rapidly rising investments, favorable world rice markets, and export
of services (US military). The turning point came in 1969 due to a combina-
tion of a decline in US military expenditures and transfers, and a reduction
in the prices of rubber and rice. The low point was reached in 1971
when demand and energy requirements increased by only 15.0% and 17.2% respec-
tively. However, system growth recovered in 1972 to better than 19.0%.
5.02      For Thailand as a whole per capita generation of electricity
increased from 85 kwh in 1968 to 153 kwh in 1972 at an average annual rate
of 15.2%. The number of electricity consumers increased in this period
from 694,514 to 967,462 and generation/consumer from 3,980 kwh to 6,015 kwh.
In spite of these impressive statistics, only 17% of the total Thai
population (3.6 million within Bangkok and 2.8 million outside Bangkok)
enjoy the benefit of electricity. Thus the latent demand to be served
remains substantial.
5.03      Of total power sold throughout the country in 1972, residential
sales accounted for 20.4%; industrial and commercial sales for 78.8% and
street lighting for 0.8%. In Bangkok, the capital, residential sales
amounted in 1972 to 2,020 kwh/consumer, whilst in the rest of the country
the corresponding figure was 735 kwh. The growth rate of residential con-
sumption per consumer in the Bangkok metropolitan area averaged 8.0% during
1968-1972 whilst in the provinces a rate of 12.1% was achieved. This
illustrates to an extent improving economic development of the provincial
regions.
5.04      The power market forecast is based on known industrial developments
and the Government's 1972-1976 Economic Development Plan. Maximum demand
to be served by EGAT in 1982 is forecast at about 3,260 MW and generation
at 19,250 GWh. This indicates average annual growth rates for 1972-1982
of 12.1% for demand and 13.0% for generation, substantially below historic
rates because of the larger base and expected slower economy growth. On a
national basis generation/capita would increase from 153 kwh in 1972 to
382 kwh in 1982 (average growth rate 9.8% compared to 15.8% for the period
1968-1972). By 1982 an estimated 27% of the population would enjoy the
benefits of electricity. In 1982 EGAT is forecast to provide for 96% of all
power demand in Thailand (the corresponding 1968 figure was 88.6%). Power
demand is not distorted by an inadequate tariff policy (see also para 3.10).
Further details on passt and forecast development of the power market are
given in the tables of Annex 20.
Economic Evaluation
5.05      Because the project will provide measurable agricultural benefits
downstream, the Government agreed in 1970 to provide $ 600 million (about



- 16 -
US$30 million equivalent) as equity towards the cost of the dam. The
methodology used in arriving at this allocation was the acceptable" Separable
Costs Remaining Benefits Method".
5.06      Three alternatives were considered in order to analyse the merits
of the proposed project:
(a) comparison of the proposed project with an oil-fired steam
alternative providing the fame service, 1/ assuming the
proposed project to bear
(i) all costs; and
(ii) all costs less the $ 600 million allocated to irrigation.
The comparison was based on the discounted cash flows of the
two alternatives over a period of 50 years. To allow for
uncertainties, a probability analysis was used to establish
the mean value and range of variation of the discount rate
which equalized the present worth of the two alternatives,
assuming three different values, with corresponding probabilities
assigned to them, for each of the main variables (capital costs
and fuel price);
(b) determination of the equalizing discount rate of a cost and
benefit stream over 50 years, of a downstream irrigation
project. This analysis was carried out on a sensitivity
basis with: the most probable costs and benefits; costs
increased by 20% and probable benefits; benefits decreased
by 25% and probable costs; and costs increased by 20% and
benefits decreased by 25%. In carrying out this analysis
it was assumed that
(i) no Quae Yai costs would be allocated to irrigation;
and
(ii) S 600 million of Quae Yai costs would be allocated to
irrigation; and
(c) comparison of an alternative power development stream
containing oil-fired steam generation, but no irrigation, 2/
with a power development stream containing the proposed
1/ System effects could be ignored in this case because of the modern
and efficient plant already in service.
2/   An irrigation project alone, bearing the full costs of storage facili-
ties to provide the necessary regulation, would not be economically
viable.



- 17 -
project and an irrigation project. Total costs includirg
operating and maintenance costs of the multipurpose project
were reduced by the incremental benefits 1/ attributable to
irrigation thus giving a net multipurpose cost stream.
Power benefits were ignored since they are common to both
alternatives. This analysis was carried out over 50 years
on a sensitivity basis with: the most probable capital
and fuel costs and probable irrigation benefits; the upper
range of hydro costs, 20% higher irrigation costs, 25% lower
irrigation benefits; higher range of thermal costs (capital
and fuel), low hydro costs, most probable irrigation costs,
and irrigation benefits increased by 25%.
5.07      The range of equalizing discount rates computed for the above
alternatives permit realistic assessment of the influence of value varia-
tions on the main parameters. The rates are:
Equalizing Discount Rate  /
(a)  (i)  power alone, all costs allocated
to power                             11.1  -  14.7 -
(ii) power alone, $ 600 million
allocated to irrigation              13.7  -  22.9 3/
(b)  (i)  irrigation full development, no
Quae Yai costs allocated to
irrigation                           16.4  -  24.4
(ii) irrigation full development, with
$ 600 million of Quae Yai costs
allocated to irrigation              13.5  -  19.4
(c)       Multipurpose project                 12.3  -  21.7
1/   Incremental benefits are defined as total benefits (with project-case)
less present condition benefits (without project-case).
2/   The discount rates of (a) and (c) are understated because of recent
fuel cost increases. The analysis made assumed a high range of fuel
cost for 1980 expressed in 1973 $ of US / 60/million Btu, whereas the
current estimate for fuel in 1980 expressed in 1973 $ is US I 165/mil-
lion Btu. Utilizing this value in the discounted cash flow analysis
for (a) (i) above would increase the mean value from 12.9% to over
18% or otherwise expressed, every $ increase in the cost/barrel of
fuel oil above the value assumed in the July 1973 analysis (US$3.30/
barrel) increases the equalizing discount rate by about 1% for this
particular project.
3/   Range with 95% probability (Mean value + two standard deviations).



- 18 -
5.08      The above results justify implementation of the proposed power
project, especially since the analysis attributed no value to benefits that
can be realized subsequent to the scheme's implementation such as tourism
(close proximity to Bangkok), fisheries in the reservoir, flood control (5
and 5C year return floods would become 15 and 1000 year return floods), and
communication in the valley above the dam. However, the substantial down-
stream agriculture/irrigation benefits that can be realized improves the
overall situation, indicating that early implementation of an agriculture/
irrigation project should be aimed at. Further details of the July 1973
analysis are given in Annexes 1 and 20.
Financial Justification of the Project
5.09      The financial rate of return of the Project, defined as the discount
rate which equalizes the Project's cost stream (with the Project bearing all
costs) and its associated benefit stream (tariffs prevailing before the
adjustment for increased fuel costs) is about 11.2%. This is a satisfactory
level, coincides with the opportunity cost of capital, and indicates that
base tariff levels are appropriate. With the 55% tariff increase to offset
increased fuel costs the financial rate of return of the project would
increase to about 15.3%.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Operating Results and Present Financial Position
6.01      The provisions of the Act governing EGAT's activities and the
policies followed enabled the Authority's management to maintain a sound
financial position. For the past four fiscal years, the rate of return on
average net fixed assets in operation varied between 7.9% (1970) and 10.1%
(1971); debt service coverage on an annual basis was better than 1.6 times;
self-financing averaged about 30% of capital investments; the debt/equity
ratio of 58/42 (1973) indicated a satisfactory capital structure; and a
current ratio of about 1.7 (1973) was adequate. Income Statements and
Balance Sheets for 1970-1973 and 1969-1973 respectively are shown in
Annexes 21 and 22.
Financial Forecasts
6.02      EGAT's future financial prospects as compared to those of a
year ago are significantly affected by recent fuel price increases and
currency adjustments, since the Baht (with the exception of a 4% upward
adjustment vis-a-vis the US$ in July 1973) followed the US$. Outstanding
debt service obligations in currencies other than the US$ have increased,
and new investments expressed in Baht and thus future foreign debt are
higher. The amounts in absolute terms are considerable. These are esti-
mated for the period 1974-1982 as follows:
(a) existing debt service -- up $ 200 million; and
(b) capital investments -- up $ 550 million.



- 19 -
6.03      Several sets of financial projections were prepared during
appraisal to consider the variables available in analyzing measures required
to maintain the past sound financial position in light of the changed
situation mentioned in the previous paragraph. The principal variables
considered were:
(a) reduce operating expenses (since fuel costs and depreciation
account for roughly 75% of this account, there is no signifi-
canlt room for improvement);
(b) reduce capital construction (this was done in terms of
system capability by cutting reserves to the lowest
acceptable level, with some risk. Nevertheless, the
reduced program is still more expensive in terms of
Baht than was the previous larger program);
(c) introduce a fuel adjustment clause in the tariff structure;
(d) increase tariffs; and
(e) extend a previously-agreed tax moratorium beyond 1976.
In addition, there was scope to vary the amounts and type of debt to be
incurred and to examine cost-sharing assumptions for multipurpose project
construction undertaken by EGAT.
Financing Plan
6.04      The proposed financing plan resulting from the above analysis is
summarized below.  It excludes the effect of the fuel surcharge as does the
subsequent discussion of the financial forecasts.

6.05      The proposed project would be financed by a Bank loan of US$75.0
million equivalent (41.5%); an OECF loan of US$41.0 million equivalent
(22.5%); a local currency loan of US$4.5 million equivalent (2.5%) to cover
import duties; equity contributions of US$29.5 million equivalent (16.5%);
and retained earnings of US$31.0 million equivalent (17.0%), a total of
about US$181.0 million equivalent. The proposed project would represent
13% of EGAT's 1974-1982 capital program (Annex 11). A Sources and Applica-
tions of Funds Statement is given in Annex 23.
6.06      Government has agreed, and the proposed Loan and Guarantee Agree-
ments provide for the translation into action of the assumptions underlying
the above financing plan, namely that:
(a) a tariff increase to compensate for the difference
between the fuel price prevailing on the date of
the increase and the price on July 1, 1973
(US$0.50 per million Btu) will be made effective
not later than June 1, 1974;
(b) a fuel adjustment will be introduced into the
tariff structure to increase or decrease the basic
energy charges to compensate for subsequent changes
in the cost of fuel;
(c) the Government will provide equity of $ 600 million
towards the cost of the project as a reasonable
contribution for downstream benefits;
(d) the Government will provide EGAT with a loan of
$ 90 million to cover estimated import duty costs
of the project; and
(e) the Government will assist EGAT in issuing bonds
equivalent to $ 300 million.
6.07      The Council of Ministers has agreed to extend the existing income
tax moratorium to 1982 and also that EGAT shall maintain its income at a
level sufficient to contribute 30% of the cost of investment in power
facilities. This will require a tariff increase of about 5% in addition
to the increase to offset the increase in oil prices.
6.08      The receipt by EGAT of a letter of intent from OECF confirming
their intention to make available to EGAT an amount equivalent to V 11.6
billion would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan. The terms of
the OECF loan were assumed at 3.25% with a 25-year term including 7 years
grace on amortization.
Future Operating Results (The following discussion excludes the effect on
revenue or cost of variations in fuel price as the fuel surcharge is
designed to "wash" these out.)



- 22 -
General
6.09      Energy sales are estimated to increase from 6,399 GWh in 1973 to
17,500 GWh in 1982 at an average annual growth rate of about 12Z. The
average revenue per kwh sold is estimated to average about $ 0.30 (USe 1.5).
While revenues are forecast to increase from $ 1,832 million in 1973 to
$ 5,734 million in 1982 at an average annual growth rate of about 12%,
operating expenses are forecast to increase at an average growth rate of
about 13%, an indicator that a further tariff increase may be necessary
towards the end of the decade.
Rate of Return
6.10      The rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation 1974-
1982 is estimated to be not lower than 8.2% (1974) and would exceed 10% in
1976-1980.  The decline towards the end of the forecast period when the
first nuclear plant enters the rate base is a further indication of a
possible need for upward tariff adjustments in these years.
Debt/Equity
6.11      EGAT's capital structure remains favorable.  The debt/equity ratio
remains around 58/42 throughout the forecast period.
Operatin  Ratio
6.12      While this ratio remains satisfactory at around 60% over most
of the forecast period, its upward trend in 1981-82 gives further indica-
tion that a tariff adjustment may be needed toward the end of the period
under review.
Current Ratio
6.13      This ratio hag varied between 1.26 and 1.67 in the past and will
not drop below 1.34, a satisfactory level. Since EGAT sells power in bulk
to a limited number of consumers, its accounts receivable position has been
forecast to improve from 2-1/2 months' revenues in 1973 to 1-1/2 months'
revenues by 1977. The inventory level is adequate. Year-end cash require-
ments are forecast to increase from $ 110 million in 1973 to % 290 million
in 1982, a target not met in all years. However, with its overdraft
facilities of $ 200 million, EGAT should have no difficulties in meeting
its day-to-day commitments. It is financially advantageous for EGAT to
meet unexpected short-term cash requirements through utilization of its
overdraft facilities.
Debt Control
6.14      On an annual basis debt-service coverage averages about 1.8 times,
which is satisfactory. However, the current debt control covenant prescribes
that, except as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree, internal



- 23 -
cash generation of the past fiscal year or a later 12-month period prior
to the incurrence of debt shall be not less than 1.4 times future maximum
debt service on all debt drawn. The coverage on this basis would vary
between 1.22 and 1.44 during the forecast period. The intent of this
covenant was to provide a test which, if applied and not met, would cause
the Borrower to consult the Bank before incurring debt.  Since debt is
defined as incurred only at the time of drawdown, strict application of
the covenant would require the Bank's agreement to every debt drawing to
be made during the next four or five years.
6.15      The form of the earnings test (paras. 3.09 and 6.16) ensures
adequate debt service coverage regardless of the volume of debt. What is
needed in the circumstances is control over the incurrence of debt, not
its drawdown. For this, a simple type of debt control covenant was agreed
during negotiations. It would give EGAT's management adequate freedom to
manage its debt while providing for Bank review of project financing in-
volving substantial amounts. The proposed Loan Agreement provides:
(a) "The Borrower covenants that before it shall:
Mi) undertake or execute, for its own account
or for the account of any third party or
parties, any new major investment 1/ not
related to the Project; or
(ii) acquire any major asset, 1/ it shall first
have obtained the agreement of the Bank to
the financing plan covering such project,
investment or asset"; and
(b)  "Except as the Bank and the Borrower shall from
time to time agree, the Borrower shall not incur
short term debt, including overdraft arrangements
and bonds, if by such incurrence the Borrower's
total outstanding short term indebtedness would
exceed a sum e'quivalent to US$50,000,000."
Self-Financing
6.16      Under the existing loan agreements with the Bank, EGAT is required
to establish and maintain tariffs which will provide sufficient revenues to
cover operating expenses including depreciation, interest, debt amortiza-
tion insofar as it exceeds depreciation, and to finance, on average, not
less than 30% of the investments in power facilities during any consecu-
tive four years comprising one actual and three forecast years. This
1/   Defined as involving an investment of more than US$50 million
equivalent.



- 24 -
eirnings test, which differs in form although not in substance from the
more usual return on assets test, has served its purpose very well in the
past. It reflects the requirements of the EGAT Act, which the Bank
approved, and follows the Government's policy requiring publicly-owned
companies to rely on a reasonable degree of self-financing.
6.17      As shown in the table of paragraph 6.04, EGAT will contribute
30% towards construction from internally generated funds over the period
1974-1982 assuming a tariff increase of about 5% from the beginning of
FY 1975.  The financial projections as given in the Sources and Applications
of Funds Statements, shown in Annex 23, include, however, the issuance
of local bonds of % 300 million in 1974. Together with a previous
issue of $ 50 million in 1972 and l 234 million in 1973, these bonds,
all with a maturity of 5 years, are scheduled for retirement in 1977,
1978, and 1979. EGAT's cash position in these years would permit
their retirement and the forecast assumes that EGAT would do so. Since
the bonds are issued and retired in the period under consideration, their
exclusion (interest component excepted) from the calculation of the
contribution to construction percentage is reasonable, giving the above-
mentioned figure of 30%. In application of the covenant covering successive
4-year periods, the exclusion of the bonds is also reasonable in view of
their short-term nature. Thus the covenanted requirement of 30% is met
in all years except 1974 (28%). The reason for the shortfall in that year
is attributable to the currency exchange rate adjustments of December 1971
and February 1973 and because the assumed tariff increase does not become
effective until the beginning of 1975. For instance, the shortfall in
foreign exchange of the two current Bank loans (655-TH and 790-TH) is
estimated at US$14.5 million (S 290 million). Debt service payments and
costs of other projects are also affected. To offset this shortfall,
EGAT will issue short-term local bonds for public and commercial bank
subscription in these years.
6.18      In spite of these difficulties EGAT's forecast position is
satisfactory and can be summarized as follows:
(a) EGAT will earn a rate of return on net fixed assets
in operation averaging about 9.8% for the period, a
satisfactory level;
(b) the debt/equity ratio does not fall below 59/41,
indicating a satisfactory capital structure; and
(c) the debt/service coverage on an annual basis
averages 1.8, which is adequate.
6.19      Inclusion of interest during construction in the proposed Bank
loan is recommended because:
(a) EGAT's past and projected financial position is
sound;



- 25 -
(b) it represents foreign exchange expenditure; and
(c) EGAT's financial situation requires it or its
equivalent in other borrowings.
Debtors
6.20      EGAT had no consumers in serious arrears at September 30, 1973.
VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMNENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
points and appropriate covenants included in the agreement for the
proposed loan:
(a) an earnings test (paras. 3.09 and 6.16);
(b) resettlement (para. 4.13);
(c)  tariff increase (para. 6.06); and
(d) debt control (para. 6.15).
7.02      The receipt of a letter of intent from OECF by EGAT confirming
OECF's intention to help finance the project is a condition of effective-
ness of the proposed loan (paras. 4.03 and 6.08).
7.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$75.0 million to the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand for a period of 26 years including a grace period of 6 years.

IRRIGATION ASPECTS
introduction
1.        Tlhe Mae Klong (or Meklong) River Plain forms the southwestern
portion of the Central Plain of Thailand. The main population center,
Nakhon Pathom, is situated 138 km west of Bangkok. The climate is tropical:
the winter or northeast monsoon season extends from October to Februarv;
the summer or hot season from February to May; and the wet or southwest
monsoon season from May to October. The mean annual rainfall is approxi-
mately 1,100 mm, of which 85% falls during the wet season. Without irriga-
tion, crop production in the dry season is extremely limited while wet
season yields are uncertain due to the likelihood of short dry periods at
the beginning of the wet season.
2.        The potential for irrigation development from the Mae Klong River
is about 400,000 ha. The bulk of this area is on the left bank and slopes
gently towards the Nakhon Chaisri River. Due to the many old rivers, terraces,
and channels, the terrain is somewhat undulating. Large areas are inundated
each wet season and, without better water control, are suitable only for
floating rice. Soil surveys have shown that about two-thirds of the Plain
is best suited for rice production, tohacco, peanuts and vegetables.
3.        According to a 1966 census, about 860,000 persons or 144,000
families are dependent upon agriculture in the Plain. Approximately 70%
of the holdings, comprising 65% of the land, are between 2 and 4 ha; while
only 8% are less than 2 ha. Some rather large holdings exist in the areas
where broadcast rice-growing is practiced. About 70% of the holdings were
owner-operated in 1967, but the expansion of sugar growing on rented land
may have changed this proportion.
The Mae Klong Stage I Project (Loan 394-TH)
4.        In 1964, the Bank made a loan of US$22 million to Thailand for a
first stage project in the Mae Klong Plain (Loan 394-TH). The purpose of
the project was to provide regulated (wet-season) irrigation, surface drain-
age, and partial flood control to 175,000 ha on the left bank (known as



ANNEX 1.1
Page 2
the Stage I area); to carry out land classification of the entire Mae Klong
Plain (390,000 ha); and to conduct a feasibility study for a second stage
project.  Major features of the project, as envisaged at appraisal, included:
(a) the Vajiralongkorn diversion barrage across the Mae Klong
River at Tha Muang;
(b) a main canal about 70 km in length and about 540 km of
secondary and tertiary canals;
(c)  flood protection dikes totalling 102 km;
(d) 68 km of new major drains and improvements to about 203 km
of minor channels;
(e) 40 km of feeder roads;
(f) a detailed land classification survey over the entire Plain;
(g) the establishment and operation of an experimental and
demonstration farm in the light-textured soils of the
northwest portion of the Plain;
(h) a feasibility study for a second stage project; and
(i) the services of advisers and individual consultants for
carrying out the various aspects of the project.
5.        The physical works were constructed by the Royal Irrigation Depart-
ment (RID) by force account. Construction began in 1965 and is now
essentially complete, except for some of the minor drainage ditches and
the flood protection dike which was deleted from the project (see para 7).
Construction took about two years longer than expected, but the estimate of
total costs was not exceeded. In fact, there were considerable savings
in the foreign exchange requirements and approximately US$5,364,000 of
the loan amount was cancelled after the closing date of June 30, 1970
(extended from December 31, 1969).
6.        Concrete Lining - Early in the construction period, RID adopted
the policy of concrete-lining all canals. The economic justification of
lining canals in the relatively impermeable soils of the project area was
never adequately established and the Bank, therefore, decided to exclude
expenditures for lining from financing out of the loan. However, canal
lining was executed outside the scope of the Bank-financed project at a
cost of about US$10 million. While this work will certainly facilitate
water control, especially in the dry season and should increase irrigation
efficiency, it is doubtful whether the benefits have exceeded the costs.
RID has since abandoned the policy of lining all canals and, on future
projects in this area, lining will be limited to sections where it is
justified by high seepage losses.



ANNEX 1.1
Page 3
Flood Protection - During the construction period, it was found
that the land acquisition cost for the proposed 97 km left bank flood
protection dike would be much higher than expected at appraisal, due to
accelerated industrial and residential development adjacent to the river.
As RID was at that stage planning to construct storage reservoirs on the
Quae Yai and Quae Noi Rivers, the major tributaries of the Mae Klong, it
appeared that the proposed dike would not be required in the long term.
Therefore, the dike was eliminated from the project and a 1 km overflow
section was incorporated into the main canal, which runs close to the left
bank of the river, so that flood waters could escape to the southeast
without damage to the irrigation facilities. The Quae Yai reservoir now
proposed will certainly reduce the likelihood of flooding but, as the Quae
Noi reservoir is unlikely to be built for some years, if at all, it would
be necessary to examine the question of flood protection for the Mae Klong
Plain. Studies to date have not attempted to quantify the benefits of
alternative methods of flood mitigation, except indirectly through the
projection of higher crop yields.
8.        Irrigation Effectiveness - The purpose of the Mae Klong Project
was to improve water control for wet season irrigation. Therefore, there
was no provision in the project for on-farm works, such as farm ditches and
drains and land levelling. Consequently, little development of this kind
has taken place and yields have remained rather low. The area irrigable
from the Mae Klong Project works is 149,000 ha. The reduction in area from
the 175,000 ha estimated at appraisal reflects the preliminary status of
design at appraisal, the infeasibility of cormanding some of the more
elevated land, and inadequate methods of canal design, which resulted in
some canals being constructed too low to irrigate their full command areas.
The wet season area actually irrigated was 22,500 ha in 1971 and 108,000 ha
in 1972. It is expected that the full 149,000 ha will be irrigated in 1973.
At appraisal, it was expected that a small area of 8,000 ha would be irri-
gated in the dry season under Stage I but to date, no significant amount
of dry-season irrigation has taken place.
9.        Agricultural Development - Rice is the major crop and occupies
60 to 70% of the cultivated area. A range of native rice varieties is
grown, which vary in duration, straw length and ability to withstand
variation in water depth and flood duration. About 45% of the rice area
is low-lying and subject to flooding, and thus is suitable only for broad-
cast cultivation with minimal use of modern inputs. The remaining rice
land has some degree of water control and transplanting is practiced, along
with some use of fertilizer and agrochemicals. Sugarcane is also an impor-
tant crop and the Mae Klong Plain accounts for half of Thailand's production.
However, yields are comparatively low.
10.       Paddy yields at the time of appraisal in 1964 ranged from 1.0
to 1.5 ton/ha in various parts of the project area. It was estimated that
yields would rise to 1.7 to 2.8 ton/ha after full development of the first



ANNEX 1.1
Page 4
stage project. Thus, the present yields of 1.3 ton/ha for native broadcast
rice, 1.9 ton/ha for native transplanted rice and 2.8 ton/ha for RDI trans-
planted rice ( a high-yielding variety) appear to be reasonably in line
with expectations, remembering that the full development period assumed for
the first stage project has not yet elapsed.
11.       These results have been achieved despite inadequate levels of
agricultural supporting services such as seed, fertilizer, credit and
extension services. The extension service, provided by the Ministry of
Agriculture is severely limited in its effectiveness by the lack of adequate
funds, facilities and trained personnel. The ratio of extension workers
to farmers is of the order of 1:5,000. The lack of supporting services
could be an impediment to the full realization of benefits from the Stage I
project and any future projects in the Mae Klong Plain should specifically
address these needs. The experimental and demonstration farm included in
the Stage I project has only recentlv been established and has not yet had
any impact on the area.
12.       Future Development - The irrigation facilities constructed under
Loan 394-TH are unable to provide significant amounts of water in the dry
season, as the Vajiralongkorn Barrage has virtually no storage capacity,
and the unregulated flows of the Mae Klong River are highly seasonal. The
construction of the Quae Yai Dam would make available a reliable dry-season
water stupply for about 235,000 ha. However, to make effective use of tnis
water, especially where soils are best suited to non-rice crops, on-farm
development would be necessary. As the organizational capacity of the
Ministry of Agriculture to carry out such works is limited to about 20,000
ha per year, it is necessary to carefully re-assess priorities for develop-
ment between various parts of the Mae Klong Plain, in order to maximize
the economic returns to investment.
13.       When the Stage I project was appraised in 1964, it was envisaged
that the next stage of development would be the provision of irrigation
facilities to the same level as provided for Stage I (that is, without on-
farm development) to an area of 220,000 ha (140,000 to the north of the
Stage I area and 80,000 ha on the right bank of the Mae Klong, as shown
on the attached Map. A feasibility study under Loan 394-TH was conducted
by RID with the assistance of advisers from the United States Bureau of
Reclamation and was completed in 1968. In accordance with this plan, RID
has constructed, over the last two years, about 50 km of the main canal,
together with a number of laterals to serve this Stage II area.
14.       Taking into account experience from pilot projects in the Chao
Phya Plain north of Bangkok, an analysis was made of the benefits to be
obtained from development of the Stage II area for wet-season cultivation
only. This shows that a rate of return of only 6% may be expected. Addi-
tional investment, mainly in on-farm development, is needed to permit dry-
season cropping and to give the degree of water control necessary to maximize



ANNEX 1.1
Page 5
yields from high-yielding rice varieties and non-rice crops. If these
additional investments are included and dry-season cropping is assumed, the
economic rate of return is acceptable.
15.       It is, therefore, proposed that over the next few years, invest-
ment should be channelled ftrst to providing on-farm development to the
.Stage I area and later to providing full irrigation facilities, including
on-farm works, to the Stage II area. As the rate of development would be
governed by the availability of funds and experienced staff, it would not
be possible to proceed with on-farm development works on both areas simul-
taneously. Therefore, in order to carry out the proposed program, it would
be necessary for RID to postpone further construction in the Stage II area.
Recommendations are given below for the steps needed to implement the
phased introduction of dry-season cropping in the Mae Klong Plain.
The Mae Klong Irrigation Improvement Project
16.       The proposed Mae Klong Improvement Project would provide on-farm
development and the necessary supporting services at adequate levels to
permit year-round cultivation in the Stage I area previously assisted under
Loan 394-TH.  In view of the considerable past investments in irrigation
infrastructure in this area, and the fact that the Quae Yai Dam would pro-
vide a regulated water supply in the dry-season, the economic rate of return
is likely to be reasonably high. On-farm development comprises; land
levelling, realignment of farm boundaries, to enable a more efficient
irrigation and drainage layout; farm ditches and drains; and farm roads.
Up to about 110,000 ha of the project area would be physically suitable for
development at this intensity. Further drainage works, feed roads and
possibly some additional structures in ,;he main canals would also be
required. Supporting services would include expansion of the extension
service, training of extension workers, and provision of seeds, fertilizer
and other ipputs at reasonable prices and with adequate sources of credit.
Preliminary estimates suggest that such a project, which would cover 150,000
ha for vet season cropping and 84,000 ha in the dry season, would cost about
t 900 million (US$43 million). Additional details on irrigated areas and
cropping patterns are given in pages 8 and 9, and a detailed cost estimate
is given on page 10 of this Annex.
17.       Some study has also been given to a future extension of the pro-
ject into the Stage II area of 220,000 ha, which has been divided into four
sul-areas for analysis. The cost of full development, including the main
irrigation system and on-farm works, would be US$136 million at present
prices. It is likely that this project would have to be broken into several
stages. Due to commitments elsewhere in the country, it is doubtful whether
the Government could implement this kind of development at a rate greater
than 20,000 ha per year.

I area described in para 16 would lead to the following yield. increase:

(g)  Maize                                  1.9.        4.5
Further details on yeilds and returns are given on page 11.  The projected
rice yields are based on results achieved on pilot,rrojects, in the Chao-
Phya Plain.  The incremental net value of production from the project area
at full development would be about 0 840 million.per year, leading to an
economic rate of return of about 25% (page 12), if the cost of providing
irrigation storage,in the Quae Yai reservoir is ignored, or 21% if a
reservoir cost of $ 600 million is allocated to the irrigation,project.
Due to limitations on the feaaible rate of project implementation, a.
development period of 16 years from the commencement of constructton has
been assumed.
19.       The economic analysis (page 12) shows that the rate of return for
a future project in the Stage II area would also be acceptable at-about 16%.
However, there is significant variation between the sub-areas. In particular,
the East Malaiman area may be of,doubtful econ.omic merit.
Water Availability
20.       The water requirements of the proposed.Mae Klong Irrigation Improve-
ment Project are shown on page 13.  Preliminary hydrologic and operational
studies show that sufficient water will be available for irrigation of the
whole Mae Klong aSea at the projected cropping intensity of 163%, as well.
as providing 50 m /sec for salinity control.and navigation downstream of.,
the Vajiralongkorn Barrage. Annex 17 also shows that there is no con-
straint on water availability during the construction and filling of the
Quae Yai reservoir as development of the Stage II area would probably not
begin until 1983. However, to reconcile power and irrigation requirements
at full irrigation development the 360 MW power station, would have to
onerate at a plant factor of only 15% during the wet season. The plant
factor could be increased to 25% if the marginal East Malaiman development
were not proceeded withi. Alternatively, if pumped storage is provided for
the second stage development of Quae Yai, there would be no problem since
the downstream ptmp reservoir could discharge for irrigation needs a flow
independent of the turbine discharge.



ANNEX 1.1

Feasibility Study
21.       In order to obtain the necessary data and analysis to form an
adequate basis for appraising the Mae Klong Irrigation Improvement Project,
a feasibility study is required. This study should also examine flood
protection needs, review past and present planning for the whole Mae Klong
Plain and recommend an order of priority for future investments in the
Stage I and Stage II areas. The study would be conducted by the Office
of Irrigated Agriculture, an agency within the Ministry of Agriculture newly
formed to implement to Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project (Credit
379 TH) being financed by IDA. Some consultant assistance in advising the
Office and in reviewing the findings of the study would be provided from
the consulting services being financed under Credit 379 TH. It is expected
that the study would take about one year to complete.

1/ For economic analysis farm gate price was adjusted to take into account future world
price projections, handling charges and export tax. Fertilizer cost was reduced to
reflect world market price for the "straight" nitrogen fertilizer used in the area.
4ice yields and prices are on a "paddy"' basis.
2/ Current farm gate prices of rice are inflated and 01,000 per ton is considered a more
realistic price for assessing returns to the farmer. The price for sugar cane is based
on delivery to the factory. Loading and transport were included in cash costs for the
crop.
3/ Cash inputs include hired labor at 016 per day - the average wage rate for hired labor
in the area.

QUAE YAI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
INTERNATIONAL BOARD OF CONSULTANTS
GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE QUAE YAI PROJECT
FOR RESERVOIR LEAKAGE, AN ADEQUATE GROUT CURTAIN
FOR THE DAM, AND AN OPTIIIJM LAYOUT FOR DAM STRUCTURES
1.        The present site of the dam for the Quae Yai project (sometimes
called Quae Yai No. 1) has been studied by the Electric Power Development
Co. (EPDC) of Japan since about 1968 acting as consultants to the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). Several reports were prepared
by EPDC and a Feasibility Report became available to the Bank in 1970.
2.        Using this report as a guide, a pre-appraisal mission visited
Thailand in December 1970 and discussed the project with EGAT and EPDC
personnel. The report was not convincing as to the phvsical feasibility
of the project due to the extraordinary large water losses in drill holes
on the site, and the appearance of the foundation rock in several adits
which showed quartzite, limey quartzite and limestone tightly folded and
fractured with deep weathering, clay filled openings, and some small caves.
None of the adits reach groundwater, another indication of highly pervious
abutments. Furthermore, karstic (soluble) limestone was known to exist in
the vicinity of the proposed reservoir and there was little information
available to assure that the reservoir would not have excessive leakage
at locations remote from the dam. No other dam site in the vicinity pro-
mised any better conditions.
3.        Further explorations were done by EGAT and EPDC to resolve the
questions and the Bank representatives suggested and EGAT agreed to appoint
a consulting board to guide these activities which were estimated to take
about one and one-half years. These activities consisted of further drilling
and grout testing at the dam site, and further explorations over the
reservoir area, including the determination of ground water levels in tlle
divides between other drainage areas. If these levels were higher than the
proposed reservoir level, water tightness would be assured.
4.        A three man consulting board was selected (sometimes called the
International Board of Consultants) consisting of a geologist from the UK,
a grouting expert from France, and a rockfill dam expert from the US. It
held its first meeting in July 1971 and visited the dam site, flew over the
reservoir and carried on discussions with EGAT, EPDC and Bank personnel.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        The board was encouraged by the additional investigations carried
out since December 1970. They felt that the right abutment presented
no serious grouting problems because of fairly good rock. However,
groundwater so far as was known, was practically at river level on both
abutments and, therefore, reservoir leakage around properly grouted abutments
might still be a problem. They felt the quality of the left abutment was
so poor that a definite solution was not yet possible either as to feasibility
or costs. Aerial surveys of the reservoir area indicated, but not conclu-
sively, that karstic limestone was not present at critical locations.
Ground surveys indicated some fairly high groundwater levels, but they
could not be considered conclusive. The board geologist outlined a minimum
program of drilling to establish groundwater levels; even a small program
is difficult in this rough jungle area far from a water supply. The rockfill
dam expert suggested a shift in the left abutment of the embankment in the
hope of having to strip less undesirable foundation material; he favored
stripping a core trench rather than trying to grout some of the left abut-
ment material. The grout expert considered the grouting of the right abut-
ment simple, but suggested for the left abutment two lines of holes: one
to be grouted with a mixture of clay,2bentonite, sodium silicate and some
cement under pressures up to 40 kg/cm , the other to be grouted with cement
only at much lower pressures. The board in general did not like the pro-
posed tunnel spillway even though it lowered costs, because of the serious
destruction of tunnel linings in some other similar spillways. The layout
of structures on the right bank which had been criticized as risky at the
first meeting was considered satisfactory by one consultant but EPDC itself
proposed a safer layout.
6.        The second meeting of the Board was held in Thailand in April 1972.
Again a visit was made to the dam site and discussions were held as before.
It was concluded that the investigations made since the first board meeting
had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the reservoir will not leak
excessively. The holes drilled establish the fact that groundwater rises
to or above reservoir elevation at all critical locations. Explorations
disclosed year round flowing streams at many locations and at the upstream
end of the reservoir the head was negligible compared to flow distances for
any leakage.
7.        EPDC had drilled and water tested a number of holes along the
center line of the dam and had reached depths where water losses were
negligible, thus establishing the depth of the grout curtain which would
not be excessive. Drilling on the left abutment will be done from tunnels
to limit depths of grout holes and to permit regrouting if necessary. It
will be done from the surface on the right abutment.  Consolidation area
grouting will be done inder the core to prevent water flows against the
core.
8.        The grouting consultant recommended a grouting test to establish
grout mixtures, pressures, etc. After some discussion it was decided to



ANNEX 2
Page 3
make the test before a civil works contract was signed. EPDC did not con-
sider this necessary but for Bank purposes it would help to assure an
adequate cost estimate. This test and a few holes to establish the end of
the grout curtain on the left abutment were all that remained to be done
in the way of geological explorations.
9.        The proposal made at the first meeting to shift the left end of
the dam upstream was finally rejected as probably more expensive in view
of probable unfavorable geology.
1l.       After the first meeting one board member had suggested that a
cofferdam of reasonable heiglt could be built straight across the river
since the reservoir is so large it can store the spillway design flood
except for the flows through the diversion tunnels. This solution was
accepted after EGAT gave assurances that the land purchasing and resettle-
ment that would be needed at an earlier date with this scheme could be
managed. The very large reservoir also reduced the risk of using the
short flow records which are available.
11.       Responding to the board's objection to the tunnel spillway EPDC
at this meeting proposed an open chute spillway, a better if more expensive
solution. A compromise arrangement of other structures on the right abut-
ment was also presented.

ENERGY RESOURCES
1.        The National Energy Authority (NEA) has initiated a study to pre-
pare a long range program for the supply, production and use of energy.
This study will serve as a guide in the development of the energy sector.12
In the period 1956-1970 j2tal energy consumption increased from 10.6 x 10
kcal (1956) to 57.7 x 10   kcal (1970), a 5.5 fold increase or an average
annual growth rate of 13%.
Government Policy
2.        Because of the importance attached to energy and fuel on the
development of the country, the policies enforced are to:
(a) ensure the production and supply of sufficient energy
to meet the needs of the contry;
(b) regulate the price of energy within reasonable ranges;
(c) promote the use of locally available sources of energy;
(d) ensure the most efficient and economical means of
production, transmission and utilization of energy; and
(e) promote domestic industries which change raw materials
into useable fuels (oil refineries).
3.        Since Thailand presently relies mainly on energy derived from
imnorted fuels, the government gives particular attention to the control
of production (oil refineries) to meet the market demand in the most eco-
nomical way. In 1971 Thailand imported crude oil with a foreign exchange
value of about US$190 million equivalent. In the same year, energy
consumption per capita in Thailand amounted to about 220 kg coal equivalent
--about 1/20th of the energy consumption of European countries. Thus with
the ever expanding energy needs, particular emphasis is placed on the
planning of energy development.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Thailand's Energy Resources
4.        Thailand's energy resources consist of hydro-power, petroleum
(limited but prospecting in the Gulf of Siam is underway), coal, oil shale,
charcoal, wood, paddy husk, and bagasse. Charcoal has been used extensively
for househiold purposes; and wood and paddy husk by industries to produce
process steam. Because of limited quantities of paddy husk and increased
industrial requirements, this fuel source has lost its importance.  Wood
is still an import fuel source, but the country's forests have been gradually
depleted.
Hydra-power
5.        Amongst all types of energy, hydro-power is the most important.
Thailand's geographic situation is favorable with rainfall varying from
1000 mm - 3000 mm per annum.  The river basins in the North and West have
large catchment areas but the rivers themselves are not steep. Thus the
best development consists of high dams which provide storage and head and
regulate seasonal run-off variations. The most important rivers are the
Ping; Nan; Pai; Yuam; and Meklong (the latter has two important tributaries,
the Quae Yai and the Quae Noi). In the South and East rainfall is more
abundant but streams and rivers are small, catchment areas are narrow, and
only medium size dams with small storages can be provided. Energy can
therefore be produced only during the rainy season which in this area
benefits from two monsoons. The important rivers are: Pattani, Sai and Lang.
6.        Besides the water resources within Thailand, there are two interna-
tional rivers, the Mekong and Salaween with an exceptional potential for
hydro power.  Thailand's own potential (84 different projects) totals about
11,300 MW and 40,700 GWh per annum.  Of this potential about 520 MW (4.6%)
with an average annual energy production of about 1900 GWh (4.7%) are pre-
sently exploited.
Coal
7.        Coal is found in many parts of Thailand; both in the North and in
the South. Commercial mining is, however, carried out at only 3 mines (Mae
Moh; Lee; and Lampoon). The estimated reserves at Mae Moh are 120 million
tons of which about 45 million tons can be commercially exploited. (The
heating value is about 6,600 BTU/lb (lignite)). The reserves at Lee are
estimated at 30 million tons of which about 20 million tons can be commer-
cially exploited. (The heating value is about 9,000 BTU/lb). The lignite
deposits at Lampoon (Krabi) are estimated at 25 million tons of which about
10 million tons could be commercially mined.
8.        Most of the lignite mined is presently used as fuel for steam
electric plants established near the mines. Lignite at Mae Moh is also
used to produce fertilizer. About 460,000 t/annum are presently being



ANNEX 3
Page 3
mined of which about 400,000 are used for power production and 60,000 t
for fertilizer. At Mae Moh mining costs vary between US 8-9/t. On the
basis of heating values and the cost of transport, imported heavy fuels
(bunker oil costs about US$22,5/t) 1/ are cheaper for power generation at
Bangkok and thus restrict the use of coal for power generation to power
plants located at the mine sites.
Petroleum
9.        The only source of petroleum found in Thailand is at Fang in the
Chiang-Mai province in the North. Proven reserves are about 2.5 million
barrels and 400,000 barrels have been refined at the site for military
purposes. The refinery started operations in 1958.
10.       The Government has awarded concessions to explore for oil in the
Northeast and in the Gulf of Siam to six foreign companies. No exploratory
results are available to date.
11.       Oil refineries presently in operation in Thailand total 4 with
a capability of processing 166,000 barrels/day.
12.       Oil shale has been discovered at Mae Sod and Lee.  The Mae Sod
deposits are estimated at 2500 million tons which could yield 40-60 gallons
of oil/t. The Lee deposits are estimated to total about 15 million tons
with an oil content of only 12-40 gallons/t. The total crude oil that could
be distilled from these two deposits are estimated at about 2700 million
barrels which could meet Thailand's domestic requirements at the current
rate of consumption for up to 50 years.
13.       A by-product of sugarcane refining (29 sugar refineries in the
country), bagasse is used as the main fuel in the sugar refining process
together with heavy oil and wood. About 90% of the bagaase is used as fuel
each year.  The heating value, however, is low (1.9 x 10  kcal/t) thus
restricting its use to sugar refineries (transport would not be economic).
Garbage
14.       The Bangkok province with a population of about 2.5 million pro-
duces about 700,000 t of garbage each year. At the present 20% is utilized
to produce cliemical fertilizer and 80% is placed in sanitary land fills.
NEA has determined that the heating value is about 2,000 kcal/kg (equivalent
to a low grade cool) and that garbage could be used as a fuel. It has
therefore initiated a project -o construct a 22 MW steam electric plant using
garbage as fuel.
1/   Price July 1973.  Faced with the current level of fuel oil prices,
EGAT proposes to convert one 75 MW oil-fired unit at N. Bangkok to
lignite.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Charcoal and Wood
15.       These were originally the main sources of energy.  At present,
they only account for 1.9% of total energy consumption because of the
decrease of wooded areas and increased costs.
Forecast Energy Consumption
16.       Energy Consumption is forecast to increase as follows:
1965     1975      1980
Petroleum (million barrels)    15.8       78.3    139.7

Paddy husk & bagasse
(million tons)                1.14      2.88     4.55
17.       As a percentage of total energy requirements expressed in heating
value, the various energy sources are estimated to develop as follows:
1965     1970      1975     1980
Petroleum                        77.5     80.4      84.3     81.4

for about 80%.

APPRAISAL OF THE QUAB YAI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
THIE METROPOLITAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY (MEA)
1.        The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) is a state enterprise
established in 1958 under "The Metropolitan Electricity Authority Act, B. E.
2501" with the objectives of supplving electricity to the provinces of
Bangkok, Thonburi, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakon. MEA is EGAT's largest con-
sumer, purchasing all of its energy requirements from EGAT.
2.        During the five years 1968-1972, the market served by TEA developed
as follows:
Average annual
1968     1972      growth rate in %
Maximum Demand (MW)                 351.1      643.8          16.1 %
Energy Purchases (GWh)            1,858.9   3,679.1          18.8 %
Energy Sales      (GWh)           1,736.6   3,510.3          19.1 %
Losses            (GWh)             122.3      168.8           8.3 %

Sales/Consumer   (kWh)              5,840      8,850         11.0 %
Residential Sales % of total         19.4       17.8         16.1 %
Industrial & Business Sales %
of total                          79.8      81.4          20.0 %
Street Lighting % of total            0.8        0.8          19.0 %
3.        To serve this demand, PlEA at the end of FY 1972 had in service 34
HT/primary distribution voltage substations with an installed transformer
capacity of 1290 MVA/1720 I4VA.  (The figures indicate "oil natural cooling"/
"'oil forced air cooling"). Thus installed capacity corresponded to 1.4 -
2.1 times of maximum demand. A range of between 1.6 - 1.8 is generally
accepted as a desired upper range which, compared to the actual ratio,
indicates TlEA's ability to supply the demand on its system.
4.        MEA purchases power and eaergy from EGAT at four terminal sub-
stations. They are North Bangkok, supplied from EGAT's 252.5 MW North
Bangkok Thermal Plant; Bangkok Noi; South Bangkok, supplied from EGAT's



ANNEX 4
Page 2
760 MW South Bangkok Thermal Plant; and Bangkapi. 69 kV and 115 kV sub-
transmission lines link the terminal substations to the 12 kV and 24 kV
distribution substations. These lines had a total length of 362 circuit
kilometers at the end of 1972.
5.        MEA's primary distribution system has two voltage levels, 12 kV
and 24 kV. At the end of 1972, 2388 circuit kilometers were in service.
Its secondary distribution system at 220/440 volts has a length of 6342
circuit kilometers.
The Second Power Distribution System Improvement and Fxpansion Project
6.        This project which covered the five years 1967-1971 was executed
satisfactorily. By the end of 1971, 85% of all forseen projects were com-
pleted. Delays which occurred resulted mainly from a shortage of trained
technical and administrative personnel, and problems associated with pro-
curement:  (a) land necessary for substations and (b) placement of equipment
orders.
7.        To meet the increasing power demand within the area presently
served, but also to expand its system into rural areas, MEA has undertaken
execution of its Third Power Distribution System Improvement and Expansion
Project placing special emphasis to system expansion.
The Third Power Distribution System Imrovement and Expansion Project
8.        This project covering the years 1972-1976 places special emphasis
on:
(a) system expansion to ensure adequate supply of its service area;
(b) planning to ensure economic system development; and
(c) cost control.
9.        To achieve these aims the following targets have been set:
(a) by 1976 MEA would be in a position to serve 92% of the
total poiulation (5.6 million) within its service area   2
(3100 km ) and its network would cover an area of 2300 km
or 75% of the service area; and
(b)  by 1976, XEA estimates maximum demand to reach 1340 14W.
The Mission, however, estimates this demand at 1170 MW
which would represent about 87% of MEA's estimate. For
planning purposes MEA's target is satisfactory since delays
will occur as evidenced by the 85% achievement of the "Second
Project".

11.       The Third Project is subdivided into 4 sub-projects.  They are:
(a)  Construction of 12 new substations; the improvement of 21
existing substations; the construction of 6 new terminal
substations (EGAT supply points); and the improvement of
one existing terminal station;
(b) the construction of 230 kV, 115 kV, and 69 kV transmission
lines radially linking all substations which are provided
with multiple feed-in points. The length to be constructed
over the period totals 217 circuit kin;
(c) the expansion and strengthening of existing distribution
facilities and construction of new facilities; and
(d) the construction of a central load dispatching and operating
center.
Investments 1972-1976
12.       Estimated investments for the 1972-1976 Project are about 1800
million Baht or nearly US$90.0 million equivalent.  Investments per incre-
mental kW of demand (1971 = 558 14W; 1976 = 1170 MW or 612 MW) is about
US$150/kW which is not unreasonable given the load density in the urban
areas.

in million of Baht
Asian Development Bank Loan (Urban Project)             744
Proposed Foreign Loan (Rural Project)                    88

TOTAL                                1799
MEA would thus contribute about 32% from internal resources; ab&tt 17% would
be financed through customers contributions; and the balance of about 51%
would be financed through external and internal loans. Of the above total
investments, about 16% would be made in rural areas.

15.       MEA, with the exception of new loans incurred, had only one loan
outstanding - USAID. Its construction program up 'to and including 1971
had been financed solely from internal resources. Its current expansion
program 1972-1976 will about double assets in service corresponding to a
doubling of maximum demand in the same period.  The above summarized finan-
cial statements indicate:
(a) the rate of return on average net fixed assets in
service remains at an acceptable level; and
(b) MEA's Year end cash position remains positive, well
above working capital requirements, and increases over
the period from 68 million Baht to 223 million Baht
(about US$11.0 million).
16.       In the preparation of these forecasts, MEA has assumed that the
cost of purchased power would decline from 28.15 stang/kWh in 1972 to 27.15
stang/kWh in 1976 due to load factor improvement. These costs in US cents/ki4h
are about 1.35 and 1.31 respectively. iMEA estimates average revenue per kWh
to drop from 41.04 stang/kWh in 1972 to 37.52 stang/kWh in 1976. (US cents
1.97/kWh respectively US cents 1.80/kWh). MEA foresees two tariff reduc-
tions; the first in 1973 averaging 0.68 stang/kWh, and the second in 1975
of an equivalent amount. Over the period, these two reductions, taken into
account in the preparation of the statements, lower revenues by about 235
million Baht.
17.       It is of particular interest to note that to meet its distribution
construction and operation requirements, MEA only needs to increase the cost
of purchased power by 46% (1972) dropping to 38% (1976).  This in part         2
reflects M4EA's restricted area of operations - of its service area (3100 km )
only about 40% or 1235 km 2was served in 1972 - and the relative high load
density of about 600 kW/km in 1972 which remains virtually constant over
the period, inspite of a near doubling of the area served. Normally dis-
tribution authorities need to double the cost of purchased power to meet
their construction and operating commitments.
18.       In conclusion it can be assumed that MEA's financial situation -
in spite of its substantial investment program - remains satisfactory over
the period. Average revenue/kWh, compared to utilities in developed countries,
is not excessive indicating a reasonable margin of flexibility with regard
its tariffs, indicating further that any reasonable tariff increase by EGAT
could be absorbed by MEA by foregoing proposed tariff reductions.

ELECTRICITY GEN4ERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILNAD
APPRAISAL QUAE YAI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
THE PROVINCIAL ELECTRICITY AUTIORITY (PEA)
1.        The Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) established in 1960 is
authorised to distribute electricity for residential, commercial and indus-
trial consumption in all provinces of Thailand with the exception of the
Bangkok Metropolitan Area served by the Metropolitan Electricity Authority.
It is under the control of the 14Iinistry of the Interior. PEA purchases
power and energy in bulk from EGAT, but also generates electricity in local-
ities that cannot yet be economically served by EGAT's transmission system.
2.        To meet its increasing demand PEA has continually expanded its
system and presently has in service about 370 diesel generating plants all
over Thailand with an installed capacity of about 75 MW producing about 12%
of its total energy requirements.
3.        The principal statistics covering PEA's services 1968-1972 are
summarized as follows:
Average annual
1968     1972       growth rate in %

4.        At the end of 1972 PEA's distribution facilities were as follows:
Distribution Lines
3.5 kV                     733 km
11 kV                    1706 km
22 kV                    4776 km
33 kY                    2086 km
Installed Transformers
3.5 kV primary voltage   83.6 MVA
11 kV primary voltage 117.7 MVA
22 kV primarv voltage 374.0 MVA
33 kV primary voltage 102.2 MVA
5.        In 1971 PEA's investments totalled 128.1 million Baht (US$6.2
million equivalent) of which about 58.7% was contributed from internal cash
generation; 27.4% was provided from the Government's budget; and the balance
of 13.9% by foreign and domestic loans. The respective figures for 1972
were: Total investments 169.4 million Baht (US$8.1 million equivalent) of
which 67% was provided through internal cash generation; 3% from the Govern-
ment's budget and 30% through foreign and domestic loans.  The investments
made in 1971 and 1972 represent a cost/kW of incremental demand of about
US$147. This is not unreasonable, because the large area served by PEA
with its low load density tending to increase costs is offset by the relative
low cost construction.
6.        In 1971 PEA's revenues from the sale of electricity totalled
622.5 million Baht or 67.3 stang/kWh on average (US cents 3.24). In 1972
the respective figures were 762.5 million Baht and 62.9 stang/kWh (US cents
3.02) indicating a tariff reduction effective in this year. Overall PEA
has been in a position to reduce tariffs consistently -- a total of 11 tariff
reductions since its establishment in 1960. It is of interest to note that
PEA's average revenue/kWh sold in 1972 was about 153% of MEA's average
revenue. Efforts are being made towards a uniform tariff system (PEA and MEA)
and EGAT already supplies energy to both authorities under the same tariff.
7.        At present PEA has two main rate schedules:
Rate A: applicable to areas supplied by EGAT: and
Rate B: applicable to areas where PEA generates electricity.
Rate A is divided into 9 schedules: General Regular Service: Small Business
Service; General Business Service; Medium Business Service; Large Business
Service; Water Supply Service; Mining Industry Service; Agricultural Pumping
Service; and Temporary Service. The Block tariff system is utilized whereby
the cost per kWh falls with increased consumption. The first two schedules



ANNEX 5
Page 3
are a direct kWh charge whilst the General Business through Large Business
services also include a demand charge. The Water Supply Service is provided
at a flat rate of Baht 0.60/kWh; the Mining Industry Service and Agricultural
Pumping Service at Baht 0.40/kWh. For Temporary Service a flat rate of
Baht 0.05 - 0.08/Watt/night is charged.
Rate B is divided into 7 schedules: General Regular Service: Small Business
Service; General Business Service; Water Supply Service; Mining Industry
Service; Agricultural Pumpting Service; and Temporary Service. The Block
tariff system is also utilized here.  The first two schedules are a direct
kWh charge whilst the General Business Service also has a demand charge.
Water Supply Service is provided at a flat rate of Baht 0.70/kWh; the MSining
Industry is charged at a rate of Baht 0.50/kWh; and the Agricultural Pumping
Service is charged Baht 0.60/kWh. Temporary Service is charged at the same
rate as in the main Schedule A.
8.        A domestic consumer utilizing 250 kWh/month would pay under Rate
A Baht 257.20/month or about Baht 1.03/kWh (US$12.4; respectively US cents
4.94/kWh). Under Rate B the same consumer would pay Baht 341.60/month or
about Baht 1.37/kWh (US$16.42; respectively US cents 6.56/kWh).
The Second National Economic and Social Developnent Plan 1967-1971
9.        Under this plan PEA carried out 9 distinct projects.  Of these
3 were completed in 1969 with an investment of about 261 million Baht.
They covered the Yanhee First Stage, Nam Pong and the Riural Electrification
Project (Phase 1.)  The investments in the other 6 projects of  hlich 4 were
completed in 1972 totalled about 545 million Baht. The completed projects
covered the Yanhee Second Stage; Krabi; Mae Hong Son; and the Second Phase
of the Rural Electrification Project. The Lam Dom Noi and Lower Southern
Projects (total investments 167 million Baht) are scheduled for completion
in 1974 and 1975 respectively.
10.       As in the case of MEA, project implementation has not been carried
out on schedule due to the lack of experienced technical and administrative
personnel. PEA operates -- besides the Head Office in Bangkok -- 697 offices
in the Provinces. Its staff in 1972 totalled 6327 of which 1569 were
employed in Bangkok and 4758 in the Regions. The staff/consumer ratio is
a very favorable 1/90 indicating a serious staff shortage in view of its
widespread operations.
The Third National Economic and Social Development Plan 1972-1976
11.       To meet the increasing demand for power and einergy and to
expand its system into areas not presently served, PEA has formulated a
development program covering the years 1972-1976. This program consists
of:



ANNEX 5
Page 4
(a)  projects in the area serviced with EGAT power consisiting
of 4 sub-projects with investments totalling about 108
million Baht of which about 51 million Baht would represent
foreign exchange expenditures;
(b)  ptrojects in the area served by PEA diesel plants consisting
of 6 sub-projects with investments totalling about 259
million Baht of which about 128 million Baht would represent
foreign exchange expenditures;
(c)  projects to extend primary distribution lines to centers
presently supplied by diesel generators. The number of
centers affected are 93 and investments are estimated at
about 190 million Baht of which about 72 million Baht
would represent foreign exchange expenditures;
(d)  Accelerated Rural Electrification.  The feasibility of
this project is under review and PEA is being assisted
by a team from USAID. Estimated investments total about
450 million Baht over a five year period of which about
154 million Baht would represent foreign exchange costs.
The objectives are to electrify about 500 villages per
year;
(e)  expansion of existing systems to meet increased 4emand.
Investments for this project total about 345 million Baht
with an estimated foreign exchange content of about 223
million Baht; and
(f)  a project to provide 30 villages/year (1973-1976) withi small
diesel generating units and distribution systems. A first
stage of such a project was completed in 1972. Annual
investments are estimated at about 5.4 million Baht/year
provided from the Government's budget.
12.       PFA's 1972-1976 investments program, details of whichi are provided
in page 6 of this Annex, can be summarized as follows:

13.       The forecast investments cover an incremental demand of about 310
1J or about US$213/kW which is not unreasonable when compared to past invest-
ments and considering the large rural electrification component.
14.       Proposed foreign exchange financing arrangements are as follows:

15.       In conclusion, PEA's investments are in line with forecast demand
thus tying in with EGAT's investment program.  PEA unforttnately, as 1MEA,
suffers from a shortage of qualified technical and administrative personnel
which nevertheless has not prevented it from meeting the targets set.  This
situation, however, places a great strain on staff in service, who through
dedication perform an excellent job.

TRAINING
INTRODUCTION
1.dl      The three government owned electricity supply authorities EGAT,
MEA and PEA have jointly, with the National Energy Authority (NEA) and
Electricite de France (EdF), established an Electrician Training Center
to train technicians, foremen, and skilled workmen. In accordance with
their individual interests and responsibilities EGAT, MEA, PEA and NEA
conduct their own courses. Other private enterprises or other government
offices who are interested in the courses offered can send their personnel
to the center.
1.02      Other categories of personnel such as executives, engineers and
adninistrative personnel are sent to local educational institutes and abroad
to gain experience.
OBJECTIVES
1.03      The objectives are:
(a) to provide for refresher courses;
(b) to train new personnel;
(c) to facilitate the transfer of technical employees within
the respective authority;
(d) to qualify the capable technicians, foremen and skilled
workmen; and
(e) to improve safety.
TRAINING COURSES
1.04      The number of trainees passing through the training center averaged
over the past five years about 225/year. The courses offered are: improve-
ment courses for skilled workmen and technicians in power distribution
technology, electromechanics, meters and relays; training courses for



ANNEX 6
Page 2
metering, instrumentation, protection and control room equipment, electro-
mechanics, and interior wiring; and specialized courses for skilled workers
and technicians for wiring, air-conditioning equipment, and automobile
electrics.
1.05      Short improvement courses are divided equally into classroom study
(theory) and practical application. The training courses consist of (a) 15
weeks basic training (common to all levels); (b) 5 weeks initiation of
fundamentals; (c) a specialized course of 24 weeks duration (meters, pro-
tection, control room equipment, electromechanics) or 16 weeks duration
(interior wiring); and various specialized courses are given varying from
60 - 90 hours duration.
EGAT
EGAT relies on on-the-job training and for senior staff provides
training possibilities abroad. Its use of the Technical Training Center
can be summarized as follows:
1968           Ill employees
1969           102 employees
1970           120 employees
1971            59 employees
1972            50 employees
MEA
MEA presently employs about 7,000 personnel. Parallel with MEA's
past load growth (on average about 20% p.a.) new staff will need to be con-
tinually recruited. Thus MEA's objectives are to:
(a) increase working efficiency;
(b) prepare personnel for promotion;
(c)  develop top and middle management;
(d) improve methodology; and
(e) improve working and public relations.
MEA's training program covers top management development courses; courses
for technicians, linemen and servicemen; and ih-service training for engineers
and administrative personnel. The number of MEA employees trained at the
Training Center totalled:

1970            91
1971          105
1972            27
PEA
PEA trains about 50 employees per year.  The training provided at
the Center is similar to that available from other established vocational
schools with the addition, however, of special technical courses commensurate
with the responsibilities of staff. The training duration is normally three
years with persons in possession of a high school certificate.  Training is
divided into theoretical courses and on-the-job training.  The number of
PEA employees completing courses at the Training Center numbered:
1968            57
1969           51
1970           73
1971            52
1972            24

QUAE YAI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
GENERAL
1.        The Quae Yai River originates in the mountains forming the border
between Thailand and Burma and flows south through the mountain region
generally following the predominant geological structures. On the east, the
Quae Yai River Basin bounds on the Chao Phya Basin and on the west, the
basin of the Quae Noi River which joins the Quae Yai near Kanchanaburi forming
the Mae Klong River which flows into the Gulf of Siam.
2.        The Quae Yai River is about 380 m long and the catchment area
above the junction of the Quae Noi is about 14,800 sq km. In its upper
reaches the Quae Yai valley is steep and generally narrow. Immediately
downstream of the junction with the Huai Kha Khaeng, its largest tributary,
the Quae Yai River enters a wide and open valley. Before reaching the
western end of the Central Plain, the Quae Yai once more passes through
a narrow gorge about 80 km upstream of Kanchanaburi. This gorge forms a
favorable dam site for a huge reservoir and the Project is located in this
area.
THE DAM
3.        The darm to be built will be a rock-fill structure with a center
impervious core, about 140 m in height and with a crest length of about
615 m. The crest elevation is 185 m, affording with a normal full supply
level of 178.5 m a freeboard of about 6.5 m.  The3total embankment of the
dam, has an estimated volume of about 13 million m .
4.        The project site has a favorable topography permitting the con-
struction of a common forebay for the intakes and the spillway by excavation
in a saddle on the right bank. Materials excavated can be used for the
daw embanikment.
5.        According to geological investigations (see Annexes 2 and 18) the
foundation rock at the damsite is heavily fissured due to folding and
weatlhered to a considerable depth. Large faults have not been located.
For a concrete dam, the foundations would not be stable enough. However,



ANNEX 12
Page 2
a rock-fill dam -- the base of which covers a wide area -- does not need
the bearing strength required for a concrete dam and can be safely built
provided that adequate precautions are taken (see also Annex 18). All
aggregates required for the construction of a concrete dam would have to
be quarried and crushed because of the absence of river deposits (sand and
gravel) in adequate quantities. For a rock-fill dam, however, the materials
required are abundant and readily available in the vicinity of the dam.
6.        A rock-fill dam was chosen because the volume of impervious core
required is small with regard total volume. The rock-fill zone will be
embanked with sound and high shear strength rock which will reduce the
cross-section. The adoption of a relatively thin impervious tore will also
reduce the volume of excavation. A thin earth core also has the advantage
of quickly dispersing pore pressure developing during construction and thus
facilitating the implacement of core materials which is influenced by weather
conditions.
7.        The impervious core inclines slightly and has filter zones on the
upstream and downstream sides. The transition zone, to be provided between
thte filter zone and the rock-fill zone on the downstream side, alleviates
abrupt changes in the grading of the embankment materials suppotting the
core. Rock will be placed in such a manner to have materials of larger size
on the outer side and smaller size on the innet side. Rip-rap will be
placed on the upstream surface to prevent erosion by wave action.
SPILLWAY
8.        The spillway is an open-channel chute type.  Five radial gates will
be installed to control the discharge. The maximum spillway capacity has
been determined together with the determination of the maximum ptobable
flood. (See Annex 16).
INTAKE STRUCTURE
9.        Built adjacent to the spillway, the intake will be designed in such
a manner that water can be drawn from the reservoir down to elevation 147 m.
Each intake will be provided with roller gates oterated by a gantry crane.
The intake structure for 5 inlets will be completed in the first phase
(3 x 120 MW = 360 MW first phase; followed by 2 x 180 MW = 360 MW reversible
pump-turbine units in a second phase). The inlets of future units will be
closed by temporary bulkheads.
PENSTOCKS
10.       All welded penstocks about 240 m in length will conduet the water
from the intakes to the turbines. The inner diameter decreases from 5.5 m
at the upper end to 4.5 m at the lower end.  Design flow is 120 m3/sec for
each penstock.



ANNEX 12

POWERHOUSE A4D SWITCHYARD
11.       The powerhouse to house 3 units consisting of the main machine
room, control room, repair workshop, stores and station service unit is a
conventional reinforced concrete structure about 38 m high; 28 m wide at
the top and 50 m wide at the botton; and 80 m long. Excavation will be
carried out for all 5 units to avoid blasting when the first three units
are operational. The excavated area for units 4 and 5 will be backfilled
witll loose material.
12.       The switchyard is located on the opposite bank to the power house.
Sufficient space is available for 5 units.
GENERATING EQUIPI4ENT
13.       A high voltage synchronizing unit system is foreseen because of
its high dependability and operating freedom. The turbine and generator
control system will be centrally operated fron the control room. The
turbines are vertical shaft Francis units each of about 125 MW cipacity
operating at 167 rpm and with a discharge of not less than 120 m /sec at
rated head. Further optimisation studies are necessary to determine the
most economic turbine characteristics.
14.       The generators will be vertical shaft, umbrella type, synchronous
with damper windings and air-coolers, installed in a concrete barrel. Unit
capacity is about 140 tIVA and the frequency is 50 cycles.
15.       The transformers will be outdoor, three-phase, forced oil and
forced air-cooled type each of 140 MVA capacity. They will be installed on
the tailrace side of the powerhouse.
16.       For station service, a horizontal shaft Francis unit (3 MW) will
be installed in the powerhouse.
17.       For unloading, assembly and disassembly of the turbines, generators,
transformers etc. two 200-t overhead cranes will be installed.
18.       The bus-lines between the generators and transformers will be of
the isolated phase enclosed bus type and disconnecting switches, potential
transformers, current transformers, etc. to be connected with the bus-lines
will be enclosed in cubicles to ensure security and to minimize space.
TRANSMISSION
19.       To transmit the 360 1W station output to Bangkok, two 230 kV
transmission circuits will be required. The transmission line will extend
north from the Bangkok Noi substation turning left towards Quae Yai. After
turning left the line runs parallel with the railroad and highway and then
follows the new access road to the Project.



ANNEX 12
Page 4
20.       Supports to be used will be two-circuit steeltowers with three
conductors suspended on each side. Since the annual frequency of lightning
occurrence along the transmission line route is high, two overhead ground
wires are provided to shield the conductors.
SUBSTATION
21.       Power will be transmitted to the Bangkok Noi substation to the
west of Bangkok. This substation will form part of a 230 kV ring transmis-
sion system encircling Bangkok. The connection system of the two lines
will be of the transfer bus type, identical to the present system. Arrange-
ments of electrical equipment, circuit breakers, disconnecting switches,
current transformers etc, will conform to the existing layout. Additional
panels will be installed in the control room.
COTIMUNICATION EQUIPMENT
22.       Communication equipment will include a multi-channel microwave
radio telephone, power line carrier telephone, and UHF radio. Load dis-
patching will be commanded from the Nlorth Bangkok Dispatch Center. To
facilitate communication during construction, the microwave radio telephone
will be installed early.
CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE
23.       The construction schedule is outlined in Annex 15.  By July 1973
specifications for the civil contract will be prepared for issuance inee-
diately thereafter. It was anticipated that a contract could be awarded by
January 1974. 1/ During calendar 1974 the principal activity will be concen-
trated to prepare camp facilities and construction roads and to install
construction plant and equipment. Excavation of the two diversion tunnels
will commence in this year. During calendar 1975 excavation of the diver-
sion tunnels will continue and excavation for the coffer dam is scheduled
to be started.  In November 1975 it should be possible to divert the river.
At the same time excavation for the dam will proceed as will excavation for
the spillway, intakes and penstocks. The first fill for the main dam is
expected to be placed in early 1976 and completed in two years (early 1978).
Filling would conmaence in July 1977. In early 1976, excavation for the
powqerhouse would commence and installation of the electromechanical equip-
ment would start in late 1977. Tenders for such equipment would need to be
issued b)v mid 1974 and contracts awarded early 1975.  Transmission and
suibstation facilities would be constructed during the period end 1974 --
mid 1979. Specifications would need to be issued by mid 1974 and contracts
awarded by early 1975. Prior to contract award the final surveys would be
carried otut.  The units are scheduled to become operational in August and
tlovember 1979 and March 1930. The critical date is July 1977 the begin of
filling. If a delay should occur and the flood season 1977 missed, opera-
tions of the scheme would be delayed one year. From mid 1974 to the end
of 1978, resettlement work needs to be carried out whiich is considered ample
in view of the excellent Ecological Report and recommendations already
available.
1/   Current estimate mid-April 1974.

QUAE YAI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
HYDROLOGY
GENERAL
1.        The Quae Yai River originates in the mountains forming the border
between Thailand and Burma and flows south through the mountain region
generally following the structures. On the east the Quae Yai basin bounds
on the Chao Phya Bassin and on the west, the basin of the Quae Noi River
which joiIIs the Quae Yai near Kanchanaburi forming the Mae Klong River
which flows into the Gulf of Siam.
2.        The catchment area at the damsite is about 10830 sq. km.  There
are no existing lhydro-electric developments on the Quae Yai nor on the
Quae Noi. However, at Tha -tMuang, about 10 km downstream of Kanchanaburi, a
headwork diversion dam has been constructed by thie Royal Irrigation Depart-
ment (RID) to supply irrigation water to about 500,000 ha of fertile land
in the western part of the Central Plain.
CLIMATE
3.        The climate of the project area is tropical monsoon.  From November
to February, the area has little rainfall and moderate temperature due to
the NE monsoon bringing cold and dry air from the China mainland. March
and April is the hot season attributable in part to the retreat of the NE
monsoon. From May to September, the SW monsoon prevails, bringing a stream
of warma htmid air from the Indian Ocean, and rainfall is abundant. October
is the transitional period from the SW to the NE monsoon.
4.        The annual mean temperature, monthly maximum temperature, and
monthly minimum temperature at the Project site are 29.0C, 38.0C; and
17C respectively. The highest temperature recorded was 43.7C and the
lowest 0.1C.
5.        The annual rainfall of the Quae Yai basin is about 1600 am in the
upper reaches, about 1100 mm in the basin of the tributary Huai Kha Khaeng,
and about 1000 mm at the Project site. For the catchment area as a whole,
average annual rainfall is about 1300 mm.



ANNEX 16
Page 2
HYDROLOGY
6.        On the Quae Yai River there are 5 streamflow gauging stations.  In
addition there are two on the Quae Noi, one on the liuai Ta Poen River, and
two on the Mae Klong River downstream of the Quae Yai-Quae Noi junction.
The Kong Rieng gauging station on the Quae Yai is about 4 km upstream of
teie damsite. This station has been in operation since 1952.
7.        Available data was verified by comparing simultaneous run-off data
of the three Quae Yai gauging stations (Kang Rieng, Ongkla and Khao Chod).
The three hydrographs are similar and their quantative and time-lag relations
resonable. The Kang Rieng rating curve was made on the basis of an adequate
number of direct measurements using a current meter and revised yearly (upto
3 times/year) to cope with river bed changes. The rating curves are con-
sidered to be reliable. The correlation between annual average run-off
and annual average rainfall within the Kang Rieng catchment area is gocd.
8.        Since only a short period of run-off records is available, 1952-1971,
the correlation between run-off and rainfall is particularly important
because of the longer rainfall records (available since 1911).
9.        The average annual rainfall in Bangkok and Kanchanaburi from 1952-
19('7 was 1530 mm and 1040 mm respectively. For the period 1911-1967 the
corresponding figures are 1440 mm and 950 mm. Based on run-off records at
the Ban Tham gauging station on the IMae Klong below the junction of the
Quae Yai and Quae Noi rivers - for which records are available from 1940-
1966 - a smili5r comparison showed 409 m /sec average run-off for 1952-1966
and also 409 m /sec for the 1940-1966 period. Therefore from the point
of viexw of determining the energy prodluction for the life of the project
the 1952-1971 period is considered adequate, especially since this period
includes a dry period of several years. To determine, however, the filling-
up period of the reservoir the situation is more critical and a special
analysis was carried out described more fully in Annex 17.
River-Run-off
1(.       The run-off was calculated according to usual and acceptable
criteria in that the specific run-off of the various gauging stations was
correlated to the run-off data available at Kang Rieng. A correlation
between average annual rainfall within each sub-catchment area was also
carried out.  The specific run-off of the Quae Yai increases in thle upper
reaches giving ratios of 1.6 for Kao Chod; 1.2 for Ongkla; and 0.63 for
Ban Tham with a value of 1 assigned to Kang Rieng. A similar trend is found
for rainfall.
Flood Flow
11.       Since the proposed dam is a rockfill structure, the determination
of the maximun  probable flood is of particular significance in the design
of the spillway capacity and free board.  Two methods were utilized:
statistical and physical.



ANrIX 16
Page 3
12.       Statistical.  The probability calculation was based on past flood
records at the Kang Rieng gauging station using acceptable methods. The
results obtained can be summarized as follows:
3          Flood Volu9e
Frequency           Peak Flood m /s           million m
20                  2700                    2520
50                  3300                    2820
100                  3700                    3090
200                  4100                    3370
1000                  5000                    3970
5000                  5300                    4500
10000                  6300                    4840
13.       Physical:  This method gives the probable maximum precipitation
that may happen if all factors contributing to the generation of precipita-
tion were to reach their most critical conditions simultaneously. For the
Quae Yai River, 15 historic storms were studied and a period of one month
was determined as the duration of the storms. The results of these studies
were as follows:
Maximum Probable Peak Flood          6000 m3/sec
Maximum Probable Flood Volume        4920 million m
14.       Thus the statistical and physical methods utilized gave nearly the
same results. Nevertheless, a renewed analysis was carried out described
below:
(a) Historic rainfalls were obtained from the storm of 30th
September - 9th October 1963. The probable maximum
precipitation was estimated without modification of the
rainfall pattern according to intensity-duration-frequency
phenomenon, an amount of 5 nmUn continuous loss was then
subtracted to sustain the base flow, and effective
rainfall was assumed at 80%, 75% and 70% to compute
the probable maximum flood by the distribution ratio
method; and
(b) The probable maximum flood was based on the unit hydrograph.
The same rainfall data, loss, base flow and effective
rainfall was used as in (a) above.



ANNEX 16
Page 4
15.       The following summarizes the results:
Maximum ProIable Flood  Flood Volu e    Effective    Run-off
m /sec          million m      Rainfall (M)  Coefficient (%)
Case (a)          8052.8               4307              70             63.1
Case (b)          7913.8               4345              70             63.1
16.       This calculation was further checked with the use of the maximizing
factor.  This factor, defined as the ratio of the maximum moisture inflow
index to the historical moisture inflow index, was found to be 1.70 and 1.72
for 96% and 100% relative humidity. (For the Nan River this factor was
1.13).  Using 1.7 and380% effective rainfall, the probable maximum flood
calculated was 7102 m /sec and the flood volume 3870 million M3.
17.       For the purpose of design the maximum probable flood and flood
volume as calculated in the preceding paragraph was adopted. To allow for
increased safety, however, the normal high water level was reduced 1.5 m
to 178.5 m and the spillway crest elevation reduced by 1 m to 171.0 m.   3
Under these conditions maximum reservoir discharge would amount to 2582 m /sec
of -which 2422 m /sec over the spillway and 160 m /sec through the outlets,
and maximum reservoir elevation would amount to 182.4 m i.e. 2.6 m below
tiie dam crest level. The 2.6 m freeb ard could accommodate an additional
flood volume of about3l,000 million m . Thus a maximum flood volume of
about 4,900 million m  could be acconmodated, meeting the requirements as
given in paragraphs 12 and 13.
L,vaporation
13.       Evaporation losses from the reservoir can be estimated by deducting
tiue evapotranspiration of the original ground surface from the evaporation
of the reservoir water surface. Two methods were utilized which gave annual
evaporation losses of 425 mmn and 440 mm. A rounded off figure of 500 mm
was used to determine the annual net possible evaporation loss.
Sedimentation
19.       Sedimentation of the storage was estimated on data collected at
the Ban Tham site. Total sedimentation volume wihich includes suspended
ssdiment load and bed load transportation at Ban Tham is about 4.6 million
m /year for a catchment area of about 25,500 sq. km. This gives 180 m /sq.km.
20.       From this value, total sediment at the proposed damsite (catchment
area 10,880 sq. km.) is about 2 inllion m /year.  This would give a life of
the reservoir of 17,200 million m (Volume dividV by 2) - 8600 years. With
an effective stoSage capacity of 4,350 million m , dead storage amounts to
12,850 million m which provides for over 6,000 years sedimentation. Thus
over the projects estimated life of 1003years, total sediment encroachment
oni the reservoir is about 200 million m , just over 1% of the storage volume.

ELECTRICITY GENERATING AIUTHORITY OF THAILANID
QUAE YAI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
OPERATIONAL STUDIES
1.        To determine the compatibility of power generation and irrigation
two studies were carried out. The first related to the period of initial
impounding of the Quae Yai Reservoir and examined the effects of phased
irrigation demands from the progressive development of the Stage I and Stage
II Meklong irrigation project (see Annex 1) and power releases on the rate
of filling of the reservoir. The second examined the steady state condition
in which the oDeration of the Quae Yai reservoir was studied under the
ultimate irrigation demands following full development. Both studies covered
the 20 year period of available stream-flow records 1952-1971.
2.        Irrigation demands were established from consumptive use require-
ments of the various crops projected.  The demands at the Vajiralongkorn
diversion barrage were derived from the consumptive use estimates by making
allowance for effective rainfall, farm and canal efficiencies. For the
filling studies effective rainfall was assuined at a 3/4 low level (i. e.
a level that would be exceeded in three years out of four). Demands at the
diversion barrage increased from vear to year to reflect the phased introduc-
tion of irrigation development, particularly on-farm development.
3.        It was assumed that the Quae Yai Reservoir would start to fill from
June 1977 and dry season water wqiuld be available from December 1979.  Demands
at the barrage, including a 50 m /sec downstream demand for salinity control,
were translated to requirements from Quae Yai by establishing the incre-
mental requirement over and above available flows in the other tributaries
of the fleklong. For the 2nd, 4th and 6th years of filling it was assumed
that 3/4 low flows would be available from tributaries other than Quae Yai
and for all other years median flows. The resulting requirements are given
on pages 6 and 9 of this annex.
4.        With these requirements and the 20 years of available stream flow
records of the Quae Yai as inflow to the reservoir, 20 filling cycles were
examined, one starting in each year of record in order to establish the time
to reach full operating regime unider a number of probabilities.
5.        For the steady state study, the effects of actual rainfall addi-
tional to the 3/4 low level was examined for each month of each year. Con-
servative assumptions were made on the efficiency of additional rainfall
in reducing stored water demands in view of the time lag between water leaving
Quae Yai and reaching the field - probably 3 days or more.



ANNEX 17
Page   2
6.        Witni the adjustments for effective rainfall, demands at tne diver-
sion barrage were established for each month of each year of the period
1952-1971 and with the allowance for salinity control, translated to require-
iments from the storage oy taking into account the actual flow in tributaries
of the IMeklong river other than Quae Yai during these months. The opera-
tion studv was then run with imatching Quae Yai inflows to determine the
power output of the project under ultimate operational conditions.
7.        The results of the filling runs indicated no conflict between
power and irrigation durinig initial impounding. However, for steady state
operation it was found necessary to reduce the minimum monthly continuous
power from 120 MWl to 90 :4W and to introduce a reducing factor of 60% to
define output wihen operating below the rule curve in order to prevent the
reservoir being evacuated during the simulated 20 years operation. Thus
a plant factor of 15% (equivalent to 3 1/2 hours of operation per day at
full output) would be applicable to the wet season mqonths July through
October for a number of years. This indicates a degree of inflexibility in
the operation of the project for power and a conflict with water demands for
irrigation. Even so, the output of Quae Yai can be readily and effectively
absorbedi by EGAT's system. Due to this a marginal analysis was performed
for the various sub-projects of the Stage II Irrigation area. Two critical
areas were envisaged: (a) the Lower Right Bank area which indicates salinity
problems, and the East Ilalaiman area which consists of a Large portion of
broadcast rice. The results for the Lower Right Bank area indicate that
even in the most severe conditions anticipated, the estimated internal rate
of return is above the assumed opportunity cost of capital (12%).  The
East Malaiman area, however, will deserve additional attention since the
estimated economic internal rate of return equals the opportunity cost of
capital only under the most favorable assumptions.  Thus, should it prove
more economic to reduce the assumed scope of irrigation development, power
prospect would improve.
3.        The only operational concern resulting from the need to operate
the power plant to Tlaximize both irrigation and power benefits results from
the aboverentioned low plant factor operation.  To attain an output of 360
=ft, 360 m /sec would le released during 3 1/2 hours.  The sudden release
of water could affect navigation anid could endanger life.
9.        However, this state would only exist once the irrigation area
is fully developed (1994). By this time the second phase of the Quae Yai
Scihemne would be operational.  This phase which forsees the installation
of two 180 PIN units would also be provided with a downstream re-regulating
pond to serve as a reservoir for pumping water. Releases further downstream
fromi this reservoir xwould be spread over the full day thus providing a
fairly constant river flow downstream eliminating any hazards and improving
navigation conditions.

The results of this study also provided the yearly energy generation and the
weighted average generation for purposes of the economic evaluation of the
power project.
(b) Steady State Operation
The important conclusion to be drawn from this study is
that rated output (360 MW) could be achieved in every
month of the 20 year period. Yearlg average inflow into
the reservoir totals 4347 million m ; ev4poration averages
3 
189 million m ; and spill 17.0 million m . Irrigation
requirements average 3230 million m . There is no shortage
of irrigation water in any month of the 20 year period.
The surface of the reservoir varies between a minirnum of
162.4 m and the maximum of 180.0 m (median minimum level,
168.8 m; and median maximum level 175.4 m confirming the
assumption of initial level made (175.0 m). Average power
for the period is 141.1 MW giving an average plant factor
of 39.4%. Minimum average power is 54 MW (plant factor 15%);
and maximum average power 324 K4 (plant factor 90%). Average
yearly generation is 1230 GWh. Since EGAT's system is a
mixed thermal-hydro system, power available can be readily
and effectively absorbed by the system.
12.       The analysis carried out was also based on the following assumptions:



ANNEX 17
Page 4
(a) rule curves for reservoir operation were established.
(i) upper rule curve. On exceeding this rule curve it
was assumed that power generation would be at full
output;
(ii)  between the rule curves continuous power output
was limited to 90 MW; and
(iii) lower rule curve. When the reservoir drops below
this curve continuous output was reduced to 54 14W
(i.e. 60% of 90 .W)
(b)  turbine efficiencies were established as a function of
available head (varying from 84% at 150.0 m elevation to
92tl at elevations between 165 - 185 m)
(c)  a penstock efficiency of 9L% was assumed corresponding
to a head loss of over 2.3 m;
(d)  a generator efficiency of 97% was assumed;
(e)  evaporation losses were determined as a function of the
storage surface and month;
(f)  energy output is a resultant of flow, head, and machine
efficiencies;
(g)  in determining power output irrigation requirements were
given priority.
13.       The studies carried out, which were based on conservative assump-
tions, indicate the viability of the proposed project and provided essential
date for the economic justification of tne project. Similar studies will
need to be carried out prior to initial impounding to take into account
tlie definite established irrigation requirements and a further five years
of stream records.

GEOLOGY
GE.NERAL
1.        The strata in the vicinity of the damsite comprise the so called
Kanchanaburi Series of the Paleozoic era. West of the damsite there are
metamorphic rocks and to the east there are stocks and batholiths of granite.
The Kanchanaburi series can be divided into 3 formations: A, the lower; B,
the middle; and C the top.
2.        Formation A.  These consist of quartzite, calcareous sandstone,
slate, calcareous shale, and impure limestones. The damsite is located in
this formation. Quartzite is widely distributed while slate is localized.
At the damsite there is calcareous sandstone and an intercalation of impure
limestone. This formation has been subjected to severe folding and thin
layers of argillaceous (clay) rock are considerably crushed.
3.        Formation B.  Consisting of alternations of shaly limestone and
shiale, this formation is found in the flat area on the left bank of the
river and has also been subjected to severe folding.
4.        Formation C.  This formation does not exist in the vicinity of
the damsite. It consists of alternations of sandstone, shale and thin
calcareous facies.
5.        Rat Buri limestone is widely distributed in the area west of the
dairisite and a karstic topography is presented, but limited to an area of
puire Rat Buri limestone and not found in the area of irmpure limestone in
the Kanchanaburi Series.  The axis of folding of the latter series in gen-
erally NWM-SE with the respective strikes of the three formations in the
same direction coinciding with the topography of the Quae Yai River Basin.
n.        The characteristic features are that the rocks of each foriation
are multifarious, but calcareous rocks predominate and there are various
thiickness of limestone with large amounts of impurities.  Prominent faults
are not seen at the dansite.  Strikes and dips of the bedding plane of the
formiations at the damsite are not constant, but as a whole the strikes are
roughly parallel to the river while the dips are either NE or SW. The
foundation rock of the dansite is more severely folded on the left bank
than the riglit bank, and crushing and weathering of rock on the left bank
is more predominant. The rock on the right bank is generally sound.



ANNEX 18
Page   2
7.        The ground water table at the damsite is generally low.  Thke table
is higher than the water level of the river at tne rig'nt abutment following
the topographly.  At the left abutment the level more or less coincides with
the river level extending fairly deep into the mountain side.
RE.SERVOIR GEOLOGY
3.        The reservoir leakage problem can be divided into two:  (a) leakage
from the basal rock of the reservoir; and (b) leakage from the dam founda-
tions and the surroundings.
9.        To the west are metamorphic rocks which comprise the backbone of
the Central liountain Range running NWJ-SE at the boundary between the Quae
Yai and Quae Noi basins. To the east, there are distributions of stocks
and batholiths of granite running parallel to the metamorphic rocks. The
strata between these are the Kanchanaburi Series and the Rat Buri limestone
- a semi consolidated Tertiary svstem and a Quarternary system.
10.       The Kanchanabrui Series may be the parent rock of the metamorphiic
rocks. The intrusion of granite is thought to be later than the deposits
of the Rat Buri limestone.  The geological ages are not clearly known, but
it is assumed that the Kanchanaburi Series are of the Carboniferous period
or earlier and the Rat Buri limestone either of the Carboniferous or
Permian period.
11.       Whilst the Kanchanaburi Series are severely folded, the folding
in the overlying Rat Buri limestone is weak. The only fault found is a
thrust fault running along the western slope of the Central Mountain Range.
12.       Core borings were carried out on the flat areas on both banks of
the damsite. It was found that the elevation of the ground water table at
the flat area of the left bank is at an elevation of between 178-209 m above
sea level, sloping gently towards the reservoir in a NW direction. On the
right bank the ground water table varies between 171-181 m parallel with the
topography. It is considered that water collected on the right bank will
flow into the Quae Yai River upstream of the rigl2t abutment. No cavities
were discovered which could serve as passageways for water.
13.       There should be no fear of leakage froma the reservoir because:
(a) the Rat Buri limestone with developed karstic phenomena is
located above reservoir full supply level (180 m.a.s.l.)
(b) strata underlying the limestone are alternations of calcareous
sandstone, impure shaly limestone and shale. ilo karstic
phenomena were found. There is little possibility of caves
being fromed;
(c)  below the strata mentioned in (b) above, quartzite and slate
is found serving as a barrier against leakage on the eastern
side;



ANNEX 18
Page   3
(d)  metamorphic rock to thie west serves as a barrier against
leakage at the xestern side;
(e)  the major trib)utaries flowing into the Quae Yai have continuous
flowing water at points higher than the reservoir high water
level even in the dry season;
(f)  bore holes drilled on the left and right bank showed the ground
water table to be about equal or higher than reservoir full
supply level; on the vast flat area on the left bank the ground
water table slopes to the N, flowing towards the reservoir; and
(g)  preliminary groutino tests indicate that the water tightness
of the dam foundations can be adequately improved.
DAM'ISITE GROLOGY
Lcft Abutment
14.       Below an elevation of about 100 m, the left abutment is covered
by a thin topsoil layer about 2-3 m dleep. At higher elevations topsoil
thickness is substantially less. At the foot of the slope, terrace deposits
do not exceed 10 ma.
15.       3edrock can be divided into two varieties.  One is calcareous
sancdstone in tlle vicinity of the dar axis from elevation 140 mil to the river
bed.  The othler is qtlartzite above elevation 140 r.i at the dan axis.  Tile
boundary between the two is slightlv sheared and crushed, and the rock is
brittle.
16.       The thickness of calcareous sandstone layers is about 30-150 cm
with intercalations of thin layers of slhaly limestone and quartzite. The
character of the rock is hard, but where folding is severe, crushing and
weathering are predominant and the rock is brittle.  Intercalated shale
tias become clay in most cases.
17.       Ouartzite is less crtuslled and weathlered but has thin clay seamas
along, bedding plaaes.  Rock pieces are haard.  Development of cracking is
prominent and browniish weathered surfaces along the cracks continue to fairly
great del)th,s.  Permeability of these parts at hiigh elevations is therefore
estir,ated to be high.
18.       Below elevation 90-100 Ti there is a fairly large-scale weak zone.
Tae widthi at elevation 6( ma is about 130 m along tiie dam axis and is believed
to continiue in the upstreai-doinistream directioni parallel to the river.
TPere is outcropping of sotund bedroclk at the river bed, and in borings to
a cdeptli of 100 m, this weak zone was not found.  In two exploratory adits
(El.( 60.35 m ancl El, 72.32 m) excavated inT this wealk zone, there exist fairly
thick masses of hard rock in irregular forms.



ANNEX 18
Page   4
19.       The weak zone is seen at a depth of 20 ri from the portal of the
first adit. From this point to 90 m there are repetitions of slightly hard
rock intercalated by thin slheared portions 5-10 m thick and completely crush
weathered zones 3-5 m thick. From 90 m to the face of the adit (at 101.3 m
from the portal) there is a continuation of a completed crushed weathered
zone, although hard quartzite can be found at the bottom part of the facing.
Correlating with a drill hole, it is estimated that the conditions found
in the adit exist over a fairly wide area and deeper into the rock than the
face of the adit.
2').      This weak zone was formed due to the compounding of wieathering
action on the crushed rock following folding. It is expected that the
condition will improve at deeper elevations.  There was no water found at
either of the test adits. Clay is well compacted even in the weak zone.
Preliminary test grouting carried out indicates that cement grouting is
effective to treat this zone.
21.       Besides the weak zone, the left abutment has small-scale faults
at the boundary between calcareous sandstone and quartzite near an eleva-
tion of about 140 m. But there is a wide distribution of hard bedrock above
an elevation of 100 m.  Even at parts of hard rock in the test adits there
are a nwaber of non-continuous small-scale cavities filled with secondary
limae or soil but all are located near the ground surface.
River Bed
22.       Besides small-scale sand and gravel deposits below elevation 65 m
tihere are some sand deposits. However, outcrops of sound quartzite are seen
over wide areas of the river bed in the vicinity of the dam axis. Underlying
these is limestone intercalated with thin layers of shale and calcareous
sandstone. The bedrock at the river bed is generally fresh and sound. There
is no large-scale wealk zone as on the left bank. Cracks are nunerous to a
depth of about 50 m. These are not filled with clay and permeability is
high and the cement grout intake is large.
Rig it Abutment
23.       The rocks on this abutment are calcareous sandstone, quartzite,
shale and limestone. Calcareous sandstone is predominant with other rock
types intercalated in various thiclkness and forms.
24.       Foundation rock is fresh ancd sound and test adits and borings
indficate that the groundwater level is higher than the river water level.
ThIcre are, however, places of severe local folding and there are parts with
crushling and( weathering.  Permeability tests carried out showed favorable
results.



ANNEX 18
Page   5
Evaluation of the Bedrock for Dam Foundation
25.       There is a large wieak zone from the lower to middle part of the
left abutment and many cracks in calcareous sandstone and quartzite at higher
elevation. Weathering reaches deep and permeability is high. In the
preparation of the dam foundation, extremely fissured, weathered and soft
portions will be removed and the weaker portions excavated. The foundation
rock in the river bed is hard and has adequate bearing strengtii for a
rockfill dam. This applies also to the right abutment.
26.       The ground water table has been confirmed by a total of 8 drill
holes. On the left abutment the table is low and at about the same level
as the river. On the right abutment the water table is higher and maintains
a level more or less in agreement with the topography. Preliminary grouting
tests were carried out on the dam axis as were permeability tests. These
tests indicated that caution will be required in the preparation of tile
foundation (see paragraphs 27 to 30). Further grouting tests are necessary
in order to determine the most effective and economic way to consolidate
the foundation.
Dam Foundation Treatment Program
27.       Based on present information derived from geological investiga-
tions, permeability tests, ground water measurements, and preliminary
grouting tests, the following paragraphs summarize the proposed foundation
treatment program which, however, is subject to the results of an extensive
grout testing program to be carried out from January-July 1973.
28.       Besides a grout curtain to prevent leakage, blanket grouting is
to be carried out to prevent not only water seepage but alto to improve
the meclhanical properties of the surface layer of the foundations for
the impervious core of the dam. In particular to secure safety against
piping action at the zone of poor geology at the left abutment, a core
cut-off trench will be provided and the deeper parts grouted. For the
lower parts of the right and left bank and the river bed a foundation
gallery is forseen to enable curtain grouting to be carried out and to
serve as a maintenance and inspection gallery. Curtain and blanket grouting
at the right bank, rim areas and in the vicinity of the intake will be
carried out after excavation.
29.       It will, however, be necessary to modify the present plan as
circumstances dictate by the availability of work performance and new geol-
ogical data.
30.       Objectives.  The i'rcatment Porgram has the following objectives:
(a)  Water tightness.  To reduce permeability to 2 Lugeons -/ but
to accept 5 Lugeons when the depth from the foundation surface
is deeper than 50 m or the dam height is less than 30 m.
1/   1 Lugeon is equivalent to a leakage in liters/min from 1 meter length of
drill hole under a pressure of 10 kg/cm



ANNEX 18
Page   6
(b)  Grout Curtain.  Standard depth 50-70 m and width 5-10 m.
Width of blanket grouting will, however, be 10-15 m and
depending on geological conditions will be carried out over
a part or full width of the impervious core foundation.
(c) Grout Strength. Cement content at least 30%.
(d) Spacing of Grout Curtain Rows. Carried out along the dam
axis in one to three rows. At tlhe river bed and left abut-
ment where permeability is high - 3 rows spaced 3.0 n apart
to a depth of 50-60 m from the excavated surface or from the
grouting tunnel.
Left Bank Saddle
31.       At full reservoir level this saddle is about 200-300 n wide and
500 m along.  The elevation of the top of the saddle is more than 50 m
above full reservoir level, but both the upstream and downstream sides have
deeply eroded ravines. The risk of leakage is therefore great and detailed
geological investigations were carried olut. In the upstream ravine, rock
outcrops can be seen from an elevation of 100-380 m. Rock comprises banded
quartzite with a thickness from 20 cm - 100 cm and with an intercalation of
thini beds of calcareous sandstone.  Above 340 m the rock character is fresh,
soun(d, compact and good.
32.       The downstreain ravine is covered with overburden and has less
outcrops.  From available outcrops it can be considered that the geological
features encountered upstream continue downstream with little change. No
larae scale faults pass through the saddle.
33.       Fresh, sound cores were recovered from drill holes.  Permeability
test gave values of only several Lugeons at depths below 40 m. Sheared
zones encountered are on the whole water tight and compact.  The rock of the
saddle is of relative good quality and leakage froia the reservoir would be
insignificant. Nevertheless, adequate foundation treatment is necessary
to prevent a wash-out of materials in sheared zones and cracks.
Forebay
34.       The forebay connecting to the power intake struicture and spillway
is planned at a location fairly distant from the right dam abutment.  The
rock in this area consists of calcareous sandstone and quartzite intercalated
witlh thtin layers of shale.  Weathered rock is to be found to a depth of only
10-29 m and core recovery was about 100%.  The rock is sound and the bedding
planes are parallel to the slope of the mountain. Attention will, however,
need to be given to excavation to ensure stability of the west side. Per-
meability to a depth of 25 m is high but the rock is virtually impermeable
below 80 m.



ANNEX 18
Page   7
Penstock and Spillway
35.       These structures are close to each other.  Test adits and borings
were carried out. The geology is similar to the forebay. However, since
layers of limestone are intercalated it may be possible that cavities are
uncovered during excavation but should not be detrimental to the structures.
The bedrock has adequate bearing strength for the structures and at the
spillway site is of good quality. The bedding planes at the chute portion
of the spillway are parallel to the mountain slope and precautions need to
be taken to ensure slope stability. This also applies to the penstock area.
Powerhouse
36.       The bedrock is chiefly calcareous sandstone with intercalation of
thin layers of slhale and limestone. In an exploratory adit a cave was found
wqith a width of 8 m filled with talus deposits at the ceiling. This cave is
at a depth of less than 10 m from the ground surface and is considered to be
localized formed by erosion of the thin limestone layer. Borings did not
uncover other caves. The bedrock has adequate bearing strength as a founda-
tion for the power house. Care needs to be taken to stabilize excavated
slopes.
Conclusions
37.       Since EGAT's decision to proceed with investigations in 1968, con-
tinuous geological investigations have been carried out. The engineering
geological conditions encountered have been taken into account in the
design of the structures. Nevertheless, in respect to foundation treatment,
civil engineering and engineering geology judgements will have to be made
as new infortation becomes available. EGAT's decision to retain the
service of individual members of the International Consulting Board is
therefore sound and correct.
38.       EPDC's Design Report is based on substantial information such as
27 exploratory adits with a total length of about 1240 m and 45 drill holes
with a total length of about 2740 m. The cost estimate reflects the results
of investigation and includes only one physical uncertainty. This concerns
tlhe extent of the necessary foundation treatment and the amount of cemient
intake needed for grouting. To determine this EGAT has agreed to an exten-
sive grout testing program to be carried out from January - July 1973. Thie
results of thlis program will be communicated to prospective bidders to
enable them to prepare realistic bids through the removal of the present
uncertainties.  Onice informatiora can no longer serve this purpose the
testing program will be ten;iirated.

1.01      At the request of EGAT, an Ecological Reconnaissance for the Quae
Yai Hydro-Electric Project was carried out by a team from the Asia Institute
of Technology, headed by Professor 14. G. McGarry. A report was completed
on November 4, 1972 summarized below: The objectives of the study were to:
(a) identify potential problems caused by the scheme; and
(b) recomnend action to overcome or satisfactorily minimize
identified problems.
1.02      Apart from hiydro power benefits other benefits can be realized by
the construction of the scheme.  They are:  tourism, fisheries, low flow
augmentation for downstream irrigation and navigation, downstream flood
protection, control of saltwater intrusion and pollution, and communications
in the Quae Yai valley.
1.03      Health and welfare aspects of about 8,000 inhabitants whose homes
would be inundated by the reservoir were investigated.  Consideration was
given to their relocation, changes in occuption, life-style, physical and
social surroundings and recommendations were made. Consideration was given
to the biotic communities of the reservoir area, and the value of forestry
stands in the inundated area was assessed. The potential for aquatic plant
growth in the Quae Yai valley was evaluated and counter measures recommended.
1.ii4     Other aspects considered were (a) possibility of incompatibility
of the scheme's power operations witlh other resource needs of the region;
(b) changes in aesthetic quality of the area; (c) downstream scour; (d)
watershed erosion; and (e) the impact of the dam on ground water levels and
physico-chemical changes in agricultural soils of irrigation areas.
1.05      The Quae Yai basin i, viewed as being of prehistoric and historic
archaeological value; several important finds have been made in the region
in recent years.

2.        SUMARY
2.01      The Quae Yai Hydro-Electric Development, as presently foreseen,
could consist of five dams. The ecological reconnaissance report concerns
itself with the lower-most dam at Ban Chao Nen, the object of the present
appraisal. It was found difficult to extend the reconnaissance to the other
4 dam areas because of (a) their inaccessibility; and (b) insecurity in the
upper reaches.
Health
2.02      For the health survey, more than 1,000 people or 1 in 8 were examined.
The major health problem is malaria which, if not combatted, could seriously
affect the health of persons migrating to the dam during its construction
and the inhabitants of the area thereafter. Filarinsis is currently not a
serious hiealth problem although it is likely to be exacerbated during and
stibsequent to dam construction.  Haemorrhagic fever outbreaks are now cormmon
in Tlailand and vectors were found in the area.  Waterborne parastic diseases
are considered not to be a major threat, although suclh diseases as opis-
thorchiasis and paragonimiasis are likely to be introducedl by in-migrating
laborers from N-E Thailand.  'iost other infections diseases experienced in
Thailand could become a problem unless adequate provisions are made and the
necessary measures taken. All of the above-mentioned diseases may be con-
trolled through adequate health services and eradication programs.
Resettlement
2.03      The reservoir will displace about 8,000 inhabitants.  hle majority
of these are Thais, although a large Karen community exists in tae upper
reacihes. Alono the valley, agriculture and the harvesting of bamboo from
thie forest are tihe major occupations. Acquired earnings are utilized to
purchiase food from downstream as insufficient rice and meat are produced
locally to meet the needs of the valley. Coamunication and transport are
largely by boat.  Villages comprise houses of bamboo and the more solid
tinber construction.
2.(4      Villages are made up of clusters of 5 - 3 lhouses belonging to
closely related people and are situated close to the river. Land holdings
vary from 1 - 50 ha, shifting agriculture is used -- with cultivated areas
normLally 1 - 5 ha.  All of the basin was and remains crowni land.  Because
of the lack of any survey, no inhabitant has a title deed to his land.  The
majority have not acquired the right to use the land they do, but have become
wiell established and enjoy free access to unlimited land.
2.0)5     Most of the people are aware of the proposed scheme, are not pleased
with leaving their homes, but face their future in a fatalistic attitude --
particularly the Thais. The Karens on the other hand express a strong desire
not to be resettled downstream and intend to resettle upstream. Both Thais
and 1Karens would prefer their villages and families remaining as physical
and social entities because of kinship and mutual support.



ANNEX 19.1
Page 3
2.06      Two resettlement sites have been proposed -- both are in the
vicinity of the dam and more investigations into these and alternative
sites is required. The present proposal is to provide relocated inhabitants
with personal loans, land, roads, schools, health stations and compensation
grants. Fair distribution of land remains a problem. The report recommends
that the area and site of compensatory land should not be based on land
exploitation rights previously granted by the government. The valley's
population is used to good soil conditions with plentiful water and a source
of cash income from bamboo harvesting. The later would not be available
on the new sites. Resettlement areas should be provided with adequate
drinking and irrigation water sources and good land for at least subsistence
living. Education extension services should be made available to assist
in the transfer from shifting to conventional upland and irrigation agri-
culture or fishing.
Fauna and Forestr
2.07      Wild life would not be seriously affected and there are commer-
cially exploitable stands of forests in the area proposed for inundation.
Fisheries
2.03      A benefit realized by the construction of other reservoir projects
relate to fisheries. A sizable return from fish production may be expected
-- but fish harvest by dynamite must be prohibited. Inhabitants in the
area could benefit if the number of fishermen are maintained at an optimum
level and sound marketing practices are encouraged and adhered to. The
dam's interference of up and downstream fish migration during spawning cycles
is considered not to be significant in view of the prevalence of lateral
migration patterns of local fish.
Aquatic Plants
2.09      These, which may be a potential problem to reservoir management,
were not found upstream during the reconnaissance, nevertheless it is
considered likely that they do exist and that problems, particularly with
water hyacinth, waterfern, and water lettuce, which were all observed down-
stream in the irrigation areas, could arise. Recommendation as to the metnods
of dealing with such problems have been made such as (a) mechanical control
-- usually inefficient but produces less hazards to fish, wildlife etc;
(b) chemical control -- usually easier, faster and longer lasting (most new
herbicides will not harm crops or fish if used correctly); and (c) biological
control -- well developed at laboratory level, but for Thailand would require
research and development. Control is also possible by the introduction of
certain species of herbevorous fislh.

Irrigation
2.10      There is little likelihood of the Hydro Power Project being
incompatible with the use of the water discharged for irrigation purposes.
Benefits would accrue to downstream navigation and irrigation by low flow
augmentation during the dry season. Likewise, downstream flood control
would benefit durtng the %'ct season.  During the first phase period of the
projects operation (3 x 120 IV = 360 1157) no downstream re-regulating pond
would be provided.  (This pond would form part of the second phase which
would also provide for the installation of two additional 180 MW turbine-
pump units). Thus, daily fluctuations of discharge related to power demand
would initially give rise to peak waves immediately downstream of the dam;
navigation would have to be prohibited from this reach.
Arciaeological Aspects
2.11      Important prehistoric artifacts have been found in the Quae Yai
basin area covering the Pleistocene and the Hoabinhian age through early
farming to the beginings of metallurgy. The Ongba cave, located above the
proposed reservoir's water level, has been found rich in artifactual material.
The deposits date from the early Hoabinhinian occupation (135,000 BC).
The first domestication of plants and stone pottery leading to the develop-
ment of pottery took place in Southeast Asia and provided the idea of agri-
culture to the West. Although sites above the reservoir level would not
be inundated, they would be made more accessible to pillage.
Tourism
2.13      A positive benefit likely to result would be related to tourism --
provided the dam is constructed and maintained in such a way as to minimize
aesthetic deterioration of its immediate vicinity. Some problems relate to
the proposed location of open fluorite mining operations, elevated rock
quarries and transmission line routes.
ilining
2.i4      There is some possibility of heavy metal contamination in the
reservoir from upstream lead mines, particularly if proposed expansion
plans materialize. Further investigation is necessary.
3.        RECOMMIMNDATIONS
3.01      A final decision as to the location of resettlement sites has not
yet been made. Only guidelines are available. Investigations should be
carried out on the proposed and alternative sites. Surveys of existing
upstream inhabitants' holdings and properties should be carried out and a
means of compensation established.  Detailed plans should be drawn up on
resettlement sites to include monetary compensation; administration; health

and1 welfare services; and educational and rehabilitation programs. A
coordinating body should be established (EGAT, the Departments of Public
Welfare, Public Health, Credit and Marketing Cooperatives, Fisheries, Forestry,
RID, Land Cooperative, and Land Developmenit Departments) and a Project
itanager given the responsibility of plan implementation.  It is also recom-
menlded that a separate resettleument site (s) be located upstream for the
Karen people.
3.02      A lhealthl center should be established at the da3asite to be staffed
by a qualified doctor and available to the resettled people and construction
laborers.  Secondary health centers should be located in all sizable resettle-
ment sites. Eradicationi program against malaria, hiaemorrhagic fever and
filariasis should he initiated and expanded. Further investigation is
required to establish wiether the intermediate hosts of waterborne parasitic
diseases are present in the river basin. If found, surveillance of inhab-
itants should be conducted and the epidemaiology of these diseases investi-
gated. The introduction of diseases such as opistorchiasis by way of in-
migrating laborers from other parts of Thailand should be monitored and
preventitive measures taken.
3.03      The consultants recommend that as sooll as possible a dry season
archaeological survey (six montlhs) should be conducted in the watershed.
All valuable artifacts in danger of inundation or made accessible to the
public, should be placed under the protection of the National Museum.
3.04      The benefits associated T,ith fisheries should be realized through
sound management practices. A Department of Fisheries Station should be
located on the reservoir to record catches, control methods of harvest and
cooperate with the Department of Credit and M4arketing Cooperatives in
establishing fish marketing cooperative.
3.05      Aquatic plants are recognized as a potential problem on the
reservoir and in the downstream irrigation system. Provision should be
made for their control.
3.06      Erosion is not considered a threat in terms of reservoir siltation.
However, erosion of topsoil shiould be prevented (construction metlhods and
the practice of shifting agriculture). It is recommended that commercial
exploitation is made of forest stands which are to be inundated and that
timber companies be encouraged to remove all forest stands.
3.07      Fuirther investigations are recommenided into heavy metal contamina-
tion of thie reservoir from lead and zinc miiiing operations.  Iluge quantities
of flourite are to be removed From the vicinity of the damn prior to its
construction.



ANNEX 19.1
Page 6
3.08      If the multi-purpose nature of the dam is to include benefits
through tourism, lowering of tihe high aesthetic quality of the valley should
he avoided. This refers particularly to open mining of flourite, rock
quarries and transmission line locations.
4.        CONCLUSIONS
4.01      Provided the above listed recommendations are implemented, supple-
nentary surveys made and analysed, the consultants -- Asia Institute of
Technology, Prof. Xl. G. McGarry -- are of the opinion that there is no single
ecological consequence or combination of consequences which is of sufficient
importance to deter or preclude construction of the Ouae Yai No. 1 Project.

APPRAISAL OF THE
QUAE YAI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
SELECTED ECOLOGICAL SURVEYS
1.        Following the recommendations of the "Ecological Reconnaissance
Report" of November 1972 described in Annex 19.1 EGAT entrusted the Asia
Institute of Technology to carry out selected ecological surveys. A report
dated January 20, 1974 covered the following fields:
(a) Dry Season Water-Borne Parasitic Diseases;
(b) Heavy Metal Pollution;
(c) Aesthetic Qualities of the Quae Yai Basin; and
(d) Archaelogical surveys of the Quae Yai Basin.
The results of these surveys are summarized in the following sections:
Dry Season Water-Borne Parasitic Diseases
2.        Aquatic fauna having potential of being intermediate hosts for
water-borne parasites were investigated and some domestic and wild animals
thought to be reservoir hosts of such parasites were included. Swamps,
ponds and other water bodies of the basin were considered. The parasites
which were of major importance to this investigation were:
(a) Paragonimus - lung fluke (worm)
(b) Opistorchiasis - liver fluke
(c) Schistosoma - blood fluke
(d) Diphyllobotrium - fish tape work
(e) the filaria Brugia; and
(f) Angiostrongylus - the lung worm
Emphasis was laid on the parasite species which were parasitic in man
although animal parasitic species were also considered.



ANNEX 19.2
Page     2
3.        Neither the parasite itself nor its intermediate hosts of human
schistosomiasis were found above or below the proposed dam site. It was
considered unlikely that schistosamiasis will be a problem north of Ban Lad
Ya in the future (about 50 km below the damsite). However, the possibility
of intermediate hosts inhabiting the Quae Yai basin cannot be ruled out in
view of the geographical and climatological similarities between the Quae
Yai River including its downstream irrigation area and other areas of
Thailand known to be inhabited by schistosoma japonicum.
4.        The liver fluke which is endemic amongst the people of Northeast
Thailand was investigated along the Quae Yai through its intermediate
snail and fish hosts. The snail host was found only in the downstream
irrigation area, but the fish was available all along the Quae Yai. No
metacercariae of the liver fluke were found in fish samples taken. Again,
there is a possibility that the liver fluke will inhabit the Quae Yai basin
in the future. It is likely to be brought there by in-migrating labor from
Northleast Thailand during dam construction.
5.        Both the snail and crab intermediate hosts of the lung fluke
were observed in the Quae Yai valley. The stage is set for its import by
in-migrating labor from central Thailand.
6.        The fish tape worm was observed and is also considered likely
to proliferate consequent to dam construction.
7.        Other water-borne parasites such as Gnathostoma and Angiostrongylus
cantonensis were not observed.
Measures to be taken
8.        A detailed survey of such water borne diseases as schistosomiasis,
paragonimiasis and opistorchiasis of the downstream irrigation area is
required. Although the parasitic agents of these diseases were not found,
several of the intermediate hosts have been detected. AIT recommends that
such a survey be carried out by the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol
University. In conjunction with the survey AIT recommends:
(a) the maintenance of a medical surveillance program during
and after dam construction. Emphasis on in-aigrating labor
and health education; and
(b) medical surveys during and after construction to cover
all important diseases in order to quantify the actual
health impact of dam construction. Such information would
prove invaluable to future water resource development
projects (Mekong).



ANNEX 19.2
Page     3
Heavy Metal Pollution
9.        Heavy metal pollution of water, soil and aquatic fauna resulting
from upstream lead mining and processing was investigated. With the
possible exception of cadium, the levels of heavy metals in the soil are
not considered to be of medical significance giving rise to concern for
public health. Lead contents of the Quae Yai waters were well within the
drinking water limits suggested by WHO, although somewhat higher than levels
considered to have no significant effect on fish, and higher than background
unpolluted levels of natural waters of Thailand and elsewhere. Cadium, zinc
and copper levels were so low as not to give rise to concern for public health.
10.       The p. H., hardness and quiescent characteristics of the proposed
reservoir could well serve to reduce present levels of lead in the Quae
Yai's waters.
Measures recommended
11.       A momitoring program for heavy metals and fluorides should be
initiated at the time of first impoundment of the Quae Yai waters. Specific
emphasis should be laid on heavy metals in the waters of the Huai Khitti
and Huai Dika/Klu, tributaries of the Quae Yai. Waste waters of the Khitti
flotation plant should be treated. A health survey of the Bo Ngam village
should be conducted. If as suspected, either plumbism or the Itai - Itai
disease is evident, then the laborers' village should be moved to an
unpolluted site or the slag washing operation stopped. EGAT should take
steps to ensure the protection of the reservoir from heavy metal pollution.
Pollution control may be effected either by adequate treatment of wastewater
streams or by restriction of mining activities.
Aesthetic Qualities of the Quae Yai Basin
12.       A positive benefit is likely to result as a consequence of the dam
through improved access to the Quae Yai River if the dam is constructed
and maintained to minimize deterioration of the aesthetic qualities of its
surrounds. The Quae Yai is crossed by the famous "bridge on the river Kwai"
and has within its basin historic and prehistoric sites of archaelogical
importance, caves and the very beautiful and popular Erawan Falls.
13.       Problem areas are:
(a) quarry sites for rock-fill material and
soil borrow pits for the earth core;
(b) transmission line route; and
(c) flourite mining operations.



ANNEX 19.2
Page     4
Recommendations
14.       Alternative upstream quarry sites which will eventually be
inundated by the reservoir should be sought after. If these cannot be
found because of the necessary quality, the downstream rock quarry proposed
should be quarried in terraces upon which top-soil should be placed fol-
lowed by reforestation. Likewise the soil borrow areas should be reforested
after soil removal. A transmission line route has been recommended which
would be environmentally and technically acceptable. Increased costs over
other alternatives would be small. Flourite mining operations six kilo-
meters northwest of the dam will leave scars on the hill sides adjacent to
the reservoir. Steps should be taken to return this area as close as
possible to its original condition.
Archaeological Studies
15.       Studies have demonstrated the presence of several archaeological
sites which would be inundated or provided with access resulting in pillage.
The authors of the report recommend further investigations, mapping and
where necessary evacuation of artifacts. It is further recommended that
the National Museum of Fine Arts and/or the Faculty of Archaeology, Silpakorn
University be contacted to implement the recommendations.
Summary
The authors conclusions are summaried as follows:
"Reference is made to the former ecological reconnaissance's several
recommendations not covered by investigations reported upon above, these
recommendations still stand. Apart from these and provided that the above
recommendations are implemented, it is considered that there is no single
ecological consequence or combination of consequences which is of sufficient
importance to deter or preclude construction of the Ban Chao Nen Dam".

ECONOMIC A4ALYSIS
TIIE POWER MARKET
1.       T-he project is one component of EGAT's 1973-1982 generation and
transmission program designed to meet the forecast demand of power and
energy. In 1962, EGAT, respectively its predecessors, was serving a maximum
demiand of _13 11W and was generating 512 MvWh at an annual average load factor
of 51.6%. At the end of 1972, ten years later, maximum demand served by
ECAT had increased to 1030 MW, generation had increased to 5711 GWh, and
the average annual load factor had improved to 63.3%. In a ten year period
therefore, theire was a ten-fold increase in power and energy requirements.
2.        The average annual growth rates for the 1962-1972 period were:
abouit 25% for maximum demand; and about 27% for generatioin.  Growth was not
conistant over the period but varied on an annual basis betweeni 35.9% in
1965/66 and 15%' in 1970/71 for maximum demand; and between 40.6%yo in 1964/65
an(I 17/2% in 1970/71 for generation. The growth of power and energy require-
ments correlated closely with general econotic development.  Growth stiinu-
lants were rapidly rising investments, favorable world rice mlarkets, and
exports of services.  The turniiig point in development came in 1969, due to
a combination in a decline in US military expenditures and transfers, and
a reduction in the prices of rtbber and rice. The growth rate of maximum
demaind served by EGA, fell from 24.1% in 196O/69 to 15% in 1970/71 and in
generation from 27.2% in 1963/69 to 17.2% in 1970/71.  rhe 1971/72 growth
rates, however, showed a recovery to 19.9% for maximum demand and 19.3% for
generation. The reversal of the 1969-71 trend in 1972 is due in part to
vigorous entrepreneurship and adaptable labor.
3.        For Thailand as.a whole, electrical energy generated per capita
rose from 85 IdWh in 1968 to 153 kWh in 1972, at an average annual growth rate
of 15.8%. The total number of electricity consumers increased during the
same period from 694,514 to 967,462 at an average annual growth rate of 8.8%
and generation per consumer increased from 3990 kWh to 6030 kWhl at an average



Ai4NEX 20.1
Page 2
annual growthl rate of 11%. Inspite of these substantial growth rates achieved
in the past only an estimated 17% of the total population of Thailand pre-
sently enjoys the benefits of electricity. Therefore, a substantial latent
demand remains to be served.
4.        In 1968 EGAT was generating 88.6% of all electricity consumed in
Thailand (PEA generated 7.3%; and private generating plants 4.1%). At the
end of 1972, EGAT's share had increased to 92.2%, whilst PEA's share dropped
to 3.47 and private generation increased slightly to 4.4%.  Of all power
sold in 1972 by EGAT (direct sales to industries); MEA; and PEA; residential
sales accounted for 20.4%; industrial and commercial sales for 78.8%; and
street lighting for 0.8%. Residential consumption in the Bangkok metropolitan
area served by 1EA in 1968 amounted to about 1490 kWh/residential consumer
and in 1972 to 2020 kWh, an average annual increase of 8%. In the rest of
the country served by PEA, residential consumption in 1968 amounted to 464
kWhl/consumer and in 1972 to 735 kWh, an average annual increase of 12.1%.
The difference between metropolitan residential consumption and the corre-
sponding consumption in the rest of the country, reflects in part the
purchasing power of the individual but the higher growth rate outside the
metropolitan area also reflects the inprovement of conditions in the pro-
vinces, a factor supporting PEA's load forecast.
5.        The Thai Authorities have given considerable attention to rural
electrification. As of December 1970 of the about 45,000 villages in
Thailand, only about 10% were provided with electricity. Village formation
hlas grown at about 1%. per annum so that twentyfive years from now about
54,000 villages would remain for electrification.  To carry out such a
program within 25 years would require yearly investments in excess of US$25.0
million, substantially beyond the plhysical and financial capability of PEA
to carry out. An initial program was therefore prepared which forsees the
electrification of 500 villages/year for the next five years. Incremental
energy and power demand resulting from such a project is modest, totalling
at the end of the fifth year 25 GWh and about 15 {W. This estimate is
based on electricity consumption per consumer per month of 10 kWh in the
first year of connection, and a coincident demand of about 100 W. By the
end of thie 25th year a rural consumer is estimated to require only 70 kWh/
month at a coincident demand of 300 W.  Thus the effect of such a program
oTI EGAT wrill be small.
6.        By 1982 Thailand's total electrical power and energy requirements
are estimated at about 3390 tW and 19700 GWh respectively.  Of this total
EGAT is estimated to provide for 3260 1111 and 19250 GWh. Thus in 1982 EGAT
will provide for about 96% of all demand and 97.7% of all electrical energy.
The average annual growth rates forecast for 1972-1982 are 12%o for demand
and 13% for energy compared to growth rates achieved 1962-1972 of 25% and
27% respectively. These forecast growth rates are not umreasonable reflect-
ing the substantially larger base. In fact, whilst during 1962-1972
maximum demand increased on average at about 92 MI/year, the increase 197 2-
1982 is about 220 MW/year.



ANNEX 290.1

7.        As mentioned in paragraph 1, the Quac Yai Project constitutes only
one element of EGAT's generation expansion program.  With an installed
capacity in service of 1423 14W, 1024 MW are presently under construction
and are scheduled to be commissioned between now and late 1975. Of this
incremental capacity 600 MI is thermal (IBPR  financed) and 424 MJ hlydro
(IBRD financed 250 14W).  Between early 1976 and end 1978 a further 502 94W
are scheduled for commissioning and with Quae Yai (360 MA) in service at
the end of 1979, available capacity would total 3367.3 MW of which 3260.8 il
are dependable. 50 M is attributable to increased Nam Ngum imports from
Laos. Pages 1 - 6 of Annex 20.2 provide further data on past and future
development of the power market.
CAPABILITY OF QITAE YAI
8.        Quae Yai will be operated witn priority given irrigation require-
ments. An analysis was therefore necessary to determine whether or not a
conflict exists between irrigation and power. As a first step an irrigation
project was developed, primarily resulting in an up-dating of the 1968 RID
Mieklong Irrigation Project Report. The up-dated project is described in
Annex 1 and the operational studies are described in Annex 17. The analysis
carried out showed that there is no serious conflict between power and
irrigation requirements mainly because EGAT's system - a mixed thermal-hydro
system - is very flexible.  In the wet season, when irrigation requirements
are low (Quae Noi and other downstream tributaries provide sufficient water
to meet irrigation needs), the Quae Yai Project will be operated as a peaking-
plant, thus conserving water1 or dry season needs.  In the dry season Quae
Yai would operate as a base - load plant.
ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROJECT
9.        The alternative to Quae Yai would be a thermal development or a
different ,iydro facility providing the same service. In each case, however,
an irrigation dam would be required at or close to the proposed site to
enable inmnlementation of the proposed irrigation development. In such an
event, full dam costs wqould have to be carried by the irrigation develop-
ment, wBhich then would compete with similar developments in other parts of
Thailand. Since no other hydro developments of similar size are ready
for implementation, the only alternative to Quae Yai is a thermal plant
located at or close to the present load center - Bangkok.
1J.       The proposed project was therefore compared to a thermal alterna-
tive uising residual lheavy oil hs fuel.  Thle comparison was carried out over
a period of 50 years, representing the average life of the hydro facility.
The main variables affecting the comparison are the forecast load growth,
the capital costs of each alternative, the price of residual fuel, and the
capital costs and potential benefits of the irrigation development.
1/   This definition refers to plant utilization factors during the respective
periods.

LOAD GROWTH
11.       Since Quae Yai constitutes only one element of EGAT's generation
expansion program, the assumption of different load growths would have no
direct influence on the decision to proceed with the project. Because the
construction period is 7 years, any ch.mge in the load forecast could be
accommodated by accelerating or deferring projects of a shorter construction
period. The energy available from Quae Yai can be econoaically utilized
Anitain EGAT's system independently of load forecast variations normally
assumed, as its output in 1982 would represent only 8.5% of dependable
capacity and only 6.5% of energy demand forecast for that year.
CAPITAL COSTS
12.       Three different values were used for hydro and thermal station
costs.
(a) Thermal power plant. Essentially these are based on the costs
of the Bangkok No. 4 unit. Since this unit is an extension of
an existing power plant, an alloT.ance was also made for site
development costs. Because of increased auxiliary requirements
of a thermal station as compared to a hydro station, off-set
in part by reduced transmission losses, the equivalent thermal
capacity was estimated at 380 MW. Thus the estimated range of
costs with their probabilities are:
(i) M  1450 millions (US$190/kW); probability 0.15
(ii) g 1600 millions (US$210/kW); probability 0.65
(iii) $ 1750 millions (US$230/kW); probability 0.20
The range adopted is equal to $ 300 million or about + 9.4%.
(b) Quae Yai costs. Total costs of Quae Yai (excluding interest
during construction and price contingencies) are estimated
at $ 2684.5 million. This estimate, is considered the base
estimate and a probability of 0.7 was assigned.  A high
estimate of $ 3,000 million was assumed and a low estimate
of $ 2,370 million. Both high and low estimates were
assigned an equal probability of 0.15 each. Thus the range
taken is equal to $ 630 million or aibout + 11.7%.
OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS
14.       The 0 & M costs assumed are based on actual EGAT experience at
their Bhumipol hydro plant and South Bangkok thermal plant reflect, however,
site and plant conditions. They are:

FUEL PRICES
15.       Fuel costs were anlaysed by two independent methods:
(a) based on past fuel contracts; and
(b)  based on world market trends.
The results can be summarized as follows:
EGAT purchases its fuel from a Government-owned refinery and
signs three year contracts. The basic price paid by EGAT remains virtually
constant in a three year period as increases in refinery prices are off-set
by decreases in taxes. The ex-refinery price before tax etc. is presently
$ 0.2814 per liter or about 35.6 US i/million BTU. By 1979 it was calculated
(based on past trends) that the ex-refinery price before tax etc. would
increase to $ 0.455 per liter or about 57.5 US U/million BTU. Thus the
average amnual increase would amount to 8.2%. In comparison Middle East
Crude Oil prices are estimated to increase in-the period 1970-1975 at 8.5%
p. a.
16.  1/   For purposes of the economiic evaluation, the following fuel oil
cost - (net of tax, etc.), valid as of 1979, expressed, however, in 1973 $
were assumed:
Low:      50 US cents/106 BTU  ; Probability  0.10
Base:     55 US cnets/106 BTU  ; Probability  0.65
Eligh:    60 US cents/10  BTU  ; Probability  0.25
(In the economic evaluation of the Pa Mgng hydro development on the Mekong
River a range between 40-60 US cents/10 BTU was utilized).
1/   At the time the analysis were made, the quoted fuel costs appeared
reasonable. Subsequent fuel market developments, however, indicate that
the most probable co9t of fuel in 1979, again expressed in 1973 $, would
be about 150 US l/l0 BTU.



ANNEX 20.1
Page   6
17.       Further fuel cost increases as from 1979 have been allowed for to
reflect increasing world demand, limitedl long-term reserves, growing cost
of exploration, development and shipbuilding costs, etc. The annual growth
rate has been assumed at 5% which is not unreasonable. In addition the
calculated fuel costs were increased by 2% to reflect lube-oil requirements.
18.       The heat rate of the alternative thermal unit was assumed at 8000
BTU/kWh over the useful life of the unit.  (A very favorable assumption)
IRRIGATION1 VEVFLOPiMENT
19.       The assumptions made to evaluate the irrigation project's economic
justification are given in Annex 1.  These may be summarized as follows:
(a) Benefits. They have been assumed to be increases in agri-
cultural production only and natural improvements have been
disregarded since it was assumed that they would be of the
same magnitude for the without-project case as for the with-
project case. Incremental benefits have been estimated by
deducting a 50-year stream of present condition benefits
from the 50-year stream of estimated benefits. Prices used
are estimated farm - or factory gate prices. In most crops
these prices exclude net benefits accruing to the economy
through the marketing process, namely taxes, rents, profits,
etc., thus lowering future total benefits. In the case of
rice, however, benefits accruing to the Government through
Export Premiums and Taxes were added. Dry season benefits
have been assumed to accrue one year after completion of
on-farm works, but existing sugar cane areas were assumed
to suffer a loss of half their annual benefit during on-farm
construction. The development period assumed to reach full
production once on-farm works were completed and supporting
services available, was 5-6 years.
(b) Capital Costs. Past investments in Stage I area and in the
diversion barrage have been treated as sunk costs. Incre-
mental capital costs are summarized as follows:
Stage I Area             8 .388.8 million
Stage II Area        f 2,710.8 million
Total                $ 3,599.8 million or US$173.0 million
The construction period of Stage I would be the years
1973-1984 and for Stage II, 1973-1978 and 1983-1995.
Progress rates would average (based on dry season
irrigated area) 1400 ha/annum in the Stage I area
and 18,000 ha/annum in the Stage II area.



ANNEX 20.1
Page 7
(c) Operation and Maintenance Costs. These would increase
from $ 22.3 million in 1973 to $ 100.2 million in 1995.
For the Stage I distribution system they have been assumed
to commence immediately, while for other area the assump-
tion was made that they would start one year before the
specific distribution systen has been fully developed.
Operation and maintenance of on-farm works were assumed to
begin on completion of these works. Supporting services
were assumed to be established in units serving 50,000 ha.
These units have been assumed to commence operations, and
thus costs, upon full development of any part of a unit.
COST ALLOCATION
20.       The principle of cost allocation between the Royal Irrigation
Department (RID) and EGAT was approved by the Government in March 1970.
The metlhod used to allocate costs was approved by the Co-mittee of Water
Resources in April 1972. This method, the "Separable Costs Remaining
Benefits liethod" is acceptable and resulted in the Government's agreement
to provide EGAT with $ 600 million towards the construction of the project.
RESULTS OF THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
21.       To analyze the economic merits of the proposed project, three
approaches were taken:
(a)  comparison of the proposed project with an oil-
fired steam alternative providing the same
service, with the project bearing:
(i) all costs; and
(ii) all costs less $ 600 million allocated to
irrigation.
The comparison was based on the discounted cash flows of the
two alternatives over a period of 50 years. To allow for
uncertainties, a probability analysis was used to establish
the mean value and range variation of the discount rate which
equalized the present wvorth of the two alternatives, assuming
three different values, with corresponding probabilities
assigned to them, for each of the main variables (capital costs
and fuel costs);
(b) determination of the equalized discount rate of a cost
and benefit stream over 50 years of the Identified
irrigation project downstream of Quae Yai. In carrying
out this analysis it was assumed that:



ANNEX 20.1
Page   8
(i) no Quae Yai costs would be allocated to
irrigation; and
(ii) $ 600 million of Quae Yai costs are
allocated to irrigation; and
(c)  comparison of the proposed project and a downstream
irrigation project with an alternative development
stream containing oil fired steam generation but no
irrigation. Total investment costs, including
operating and maintenance costs of the multipurpose
project were reduced by the incremental benefits
attributable to irrigation, thus giving a net
multipurpose project cost stream. This analysis
was carried out over a period of 50 years.
22.       The equalizing discount rates computed can be summarized as
follows:
(a)  Quae Yai, Power alone (Probability Analysis)

23.       On the assumptions adopted, therefore, which represent a real-
istic assessment of the possible range of values of the main variables,
the equalizing discount rates can be summarized as follows:
(a)  Powqer alone, all costs allocated to power -        11.1% - 14.7%
(b) Power alone11$ 600 million allocated to
irrigation -                                       13.7% - 22.9%
(c)  Irrigation full developm2t, no dam costs
allocated to irrigation -                          16.4% - 24.4%
(d)  Irrigation full developm7t, $ 600 million
allocated to irrigation -                          13.5% - 19.4%
(e) Miultipurpqe project, power and irrigation
combined -                                         12.3% - 21.7%
24.       As a result of the recent development in fuel prices the result8_ -,
given in (a) and (c) of paragraph 22 are.understated. Utilizing the current
estimate for fuel prices in the analysis would increase the mean value of
the equalizing discount rate for (a) from 12.9% to over 18%.  Or otherwise
expressed every $ increase in the cost/barrel of fuel oil above the value
assumed in the July 1973 analysis (US$3.30/barrel) increases the equalizing
discount rate by about 1% for this particular project.

Assumptions in Financial Forecasts
1. *REVENUE
A tariff increase of 4-1/2% on average (1.3 stang) has been
assumed from FY 1975 onwards.
2.        FUEL PRICE
EGAT's fuel price at July 1, 1973 was made up of:
Basic price          28.14 stang/liter - 35.19 US4/1 mill Btu
Excise tax            4.00 stang/liter
Business tax          0.68 stang/liter
Rent for Government-
owned Refinery      7.00 stang/liter
39.82 stang/liter = 49.8 US4/1 mill Btu
This price has been assumed for calculation of fuel costs throughout the
period of the forecasts.
3.        FUEL SURCHARGE
No fuel surcharge has been assumed in the forecasts on the basis
that any increase in the cost of fuel above that prevailing in July 1973
will be offset by the tariff increase to cover fuel cost increases and the
fuel cost adjustment clause.
4.        PURCHASED POWER
With the completion of the Nam Ngum project in Laos (fiscal
year 1972), EGAT plans to import between 230 GWh and 420 GWh per year during
the period fiscal 1974 through 1982. According to EGAT, the price for energy
has been fixed at $ 0.09/kwh; this price, therefore, has been included in
the financial projections.



ANNEX 24

5.        OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND ADMINISTRATION
The forecast of operation and maintenance expenses is based on
a detailed analysis carried out by EGlT of the number and qualificatio*
of staff employed at the end of fiscal year 1972 and of the level of
expenditures other than salaries and wages by each physical facility
(e.g. each generating unit) throughout Thailand. Administration expense
is increased by 10% a year from 1974.
6.        DEPRECIATION
EGAT's depreciation is based on the straight-line method. The
rates were revised in October 1971 to reflect operational experience of
EGAT. The more significant old and new rates are as follows:
Annual Depreciation Rate

Thermal Plants
(Oil and lignite)
Boiler and Accessories                 3%                    4%

7.        INCOME TAX
According to their Acts, EGAT and its predecessors were
required to turn over their total net profits to the Government. Since
none of the entities in fact financially were in a position to live up
to this stipulation, the Government decreed in 1965 that all State
Enterprises should pay instead the equivalent of the corporate income
tax which amounts to about 25% of the net profit. Even this tax, however,
was not paid, and eventually accumulated to $ 204,8 million in EGAT's
books by the end of fiscal year 1969. During negotiations for Loan 655-TH,
the Government agreed to convert the deferred tax amount into a 6%,
15-year loan amortization starting in fiscal year 1973 and to exempt
EGAT from paying income tax to the Government during the period 1970-1976
unless its debt/equity ratio fell below 1:1.2 (i.e. total debt outstanding
would become less than 45.5% of the total capitalization). At the same
time, the Government committed itself to review EGAT's income tax situa-
tion and arrive at a permanent solution before the end of fiscal 1976.
For the reasons explained in the report, the financial forecast assumes
that EGAT w'.ll continue to be exempted from income tax throughout the
1974-82 period.
8.        FORECAST EXTERNAL SOURCES
EGAT's future needs for external funds are estimated to be
obtained as follows:
(a) the proposed IBRD loan of US$75.0 million
equivalent assumed to be at 7.25% for a term
of 26 years including 6 years of grace;
(b)  the proposed OECF loan of US$41.0 million
equivalent assumed to be at 3.25% for a term
of 25 years including 7 years of grace;
(c) agreed loans from OECF for six projects aggre-
gating to US$90.0 million equivalent assumed to
be at 3.25% and 4.5% and for terms ranging from
25 years including 7 years grace to 20 years
including 5 years of grace;
(d) agreed loans from ADB for four projects aggre-
gating to US$65.0 million equivalent assumed to
be at 7.5% and for terms of 22 and 20 years with
4 and 5 years of grace;
(e) small balances to be drawn on suppliers' credits
from Austrian Banks at 4.5% for a term of 20 years
including 5 years of grace;



ANNEX 24
(f) assumed foreign currency loans for: three
nuclear projects, two hydro projects, exten-
sions to existing plant and transmission
expansion on the following terms: IBRD
(7-1/4%, 25 years including 5 years grace),
Export/Import Bank (7-1/2%, 26 years includ-
ing 6 years of grace), ADB (7-1/2%, 25 years
including 5 years of grace), and OECF (3-1/4%,
27 years including 7 years of grace);
(g)  a series of annual loans partially committed
from Government against project expenditure and
import duties. These are assumed to be at 6%
with repayment periods varying up to 26 years
including 6 years of grace;
(h) Government contributions of $ 1,922.0 million
including $ 600 million for the Ban Chao Nen
Project; and
(i) issue of EGAT Bonds of $ 300 million in 1974 at
8.5% for a term of 5 years.
