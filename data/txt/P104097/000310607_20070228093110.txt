                   three single-tranche development policy lending operations.

Description        The proposed operation would support policy and institutional
                   actions to improve the results of one of Vietnam's principal National
                   Target Programs (NTPs) for poverty reduction: the re-designed
                   Programfor Socio-Economic Developmentin Communes Facing
                   Extreme Hardship inEthnic Minority and Mountainous Areas
                   (2006-2010), also known as `Program 135, Phase 2'. This program
                   provides basic infrastructure, production and livelihood support
                   services, and capacity-building support to predominantly ethnic
                   minority communities living in Vietnam's poorest and most remote
                   communes and villages.

Benefits           Consistent with the Vietnam CAS/CPS, and as a complement to
                   ongoing PRSCs and investment operations, the proposed operation
                   would help the GoV to narrow a persistent poverty gap between the
                   targeted areas/population groups and the rest of the country, in a
                   context of otherwise outstanding economic growth and poverty
                   reductionperformance. It would provide a vehicle for IDA and the
                   donor community more broadly to jointly engage the Borrower in a
                   programmatic reform agenda on a strategically important NTPfor
                   poverty reduction, with particular respect to:
                           Poverty targeting of NTP resource allocation;
                       0   Deepening and scaling-up community-driven approaches to
                           planning, managing, operating and maintaining basic
                           infrastructure investments;
                       0   Fiduciary transparency and accountability in program
                           implementation; and
                       0   Process monitoring and impact evaluation.
Risks              Possible risksto success of the proposed operation (section V) are:
                       0   Institutional;
                       0   Fiduciary; and
                       0   Policy-related.
Disbursement       The Credit would be disbursed upon declaration of effectiveness.

Co-financing       A number of bilateral donors and multilateral agencieshave
                   expressedtheir support for NTPs for poverty reduction inVietnam,
                   and participatedin the preparation of the proposed operation.
                   Subject to confirmation, the following donors and agencies intendto
                   contribute resources to the operation through joint or parallel co-
                   financing: Australia, Finland, IFAD (credit), Ireland, Sweden, and
                   the United Kingdom. UNDP,while not co-financing, is providing
                   technical assistance to the re-design of Program 135, Phase 2, and
                   for capacity-building support during its implementation.

                                  I. INTRODUCTION

1.       Overall objectives. The proposed Credit, the first in a programmatic series of three,
would support policy and institutional actions to improve the results of one of Vietnam's
principal National Target Programs (NTP) for poverty reduction: the re-designed `Program
for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship inEthnic Minority
and Mountainous Areas (2006-2010)', known more familiarly in Vietnam as `Program 135,
Phase 2' (P135-2). P135-2 and the particular policy areas that are the focus o f the proposed
series o f operations are judged to represent the best available entry points to a wider,
emerging agenda for systemic change in the way NTPs in Vietnam are conceived and
implemented. This reform agenda aims broadly to promote informed participation and civic
engagement at community level in the Government's targeted public investment programs as
a primary means to improve the results o f these programs. It has important implications for
the prospects that NTPs will contribute as intended in the next five years to narrowing the
persistent poverty gap between lagging areas/ population groups (notably ethnic minorities)
and the rest of the country.

2.       The proposedseries of operationswould providea vehicle for IDA and the wider
donor community jointly to engage the client in this high-priority, strategic reform
agenda. The proposed Credit would support policy and institutional actions to improve the
results of P135-2 with particular reference to: (i)improved poverty targeting o f program
resource allocation; (ii)deepening and scaling-up of community-driven approaches to
planning, managing, operating and maintaining basic rural infrastructure; (iii)enhanced
fiduciary transparency and accountability in program implementation through wider use o f
`social audit' approaches; and (iv) process monitoring and impact evaluation. Critical aspects
o f this reform agenda have already been demonstrated at scale under ongoing IDA- and other
ODA-supported initiatives in Vietnam covering at least a half o f all the provinces, districts
and communes targeted for inclusion in P135-2 (see maps and Annex 7). Those elements o f
the reform agenda supported by the proposed series of operations are described inthe attached
Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1).

3.       The proposed operation would be the first in a programmatic series of three
Development Policy Credits (DPCs) over the life of P135-2 (2006-2010)to support the
sustained implementation of the reformed elements of this Government program in a
progressive,phasedmanner:

            DPCl (US $50 million equivalent) would support those critical aspects of the reform
            agenda around which consensus has substantially been built.The prior actions in this case
            are primarily policy and institutional actions already shown to deliver results through
            strengtheningcommunity-level ownership over the planning, execution, management and
            construction supervision, and operation and maintenance of basic infrastructure
            investments. Some of these would be applied in selected provinces under P135-2 with
            monitoring mechanisms in place to allow Government, IDA and co-financing donors to
            assess results;

                                                 1

        0  DPC2 (US $50 million equivalent) would support the rolling-out in more program
           provinces of the demonstrated policy and institutional actions, and would support
           additional policy and institutional actions relating to other aspects of the reform agenda
           (e.g. sustainability and pro-poor targeting of production- and livelihood-support services),
           following preparatory work with Government in the meantime, supported by parallel
           technical assistance (TA), to help buildconsensus aroundneededreforms;
        0  DPC3 (US $50 million equivalent) would ideally support the rolling-out of critical actions
           relating to the entire reform agenda to all provinces included under the program, and
           perhaps to the Government's future policies and programs intended to sustain the reform
            agenda beyondP135-2andNTPsthemselves.
        0  The operation policy matrix or results framework (Annex 3) describes the main areas of
           the programmatic reform agenda in question, identifies the relevant prior actions for the
            proposed Credit (DPCl), provides indicative policy benchmarks for purposes of
                                         and
            monitoring progress towards the agreed goals. Some policy benchmarks in the results
            framework would form triggers for the preparation of the next DPC operation. Selected
            milestones would also be usedas triggers for separate disbursement by some participating
            bilateral donors prior to the next DPC operation.

4.      Choiceof lendinginstrument/financingmodality. At the current rate of progress in
sustaining widely-shared economic growth and reducing poverty, Vietnam i s expected to
attain middle-income status by around 2010. While Vietnam will not graduate from IDA
within the next five years, its current performance makes a transition to IBRD/IDA blend-
status in the latter half this period highly likely. Strategic choices therefore need to be made
regarding the most appropriate aid modalities for rapidly scaling-up the impact of innovative
approaches supported to date under IDA-supported investment operations - including ways o f
promoting informed participation and civic engagement at community level in targeted public
investment programs - and ensuring their future institutional sustainability.

5.      The Government of Vietnam has gained considerable experience with policy-based
lending instruments over the last five years in implementing a series of annual Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) in support o f its overall policy reform agenda. PRSC5
(approved in June 2006) included as a prior action the Prime Minister's Decision No. 7
approving the re-designed P135-2, and confirming its importance for the Government as an
instrument to help reduce poverty and promote livelihood security inremote and lagging areas
in which ethnic minority groups tend to predominate within the local population. The
proposed series of operations would complement the `macro' reform agenda underpinned by
PRSCs by supporting a program of `meso-level' policy and institutional actions to help scale-
up and sustain the impact of the reformed elements of P135-2. The relevant policy and
institutional actions call for sustained engagement at a program-wide level if their intent i s to
be fully realized inpractice.

6.       Theproposed series of policy-based lending operations offers a powerful vehiclefor
donor coordination around a programmatic reform agenda. Consistent with the Hanoi Core
Statement on Aid Effectiveness (Vietnam's localized version of the Paris Declaration), the
Government o f Vietnam and donor community are agreed that policy-based budget support,
complementedby parallel TA, provides the most appropriate financing modality to help bring
about these strategic outcomes for which P135-2 provides the best available entry point. The
proposed operation has been jointly prepared and would be co-financed by five bilateral
donors (Australia, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, and the UK) and other multilateral agencies
(FAD) in addition to IDA. UNDPis providing parallel TA support, and other bilateral (e.g.

                                                   2

Canada) and multilateral (e.g. EC) agencies have expressed interest injoining the joint donor
budget-support group in the near future. Some o f these agencies would co-finance the
proposed operations jointly with IDA through a Bank-administered trust fund, while others
would co-finance in parallel through bilateral agreements with the Government of Vietnam.
All co-financiers would use a common operation policy matrix or results framework as a basis
for disbursement, including those who propose to disburse annually, including the alternate
years between the IDA-supported operations.

7.       Two alternative lending modalities have been considered and rejected. The first
option would be for IDA to continue to support one or more stand-alone investment
operations or `repeater' projects, more or less aligned to Program 135 Phase 2, with selected
policy and institutional aspects addressed under future PRSCs. The second option would be to
work jointly with both the Government and wider donor community to build consensus
around the necessary harmonization o f procedures (e.g. for public procurement and financial
management, rules governing local contributions to basic infrastructure investments, and so
on), while similarly supporting priority policy actions under future PRSCs. This second
alternative may be thought of as a `sector'-wide approach (SWAP) - or, in this case, program-
based investment lending - in support o f the Government's Program 135 Phase 2.

8.      Policy-based lending is preferred as an aid modality to either of these investment-
lending options. Many important lessons in promoting public participation and civic
engagement within stand-alone, ODA-supported projects have already been learned in
Vietnam, and now call for wider application and institutionalization in a manner that can only
be fully achieved at the level o f and through Government policy. Continued parallel
investment lending could impede the nascent NTP reform agenda during this critical period.
Moreover, while joint IDNdonor financing o f the proposed series o f operations would
amount to less than 30% of the expected total cost o f the Government's P135-2, the policy
and institutional actions supported by these operations would apply to the whole o f P135-2
and in due course to other NTPs as well, thereby achieving substantially greater overall
impact. At this juncture in Vietnam's development, then, policy-based lending i s judged to
offer a more flexible and sustainable approach to strengthening Government's own policy and
institutional framework for promoting informed participation, civic engagement and fiduciary
transparency and accountability in its poverty-targetedpublic investment programs.

                               11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSINVIETNAM

9.      Vietnamhasbeenoneof the bestperformingeconomiesinthe world over the last
decade. Real GDP has on average grown by 7.3 percent per year during 1995-2005 and per
capita income by 6.2 percent per year. The economy has proven resilient to shocks growing
by over 8 percent on average in the last three years despite negative impacts from SARS,
avian influenza, poor weather, high commodity prices, inflation, and anti-dumping suits. In
US dollar terms, income per capita rose from $260 in 1995 to $400 in 2000 to a current level
of $715. At this pace Vietnam would enter the ranks of middle-income countries by
surpassing US $1,000 per capita in 2010.

10.     Vietnam has become increasingly integrated with the world economy, and
formallyjoinedthe WTO inJanuary 2007. Exports have been the main drivers for growth,

and foreign investment has been buoyant in recent years. The main manufacturing exports are
garments, footwear, and wood products, reflecting Vietnam's comparative advantage o f a
low-cost but high-quality labor force. While external demand conditions have been generally
favorable, importantly, the supply response has been made possible by domestic reforms that
have dismantled controls on economic activity and strengthened the investment climate. Key
non-manufacturing exports are crude oil, rice, seafood and coffee. The share o f agriculture in
GDPdeclined from 27 to 21 percent of GDP over 1995-2005 while that of industry rose from
29 to 41 percent over the same period. The services sector picked up in the last two years to
record an average growth of 7.2 percent over 2001-05. Tourism-related services have been
especially buoyant.

11.    The rising importance of the private sector has been a feature of recent growth.
The role of the state sector in manufacturing activity has declined appreciably: from 52
percent in 1995 to under 35 percent in 2006. The rising share o f the private sector i s also
reflected in non-oil exports and bank credit. Macroeconomic policies in Vietnam have been
generally prudent and key economic balances have been maintained at manageable levels.
The government's stance towards fiscal and monetary policies reflects a determination to not
repeat past mistakes that resultedin a short period of hyperinflation in 1992-1996.

12.    The period 2001-2005 was characterized by strong economic growth, with GDP
rising by an average of 7.6 percent per year in real terms (Table 1). GDP grew by 8.4
percent in 2005 and by 8.2 percent in 2006. The government's target growth rate for the next
five years i s 8 percent. In recent years, policy makers have debated the quality versus the
quantity o f growth. While quality debates have included environmental and social equity
dimensions, quality has also been equated with the productivity o f investment. Several
policymakers have stressed the need to enhance productivity, which i s closely linked to better
selection and management of public investment projects.

13.    Investment increased from 31 percent of GDP in 2001 to 36 percent in 2005.
Equally encouraging i s the change in the ownership pattern o f investment. The share o f the
domestic private sector in total investment has risen from 23 percent in 2001 to over 32
percent in 2005, while that of the state-owned sector has declined from about 60 percent to 52
percent. Foreign investment has picked up strongly in the last two years. After reaching a
seven-year high o f 4.2 billion dollars in 2004, FDIcommitments soared to 6.3 billion dollars
in 2005 and nearly 10 billion dollars in 2006. FDI disbursements, including domestic
borrowing byjoint ventures, stood at 3.3 billion dollars (or 6 percent o f GDP) in2005.

14.    Export growth has been robust. Average export growth over 2001-2005 was 21
percent, with a 22 percent increase recorded in 2006. Over the same period, imports grew by
an average 23 percent per year. While the trade balance moved from a surplus of 1.9 percent
o f GDP to a deficit of 6.6 percent over 2001-2003, reflecting the import needs of a rapidly
expanding economy, the deficit has since narrowed significantly and moved into surplus in
2006.

15.    External current account moves to surplus. Strong overseas remittance in-flows
have also been a feature of the recent period. Those operating through formal channels alone
rose from a little over 1 billion dollars in 2001 to nearly 3 billion in 2005. Given the positive
trade balance and continuing highremittance in-flows a current account surplus i s anticipated
in2006. At the same time, annual FDIand ODA inflows remained robust at around2 and 1.8

                                                4

billion dollars respectively. As a result, foreign exchange reserves have risen rapidly from 3.4
billion U S dollars at the end of 2001 to over 11billion dollars by late 2006 (equal to around
11 weeks o f imports). Vietnam's external debt to GDP ratio stood at a manageable 32 percent
at the end of 2005, with similar levels projected for 2006 and 2007. With nearly two-thirds o f
this debt on highly concessional terms, the ratio of debt service payments to exports i s
expected to remain around 5.5 percent.

16.     Inflation has eased but pressures remain. Having been below 4 percent per year up
to 2003, inflation rose sharply to 9.5 percent by the end of 2004, mainly due to supply shocks
stemming from the avian influenza outbreaks, bad weather conditions, and hardened
international commodity prices. The result was a sharp spike in food prices, which account for
nearly 50 percent o f the consumption basket. Inflation declined to 6.6 percent by December
2006, as the effects of supply shocks abated. But the difficult task o f macroeconomic policy
remains to support the government's growth targets without overly exacerbating inflationary
pressures.

17.     Government's current revenue more than covers current expenditure and
borrowing is undertaken only for investment. Government budgetary expenditures have
increased from around 24 percent of GDP in 2001 to over 26 percent in 2005. Capital
expenditures form about a third o f total outlays.      The fiscal deficit, including ODA on-
lending, has ranged from 1.7 percent o f GDP to 3.8 percent, and has been financed without
monetization. Helped by buoyant oil-related receipts, revenues rose from around 22 percent o f
GDP in 2001-02 to over 25 percent in 2004-05. In general, Vietnam has done very well in
terms of raising revenues with state enterprises being dominant contributors o f non-oil
receipts. With increasing privatization, tax administration reforms are becoming necessary: to
cover a growing number of more dispersed enterprises, and with a focus on reorienting the tax
administration towards a more business-friendlytax-payer service culture.

MACROECONOMICOUTLOOKAND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

18.    Reassuringly,publicdebt stood at a manageable43 percentof GDPat the end of
2005. This figure also includes realized contingent liabilities from banking sector reform, off-
budget and guaranteed items. In net present value (NPV) terms, it only amounted. to 33
percent o f GDP, as a large fraction of public debt i s on concessional terms. The main risk to
medium-term debt sustainability stems from contingent liabilities associated with banking
reform. However, the problem i s manageable especially if the recently adopted banking
reform roadmap i s implemented as planned. The risk i s also mitigated to some extent through
equitization proceeds as well as through sale o f currently undervalued collateral, mainly state-
owned land.

19.    A joint Bank-IMFDebtSustainabilityAssessment(DSA)placedVietnamat a low
risk of external debt distress over the period 2006-2011. A DSA was completed in
September 2006 assessing the sustainability o f both external debt and public debt. Vietnam's
external debt ratios would remain below applicable policy-based debt thresholds under the
baseline and under standard stress scenarios, provided that external borrowing policies will
continue to be guided by the prudence that has characterized Vietnam's policies over the last
few years. However, the expansionary policies contained in the SEDP could pose risks to this
relatively benign outlook in the event of a sharp decline in oil prices. Under the baseline
scenario of the DSA, the stock of total external debt i s expected to fall steadily from about 33
percent in 2006 to about 30 percent o f GDP by around 2016 (or, in NPV terms, from 22.4
percent in 2006 to 20.4 by 2016). Public and publicly-guaranteed debt would increase slightly
from about 46 percent o f GDP in 2006 to around 54 percent by 2016 (or, in NPV terms, from
41 percent in 2006 to about 50 percent o f GDP by 2016). Overall, the macroeconomic
framework i s judged to be adequate for the purposes of the proposed operation.

PROGRESSINPOVERTYREDUCTION

20.    Broad-based growth has been accompanied by a continuation of Vietnam's
remarkable record in poverty reduction. Data collected through the Vietnam Household
Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) shows that the percentage of the population living in
poverty has fallen from 58.1 percent in 1993 to 19.5 percent in 2004, implying an average
decline of 3.5 percentage points per year (Table 2). The proportion o f poor people now i s
only about one-third of what it was a decade ago, while measures used to track inequality
suggest that there has been only a modest increase in inequality over that time. The Gini

                                                6

index stands now at 0.37, compared to 0.34 in 1993, 0.35 in 1998 and 0.37 in 2002, though
the Gini index does not reflect big increases in income and expenditure at the very top of the
distribution, which i s a visible trend in Vietnam.                 However, the ratio of per capita
expenditures between the richest and the poorest quintiles has not increased dramatically.
This ratio was 6.27 in 2004, compared to 4.97 in 1993, 5.49 in 1998 and 6.03 in 2002. This
generally inclusive growth pattern explains the unusual speed at which Vietnam has managed
to reduce poverty.

          percentage of the population with expenditures below the food and non-food consumption
          bundle neededto sustain an intake of 2100 calories per person per day. The food poverty
          rate refers to expenditures below the value of the food component of that bundle.

21.     Poverty reduction appears to have accelerated in the past two years.                         This
acceleration could be amplified by a quirk o f the data: the household survey for 2002 was
much larger in scale then the previous ones, but conducted with less supervision and training
o f enumerators. However, a faster reduction in poverty i s in line with the acceleration in
economic growth during 2002-2004, compared with 1998-2002.                         A sharper reduction in
poverty might also reflect an increasing scale of budget transfers to poorer provinces, since
tax-revenue sharing arrangements and equalization grants were introduced in this period. The
public investment program, with its greater emphasis inremote areas duringthe last five-year
plan, might have contributed as well. Rural infrastructure development has benefited farmers
by increasing their access to markets. The proportion of the population living within two
kilometers of an all-weather road increased to 83 percent in 2004, compared to 76 percent in
2002. A more rapid poverty reduction in recent years could also reflect a rise in world prices
for agricultural commodities such as coffee and rice, which are important sources of income
for many rural households.

22.     These impressive achievements sit alongside much slower progress for ethnic
minorities. The recent trends in poverty in Vietnam demonstrate keenly that growth alone
cannot tackle all the problems of poverty and social exclusion. Progress has been more rapid
for the majority Kinh and Chinese population groups, even in when they live in remote and
mountainous areas. In 2004, only 14 percent o f the majority group was living in poverty,
compared to 61 percent of the ethnic minorities. Though the latter account for only 13
percent o f the total population, they now constitute 39 percent of the poor. Their level of
deprivation i s also more severe than for other groups. As o f 2004, the poverty gap for ethnic
minorities was 19.2 percent, while that for poor Kinhpeople was only 2.6 percent. And while
only 4 percent o f the Kinh are food-poor, just over one third of ethnic minority people live
below a food poverty line. Though there i s higher density o f poverty in the delta regions than
in the mountains, the lowland poor are clustered quite close to the poverty line. Sustained
aggregate growth rates o f 7-8 percent per annum are likely to lift these people out of poverty.
The highpoverty gaps for ethnic minorities - particularly those living the North West (where
the poverty gap i s 22.7 percent), the Central Highlands (26.9 percent) and the South Central
Coast (39.5 percent) - suggest that high national growth rates will be far from sufficient to
tackle poverty that i s driven by geography or ethnicity.

23.     Aggregate figures also mask widening disparities in the extent and depth of
poverty between regions. Standard measures of inequality suggest that high growth and
rapid poverty reduction has been accompanied by only very modest increases in inequality.
The Gini coefficient, for example, has risen from 0.34 to 0.37 between 1993 and 2004.
Despite this, consumption data and poverty rates suggest a growing gap between the richest
and poorest regions. In 1998 living standards (measured by per capita consumption) were 3.4
times higher inthe richest region (the South East) than in the poorest region (the North West).
In 1998, the proportion of the population living in poverty in the South East was six times
higher than in the North West. By 2004, the poverty rate in the North West was eleven times
as high as inthe South East.

                            111.   GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

24.     There was a noticeable acceleration, starting around 2001, of the Government's
drive towards relying on market mechanisms, building a multi-stakeholder economy
and further integrating with the region and the world. The vision underlying this drive
was articulated in several strategic plans and documents, including the Ten-Year Socio-
Economic Development Strategy 2001-2010, the Five-Year Socio-Economic Development
Plan (SEDP) 2001-2006, and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
(CPRGS). These strategic plans and documents aimed at building a market economy with a
socialist orientation. They built on the successes o f the renovation process initiated in the late
1980s with Doi Moi, while also preserving the strong poverty focus which has characterized
the reform process o f Vietnam.

25.     The CPRGS, approved in 2002, represented a sharp improvement from earlier
planning documents based on a "command and control" view of the economy. Rather
than spelling out detailed sector-by-sector production targets, the CPRGS focused on
development outcomes such as poverty reduction and other Vietnam Development Goals
(VDGs). Empirical evidence and a broad consultation process were used to identify the
policies best suited to attaining those development outcomes. Efforts were also made to cost
these policies and to align resources towards their attainment. A set of indicators was

                                               8

developed to monitor progress in implementation. Broadly speaking, the reform agenda in the
CPRGS was structured around three main pillars: completing the transition to a market
economy, ensuring social inclusion and environmental sustainability, and building modern
governance.

26.     Other important policy developments have influenced this reform agenda and
are bound to accelerate the pace of change in the coming years. By mid-2003 the
government decided to aim for a rapid accession to the WTO, and succeeded in doing so in
November 2006. In late 2003, a new anti-corruption strategy started to emerge, with the
emphasis shifting from punitive measures to increased transparency and the strengthening o f
the systems through which the government operates. The year 2004 saw the coming into
effect o f the new Budget Law, which makes the National Assembly and People's Councils at
all levels responsible for resource appropriations.

27.     The SEDP 2006-2010 incorporates the main elements of a poverty reduction
strategy. The CPRGS, though approved by the Prime Minister, was formulated on the
marginsof mainstream planning processes and coexisted with the five year SEDP 2001-2005
which was discussed by the Party Congress and approved by the National Assembly. But the
process o f formulating, implementing and monitoring outcomes of the CPRGS initiated
permanent changes in the approach to socio-economic planning. Following Directive 33 o f
the Prime Minister, the SEDP for 2006-2010 was drafted according to the same principles that
had governed the preparation o f the CPRGS. The last year has seen concerted efforts to
reform the mainstream planning process to incorporate these principles, including the
preparation of a clear results-based monitoring framework for the SEDP. Accordingly, the
Bank and other donors intend to use the new SEDP 2006-2010 as a basis for their
development assistance to Vietnam over the same period.

28.     Redressing the persistent gaps inthe extent and depth of poverty among different
regions and ethnic groups has become a major objective of GoV policy. Acknowledging
that growth alone will not address persistent poverty in remote regions and that targeted
assistance i s necessary, the Government has introduced a number of initiatives over recent
years. These include the national target programs (NTPs) for poverty reduction, such as P135
and the Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction-Job Creation (HEPR-JC) program, along
with stronger efforts to ensure that mainstream expenditure delivers benefits in remote areas.
In recent years the norms for allocating recurrent budget expenditure have been adjusted to
incorporate poverty criteria. In 2006 the Government introduced new norms for the allocation
o f investment expenditure, which now include a poverty dimension. Both targeted assistance
and increased budget allocations need to be complemented by land-allocation processes that
suit upland, rain-fed farming systems and common-pool resource management arrangements,
and concerted forest-sector reform in order to deliver sustained positive change for remote
areas.

29.     As an integral part of the SEDP, Government is revamping the NTPs for poverty
reduction, in order to help address the distinct challenges facing communities living in the
poorest and most remote areas o f the country. More specifically, and of most direct relevance
to the proposed operation, Phase 2 o f the Program for Socio-Economic Development in
Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas (more
commonly known as Program 135) has been redesigned on the basis o f lessons from recent
evaluations of Phase 1, implemented over 1998-2005; lessons from parallel, donor-supported

                                                9

initiatives; and an exceptionally thorough process of consultation throughout 2006 involving
key ministries and central agencies in at least ten major workshops, each o f the 43
participating provinces in at least three consultation workshops organized on a regional basis,
and extensive field studies conducted in a number of provinces. P135-2 focuses primarily on
targeted areas within those regions in which ethnic minorities predominate within the local
population, poverty incidence i s highest, and poverty gaps the deepest: the North-West,
North-East, North-Central Coast, Central Highlands, and the Mekong Delta (see maps).

30.      The objectives of P135-2, as expressed in the Government's approved program
document' (see Annex 2 for a fuller summary), are: (a) to facilitate significant improvement in
production knowledge and to accelerate a shift toward higher value-added commodities; (b) to
sustainably improve the socio-cultural life o f people living in communes facing extreme
hardship in ethnic minority and mountainous areas, in order to narrow the gap in living
standards among Vietnam's regions and ethnic groups; and (c) by 2010, to eradicate hunger in
the targeted areas and to reduce the poverty rate to below 30%, according to the
Government's new poverty line2.

31.      These program objectives for P135-2 are also set within the Government's
broader policies for strengthening decentralization, local governance and public
accountability, which increasingly permeate all national programs that make up the SEDP
(2006-2010). P135-2 i s regarded as one o f the Government's main instruments with the
potential to operationalize the `Grassroots Democracy Decree' No. 29/79 (2003); Decision
No. 80 (2005) which provides for community participation in planning, construction and
operation of basic rural infrastructure; and Decision 192 on financial transparency; as steps
towards the building-up o f more responsive and responsible local government institutions
more generally. Accordingly, significant improvements have been introduced in the design of
P135-2 andits implementation arrangementscomparedwith P135 Phase 1, including that it: (a) i s not
limited to basic infrastructure provision alone but also includes significantly increased support
for agricultural production and rural livelihoods; (b) includes criteria for targeting the poorest
villages within poor communes; (c) aims at wider implementation of commune-level investment
ownership; (d) provides more resources for operation andmaintenance(O&M) of basic infrastructure;
and(e)providessignificantlyincreasedsupportfor local-level capacitybuilding.

32.      P135-2 i s designed as a stand-alone target program, and i s planned and accounted for
as a separate component of the provincial government budgets. At the same time,
implementation of the program is guided by a wide range of sectoral and cross-sectoral
policy and legislation. The current re-design of P135-2 and improvements that may be
introduced over the course o f the program also need to be considered in light o f the broader
evolving policy context. This i s particularly with respect to: (a) the on-going Program on
Public Administration Reform (including aspects relating to decentralized budget
management, improved fiduciary control, and strengthening the local government authorities
and administrations); (b) the legislation on local democracy and enhancing these aspects in
program planning and implementation at the grassroots levels; and (c) specific policies on
support for ethnic minorities, economic incentives for remote rural areas, and social assistance
policies for poor households and vulnerable groups. The Attachment in Annex 2 provides a

list o f some o f the most relevant documents that relate to the program, including program-
specific guidelines and important areas o f cross-cutting policy and legislation.

33.      Integrationwith the other programsand policies. According to Decision No.7, a
core principle for P135-2 i s to effectively integrate the program with the implementation o f
other policies and programs in the same areas. Components that are included in P135-2 (and
those which are not) are furthermore determined by the existence o f the other NTPs which
have complementary sets o f policies and interventions. This relates, in particular, to the
measures that are included under Component 4 of P135-2: support for living conditions o f
poor households (improved access to essential social services). The interventions that are
funded under this component are essentially designed to provide additionality to other policy
areas and programs. While the other major NTP for Poverty Reduction (under the Ministry o f
Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, MOLISA) primarily follows a household-based targeting
strategy for the provision of social and financial services to poor households, on a nationwide
basis, P135-2 i s distinct inits geographical targeting and concentration o f additional resources
on ethnic minorities and remote communes and villages. The interventions o f these two
poverty reduction programs should, therefore, be regarded as complementary; for example,
credit supply to poor households through the Bank for Social Policies (under the MOLISA-led
NTP for poverty reduction) might be provided for production support services delivered
through P135-2.

34.      Land policy for ethnic minorities. Recent legislation has provided a stronger basis
for ensuring equitable and stable allocation of residential and production land to
disadvantaged ethnic minority households (through Decision No.134 of 2004), and
specifically for ethnic minority people in the Central Highlands (through Decision No.132 o f
2002) and the allocation o f forests and contractual assignment o f forests for protection to
ethnic minority households and communities in hamlets and villages in the Central Highlands
(through Decision No.304 o f 2005). Accordingly, while land allocation i s not included as a
component under P135-2, the program interventions need to be viewed and implemented in
this wider policy context. Enhancing the coordination between P135-2 and the other sector-
based target programs (in forestry and rural water supply and sanitation) will therefore be
important.

               IV.     BANKSUPPORTTO GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINKTO CAS/CPS

35.      The proposed operation is fully aligned with the Bank's Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) 2007-2011. The CPS is based on the Government's SEDP (2006-2010),
which the Bank and other donors recognize as embodying the main principles of a poverty
reduction strategy, including a clear results orientation. The proposed operation i s most
strongly aligned with the second CPS pillar - `Strengthen social inclusion' - under which it
directly addresses two CPS outcomes o f `better access to services and infrastructure for the
rural poor', and `ethnic minorities in rural areas more fully integrated into development
processes'. It would also contribute to the fourth CPS pillar - `strengthened governance
systems' - particularly with respect to the outcome `modernized planning towards
development objectives, with more participatory approaches'. In addition, the proposed
programmatic series of development policy credits is fully consistent with the strong
emphasis in the CPS on new modalities for delivery o f development assistance, and

                                                11

partnerships between      Government and donors            around program-based      approaches,
underpinned by the Hanoi Core Statement commitments adopted by the Consultative Group
Meeting in 2005. The proposed operation i s included inboth the previous CAS (2003-06) and
new CPS (2007-1 1) as part of the base-case lending scenario.

COLLABORATIONWITH IMFAND OTHER DONORS

36.    The implementation of Vietnam's ambitious reform agenda was initially
supported by the IMF as well, through a PRGF credit approved at the same time as
PRSC 1. The IMF has not had a lending arrangement in Vietnam since the expiry of its
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in April 2004. However, the IMF remains
fully committed to continuing an effective partnership with the government of Vietnam to
support the implementation o f the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(CPRGS). The IMF maintains a regular policy dialogue with the Government through Article
IV consultations, interim staff visits, and its resident representative office in Hanoi, and seeks
to build capacity through training activities in Vietnam and abroad. It supplements this
dialogue with technical assistance in areas of core Fund expertise, including tax policy and
administration,   budget    management,       monetary    and   financial    sector policy,   and
macroeconomic statistics. The IMF continues to cooperate closely with the World Bank in
Vietnam, and to contribute actively to the broader dialogue between the Government and its
development partners. A Fundrelations note i s attached (Annex 5).

37.    Meanwhile,the five PRSCoperationsinVietnam approvedto datehavebeenco-
financed by numerous bilateral and multilateral agencies, either through grants or
through parallel lending. More importantly, the process saw a transition in the role of co-
financiers from providers of finance to partners substantially engaged inthe preparation o f the
operations and conduct of the policy dialogue. This dialogue i s organized by policy areas, in
which donors engage selectively, based on their interests and technical capacity on the
ground. The number o f donors participating in this process has increased from four in PRSC
1to 19 donors for preparation of PRSC 5, of which 11are co-financing.

38.    The proposed series of operations i s expected to serve as an effective vehicle for the
coordination of donor support for the intended reforms in Vietnam's NTPs for poverty
reduction. A number o f bilateral and multilateral agencies - including Australia, Finland,
Ireland, the International Fundfor Agricultural Development (IFAD), Sweden, and the United
Kingdom (UK)- have contributed to the preparation of and expressed interest in providing
joint or parallel co-financing for the proposed series of operations, building on their own
experience in supporting investment operations in selected provinces in parallel with Program
135 Phase 1.Between them this group of donors i s supporting ongoing investment operations
in around 12 provinces (of which 8 are additional to the 19 provinces in which IDA is
supporting relevant investment operations). (Annex 7 and attached maps show the respective
geographical coverage of P135-2 and related ODA-supported projects). Jointly with the Bank,
this core donor group has engaged closely throughout 2005-06 with CEM, MPI and other
agencies in the evaluation o f P135 Phase 1 and the redesign of P135-2, and seeks to support
the institutionalization at a policy level for P135-2 and other NTPs o f innovations already
tried and tested under ODA-supported projects. The United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) has also provided parallel TA assistance throughout this process. Inthe case of the
UK, the Department for International Development (DFID) provided ear-marked or targeted
budget support in the amount of GBP 10 million for the final year (2005) of Program 135

                                                 12

Phase 1, intended as the basis for the proposed series of larger, coordinated budget-support
operations over 2006-2010. Table 3 summarizes the indicative co-financing commitments to
the proposed series o f operations by the core donor group. Other bilateral (e.g. Canada) and
multilateral (e.g. EC) agencies have expressed interest in joining the joint donor budget-
support group in the near future.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

39.     The implementation of the ambitious reform agenda spelled out in the CPRGS and
other strategies and plans has been supportedthrough five PRSC operations to date. PRSC 1,
a two-tranche operation for US$ 250 million, was approved by the Board in June 2001, based
on an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The focus o f PRSC 1 was mainly
on the structural reform agenda, with policies articulated around five main areas: liberalizing
trade, reforming SOEs, strengthening the banking sector, creating an enabling environment
for the private sector, and improving management and transparency in public finances. The
second tranche o f PRSC 1 was released in December 2002.            PRSC 2, a single-tranche
operation for US$ 100 million, was approved by the Board in June 2003, based on the
CPRGS. Under PRSC 2, the range of economic reforms supported by the donor community
was considerably broadened. In addition to the mainly structural reforms covered by PRSC 1,
this second credit included various policy actions aimedat keepingdevelopment inclusive and
buildingmodern governance. Measures related to education and health sectors, environmental
sustainability, land management, legal development and public financial management were all
part of PRSC 2. PRSCs 3, 4 and 5 (this last approved in June 2006) had the same broad
sectoral coverage as PRSC 2.

40.     The proposed series of operations would support the mainstreaming within
P135-2 and scaling-up at the policy level of institutional innovations already
demonstrated under ongoing IDA-supported projects. Most notably these include the
ongoing Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project (NMPRP, Cr. 3572-VN (2002-07),
for U S $110million equivalent plus a DFID co-finance grant of an additional U S $10 million
equivalent) and Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project (CBRIP, Cr. 3532-VN (2002-
07), for US $103 million equivalent), both implemented by M P I and due to close at the end o f
2007. Betweenthem, NMPRP and CBRIP are being implemented in 19 o f the 45 provinces in
which communes have been selected as being eligible for support under P135-2. Out of a total
o fjust over 1,000 communes participating in these two IDA-supported investment operations,

                                               13

more than half (542) are also selected for inclusion under P135-2 (see Annex 7 and maps).
Other IDA-supported operations implemented by MARD support similar interventions under
individual project components as part o f an integrated conservation and development
approach, including the Forest Protection and Rural Development Project (Cr. 2996-VN
(1997-2006), a component for around $10 million) and the Coastal Wetlands Protection and
Development Project (Cr. 3292-VN (1999-2006), a component for around US $10 million).
Relevant lessons in fostering an operations and maintenance `culture', and application o f an
environmental safeguards framework, are also drawn from the Rural Transport I1 and I11
operations implemented by the Ministry o f Transport in the case of rural roads investments
(Cr. 3306-VN (now closed) and Cr. 4150-VN, respectively).

41.     NMPRP and CBRIP broadly aim to promote informed participation and civic
engagement at community level in basic infrastructure provision and, in the case o f NMPRP,
in complementary support for agricultural extension, health and education services as well.
They are the main IDA-supported operations in Vietnam to promote what has come to be
known as a `community-driven development'              (CDD) agenda, through empowering
community groups and devolving to them control over decisions and resources in
participatory investment planning, management, construction supervision, operation and
maintenance. Specific institutional innovations promoted under these projects that distinguish
them from Program 135 Phase 1 include: (a) devolution o f primary responsibility for
investment ownership to commune rather than to district level and, in order to support this, (b)
more extensive capacity building for village representatives, commune- and district-level
officials, to develop skills such as participatory planning, book-keeping and financial
management,     community participation in procurement,           community supervision of
infrastructure construction, and operation and maintenance; (c) the development and wide
dissemination of public informational and other communications outreach materials in ethnic
minority languages and multi-media formats (e.g. posters, leaflets, television and radio
broadcasts); (d) the use of more competitive procurement methods for small-scale public
works at commune and inter-commune levels; (e) the use of community participation in
procurement for village-level schemes using primarily local materials and construction skills;
and (0stronger efforts to monitor processes and evaluate outcomes.

42.     The proposedoperation is designedexplicitly to complement and build on both
the PRSCs and ongoing investment operations. It would support the sustained
implementation o f critical reforms in the design and implementation o f the NTP for poverty
reduction most directly geared to addressing the needs of marginalized ethnic minority
communities concentrated in the poorest, most remote areas o f the country. It would draw on
the demonstrated results from directly relevant, CDD-type investment operations supported
by IDA and other donors that may be readily be applied under P135-2 and other NTPs and
thereby significantly improve their results and effectiveness. It would therefore bridge the gap
between the macro-reform agenda o f the PRSCs and the micro-operational foundations o f
ongoing investment operations by supporting a set o f meso-level policy and institutional
actions between these two levels to scale-up and institutionalize a programmatic reform
agenda.

LESSONSLEARNED

43.     The 2003-2006 CAS Completion Report assesses the Bank Group's recent
assistance to Vietnam to have achieved solid impact across the program. The Bank has

                                              14

been operating in Vietnam since 1993, and the scope of its program has evolved over that
period to cover virtually all sectors. IDA-supported investment projects have contributed to
achieving poverty and social objectives, by improving access to markets, assets, and public
services for lagging regions and the urban poor, and by alleviating growth bottlenecks in
infrastructure. Noteworthy was the impact o f AAA activities which paved the way for
advancing important structural reforms, including trade liberalization, public financial
management, and development of enabling legal and regulatory frameworks for energy, land
and water. The PRSC process was associated with important policy breakthroughs as well, an
increase in education spending, adoption o f a more decisive anti-corruption strategy with
sound analytical underpinnings, and the adoption o f an ambitious roadmap for banking
reform.

44.     The Bank's overall performance is considered satisfactory. The focus o f the CAS,
the design of the overall program and the instruments utilized for interventions were
appropriate. The quality of the work in lending, analytical and advisory activities (AAA), and
partnerships was evaluated by the country team, the Bank's Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) and internal Quality Assurance Group (QAG) to be high, and the impact on policy
development and contributions to CPRGS goals significant. A QAG assessment o f the quality
o f the Bank's AAA program in 2004 rated the program highly satisfactory overall. A Bank-
supported study of Community-Driven Development in Vietnam - prepared in part to provide
an analytical foundation for the proposed operation - was the highest rated o f these AAA
tasks3.

45.     Important lessons from regional and global experience insupporting community-
driven development have been heeded in the preparation of the proposed operation.
Vibrant local development ideally calls for productive, balanced interaction between
empowered communities and capable and responsive local governments. A global evaluation
in 2005 by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED, now the Independent
Evaluation Group, IEG) of the effectiveness o f the Bank's support for community-based and -
driven development found that greater success i s seen in community empowerment where
sustained, long-term support has been provided both to communities and to wider change
processes, and that more attention generally needs to be paid to creating the conditions for
achieving a sustainable institutional impact4. In its 2006 Annual Review of Development
Effectiveness, IEG found that success depends on the extent to which CDD mechanisms
contribute to strengthening both the capacity and the responsiveness of legitimate institutions,
and o f local governments inparticular5.A draft flagship study o f CDD in the East Asia region
shows how the entry points for promoting local government capacity and responsiveness vary
according to particular sets of country conditions, but broadly speaking, improving local
development requires attention to both the supply and demand for effective and responsive
local government services6.The proposed operation has been prepared with a particular view

to meeting the conditions for achieving a sustainable institutional impact as a result of policy
and institutional actions taken by Government to strengthen the capacity and responsiveness
o f local governments and other legitimate institutions.

46.     A number of lessonshave been learned over the last decade or so about how most
appropriately to promote demand for effective local development in Vietnam. This
includes efforts under a wide variety of Government programs and ODA-supported projects
to foster informed participation and civic engagement at community level in targeted public
investment programs, and support the devolution o f control over investments and decisions to
progressively lower levels - ideally to communities themselves. A number o f core themes
stand out, all o f which lend themselves to being addressed at the policy level rather than via
projects and programs alone.

47.     First, adequate institutional capacity building is important for the success of most
CDD-type projects and programs, and policies that aim to institutionalize such an agenda.
Critical in this case appears the need for a well-defined `growth-path' to guide capacity
building at commune level, while due attention also needs to be paid to strengthening of
district and provincial authorities and provincial training institutions (`capacity building for
capacity building'). The adequacy o f capacity building may be assessed in terms o f (a)
sufficient resource allocation (approximately 7-9% of total program spending); (b) a flexible
mechanism for the creative implementation o f capacity building at local levels; (c) a
systematic and comprehensive training program in place; and (d) capacity-building services
delivered through appropriate communications media and in suitable languages.

48.     Second, effective local organizations at commune level are critical for delivering
genuinely pro-poor outcomes from development interventions. Institutions such as Commune
Management Boards and Community Supervision Boards, when properly trained and staffed
-includingadequateprovisionfor village-levelrepresentationofbothmenandwomen-are
an effective catalyst of high performance under the ongoing IDA- and other ODA-supported
projects. But support capacity from the district level i s also a critical factor in facilitating the
effective transfer of investment ownership to communes, because communes need timely and
effective support from the interface level between the policy-making (Le. provincial) and the
implementation (Le. commune) levels. Building on such demonstrated lessons from
experience, the Government o f Vietnam has already begun to mainstream such local
organizational structures into its NTPs and wider policy framework. The Prime Minister's
Decision No. 80 (2005) on community supervision o f infrastructure, for example, calls for
such representative bodies at local level.

49.     Third, poverty targeting and resource allocation mechanisms need to ensure that
remote villages and the poorest groups within them are reached by project and program
investments or targeted budgetary transfers. The resource allocation mechanism used by
Program 135 Phase 1introduced a uniform allocation to communes o f VND 500 million per
commune per year. Allocations during Phase 1 were on the whole found to be pro-poor, but
there i s room for improvement and greater transparency in establishing a formula or other
criteria to determine how those decisions are made. Lessons learned from the ongoing Bank-
supported projects have shown that it i s important to take into account criteria such as level o f
remoteness (from commune center to district center, and from village to commune center);
population size; and some objective measure o f household poverty.


                                               16

50.      Fourth, financial management mechanisms should be                       defined    prior  to
implementation, as should arrangements for M&E and reporting lines and responsibilities.
Experience from many similar projects/ programs have shown that such mechanisms are often
worked out only after projects/ programs have already begun implementation. It has also been
learned, from the implementation of Program 135 Phase 1, that without a functioning M&E
system in place it i s impossible for the Government to track or monitor the progress or
effectiveness o f the program. Inpart this contributed to the perverse trend under P135 Phase 1
of a rising number o f communes becoming eligible for program support even while the
program reported on strong progress in reducing poverty. For financial management, in order
to help reduce the risk o f resource leakage, a system o f regular reconciliation o f program
expenditure accounts between spending units and both M O F and state treasury systems i s
critical.

5 1.     Fifth is the importance of public information and awareness-raising.An effective
communication strategy i s vital to national target programs that aim to reach vulnerable
groups including non-literate people. Information should be made available in various forms
to be clearly intelligible to diverse target groups and audiences with different backgrounds in
terms o f ethnicity, age, gender, and social status. The content o f the message being
communicated must be tailored as appropriate to the target audience. A variety o f
communications media should also be employed, including radio and television broadcasts in
appropriate languages (including ethnic minority languages), public-address systems in
villages, books, leaflets, posters, open forums duringmarket days, and so forth.

52.      Sixth i s the vital importance o f effective procurement methods for small-scale
infrastructure.     Numerous Bank- and donor-supported projects have demonstrated that
transparent and (where appropriate) competitive procurement methods are most likely to
provide assurance of cost-effectiveness and efficiency for small-scale infrastructure
development. A sound procurement strategy provides for economy and efficiency in the use
of public funds, while also ensuring transparency through the `social audit' function o f
community-level oversight over procurement decisions. Not all works contracts should be
competitively procured, however; for very small, labor-intensive works at village level for
which mainly locally available materials and skills are required, Community Participation in
Procurement (or `community contracting') helps build local capacity, creates employment,
and reduces costs.

53.      Some 60 percent o f total spending under P135-2 i s expected to be invested in basic
infrastructure, so such decisions have profound implications for the use of public resources
under NTPs more broadly. A joint Government o f Vietnam-UNDP evaluation o f Program
135 Phase 1found that `one of the most likely areas for leakage i s in the procurement process
for public capital works.. .implemented through [direct] appointing o f contractors.'7 While the
new Procurement Law and implementing guidelines (Decree 111/CP, 2006) establish
competitive procurement methods as the norm for public procurement in Vietnam, they
remain silent on the kinds of procurement challenges faced in most o f the circumstances that
prevail under P135-2, and continue to allow direct contracting on an exceptional basis. A
remaining area o f policy challenge i s to bolster province-led demand for reforms that could
institutionalize more appropriate public procurement methods - including both more

competitive procurement for relatively larger public works, and Community Participation in
Procurement for village-level schemes - thereby reinforcing community-driven development
under P135-2 and other NTPs.

54.     Seventh i s the significance of strong institutional reforms and leadership. For the
success o f P135-2, it will be essential that the leadership and capacity o f the Committee for
Ethnic Minorities (CEM) - the ministerial-level body with overall responsibility for socio-
economic development in ethnic minority and mountainous areas o f Vietnam - be
strengthened in order for program management, coordination and supervision to be effectively
carried out. Decentralization to empower provincial and district authorities to support
communes in the main task o f implementing program activities has been limited in the past
and needs to go further. CEM at central level shall assume the tasks o f overall management
and supervision, oversight o f a functioning M&E system, development o f program
implementation manuals, and coordination with other government agencies to provide quality
and effective support to local authorities in implementing the program. Coordination with
other NTPs, programs and projects i s also vital to ensure that the synergies are realized and
overlaps avoided. These were notable weaknesses in the implementation o f the Program 135
Phase 1, and can best be addressed at the policy level, combined withjudicious use o f TA.

55.     Finally, the need to step up efforts in the operation and maintenance (O&M) o f local
infrastructure has been recognized and reflected in the design and approaches o f relevant
I D A - and donor-supported projects in Vietnam. Government's expectations are that the
burden o f O&M responsibility should be borne by local authorities or participating
communities themselves. But with a rapidly rising stock of basic infrastructure even in
Vietnam's poorest communes, the obligations on local authorities and communities to finance
such costs have become unsustainable. It i s acknowledged that the central budget will need to
compensate for at least some level o f periodic if not also routine maintenance costs. These are
often regressive in their distribution, with poorer areas and communities being called upon to
pay larger amounts given the higher costs of basic infrastructure provision and maintenance in
remote, mountainous areas. This i s a policy issue o f relevance beyond P135-2 and NTPs
alone, and has implications for the way in which the Ministry of Finance (MOF) establishes
levels of intergovernmentalbudgetary transfer.

56.     Many o f the lessons described above have been learned under investment operations.
The weight o f evidence suggests, however, that lasting impact on the ground will be achieved
only if these lessons can be applied at the level of policy and institutional actions on the part
o f the Government to institutionalize the changes that they imply in the ways that NTPs such
as Program 135 operate inpractice.

                                                  public procurement methods was judged to be

                           V.      THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

57.     Development Objective. The proposed Credit, the first in a series of three single-
tranche operations over 2007-2010, would support policy and institutional actions to improve
the results o f Program 135, Phase 2 as an entry point to a wider, emerging agenda for
systemic change in the way NTPs in Vietnam are conceived and implemented. This reform
agenda aims broadly to promote informed participation and civic engagement at community
level in the Government's poverty-targeted public investment programs as a primary means to
improve the results of these programs.

58.     Specifically, the proposed Credit would support policy and institutional actions to
improve the results o f P135-2 in the following four main `meso-level' policy areas: (i)
improved poverty targeting of program resource allocation; (ii)      deepening and scaling-up of
community-driven approaches to planning, managing, operating and maintaining basic rural
infrastructure;    (iii)enhanced fiduciary transparency and accountability in program
implementation through wider use o f `social audit' approaches; and (iv) process monitoring
and impact evaluation. Critical aspects of this reform agenda have already been demonstrated
at scale under ongoing IDA- and other ODA-supported initiatives inVietnam covering at least
a half o f all the provinces and localities targeted for inclusion in P135-2. The proposed series
of operations would also serve as a partnership vehicle for the World Bank and the donor
community jointly to engage the client in this programmatic reform agenda. Good practice
principles inthe preparation and design o f the operation are summarized inBox 1.

59.     Expectedbenefits. The proposed series of operations would support the Government
o f Vietnam to pursue its objectives for the reform o f its NTPs for poverty reduction within a
structured macroeconomic framework, and would enhance the prospects of Vietnam's NTPs
contributing as intended in the next five years to narrowing the persistent poverty gap
between lagging areas/ population groups (notably ethnic minorities) and the rest o f the
country.

60.     Expected results and impacts. The expected results and impacts of the proposed
series of operations over the medium to long term (next ten years) include: (a) public
investment resources better targeted and more effectively delivered to contribute to increasing
the level, security and sustainability o f livelihoods o f ethnic minority households living in
remaining deep pockets o f poverty in remote, upland areas of Vietnam; (b) higher quality and
more cost-effective support services and basic infrastructure used by poor, ethnic minority
households in remote locations to access markets, wage-earning opportunities, education and
health services, and sources o f public information; (c) greater responsiveness of local
authorities to citizens' and communities' demands for more effective service provision; and
(d) a reduction in corruption risks in NTP and other government programs through enhanced
public participation and oversight o f public financial management and procurement.

61.     Proposed sequencing and phasing of policy and institutional actions. The
programmatic reform agenda as it applies specifically to P135-2 i s deliberately phased,
focusing in the first instance (for thefirst operation) on those critical aspects o f the reform
agenda around which consensus has substantially been built. The prior actions inthis case are


                                                 23

primarily policy and institutional actions already shown to deliver results through
strengthening community-level ownership over the planning, execution, management and
construction supervision, and operation and maintenance of basic infrastructure investments.
Some of these may be applied in selected provinces under P135-2 (e.g. those that have already
gained directly relevant experience under ODA-supported projects) with monitoring
mechanisms in place to allow Government, IDA and co-financing donors to assess results and
allow for their subsequent scaling-out to other program provinces.

                          Box 1.GoodPracticePrinciplesonConditionality

Principle 1:Reinforce Ownership

The operation supports the reformed aspects of one of the Government's principal national target programsfor
poverty reduction, identifiedthrough an exceptionally thorough process of consultation throughout 2006
involving central and sub-nationalagencies and field studies. Itbenefits from broad support across at leastfive
participating ministries and44 provinces.Vietnam's impressiveeconomic performanceand overall achievements
inpoverty reduction attestto its track recordinpolicy reform, andprevious Bank supportthrough five PRSCshas
seen steady policy implementation. The operation addresses ahigh-priority, strategic agenda for the country in
contributing to narrowing the poverty gap betweenlagging regions and population groups (notably ethnic
minorities) and the rest of the country. Itrests on solid analytical foundationsthat havehelpedinformpolicy
reforms aiming to promote informed participation andcivic engagement inthe Government's targetedpublic
investmentprogramsinorder to strengthentheir results.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with thegovernmentand otherfinancial partners on a coordinatedaccountability
framework

The Bank`s supportis summarizedinafocusedpolicy matrix or results framework. The operationis the fist ina
proposedprogrammatic series of three over five years, and provides a vehicle for coordinateddonor support to a
strategicreform agendaover this period. Five bilateral donor partners and one other multilateral (IFAD)are
joining with the Bank to provide budget support, all relyingon the same policy matrid results framework. Other
development partnersincluding bilateral donors and international NGOs are also considering aligningtheir
support withthe accountability framework underpinning the proposedseries of operations.

Principle 3: Customizetheaccountabilityframework and modalities of Bank supportto country circumstances

The operationadheres fully to the core principles of the Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness (Vietnam's
localized versionof the Paris Declaration). Itcomplements andbuildson ongoing Bank-supportedinvestment
operationsand macro-levelpolicy lending through PRSCs, and seeks to institutionalize key lessons learned
through reforms in the policy environment shapingthe country's own poverty-targetedprograms and support their
sustainedimplementation inpractice.The policy areas supportedconcernpoverty targeting of public investment,
community-driven approachesto basic infrastructure provision, fiduciary transparencyand accountability, and
country systems for results measurement. They buildonresultsfrom initiatives on the ground inaround ahalf of
all targetedcommunities, and extensive analytical work to synthesizethese lessons from experience,reflecting
evolvingcountry circumstancesand priorities. There are no sensitivepolicy actions in areas such as privatization,
trade liberalization, or subsidy reform, other than actionsto reducerelianceon direct input subsidies inthe
delivery of agricultural extension services.

Principle4: Choose only actions criticalfor achievingresultsas conditionsfor disbursement

Thejointly agreedBanMdonorpolicy matrix uses alimited set of conditions as prior actions (10intotal). Across
the 13 selectedpolicy areas, there are ninetriggers for preparationof the secondproposedoperationinthe series.
The policy matrix alsoincludes actions that some bilateral donor partnersare expectedto use as conditions for
disbursementinthe alternateyears betweenthosejoint operations also supportedby the Bank. Conditionality is
focused on steps consideredcritical to achieving results on the ground, includingadoption of key implementation
guidelines andevidenceof decentralizationof control over decisions and resources to community-level groups.
Conditions also address basic transparencyissues.

Principle5: Conducttransparentprogress reviewsconducivetopredictableandpedonnance-basedf nciul
suppo?$

Future operationsin the proposedseries will be timed to the country's budgetcycle (January-De
year). Financingfrom the current operation will be incorporated into next year's budget. Joint progressreviews
will take place twice each year, timed so as to allow for a predictable review of progressand announcementof
support levels prior to the start of the budgetyear. The results framework includes outcome indicators which will
be assessed as part of operation implementation and are closely linkedto the supportedpolicy actions. Supportfor
the Government's own resultsmeasurement systemi s one of the four priority policy areas inthe policy matrix.
62.       The second operation, expected to be prepared around the mid-term of P135-2 in
2008, would support the rolling-out in more program provinces of those policy and
institutional actions demonstratedthrough the sustained implementation in selected provinces
of the policy and institutional actions supportedunder the first operation. Inaddition, it would
support additional policy and institutional actions relating to other aspects of the reform
agenda (e.g. sustainability and pro-poor targeting of production- and livelihood-support
services), following preparatory work with Government in the meantime, supported by
parallel technical assistance (TA), to help build consensus around needed reforms. The
triggers for the second operation rely heavily on a mid-term review of P135-2, which would
also be supported inpart by parallel TA.

63.       The third operation, expected to be prepared around the end of the implementation
period for P135-2 in 2010, would ideally support the rolling-out of critical actions relating to
the entire reform agenda to all provinces included under the program, and perhaps to the
Government's future policies and programs intended to sustain the reform agenda beyond
P13.5-2 and NTPs themselves. At this stage, the definition of triggers for the third operation
has been left intentionally flexible, and would be defined during the preparation of the second
operation.

64.    Policy matrix. Annex 3 shows the operation policy matrix or results framework
summarizing the program of policy and institutional actions to be supported by the proposed
Credit and indicative triggers for the preparation o f subsequent operations in the series. Policy
and institutional actions are grouped into four major policy areas (intended outcomes are
shown in italics):

   I. PovertyTargeting,including:(a)commune,villageandhouseholdselectionunderP135-
           2 (criteria are pro-poor and effectively applied); (b) program resource allocation (favors
           poorer participating localities); (c) resource allocation for operation and maintenance of
           small-scale infrastructure (outputs are well maintained); and (d) pro-poor orientation of
           production/ livelihoods support (poor households increase incomes and diversify
           livelihoods in a sustainable, market-responsive manner);

   I1*     Decentralization, Participation and Empowerment, including: (a) informed public
           participation in program planning and management (socially inclusive, active and
           informed participation in program planning, implementation and monitoring achieved,
           and NTPs and other forms of public action at commune level effectively coordinated); (b)
           devolution of investment ownership (all P13.5-2communes act as investment ownersfor a
           signifcant share by value of all infrastructure investments, and communities apply
           acquired skills in activities beyond P135-2 alone); and (c) local institutional capacity-
           building support (communities apply learned behaviours in grassroots democracy (e.g.
           supervision of investment) in activities beyond the scope of P135-2);

   111.    Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability, including: (a) procurement for small-scale
           infrastructure (improved cost-effectiveness and quality oJ and citizen satisfaction with,
           built infrastructure); (b) public financial management (transparency and efJiciency in
           public resource use achieved, and adequate oversight over public funds ensured through
           independent audits); and (c) community contributions (local contributions are equitable,
           wage-earning opportunities in public works fully exploited for generation of local
           multiplier effects, especially for thepoorest households); and

   Iv.     Monitoring and Evaluation, including: (a) impact evaluation (evaluation of program
           outcomes perj4ormed to high methodological standard including use of appropriate
           comparator data); and (b) process monitoring (effective and reliable Management
           Information System (MIS) used to track progress towards agreed outcomes and identify/
           resolveprogram management issues).

65.    Co-financingand periodicity of support. The proposed operation has been jointly
prepared and would be co-financed by five bilateral donors (Australia, Finland, Ireland,
Sweden, and the UK) and other multilateral agencies (IFAD) in addition to IDA. Some o f
these agencies would co-finance the proposed operations jointly with IDA through a Bank-
administered trust fund, while others would co-finance in parallel through bilateral
agreements with the Government o f Vietnam. All co-financiers would use the common
operation policy matrix or results framework as a basis for disbursement, including those who
propose to disburse annually, including the alternate years between the IDA-supported
operations. Those co-financiers that would disburse in these alternate years would do so
against intermediate policy actions or benchmarks developed for the rolling, five-year
program (see Annex 3).

66.    Resultsand performancemonitoring. The means of verification to assess whether
or not the policy and institutional actions have been achieved would draw to the extent


                                                  27

possible on a strengthened management information system (MIS), expenditure tracking/
financial reporting, and other monitoring and reporting arrangements under P135-2 (including
citizen report-card surveys as part of an overall participatory monitoring and evaluation
(PM&E) system, and horizontal or cross-learning events from which localities within a region
can share and learn from each others' experiences), and on existing sources o f data generated
by government systems. Chief among these are the Vietnam Household Living Standards
Survey (VHLSS), agricultural census (conducted during 2006 and therefore a valuable
resource for P135-2's baseline survey), and a second round o f poverty mapping work just
beginning, drawing on the VHLSS 2004 and agricultural census 2006.

PARALLEL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

67.     In order for the policy and institutional actions described above to gain traction and
deliver results, complementary TA i s required to ensure that hands-on support, coaching and
mentoring can be provided to support the sustained implementation of the reformed elements
o f P135-2 and ensure that they are realized in practice. This TA i s in addition to and will not
duplicate efforts under the substantial local-level capacity-building support being provided as
an integral component of P135-2, to which Government i s committed to allocating at least 7
percent of total program cost. Interms o f donor co-financing, this TA i s also additional to the
budget support co-financing of the proposed series o f operations as set out in Table 3 above.
Annex 4 provides further details o f existing and planned parallel TA arrangements, a
summaryof which follows here, and indicates how these TA activities are mapped to various
levels o f implementation and policy areas o f the operation results framework. The
Government's P135-2 Partnership Committee, chaired by CEM, provides oversight of all
existing and planned TA.

68.     Sources of TA already mobilized include a US$3 million project supported by UNDP
(VIE/02/001) with financing from the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs, Finland; and UK DFID.

                                                  28

This project covers virtually all aspects of P135-2 re-design and implementation, with C E M
as the primary counterpart agency in the execution of all activities relating to P135-2.
MOLISA also receives support under this project for the re-design o f the NTP for Poverty
Reduction (NTP-PR). FAD, AusAid and Sweden have provided TA to MARD to support the
restructuring o f P135-2's production-support component. The World Bank has provided
technical advice and support in applying high standards of methodological rigor in process
monitoring and impact evaluation and stands ready to mobilize additional resources for this
purpose, should existing sources (e.g. under the UNDP-supported project) prove insufficient.

69.       In addition to these existing forms of TA support, further arrangements are currently
being put in place, under the common oversight o f the P135-2 Partnership Committee. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Finland, is in discussion with CEM concerning supplementary
TA amounting to around US$4 million, focusing on program planning and integration with
other NTPs at local level, the implementation of the P135-2 communication strategy and
public awareness-raising, and strengthening SAV's capacity in performance auditing. The
World Bank and AusAid are in discussion with MPI concerning possible support for a
`learning platform', building on the earlier, successful model of the Partnership to Assist the
Poorest Communes (PAC). This would serve as a valuable mechanism for institutionalizing
within P135-2 lessons from experience under completed and ongoing investment operations,
and for diffusing CDD-type institutional innovations between communities in which they
have already been tried and tested and communities in which they have not. This proposed
learning platform would not be restricted in scope to P135-2 alone, but has wider relevance
for all NTPs.

POLICY AREAS

PovertyTargeting

70.       Description. The first policy area addressed under the proposed operation concerns
the selection o f eligible communes, villages and households for inclusion under P135-2
(targeting in program design), and the criteria used for targeting program resources to
participating communes, villages and households (targeting in program resource allocation
and implementation).

71.       Challenge. Internal and external evaluations of P135 Phase 1 suggest that, by and
large, ex-ante commune selection was pro-poor. That is, the use of the Government's then
prevailing income-based poverty line as part of the basis for commune selection did generally
result in the inclusion o f the country's poorest communes and the exclusion of non- or less-
poor communes. This has been verified ex-post using small-area estimation poverty-mapping
techniques based on data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS)
for1998 and population census data for 19998.

72.       There was little or no attempt in P135-1 implementation and resource allocation,
however, to target program resources towards especially poor villages within the poorest
communes. Resource allocation followed a uniform allocation o f VND 500 million per

* Note, however, that this earlier round of poverty mapping was robust only down to the level of districts and
large communes. The results are weaker for communes having small population sizes -including many of the
remote, upland communes that are the primary focus of P135 - owing to the small size of the relevant household
clusters in the VHLSS.

                                                       29

commune, at least in terms of the allocation o f program funds from the center to participating
provinces. There were no clear criteria for how provinces themselves passed on these
allocations to participating districts and communes, and this was done on an ad hoc basis with
little regard for poverty or other measures. The majority o f investments under P135-1
comprised small-scale infrastructure, and tended to be spatially concentrated in or close to
commune centers, rather than necessarily benefiting more remote and poorer villages.
Opportunities were probably missedto reach ethnic minority communities as a result.

73.     Those aspects o f P135 that were targeted towards households rather than communes
(e.g. support for housing or household-levelproduction support) were extremely limitedunder
Phase 1. In common with similar approaches under the Hunger Eradication and Poverty
Reduction-Job Creation (HEPR-JC) Program, they were also found in an external evaluation
to be less successfully targeted, with relatively low coverage o f the poorest households and
high leakage of program resources to non-poor households. These weaknesses point to the
need for P135 Phase 2 and other NTPs to adopt a more fine-grained approach to poverty
targeting and resource allocation to ensure that pockets of deep poverty are reached at the
village and household levels. The 2004 VHLSS data confirm the persistence of such deep
pockets of poverty, particularly among ethnic minority communities, in spite o f Vietnam's
impressive overall performance inpoverty reduction (see Section 11).

74.     Governmentactions. Inresponse to these past weaknesses inpoverty targeting under
P135 and other NTPs, GoV has undertaken a number of recent actions. First, with the Prime
Minister's Decision No. 170/2005/QD-TTg (July 8, 2005), the official poverty line has been
revised to bring it closer in line with international standards in poverty measurement. In
practice, the pragmatic way even the old poverty line was applied at the local level, combined
with local knowledge, tended to result in accurate identification of poor households (Nga and
Rama 2006), but the new poverty line also ensures a closer correspondence in the overall
results (poverty incidence) with expenditure-based poverty measurement approaches such as
those based on the VHLSS.

75.     Second, and more directly significant for the proposed operation, Government's P135-
2 design now includes the selection of poorer villages within the poorest (`Zone 111')
communes and the poorest villages within somewhat less poor, so-called `Zone 11'
communes. And while program resource transfers from the center to participating provinces
are still based on the aggregation o f uniform notional allocations for each commune and
village, the implementing regulations for P135-2 call specifically for provinces to apply clear
and transparent criteria - including poverty-based measures - for targeting these program
resources differentially to poorer communes and villages. They specifically call for program
resource allocation to be `non-egalitarian'. Third, GoV also plans to undertake a new round o f
poverty mapping in early 2007 based on data from the 2004 VHLSS and 2006 agricultural
census (both conducted by the General Statistical Office, GSO).

76.     Bank's assessment/recommendation.The above policy actions already undertaken
by GoV arejudged to provide a sound basis for stronger poverty targeting under P135-2 and
other NTPs. They go a long way towards addressing the weaknesses in poverty targeting
under P135-1. The new round of poverty mapping planned for 2007 offers an important
opportunity to verify commune selection ex-post (although not village selection, owing to the
small sample size o f household clusters in the VHLSS). The Institute of Labor, Science and
Social Affairs (ILSSA), affiliated with MOLISA, is also conducting an innovative pilot inthe

                                               30

use of proxy measures for predicting poverty rates at the local level, which could also form an
input into such an ex-post assessment of the efficacy of poverty targetingunder P135-2, with
a focus on village and even household selection.

77.     Measures to be undertaken as part of proposed operation.                  In light of this
assessment, it i s proposed to take as prior actions for the proposed operation the key policy
actions that mandate the finer-grained poverty-targeting approach adopted under P135-2. The
overall approach i s described in the program document for P135-2 attached to the Prime
Minister's Decision No. 7/2006/QD-TTg (dated January 10, 2006) approving the program.
More specifically, CEM' s Decision No. 393/2005/QD-UBDT (dated August 29, 2005) sets
out the criteria that provinces are required to use in the selection o f communes and villages
for inclusion under P135-2. These criteria are verifiable and transparent, and include poverty-
based measures (e.g. percentage of poor households according to the new official poverty
line) in addition to geographical characteristics (e.g. topography, accessibility) and
demographic attributes. The overall implementing regulation for P135-2 - Inter-ministerial
Circular No. 676 (dated August 8, 2006) - requires that provinces also allocate program
resources to participating communes and villages on a similarly pro-poor basis.

78.     Looking ahead to the next operation in the proposed programmatic series, it i s
proposed to use as a trigger for the next operation the completion o f the diagnostic studies
described above, includingpoverty mapping and use o f proxy indicators, and their application
in reviewing actual commune and village selection, program resource allocation and
expenditures to date under P135-2 by the time of the program's mid-term review (MTR,
expected in 2008). Further, the Government i s committed to revising its commune and village
selection and program resource allocation criteria in light o f the findings of these studies to be
completed as an input to the MTR. The fact that provinces are given a certain degree of
latitude in how they choose to apply the criteria set out in Decision No. 393 and Inter-
ministerial Circular No. 676 opens up the possibility of comparing outcomes between
provinces in order to derive evidence-based policy recommendations for the revision of the
criteria or designing a common formula to be applied in future.

79.     The trigger(s) for the third and final operation in the proposed programmatic series
concerning this policy area would be similar: using the latest available poverty data and
analyses as a basis for Government to review the efficacy o f poverty targeting in selection and
actual program expenditures under P135-2 overall and, to the extent possible, to extend this
approach to examine the efficacy o f poverty targetingunder other NTPs as well.

Enhancing Sustainability of ProgramInvestment

80.     Description. Also grouped under the broad heading of poverty targeting (Policy Area
I)stheissueofsupportingappropriatepoliciesforfinancingoperationandmaintenancecosts
   i
as a means to ensure that P135-2 infrastructure outputs are well maintained without imposing
too heavy and regressive a burden on poor communities.

81.     Challenge. The challenge faced by Vietnam's poorest communities - and by
extension the Government - is that with a rapidlyrising stock of basic infrastructure in recent
years, the financial and labor burden placed on the country's poorest communities to maintain
these newly created assets has also risen substantially. The social distribution of such costs
tends to be regressive, for two reasons. First, there are higher unit costs involved inproviding


                                                31

and maintaining basic infrastructure in upland communes owing to their rugged topography,
often unstable soils, and vulnerability to flash floods and other natural hazards. And second, it
i s in the poorest, upland communes that basic infrastructure provision has been increasing
most sharply in recent years. Since the Government's position i s that recurrent costs for
operation and maintenance (O&M) be met by local authorities or by the communities that use
the infrastructure, these factors result in the poorest communities paying more for generally
lower quality services.

82.      Governmentactions. An important acknowledgement of this challenge was made in
the program document and outline budget for P135-2 attached to the Prime Minister's
Decision No. 7 (dated January 10, 2006), in that a specific budget line was created for O&M
of infrastructure created under P135-2, amounting to 10 percent of total expenditure on
infrastructure. The view of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, is that these O&M costs
are already accounted for as part of the recurrent, inter-governmental budgetary transfers to
provinces to meet the specific needs of poor districts and communes, and that no additional
resources for this purpose would be made available under P135-2. Moreover, MOF view it as
the responsibility of communities to maintain their infrastructure as a sign of their
commitment to P135-2. Ministry of Construction (MOC) is responsible for drawing up cost
norms to guide budget planning to cover such O&M costs.

83.      Bank's assessment/recommendation.Inview of the ambiguity in the way the P135-
2 budget line for O&M costs i s interpreted among concerned Government ministries and
agencies, and between central, sub-national and local governments, Government's actions to
date in this policy area do not yet qualify as providing an adequatebasis for support under the
proposed operation. However, this policy challenge has such important implications for the
overall poverty-reducing impact of P135-2 that it should be taken up under the next operation
inthe proposed series.

84.      Measures to be undertaken as part of proposed operation. Government has
committed to undertaking several actions prior to the MTR of P135-2 which jointly provide a
basis for moving forwards in this policy area. Building on experience under IDA- and other
ODA-supported projects, Government acknowledges the importance of capacity building for
O&M at community level. O&M groups need to be formed, given legal status to allow them
to hire contractors or skilled local artisans, and provided with capacity-building support (e.g.
simple maintenance and construction skills). These issues may be addressed progressively
under the capacity building component of P135-2. Next, Government is committed to
assessing O&M quality and the adequacy of O&M financing from various sources in the
coming two years of P135-2 implementation, drawing on data to be captured in the program
Management Information System (MIS).These findings will provide an input to the program
MTR and, on the basis of suchevidence, Government i s committed to reviewing the provision
of financing for O&M of public infrastructure in mountainous areas, and to increasing such
provision as needed. This last action is proposed as a trigger for the next operation in the
proposed series. The intermediate policy benchmarks (assessments made of O&M quality and
of O&M financing from various sources) may also be supported in the meantime by certain
bilateral co-financiers.

Pro-poor Orientation of Production/ LivelihoodsSupport

85.     Description. The fourth and last issue under Policy Area I(Poverty Targeting)
concerns the quality o f the policy framework underpinning the production/ livelihoods
support component of P135-2, and specifically the extent to which it meets the needs o f poor
upland households and i s consistent with the broader SEDP goal o f promoting market-
oriented approaches to livelihood diversification, particularly in upland, rainfed areas. This
issue extends well beyond P135-2 itself, and forms a central strategic goal o f the Ministry o f
Agriculture and Rural Development's (MARD) own five-year plan under the Government's
SEDP for 2006- 10.

86.     Challenge. It i s widely acknowledged that past approaches to supporting household
agrarian production and livelihoods have had only modest success in Vietnam's poorest,
upland areas. These approaches have tended to focus heavily on the transfer of technology
most commonly developed for lowland, irrigated farming systems (e.g. improved seeds for
dominant crops such as rice, maize or cassava), and encouraging the wider adoption of such
`models' through the public subsidy o f direct inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and equipment
costs (e.g. for product processing). Program 135 in the past included only modest funding for
such activities, which have been the preferred approach of district agricultural extension
services. Evaluations o f these approaches have shown that they tend to benefit better-off not
poorer households; are not sustainable beyond the term o f the subsidies themselves; cannot be
replicated by other, particularly poorer, households without similar levels o f subsidy; are
insufficiently tailored to the characteristics of upland, rainfed farming systems; and have been
developed in isolation from market signals. For all these reasons, while access to appropriate
livelihood-support services are urgently needed by poor households in Vietnam's poorest,
upland communities, their support under P135-2 calls for quite different approaches if they
are to be effective in increasing incomes and diversifying livelihoods in a sustainable and
market-responsive manner.

87.     Government actions.       In the re-design of P135, it was acknowledged that basic
infrastructure alone would not bring about the intended achievements in poverty reduction.
More needed to be done to promote household-level production skills, economic livelihoods,
and market integration. For this reason, the Government took the important step of allocating
a much greater share o f the total program budget for P135 Phase 2 to production/ livelihood
support than was the case under Phase 1 (from less than 4 percent o f Phase 1 spending to as
much as 20 percent o f Phase 2 resource allocation). More importantly, MARD has revised its
overall strategy for providing support services in upland communities based on
decentralization, farmer demand and market orientation. It has undertaken extensive
consultations in the process of revising this strategy, and has benefited from TA support from
FAD, Sweden, AusAid and other agencies. The revised strategy is reflected in the MARD
Circular 01/2007/BNNPTNT dated January 15, 2007, guiding the implementation o f the
productionsupport component under P135-2.

88.     Bank's assessment/ recommendation. MARD's five-year plan for 2006-10,
developed on the basis o f extensive consultations, and underpinnedby a sound framework for
monitoring and evaluation (M&E), i s considered to be among the strongest sectoral elements
o f the Government's SEDP. These aspects have been recognized and supported through
recent PRSCs. The specific application of these pro-poor, participatory, demand-led and
market-oriented principles in the context o f P135-2's production/livelihoods component i s a

                                                 33

vitally important agenda in the context of narrowing the poverty gap for ethnic minorities in
Vietnam. The Circular developed by MARD to guide the implementation o f activities under
this component is therefore of considerable strategic importance.

89.     Measures to be undertaken as part of proposed operation. The MARD Circular
01/2007/BNNPTNT i s taken as aprior action for the proposed operation. Looking ahead, it i s
vital that the improved elements o f this policy framework be implemented in a sustained
manner. Policy benchmarks to be supported by bilateral and other co-financiers prior to the
next joint IDA/ donor operation in the proposed series would include the piloting o f new
approaches in selected provinces, and operational guidelines developed to ensure the
sustained delivery o f market-oriented, pro-poor livelihood support services, including the
planned phase-out o f subsidies o f direct inputs.As a benchmark to be tracked inpreparing the
next joint operation in the proposed series, it i s proposed that an assessment be made by the
time of the program MTR o f which among these pilot activities i s judged successful and
should be implemented more widely under P135-2's production/ livelihoods-support
component. The end-of-program impact evaluation would assess the extent to which new
practices have been adopted by poor households and the rate o f their diffusion to poor
households outside P135-2, and this evidence, if substantial, might be taken as a prior action
for the third and final operation inthe proposed series.

Decentralization, Participation and Empowerment

90.      Description. The second policy area under the proposed operation concerns support
for decentralization, participation and empowerment, or the deepening and scaling-up o f
community-driven approaches to basic infrastructure provision and household livelihoods
support. There are three distinct issues to be addressed in this area: (i)  promoting informed
public participation in P135-2 planning and management; (ii)devolving investment
ownership to commune level to the extent appropriate; and (iii)     supporting local institutional
capacity building as a critical means to achieve both of the first two objectives. While the
particular policy and institutional actions that form part of the proposed operation arise out o f
lessons from experience chiefly under investment projects, they are addressed at the level o f
the policy framework that would apply to P135-2 and, in due course, to other NTPs as well.
They are therefore far-reaching intheir expected impact.

91.      Challenge. Evaluations of P135 and other NTPs, and assessmentsthat compare levels
of participation and outcomes under ODA-supported projects with NTPs, commonly identify
as weaknesses in the NTPs the degree to which they promote informed public participation,
facilitate the effective coordination of diverse local development efforts in particular
localities, and build institutional capacity for communes and communities themselves to drive
their own development process, including assuming investment ownership responsibility.

92.      Two aspects o f this broad and challenging agenda deserve particular mention. First,
insufficient attention has tended to be paid by the Government in the past to promoting public
access to information and effective communication in appropriate languages and media.
Ethnic minority communities have been especially poorly served, with communications only
inthe dominant Kinh (Vietnamese) language, and usually in written form, ill-suited to those
without literacy skills. This has resulted in low levels of public participation in or awareness
of many NTP activities, notably among women and poorer people living in more remote
villages.

                                                 34

93.     Second, under P135 Phase 1, only around 15 percent o f the 2,200 or so communes
participating in the program actually took on the role of investment ownership - referring to
primary responsibility for the planning, selection, design, contracting, supervision, operation,
and maintenance of basic infrastructure investments in their communes. This i s in spite o f the
original intent of P135 to devolve such responsibilities from districts to communes.
Throughout P135-1, objections were raised by district and provincial authorities concerning
the weak capacity of communes to assume such roles, while too few resources were invested
in helping build such institutional capacity. But experience under a wide variety of ODA-
supported projects has demonstrated that with appropriate levels and forms o f capacity-
building support, communes can be empowered to take on such roles and often deliver
stronger results on the ground. Lessons from experience have also shown that it i s equally
important to build the capacity o f district and provincial authorities to support communes as
they take on such wider responsibilities, including, for example, working with district
treasuries to simplify and streamline procedures and accept `lower'                 standards o f
documentation for very simple community-level works, such as hand-drawn technical designs
and bills o f quantities without official `red stamps',

94.     Government actions. In response to these challenges, the Government has made
some far-reaching changes in the design and implementation arrangements for P135-2, that
are also expected to apply under other NTPs such as the MOLISA-led NTP for Poverty
Reduction (the successor program to HEPR-JC). Some of these build on policy actions
already taken by the Government as supported under previous PRSCs, such as Decision No.
80 on community supervision of infrastructureinvestments.

95.     First, the Committee for Ethnic Minorities (CEM) has formulated a communications
strategy to guide the planning and implementation o f communication activities under PI35-2
by CEM and by implementing agencies at province, district and commune levels. This
strategy and associated action plan will ensure that information about program activities and
opportunities, implementation guidelines and approaches, and other outreach materials be
made publicly available through a wide range o f communications media and in ethnic
minority languages, including posters, leaflets, newspapers, radio, television (e.g. via
provincial stations and the new VTV5 channel which broadcasts mainly in ethnic minority
languages), and other audio-visual formats. Materials will be tailored and packaged to suit the
purposes o f different user groups.

96.     Second, in Decision No.7 approving P135-2, the Government has taken the bold step
of declaring that all communes under P135-2 shall have gained experience as investment
owners over a significant share of the total value o f investments in their localities by the end
of the program. This action i s to be realized progressively through the life o f the program,
matched by appropriate forms o f capacity-building support. CEM i s developing specific
criteria that provinces can apply in determining which communes are ready to assume
investment ownership responsibility from the start of the program, and which communes
would require additional support and capacity-building before they can take on such roles.
These criteria are also expected to include an assessment o f the capacity o f the relevant
district authorities to support communes as they assume these wider responsibilities. This
action also needs to be viewed in the context o f the finer-grained poverty-targeting approach,
which takes the village rather than the commune as the unit of focus for an increasing share o f
infrastructure sub-projects, and would tend to generate schemes that are smaller on average
and simpler intechnical scope.

                                                  35

97.     Third, the Government has substantially increased the level of support under P135-2
for institutional capacity-building at the grassroots (commune and village) levels. Under PI35
Phase 1, such support accounted for only a fraction of one percent of total program cost.
Under Phase 2, support for local-level institutional capacity-building has been increased to a
minimumof 7 percent of total program cost, as confirmed in the Prime Minister's Approval
No. 206mTgt-QHQT (dated February 8, 2007). Component 3 of P135-2 (capacity-building
support) i s specifically concerned with providing training and capacity building support for
commune authorities to implement the program. The policy context for this program
component includes measures that have been taken in recent years to consolidate the staffing
contingent of the grassroots administrations, including both elected officials and public
employees (through Decree No.121, October 2003). The Government has also put in place an
ambitious training program in public administration and technical qualifications for these
elected officials and public employees o f the grassroots administrations (under the Prime
Minister's Decision No.3, January 2006), and has recently reinforced the training program for
ethnic minority cadres        under the wider Public Administration Reform (PAR) program
overseen by the Ministry o f Home Affairs (MOHA). Additional training provided through
P135-2 would complement the broader program by directing additional resources to ethnic
minority areas and other remote communes.

98.     Bank's assessment/ recommendation.Taken together, the above actions on the part
the Government are considered to make a very significant contribution towards achieving the
important strategic goals under this policy area. They promise to promote socially inclusive,
active and informed participation in program planning, implementation, and monitoring, and
will help to foster the effective integration and coordination of NTPs and other forms o f
public action at commune level. They also hold great potential for empowering communities
to apply the skills and behaviors they will acquire in P135-2 activities to other fields o f public
and collective action. The oversight of public investments and budget expenditures more
generally, for example, i s a central pillar o f the Grassroots Democracy Decree (No. 29/79),
but is unlikely to be realized inpractice without further policy and institutional actions such as
those supported by the proposed operation. Circular N0.60 of the Ministry of Finance (June
2003) guides the management o f commune budgets, but with respect primarilyto communes'
recurrent administrative budgets rather than to their investment budgets. The provisions under
the implementing regulations         and guidelines for P135-2 therefore have important
ramifications for targeted public investment programs more generally.

99.     Measuresto beundertakenas partof proposedoperation. As part of the proposed
operation, three policy and institutional actions are considered as prior actions in this broad
policy area. First i s the formulation by C E M of the communications strategy described above.
Together with the specific provision made in P135-2's capacity-building plan to support
participatory planning at the village and commune levels, this will serve as a primary means
of ensuring the integration of and synergy among P135-2 and other NTP activities at the local
level. The second prior action i s the development by C E M o f specific guidance to provinces
on transparent criteria to be used to determine commune readiness to assume investment
ownership responsibility. By the time o f negotiations for the proposed operation, this
guidance had been circulated to relevant ministries, agencies and provinces for comment and
it was expected that the guidance would be issued by the end of March, 2007. The thirdprior
action is the Prime Minister's Approval No. 206RTg-QHQT (dated February 8, 2007)
committing Government to allocating a minimum of 7 percent of total program cost to local-
level institutional capacity building.

                                                36

100. Looking forward, several policy benchmarks would be tracked over the next two years
or so, with the possible support o f co-financing donors in an interim operation. Specific
indicators are to be developed to measure progress in practice in the application of the
communications strategy and use being made o f various outreach materials, and would be
monitored through the program's participatory monitoring and evaluation (PM&E) system.
The same i s also true in the case of assessing informed participation in planning and
implementation. A second, priority policy benchmark would be for PPCs to grant investment
ownership to all P135-2 communes with prior experience o f investment ownership under state
or ODA-supported programs and projects (at least 35 percent o f all P135-2 communes) for
2007. A third policy benchmark would be the adoption o f an institutional capacity-building
plan to be carried out with support under component 3 of P135-2.

 101.   Beyond these intermediate policy benchmarks, the prioritized triggers for the next
joint IDNdonor operation in the proposed series would be: first, that at least 60 percent o f all
P135-2 communes are acting as investment owners under the program by 2008; and second,
that at least 60 percent of program communes and villages have been supported in
participatory investment planning, ensuring the coordination o f public investments from
various sources.

Fiduciary Transparency andAccountability

 102.   Description. The thirdpolicy area concerns fiduciary transparency and accountability
inP135-2 implementation. This is particularly important given the highperceivedlevel of risk
in highly decentralized, poverty-targeted public investment programs operating in localities
with generally weak institutional capacity. A central premise o f the proposed series o f
operations i s that these issues are best addressed at the policy level, and that corruption
vulnerabilities and collusive practices can best be reduced through wider use o f `social audit'
approaches such as those that have already been promoted under a wide variety o f
community-driven development (CDD) projects in Vietnam. Three sets o f specific policy and
institutional actions have been prioritized in this broad policy area: (i)
                                                                        procurement for small-
scale infrastructure; (ii)public financial management and auditing; and (iii)community
contributions. These sets of policy actions should be viewed as complementary to the two
policy areas already discussed, since active and informed participation in public investments
can only be achieved where community groups are empowered to take on appropriate
procurement and social audit responsibilities.

 103.    Challenge. Internal and external evaluations of P135 Phase 1, and the joint IDA/
Government Public Expenditure Review-Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-FA) in 2004
(updated in 2005), found that fiduciary controls in public expenditure management under
P135 and some other NTPs were stronger than many critics had thought. While they were also
found to represent reasonable value for money, there was judged to be considerable scope to
improve the cost-effectiveness o f investments made, particularly through the use of more
transparent and competitive public procurement methods. Experience under IDA- and other
ODA-supported projects has demonstrated, at scale, that such methods are appropriate and
generally practicable under the circumstances in which P135-2 operates, and that they can
deliver stronger results on the ground when applied consistently. Important opportunities were
also missed under P135 Phase 1 to ensure that appropriate procurement methods be used to
maximize local employment generation. A number of important lessons have been learned
under DFID's targeted budget support to P135 Phase 1 in 2005 regarding public financial

                                                37

management, and highlighted the need for Government actions to ensure the reconciliation of
expenditures between spending agencies and the State Treasury o f Vietnam (STV) system;
the preparation of clear statements of actual fund flow down to investment-owner level; and
public disclosure o f expenditure reports.

104.    Government actions. Procurement: Inter-ministerial Circular No. 676 for P135-2
states that procurement of civil works will be conducted in accordance with the Law on
Procurement, for which Decree 111/CP guiding its implementation has recently been issued.
While this implies greater use o f competitive procurement methods than was the case under
Phase 1o f Program 135, inpractice most infrastructure under P135-2 still falls in the category
of allowable exception for which Direct Contracting may be used (all civil works contracts
under 1billion dong in value, which are expected to account for a substantial proportion o f all
contracts under the infrastructure component o f the program). Inter-ministerial Circular No.
676 for P135-2 continues to allow a wide range o f goods, works and consulting services to be
directly procured without competition. The Law on Procurement does not mandate the use o f
Directing Contracting for small-value procurement, however, and local authorities are entitled
to use more competitive methods if they so wish, which opens up the possibility o f
encouragingvoluntary good practice on the part o f provincial authorities.

105.    Inter-ministerial Circular No. 676 also makes provision for small-value, labor-
intensive works to be contracted directly with local communities to help them generate local
employment opportunities. While this i s highly appropriate and desirable, particularly given
the intention for P135-2 to invest more in small-scale, labor-intensive works at village level,
Community Participation in Procurement i s not yet provided for under the Law on
Procurement, and may therefore require the endorsement of the Prime Minister in accordance
with Article 24 o f the Procurement Law (`Selection of Contractors under Special
Circumstances').

106.    Financial management: The budgetary planning and management system that i s being
put in place for P135-2 i s in accordance with the Government's overall PAR Program (2001-
20lo), specifically with respect to the decentralization of state management responsibilities to
the provincial government authorities (under Resolution No.8, June 2004), detailed
regulations on implementation o f the State Budget Law from 2002 (under Decree N0.60 o f
June 2003), and guidelines on management and administration of the National Target
Programs (under the Prime Minister's Decision No.42, March 2002). This legislation assigns
the rights o f decision-making for program resource allocation to the Provincial People's
Councils, and executive authority and accountability to the Provincial People's Committees.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) i s currently drafting revised regulations on financial
management arrangements under all NTPs including P135-2 that will consolidate and
streamline these arrangements across the different programs. MOF has also committed to
takingthe actions under P135-2that were piloted under DFIDsupport to P135-1 in2005.

107.    Auditing: under the State Audit Law, the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV), Vietnam's
supreme audit authority, now reports directly to the National Assembly rather than to the
Government, and i s therefore considered an independent auditor. The Audit Law also
provides for not only compliance audits, which were until recently the norm in Vietnam, at
least under NTPs, but also for full financial and performance audits to be performed on public
expenditure programs including NTPs.


                                               38

108.    Bank's assessment/recommendation.The actions already taken by Government in
the area of fiduciary transparency and accountability are steps in a positive direction, but will
require sustained support throughout the course of P135-2 if their potential i s to be fully
realized in practice. If consistently and transparently implemented, they have the potential to
significantly improve the cost-effectiveness of, and citizen satisfaction with, built
infrastructure under P135-2 and other NTPs; improve the transparency and efficiency o f
public resource use; ensure adequate oversight over public funds; and ensure that wage-
earning opportunities in public works are fully exploited to generate local economic multiplier
effects, especially for the poorest households. On civil works procurement in particular,
however, the current legal framework still falls some way short of encouraging the use o f
procurement methods that will promote economy and efficiency.

109.    Measures to be undertaken as part of proposed operation. The prior actions
selected in this policy area under the proposed operation should be regarded as important, if
limited, initial steps towards the institutionalization o f the above agenda. Their sustained
implementation would be supported by subsequent operations inthe proposed series.

110.    For public financial management, the prior actions already taken are that M O F has
issued Guidance No. 2849 (dated December 29, 2006), giving instructions for MOF to
prepare processes and procedures for fund-flow reflecting the provision o f funds from the
state budget to each spending agency at central, provincial, district and commune levels; and
quarterly financial reports and reconciliation of P135-2 expenditures between spending
agencies and state treasury.

111.    For auditing, the prior action supported by the proposed operation i s the issuance by
SAV in January 2007 o f a multi-year audit plan for P135-2 that provides for the scope o f
annual audits, acceptable to donors, with a view to progressively increasing the number o f
sample provinces audited by at least 20 percent each year; annual audit reports for P135-2 to
be submitted within six months of the end o f each financial year, beginning with 2007; and
the engagement of independent external auditors, as may be necessary. Donors have
committed to providing parallel TA support to SAV to help strengthen its capacity to conduct
performance audits as required under the State Audit Law, including financing for the
engagement of independent external auditors to conduct performance audits jointly with SAV
staff.

112.    For community contributions, the prior action i s the stipulation in Inter-ministerial
Circular No. 676 that compulsory local contributions shall be affordable; that the poorest
households shall be exempted from compulsory cash contributions; and that mechanisms shall
be developed to promote paid local labor in civil works, with priority given to poor
households in wage-earning opportunities.

113.    The triggers for subsequent operations in the proposed programmatic series essentially
relate to the sustained implementation o f this policy agenda, and its progressive roll-out on as
wide a geographical scale as possible under P135-2. For public financial management, the
main trigger for subsequent operations in the series i s to ensure that semi-annual (six
monthly) financial reports on program resource allocation, transfer and spending down to
provincial level are publicly disclosed via the M O F website. In addition, triggers would
include ensuring that the prior actions identified above are being adhered to in practice and
monitored in program implementation. A supplementary trigger might be widening the basis

                                                39

on which financial reports are publicly disclosed, such as via CEM's and PPCs' websites as
well as via MOF's website.

114.    For procurement, triggers for subsequent operations concern a progressive increase in
the proportion of contracts awarded under P135-2 through open and competitive bidding
and/or other non-Direct Contracting methods, such as Community Participation in
Procurement. These should comprise at least 50 percent and at least 80 percent of awarded
civil-works contracts respectively for the two subsequent proposed operations. These targets
are held to be ambitious but achievable. All provinces should be required to use open and
competitive bidding and/or other non-Direct Contracting methods by the end o f the program,
while Direct Contracting shall be allowed only under exceptional circumstances subject to
detailed justification. Outcomes will be monitored through the Government's own system,
including external performance audits, and could provide a basis for possible prior actions
under future operations inthe area of procurement.

115.    Important supplementary policy benchmarks are identified in the area of procurement
under the interim operation to be supported by co-financing donors prior to the next joint
IDNdonor operation. One or more o f these might also form prior actions for the next joint
operation. These include: a supplementary regulation amending the procurement requirements
for P135-2 contained in Inter-ministerial Circular No. 676 so as to require open competitive
bidding as the principal method for civil works under P135-2; issuing clear guidance to
provinces on the use of Community Participation in Procurement; limiting the use o f the
Direct Contracting method to exceptional circumstances that shall be clearly specified; and
removing the value-based thresholds for the use of Direct Contracting. Inthe absence o f such
specific policy actions, some of which may be over-ambitious, subsequent operations may
support other means o f promoting voluntary good practice on the part o f certain provinces in
order to help attain the stretch targets for the use o f non-Direct Contracting methods that form
the basis o f the triggers for future operations in the series. This should be linked to monitoring
of procurement outcomes through the Government's own system including performance
audits.

116.    For auditing, the suggested triggers for subsequent operations relate to the progressive
increase in provincial audit coverage year by year (Le. at least 10 provinces by 2008 (MTR),
and at least 18 provinces by the end of the program in 2010), and evidence of the sustained
implementation of the agreed actions under the multi-year audit plan supported by the first
proposed operation. These include: annual audit plans produced; audit reports to be submitted
within six months o f the end o f the year o f audit; implementation of each prior year's audit
recommendations reviewed; and audit reports publicly disclosed on SAV's website and
through the media, in accordance with the provisions o f the State Audit Law.

117.    For community contributions,          triggers for subsequent operations concern a
progressive increase in the share o f infrastructure investments providing local paid labor
opportunities (at least 75 percent for large infrastructure investments and all small
infrastructure investments by MTR (2008)' and at least 90 of all infrastructure investments by
the end of the program), with the value of both paid and unpaid labor contributions captured
incommune accounts and P135-2 financial reports.

Monitoringand Evaluation

118.    Description. The fourth and final policy area concerns results measurement, or impact
evaluation and process monitoring under P135-2. Many o f the principles would also apply to
other NTPs but for reasons of attribution it i s preferred that the focus in this policy area be
restricted to P135-2. The intent o f the policy and institutional actions in this area are to ensure
that P135-2 outcomes are evaluated to a high methodological standard including the use of
appropriate comparator data; and that an effective and reliable management information
system (MIS) i s used to track progress towards agreed outcomes and identify/ resolve
program management issues.

119.    Challenge. While P135 Phase 1 benefited from internal and external (independent)
evaluations, these were not based on program-relevant data that was tracked during program
implementation itself. Evaluation o f impact under the MOLISA/ UNDP external evaluation
was based almost entirely on ex-post studies that attempted to retrofit both indicators and
baseline data. No attempt was made under P135 Phase 1 to monitor processes, such as
differential rates of participation or inclusion o f ethnic minority versus Kinh majority
population groups, or differential participation by gender, age, income or well-being groups,
and so on.

120.    Government actions. With TA support from UNDP, the World Bank, and other
agencies, the Government has designed a comprehensive M&E system for P135-2, and the
execution of a baseline survey i s planned to take place in early 2007 immediately following
the launching o f most of the reformed elements o f P135-2. CEM has overall responsibility for
the P135-2 M&E system, but has the full support of GSO in ensuring a high standard of
methodological rigor and that full use i s made of existing survey instruments and data sources
such as the VHLSS. C E M plans to work with MPI to adapt the Government's Portfolio
Monitoring Tool (PMT) - developed under the auspices o f the Partnership Group on Aid
Effectiveness - as the basis for its own computerized Management Information System (MIS)
for P135-2. The PMT was designed for monitoring ODA projects and programs supported by
the five development banks, and i s currently being used by around 40 PMUs and six
ministries including MOF.

121.    Bank's assessment/ recommendation. Given the vital importance of M&E in the
context o f a policy-based lendingoperation, in order to monitor progress and assess outcomes,
it i s essential that strong progress is seen in this policy area. Collaborative working
relationships have been formed for the first time between CEM, GSO, MPI, and other
agencies. Taken together, the above actions provide clear evidence of the Government's
commitment to improving process monitoring and impact evaluation of P135-2.

122.    Measures to be undertaken as part of proposed operation. For impact evaluation,
the prior actions are that outcome indicators and the overall M&E framework have been
agreed and adopted, and a baseline survey has been designed including a matched control
group. For process monitoring, the prior actions are that an action plan has been adopted to
adapt the PMT for purposes of tracking and reporting on inputs, outputs, and intermediate
outcomes o f P135-2. A benchmark to be monitored during the subsequent year i s that
participatory M&E instruments including a citizen report-card survey and mechanisms for
horizontal or cross-learning between participating localities are designed and introduced. The
triggers for subsequent operations in the proposed series of operations would be primarily to


                                                41

ensure that the overall M&E system i s in place and use i s being made of it to inform program
management decisions. By the time of MTR (2008),a mid-term impact evaluation would be
conducted, including a citizen report-card survey andregional `lessons-learned assessments'.

                               VI.     OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

    POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT
    123.     Program 135 is one of the Government's key efforts to tackle poverty,
    particularly poverty driven by geography or ethnicity. The program's target is well
    attuned to the poverty profile o f Vietnam, which shows a high concentration of poverty
    among the ethnic minority population living in remote and mountainous areas.                     In 2004
    poverty incidence among the ethnic minority population was 61% in comparison with the
    national average o f about 20%. Recent review o f P135 Phase 1 indicates that the Program
    was effective inchanneling resources to the poorest communes9. P135-2 provides community-
    level infrastructure that improves access by the poor to social services and increases their
    economic opportunities, as well as livelihood support designed to augment household income.
    Evaluation studies o f P135 Phase 1 found substantial positive impacts on poverty although
    analyses were limited to impacts of infrastructure development".                Under Phase 2, the
    production-support component will be strengthened and allocated a substantially greater share
    o f total program resources. This would increase household income-generation opportunities,
    especially where synergy i s achieved between infrastructure development and livelihood
    support.

    124.     The institutional and policy reforms supported by the proposed operation would
    improve P135's impact on poverty by accelerating decentralization, supporting more
    accountable, participatory decision-making and improving targeting. A more decentralized
    approach to infrastructure planning and management i s expected to lead to the following
    positive impacts:      (1) selection of infrastructure investments geared towards local needs,
    reducing potential mis-investment and increasing levels o f beneficiary satisfaction; (2)
    improved transparency and accountability, which would enhance cost effectiveness and
    construction quality; and (3) sustainability. Moreover, as a recent review of relevant ongoing
    IDA-supported projects in Vietnam demonstrates, commune ownership, combined with
    capacity building support, increases confidence among the commune personnel, and improves
    their technical and managerial skills".          Recognizing this, P135-2 promotes commune
    investment ownership as a central feature o f the Program. Ultimately, strengthening the
    capacities o f poor communes could have far-reaching positive impacts with regard to
    planning and management of public fund utilization that go well beyond P135.

    125.     The reforms will also promote the participation of poorest groups within a
    commune. It i s acknowledgedthat remote villages, small ethnic minority groups, women and
t   the poorest households face obstacles to participating in and benefiting from P135-2 unless
    special attention i s paid. Their inclusion inthe program will be facilitated by usingvillages as
    an entry point for identification and planning o f program-supported activities. Their

participation in commune-level, program-management arrangements will also be encouraged
and monitored. It i s intended that P135-2 will include around 2,500 o f the poorest villages in
Zone I1(generally less-poor) communes in addition to all villages in the 1,600 or so targeted
Zone I11 (poorest) communes. This more fine-grained, area-based targeting approach will
substantially broaden the program's outreach to the rural poor. The program's MIS and wider
process monitoring system, and baseline survey instruments, are designed specifically to
permit disaggregated reporting o f processes and outcomes along various lines o f social
difference, including ethnicity, gender, spatial location, and household socio-economic status.

126.    The operation, and the dialogue that surrounds it, should deliver poverty and
social benefits outside the direct realm of P135-2. The institutional and policy reforms
supported by this operation deal with the principles, rules and practices that govern the
provision of purposive, targeted public action to poor communities. These systemic reforms
lend themselves to being readily transferred to other National Target Programs and to many o f
the mainstream, sectoral programs o f the Government. As a conspicuous, flagship program o f
Government there i s the potential to act as an example to other programs.

127.    Adverse social impacts are minimal, but clear guidelines, prior consultations,
active information dissemination, and close monitoring will be needed. Some relocation
o f households under P135-2, however, i s allegedly necessitated to improve their access to
infrastructure and public services. This has to be done in a careful and participatory manner
in order to ensure that their relocation is voluntary and based on the affected households'
informed decisions. In order to minimize potential adverse impacts, clear guidelines have to
be developed and prior consultations need to be thoroughly conducted.           Land and asset
acquisition in conjunction with infrastructure development i s minimal because o f the small
scale o f infrastructure works eligible under the Program. Where it happens, compensation in
compliance with relevant laws and regulations would be provided.           Program M&E will
monitor these aspects during implementation.

128.    Though sedentarization activities have been de-linked from P135-2, it i s likely that in
practice there will be some overlap on the ground. This operation does not support the
implementation of sedentarization policies and cannot be associated directly with the
outcomes of sedentarization. However, P135 i s part of a package of Government activities
that aims to improve the livelihoods o f ethnic minorities. Sedentarization continues to be part
o f the same package. This creates a risk - that the donor support to reform P135 might be
perceived as including support to sedentarization and any adverse social impacts this may
have. It also creates an important opportunity. As donors collaborate to provide substantial
and coherent support to government efforts to tackle ethnic minority poverty, more space
should become available to engage in dialogue on this topic. Donors will seek to use the
influence that programmatic support gives them to encourage reforms in the broader package
o f activities that target ethnic minorities.   The ongoing, Bank-supported Country Social
Analysis on ethnicity and development, and studies being conducted by the Institute for
Ethnic Minorities with Bank support, among other vehicles for joint analytical work and
policy dialogue with Government, will be drawn upon to inform ongoing policy dialogue and
help set the context for future operations in the proposed series.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
129.    Institutional and Management Arrangements. Under Decision No. 7 o f the Prime
Minister (dated January 10, 2006), the Committee for Ethnic Minorities (CEM) i s assigned by

                                                44

the Government o f Vietnam as the lead agency in managing and supervising the
implementation of P135-2. However, as Inter-Ministerial Circular (IMC) No. 676 details (see
Annex 2 for further details), it does so with support from and in coordination with the four
other ministries that are also co-signatories to IMC No. 676: Ministry o f Planning and
Investment (MPI), Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (MARD), and Ministry o f Construction (MOC). These ministries have
representatives on the Program Steering Committee, which i s chaired by a Deputy Prime
Minister. State Audit o f Vietnam (SAV, which reports to the National Assembly), and the
Vietnam Fatherland Front among other mass organizations, play the role o f independent
supervision bodies. At provincial level, a Steering Committee for the implementation o f the
P135-2 i s set up with participation from all related agencies and the standing agency i s the
Provincial Committee for Ethnic Minorities, chaired by the Chairperson o f the Provincial
People's Committee (PPC). The PPC creates an enabling environment for the effective
implementation of the P135-2 by developing and issuance o f provincial guidance regulations
and implementation of capacity building. The same institutional setting applies at the district
level. The District People's Committee provides guidance and supervision for planning and
implementation at commune level. The Commune People's Committee i s the investment
owner and makes decisions on implementation and supervision. At commune level there i s a
`program management unit' established by the District People's Committee.

130.    Monitoringand evaluation. According to Inter-Ministerial Circular No. 676, the PPC
takes overall responsibility for quality, progress, and effectiveness o f P135-2. Every quarter
the PPC takes the lead in supervising, monitoring and evaluating program implementation.
The P135 Provincial Standing Office serves as the key agency to conduct monitoring and
supervision, and assists the PPC in synthesizing and reporting results to the Central Standing
Agency (CEM). Monitoring and evaluation are also achieved through annual audits, a mid-
term review (or reviews), and a final evaluation upon program completion. A baseline study
to permit impact evaluation will be conducted in early 2007 in both a representative
`treatment' sample o f P135-2 target communes and in a matched `control' sample. Further
details are provided in section IV above, since actions pertaining to monitoring and evaluation
make up one of the four main policy areas supported by the proposed series of operations.

131.     Reporting within Government. Provincial Steering Committees will synthesize
reports from local levels and submit regular progress reports to the relevant higher-level
authority. Prior to report submission, local project management units are required to collate
data certified by the local branch of STV in which their financial accounts are opened.
Provinces are to send their reports to C E M on a quarterly and annual basis. CEM submits
aggregated reports to the National Steering Committee every six months.

132.    Partnership Committee. A P135-2 Partnership Committee (PC) i s being formally
established by the Government to oversee and review progress towards the agreed policy and
institutional actions under the proposed series of operations. The PC will be chaired by CEM,
and comprises senior managers and specialists from all those Government agencies that have
a role inP135-2 implementation (including CEM, MOF, MPI, MARD, Office of Government,
GSO, and MOLISA). All co-financing donor agencies would also be represented in the PC.
The group o f donor representatives in the PC would designate one among their group to lead
the policy dialogue with the Government representatives in the PC on a rotational basis, with
the World Bank leading in those alternate years in which IDA would finance policy-based
lending operations.

                                               45

133.    The composition and Terms of Reference of the PC are informed by lessons learned
from experience under DFID's targeted budget support to P135 Phase 1. Under this previous
arrangement, the effectiveness of the PC was hampered by insufficiently senior staff
representation in PC meetings of the key central government agencies concerned, weak
coordination among the agencies, a generally low level of understanding of budget support as
a modality for ODA, and the fact that the PC had no role in the management of
complementary technical assistance (TA). For the proposed operation, the option of using the
existing, GoV Steering Committee (SC) for the NTPs for poverty reduction as the PC was
considered, but not judged to be feasible in view of the high-ranking membership of the SC
which would prevent it from meeting frequently enough or from discussing issues in
sufficient detail.

134.    Joint Progress Reviews with IDA/ Donors. Annual and interimreview missions will
be organized according to the following schedule, dictated by the Government's budget cycle:
interim review missions will be held around April of each year, and full annual reviews
conducted around September-Octobereach year. Interimreview missions would involve field
visits, while annual reviews would form the basis for preparation of the next operation and
involve an assessment of progress towards accomplishing the agreed policy and institutional
actions/ triggers. A Memorandum of Understanding concerning the Partnership Framework
between the Joint Donor Budget Support Group and the Government with respect to the PC
has been prepared for signature by all development partners concerned, including draft TOR
for the PC.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS


135.    A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, 2001) and a Public
Expenditure Review-Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA, 2005) have been
conducted, and indicate that the fiduciary environment is generally adequate for the
purposes of the proposed operation, as evidenced by improvements in the public
expenditure management systems made over the past few years and actions taken by GoV to
increase transparency. While challenges remain, GoV i s moving ahead to further strengthen
its fiduciary control framework. In connection with this process, the Bank i s actively engaged
ina policydialogue with GoV to follow up on priorities identified inthe CFAA and PER-IFA
reports. Drawing on this ongoing work, certain key actions and milestones have been
identified to help track progress in PFM reforms, some o f which are incorporated inthe policy
matrix for the proposed operation (Annex 3).

136.    The 2005 PER-FA reviewed accounting and reporting processes in the public sector,
oversight functions in the public sector, and financial reporting and auditing in SOEs.
Fiduciary risks of the current public financial management budgeting, accounting, reporting
and auditing systems of government were assessedas moderate.

137.    The PER-IFA identifies as areas for continued improvement: unifying budget
classification and accounting to ensure effective and consistent budgeting, accounting and
reporting across all sectors; streamlining the internal control framework and public
expenditure accounting processes, strengthening asset management, establishing public sector
accounting standards in line with international standards, improving financial management
reporting and use of reporting for management control, establishing an effective internal audit
review function as part of the internal control regime, and strengthening the effectiveness of
the SAV. Implementation of the PER-FA recommendations i s being supported by the PRSC
program and grant funds.

138.    The PER-IFA recognizes recent changes to improve transparency and
accountability in Vietnam. Among the most recent are the Audit Law and Anti-Corruption
Law passedby the National Assembly inMay and December of 2005, respectively. The Audit
Law significantly enhances oversight by the National Assembly and the provincial People's
Councils over public finances, and also increases public access to information on government
finances. The new Anti-Corruption Law reflects strong commitment to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency in usingbudgetary funds, including ODA. The MOF and MPIare
working with other ministries to review and strengthen management and use o f budgetary and
other funds. The data management, financial reporting, and internal control system o f the
State Bank o f Vietnam (SBV) are also expected to be further improved through a planned
IDA credit, inFY08. The PFMreforms being undertaken inpreparation for implementationof
the Treasury and Budget Management Information System (TABMIS) over the next few
years will improve public financial management and will assist in establishing an integrated
financial management system in Vietnam. The TABMIS i s supported by the Public Financial
Management Reform Project (IDA Cr.3767), and implementation o f the computerized system
i s plannedfor 2008-2009.

139.    Satisfactory progress towards the PFM reforms has been achieved. The revised
Law on State Budget, which became effective in 2004, i s one of the cornerstones o f the public

                                              47

financial management reform program. In 2005 the entire State Budget Plan was published
for the first time, including an aggregate amount for defense expenditure. Full disclosure of
the planned budget as well as actual at the central to district levels has also been achieved.
The revised Law further improved the transparency on budgetary matters by delineating the
roles o f the National Assembly and the Provincial People's Councils in budget approval.
Members of the National Assembly actively participate in the budgetary process, especially
on the discussion of resource allocations.

140.    On the management of public finance and accountability, the accounting system of
the state budget and the treasury was unified allowing for better monitoring of
expenditures. This was enhanced by the completion of the overall design of an integrated
Treasury and Budget Management Information System (TABMIS). The accountability has
also been strengthened with the transformation of the State Audit o f Vietnam (SAV) into an
independent institution reporting to the National Assembly, rather than to the government.
The Auditor General will be appointed and dismissed by the National Assembly and audit
reports will be made public. SBV will also be subject to annual auditing and the disclosure of
the resulting audit reports. A new Accounting Law and accounting and auditing standards
have also been issued. The accounting norms converge to international standards. Thirty
seven auditing and 26 accounting standards have been issued for private sector and State
Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

141.    The new Anti-Corruption Law took effect in June 2006. The main initiatives
introduced for fighting and controlling corruption include increased public disclosure and
transparency in areas such as public procurement, civil works, management of SOEs, auditing
of the state budget, management and use o f land, and personnel management. The law
specifies the contents and modalities of such disclosure. It also provides individuals with the
right to request for information from specified bodies, such as People's Committees. The law
strengthens the accountability o f heads o f organizations and agencies by specifying that they
shall be responsible for corruption occurring inside the entities under their management and
authority. The law includes articles on asset declaration by high-ranking public servants,
whistle-blowing and denunciation, and outlawing of bribery and other related corruption
crimes.    The media has also taken a more proactive approach in detecting and reporting
corruption issues.

DISBURSEMENT,REPORTINGAND AUDITING ARRANGEMENTS

142.    Since the LMF does not currently have a program in Vietnam it i s not possible to rely
on its assessment of the control environment of the SBV. However, the enactment of the
Audit Law of 2005 will assist in addressing the issue related to audit and accounting
arrangements. The audit law has established the SAV as an independent institution reporting
to the National Assembly with the Auditor General being appointed and dismissed by the
NationalAssembly. Audit reports will be made public. The SBV will also be subject to annual
auditing and disclosure o f the audit reports.

143.    To address fiduciary risks in the foreign exchange control environment, the Borrower
will maintain a dedicated foreign currency deposit account (DA) for the proceeds o f the
Credit, and will report on the funds flow of the dedicated deposit account. The Government
will, if deemed necessary by IDA, allow an independent external audit of the dedicated
foreign currency deposit account (DA).

                                               48

144.   Disbursement.The proposed Credit will follow IDA'Sdisbursement procedures for
development policy lending operations. The Credit proceeds will be disbursed against
satisfactory fulfillment o f prior actions under the development policy program and not tied to
any specific purchases, and no procurement requirements will be needed. Various measures
have been taken to ensure that the overall fiduciary policies and institutions are adequate to
proceed with support from IDA and other development partners. The analytical underpinnings
for the operation are complete: (i) cross-cutting assessment of the country's development
                                      the
policies (social, structural and sectoral) covering the policy reforms and institutional
development priorities for sustainable growth and poverty reduction has been discussed with
the government in a number o f recent joint reports; and (ii)   an assessment o f the CFAA has
been made in the 2005 PER-FA which updated the 2001 CFAA and 2002 Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR).

145.    Dedicated Deposit Account. The Borrower will open and maintain a dedicated
Deposit Account (DA) in US dollars for the Borrower's use once the Credit is approved by
the Board and becomes effective. The dedicated DA will form part o f the country's official
foreign reserves. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the Credit into said
account, an equivalent amount in Vietnamese Dong i s credited in the Borrower's budget
management system to be used for budget expenditures in a manner acceptable to IDA. The
Borrower will report to IDA on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and
credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds o f the Credit are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Financing Agreement (DFA), IDA will
require the Borrower to either return that amount to the dedicated DA to be used for eligible
purposes, or refund the amount directly to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA shall be cancelled.
The administration of this Credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.

146.    Reporting. Through SBV, the Borrower will: (i)       report the exact sum received into
the dedicated DA; (ii) that all withdrawals are for eligible expenditures; (iii) to
                       ensure                                                         confirm
IDA details of the Treasury account to which the Vietnamese Dong equivalent of the Credit
proceeds will be credited, and (iv) submit a report on receipts and disbursements for the
dedicated DA. IDA will maintain the right to request an audit o f the dedicated DA. These
processes and controls are intended to provide assurance that IDA funds have arrived at their
intended destination to be used for the intended purposes, and are subject to the Borrower's
rules and regulations.

ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

147.    Under Operational Policy 8.60, an environmental assessment and preparation of an
Environmental Management Plan and associated risk mitigation measures are not required.
However, it i s a requirement that due diligence be done to assess environmental and natural
resource (including forestry) considerations relevant to the proposed operation and to explore
options for mitigating any risks identified. An examination of the environmental implications
o f P135-2 was therefore undertaken by the Borrower with consultant support during the
preparation o f the proposed Credit, building on an earlier, generally positive, assessment of
the environmental impacts of Program 135 Phase 1conducted in 2005 with support from UK
DFID.The environmental examinationof P135-2 also buildson the findingsofenvironmental
safeguards compliance monitoring conducted under the IDA-supported Northern Mountains
Poverty Reduction and Community Based Rural Infrastructure Projects. Experience under
these ongoing investment operations, which finance very similar investments to those under

                                                49

the infrastructure component of P135-2, suggests that adverse environmental impacts are very
small, whether considered individually or in the aggregate, while positive environmental
impacts are significant. Adverse impacts, when they are a concern, can generally be mitigated
or prevented entirely by relatively simple measures during sub-project planning and
construction and incorporation of appropriate clauses inconstruction contracts.

148.    A substantial body of analytical work has also been drawn upon in the preparation of
the proposed operation concerning the importance of land and forest-based livelihood sources
for ethnic minority communities in Vietnam's lagging, upland regions. This analytical work -
on forestry and poverty, poverty-environment linkages, and the interplay of formal and
informal institutions mediating access to forest land and markets by ethnic minority
communities, among other topics - has helped to inform the policy actions on the pro-poor
orientation of production and livelihoods support under the proposed operation. Continuing
policy dialogue with MARD and provinces, building on related work in the context of the
Forest Sector Support Partnership, emphasizes the importance of ensuring that once ethnic
minority households and communities acquire land through state forest enterprise reform,
they are able to access appropriate forms of market-orientated, forestry extension support to
help them make productive and sustainable use of forest land. This issue will be followed up
during supervision and preparation of future operations in the proposed series, including an
examination of the extent to which the Government's own results-monitoring system (under
development) provides for an adequate assessment of these and other relevant environmental
and natural resourceimplications.

2.1 DFID's targeted budget support operation for MOF/STV acknowledge these shortcomings and
P135-1 in 2005 revealed a number of PFM have introduced specific measures to strengthen
shortcomings which highlighted ways in which financial management of all NTPs including
relevant PFM systems needed to be strengthened P135-2 as an integral aspect of the operation

                                                    appropriate        institutional      strengthening).

2.2 Corruption i s a significant and growing GoV is taking important steps towards the
problem in Vietnam, and in a rapidly-growing implementation of measuresto combat corruption:

                                                    corruption-related    offenses.    If implemented
                                                    strictly and fairly, the new Law should act as a
                                                    strong deterrent to corruption at all levels.

                                                    The design of P135-2 itself, and the policy and
                                                    institutional actions under the proposed operation,
                                                    should significantly strengthen transparency and
                                                    accountability in the use of public resources under

3. Policy-related risks:

  Risk    that momentum in        sustaining
  progress in poverty reduction could
  potentially be lost if:

   economically,          socially        or alternative livelihood options)     and to pilot
   environmentally unsustainable -medium activities      before   launching    into   full-scale
   risk.                                     implementation. Revised guidelines        for   the

                                             prior action for the proposed operation, and their
                                             implementation will receive ongoing, parallel
                                             donor TA support.

   3.2 Efforts to ensure greater consistency GoV aims to ensure that impact evaluation for all

                                             should continue to engage GoV in policy

       security. This might: (a) hamper the systemic reforms. These reforms will foster
       effectiveness of development activities;   stronger engagement by local communities in

ANNEXES

ANNEX 1:LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY

Hanoi, February2,2007


To: Mr.PaulWolfowitz
President of the World Bank
Washington, DC


Dear Mr.President,


149.    The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) has been
strongly committed and implemented by the Government o f Vietnam, among which the
poverty reduction and social and economic development o f extremely difficult, ethnic
minority and mountainous areas i s one o f the top priorities in Vietnam.

150.    In the past 20 years of renovation, Vietnam has gained a number of achievements in
economic development and poverty reduction, especially for ethnic minority and
disadvantaged areas. The results of the renovation and economic growth have been
redistributed with priority given to the National Targeted Programs, among which many
programs have targeted poverty reduction and living standard improvement for poor and
ethnic minority people.

151.    Since 1998, when Vietnam was still in the middle o f the economic crisis with an
average GDP growth o f 4%, the Government already determined to invest into a special
program on socio-economic development for disadvantaged, mountainous and ethnic minority
areas (referred to as Program 135. This program was implemented in almost the whole
country (in 52 among 64 provinceskities) benefiting 2,400 disadvantaged and poor
communes.

152.    After 7 years o f implementation (1999 - 2005), Program 135 achieved significant
targets in many social and economic fields, the appearance o f rural mountainous areas has
changed considerably as infrastructure has been improved substantially to satisfy essential
needs o f production development, serving people's life, development of market economy has
been promoted, poverty incidence has been reduced spectacularly, and people's intellectual
standard has been improved. Up to 2005, more than 700 communes that participated in
Program 135 were eligible to graduate from the Program; it also meant that those communes
graduated from the list of poorest and most disadvantaged communes inVietnam.

153.    Program 135 has gained popularity and i s supported by the people throughout the
country, including people in extremely difficult areas, in such a way that they understand their
own responsibility in implementing the Program and escape from poverty. Under the strong
leadership o f the Party, Government and authorities at all levels, Program 135 has effectively
promoted democracy and openness, and participation in implementation supervision. The
Government o f Vietnam always paid special attention and gave priority to Program 135 with
an increasing annual budget allocated to the Program year by year.


                                               55

154.     Although the achievements of Program 135 after 7 years of implementation are
relatively clear, several important immediate objectives o f the Program have not been
accomplished, including a considerable number o f communes with poverty incidence o f
above 25 percent according to the former poverty line (more than 60% according to the new
poverty line), a large persisting development gap, and many communes that have still not
escaped from extreme difficulty. Many issues in people's living standard have not been
addressed, for example: low percentage o f access to drinking water, insufficient production
and residential land and housing, inappropriate environment and sanitation due to traditional
customs, vulnerability to falling back into poverty, poverty reduction i s not sustainable and it
i s thus difficult to satisfy the need for industrialization and modernization in these extremely
difficult areas.

155.     To address above issues based on experience in the implementation o f the first phase
o f the Program, after extended consultation with local people, specialists and donors, the
Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs (CEMA) and line ministries and agencies have re-
designed the Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme
Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas 2006-2010 (hereafter referred to as
`Program 135, Phase 2'), which was approved by the Prime Minister under Decision
07/2006/QD-TTg dated 10 January 2006, aiming at: a rapid improvement in production and
transition in agricultural economic structure towards a close linkage between production and
market; improvement o f physical and spiritual well-being o f predominantly ethnic minority
communities living in poorest and most remote communes and villages in a sustainable way;
and narrowing the development gap among ethnic groups and regions in the country. By
2010, there will be basically no hunger and the percentage o f poor households according to
the new poverty line will fall below 30 percent.

156.     To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, Program 135 Phase 2 will be
implemented with the following main tasks: 1. Support production development, economic
structural transition, and livelihood improvement support to ethnic minority people; 2.
Development of essential infrastructure in communesand villagesfacing extreme hardship; 3.
Training and fostering for grassroots officials, improvement of administrative and economic
management capability, and community capacity building; and 4. Provision of support
services, improvement of          living standard, and legal assistance to improve legal
understanding. The Prime Minister also instructs Ministries, agencies and local authorities to
give priority to the coordination in implementation of other tasks to promote the equal
development in these areas.

 157.    Program 135 Phase 2 will be implemented in 1,800 disadvantaged communes and
2,500 disadvantaged villages in poor and ethnic minority communes in 45 provinces
nationwide. The Program's investment scale and level to each area will be determined with
priority given to sustainable poverty reduction. The resource requirements for the Program are
therefore substantial. The Government has made great effort to mobilize all possible resources
for the Program over the next five years. With limited domestic budget, budget for the
Program 135 Phase 2 was developed on a minimum basis and funds from international
sources need to be mobilized to ensure the achievement o f set targets o f the Program.

158.     The Government of Vietnam respects and appreciates all international support for the
country's economic development and poverty reduction over the recent period. We are also
eager to realize the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Hanoi Core Statement on

                                                 56

Aid Effectiveness: ownership, harmonization, linkages, and outcomes. We also highly
appreciate the increasing integrity o f the policy dialogue process and pledge to implement the
proposed requirements by donors on the basis of respecting policy, law, and existing
regulations o f the Government o f Vietnam.

159.    In order to successfully implement Program 135 Phase 2 and learn lessons from the
implementation of Program 135 Phase 1, the Government of Vietnam, in the next 5 years, has
planned to make the following improvements in the implementation of the Program in key
areas including: (i)  poverty targeting and participation; (ii)    encouraging decentralization,
community participation and decentralization o f implementation and supervision at local
level; (iii)
           increasing fiduciary transparency and investment efficiency; and (iv) development
and strengthening of supervision and evaluation of impact on poverty reduction, social-
economic development o f the Program from now to 2010.

160.    Proper poverty targeting and timely and proper resource allocation to implementation
levels i s a crucial principle and requirement to achieve the Program's targets. The
Government of Vietnam assigned CEM to issue the Decision No. 393/2005/QD-UBDT dated
29 August 2005 stipulating criteria for the selection of communes participating in Program
135 Phase 2. Those criteria and the Decision itself will be reviewed based on actual
information up to 2008 in order to re-identify communes to participate in the Program
ensuring that the targets o f the Program are met.

161.    Program 135 Phase 2 will spend a substantial part of the resources on construction and
development of basic infrastructure for poor and ethnic minorities in remote areas. To ensure
the efficient use and the sustainability o f these infrastructures, they should be well operated
and maintained. The Government will have relevant policies to institutionalize the operation
and maintenance of infrastructures under Program 135 Phase 2. Necessary resources will be
allocated to ensure the efficient operation and maintenance o f those infrastructures at local
level. Production development and promoting sustainable livelihoods are an important
component o f the Program. Experience and best practices from development projects on
agricultural and forestry extension, and market-oriented commodity development will be
consolidated and shared among Program communes. The Ministry o f Agriculture and Rural
Development has issued the Circular No. 01/2007/BNN dated January 15, 2007 provide
detailed guidance on Production Development Component to ensure that production
development and livelihood support activities are market-oriented, pro-poor and sustainable.

162.    Beneficiaries and participants in Program 135 Phase 2 are located in more than 40
provinces all over the country. Poor people and poor households in P135-2 communes will be
involved and informed of the planning, implementation, and supervision process, and will
benefit from investments under the Program. The Government i s working on a
Communication Strategy and will issue detailed guidance on its communication strategy
together with Program manuals. These forms o f documentation will be developed in both
Vietnamese and ethnic minority languages in various audio-visual formats that are accessible
to ethnic minority people. The key tendency in implementation of the Program i s that
investment ownership will be handed down to the commune level, in addition to planning,
implementing and management capacity building activities. The Government has drafted a
circular providing detailed guidance for communes to assess their capacity and hand over the
investment ownership as per the set o f criteria, which has been circulated to concerned
Ministries, agencies and local authorities for comments and has committed that the number of

                                                57

communes that are investment owners will increase from 40% in 2007 to 100% by 2010. To
achieve this, management and implementation capacity at commune and village levels needs
to be improved. The Government o f Vietnam demonstrates its commitment to give priority to
capacity building activities by allocating at least 7% o f the total budget for the Program to this
area.

163.    Financial management will be strengthened to ensure transparency and accountability
and the proper use o f Program resources. The Government has issued the Official Document
No. 2849/KBNN-KHTH dated December 29, 2006 stipulating regulations on financial
management and capital liquidation specifically for Program 135 Phase 2 to institutionalize
the financial reporting system and quarterly reconciliation between investment owners and the
State Treasury, flow of funds; financial management reports on the allocation and use o f
Program budget will be publicized on the website o f the Ministry o f Finance. In addition to
strict regulation o f financial management, Program 135 Phase 2 will also be audited annually
inaccordance with the Law on State Audit. The State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) has developed
an multi-year auditing plan for the Program, in which the audit scope will increase gradually
every year. Audit reports will be sent to Program's executing agencies and donors in June
each year, and at the same time, publicized on mass media and the website o f the State Audit.

164.    Investments will be implementedin a way to ensure public investment efficiency. The
Government o f Vietnam has issued Decree No. 111/CP guiding the implementation o f the
Law on Procurement. With the Program 135 Phase 2 in particular, the Government will issue
supplementary regulations to encourage provinces that participate in the Program to use
competitive bidding as the main principle, while direct contracting method will be allowed in
some special cases with prior approval. The poor will also contribute to the Program but these
contributions will follow legal regulations, will be closely managed, and exemption from
contributions for the poorest households will be considered to ensure they will no longer be
regressive. Inter-Ministerial Circular No. 676 facilitates local authorities in applying simple
procedures, and working groups without formal business registration are still eligible to sign
construction contracts. Under this regime, investments in infrastructure will give priority to
creating o f job opportunities for local people and poor households will have more priority in
accessing to paidjobs.

165.    Monitoring and evaluation i s one among the focal activities in the coming period. This
i s a prerequisite condition for the Government as well as the community to be aware o f the
efficiency and impact o f the Program on the socio-economic lives o f poor and ethnic minority
people, and impact evaluation plays the greatest role in this process. The Government has
developed an overall monitoring and evaluation framework and outcome indicators for the
Program allowing for efficient monitoring o f the Program. A baseline survey has been
designed and will be carried out to form a basis for future impact evaluation work. Regarding
process monitoring, the Government has agreed on establishment o f a relevant management
information system to help obtain regular and continuous information on the implementation
o f the Program and, at the same time, promote cross-learning activities among Program
provinces.

166.    To support the efficient management and implementation of the Program, a
Partnership Committee will be established as an advisory body to the Steering Committee o f
Program 135 Phase 2. This Partnership Committee will include leaders and senior experts



                                                58

from concerned departments of line Ministries, agencies and representatives o f international
donors.

167.    On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, Iwould like to express our strong
commitment to the efficient implementation o f the above-mentioned policy and institutional
actions in order to ensure the success o f Program 135 Phase 2 as well as the efficient and
close coordination between the World Bank, the donor community, and the Government o f
Vietnam. We hope that through this close cooperation, the Program will be implemented more
efficiently and will further strengthen the poverty reduction that the Government o f Vietnam
has strongly committed to and, at the same time, accelerate the achievement of the
Millennium Development Goals. On this occasion, Iwould also like to have an early
confirmation o f the annually proposed budget support from the World Bank and donors for
the purpose o f poverty reduction and development o f Vietnam in general and extremely
difficult, ethnic minority and mountainous areas inparticular.

ANNEX 2: OVERALL GOVERNMENTDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM

1.      The Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme
Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas, 2006-2010 (more familiarly known as
`Program 135 Phase 2') i s the redesigned successor to a program with the same name
implemented over 1998-2005. It aims to help reduce poverty and promote economic growth
among ethnic minority groups and local people living in remote, mountainous and upland
regions of Vietnam, buildingon lessons from recent evaluations o f Phase 1.

2.      Program objectives. Program 135 Phase 2 (P135-2) has the overall objectives of
eradicating hunger by 2010 in the targeted areas (primarily those listed above as being the
poorest in the country), and reducing the share of poor households to below 30%, based on a
newly approved poverty line. Significant design improvements of P135-2 over the previousphase
of the programarethat: (a) it i s not limited to basic infrastructure provision alone but also includes
significantly increased support for agricultural production and rural livelihoods; (b) it includes
criteria for targeting the poorest villages within poor communes; (c) it aims at wider
implementation of the commune-level investment ownership concept; (d) it provides more resources
for operationandmaintenance(O&M) ofbasicinfrastructure;and(e) itprovides si@icantly increased
support for local-level capacitybuilding.

3.      Program components. P135-2 has five components: (i)                  production/ livelihoods
support (accelerating agro-economic productivity, and enhancing income); (ii)           infrastructure
development (ensuring provision o f essential commune infrastructure on a sustainable basis
and which contributes to improved living conditions, production development and income
generation); (iii)  capacity building (provision o f training and fostering o f commune and
grassroots cadres and strengthening community capacity for effective participation in
infrastructure creation, operation and maintenance, and supervision of village and commune
management); (iv) living conditions support (ensuring improved access to essential social
services); and (v) management support (to ensure successful program implementation).

4.      Component 1 (production/ livelihoods support) comprises various production
programs aiming at introduction of high-yielding crops and new production practices based
on participatory and demand-led extension services. Models o f householdeconomy as well as
models o f farms and new co-operatives will be developed. Support from P135-2 also focuses
on the development of stronger connections or networks among farmers - traders - scientists
-statepolicies-microcreditproviders, especially inthemostdifficult areas.Specialsupport
will be provided to the poorest households in terms of inputs, production techniques, post-
harvest technologies, and marketing. Commune capacity to assume the role of investment
ownership will be supported.

5.      Component 2 (infrastructure development), focuses on small-scale and essential
works to meet identified needs at commune and village levels. Typical types of works in the
program will be inter-village roaddpaths, small-scale irrigation, low-voltage power supply,
houses for semi-boarding school students, public market-places and meeting halls for villages,
commune clinics with equipment, clean water and commune-cluster extension centers.
Communes are encouraged and planned to become investment owners with regular support
and capacity building from district and provincial levels. Another new development under



                                                   60

P135-2 i s that specific funds are intendedto be earmarked for operation and maintenance of
the infrastructure createdwith support from the program's overallbudget.

6.      Component 3 (capacity building) i s an area of special focus and this marks a major
improvement of P135-2 over its predecessor. Under Program 135 Phase 1, less than 1% of the
total program budget was allocated to capacity-building activities. In P135-2, at least 7% of
the total program budget shall be allocated to capacity-building activities. A wide range of
capacity-building activities, topics and target groups has been identified under the program.
Local leaders, technical'officers, supervision boards and local people at commune and village
levels will be equipped with project management skills, supervision, participatory planning,
household economy planning, and legal knowledge.

7.      Component 4 (living standards support) comprises complementary policies aimed at
improving the living standards and local environment of poor people, their access to public
services, and helping to narrow the welfare gap between people living in lagging regions and
those living inbetter-off regions. The priority policies are for housing, clean water, sanitation
and public hygiene, healthcare, education and legal aid. These sets of policies shall be carried
out in coordination and integration with other NTPs on, notably, healthcare, education, and
rural water and sanitation.

8.      Geographic scope and targeting. P135-2 will be implemented in 1,644 poor
communes in 45 provinces (out of a total of 64 in Vietnam), located throughout the country
but with the highest density of communes in the North-West, South-Central Coast, and
Central Highlands regions (see maps). These communes are characterized by high poverty
incidence; upland/ mountainous locations, often along the national borders; a predominance
of ethnic minorities within the local population; and facing constraints to accessibility. One of
the new features of the redesignedP135-2 i s that the program also includes some 2,500 of the
poorest villages in Zone I1 (less poor) communes as part of its finer-grained targeting
approach. These villages remain as pockets of poverty and need further support and public
investment. The Government has revised the criteria for zoning and classifying communes
according to levels of poverty and other dimensions of hardship or difficulty. The list of
eligible communes shall be updated annually as communes progressively `graduate' from
P135-2.

9.      Funding. The main funding source for the implementation of P135-2 is the state
budget, including central budget sources (which account for 70-75% of all state budget
resources for P135-2), resources from provinces, and those from local people's contributions.
In CEM's original, conservative `base' budget for P135-2 (see Table 4 below) it was
estimated that 10% of total funds, or around US$80 million equivalent, would be provided
from ODA sources. In light of the indicative commitments from the joint donor budget-
support group, totaling around US$300 million equivalent (including a total of US$150 from
IDA for the three proposed policy-based lending operations), and following the Prime
Minister's Decision No. 1922 (November 23, 2006), this amount has subsequently been
revised significantly upwards, permitting GoV to fund P135-2 at just under US$1 billion
equivalent, a level regarded as more fully consistent with achieving the overall objectives of
the program.

10.       P135-2 i s financed by various sources, and Provincial People's Committees (PPCs)
are responsible for: integrating the program into other projects and programs within their
areas of jurisdiction; mobilizing local resources contributed by the State, economic
enterprises, social organizations and residents in target communes; and empowering the latter
with participatory responsibilities and involving them in program implementation. Inter-
ministerial Circular No. 676 guiding P135-2 implementation further requires that use o f P135
resources be planned and accounted for within the Government's national planning and
financial management system; that information about the program be disseminated to each
commune and resident in an open manner; and that program funds be allocated only to
eligible localities and target groups, for the correct purposes and without waste or abuse
whatsoever.

11.       Resource allocation. P135-2 resources are to be allocated through a two-tier system.
In the first tier, from central level, state budget shall be allocated to equally according to the
number of communes in a given province. In the second tier, at provincial level, provincial
authorities should develop a clear and transparent mechanism to allocate funds to communes,
so that poorer communes and those facing greater difficulties will be allocated more
resources. Detailed criteria are to be worked out by each province, based on their own
circumstances and conditions (e.g. population, poverty rates, geographical conditions, etc).
Information on budget allocation to communes will be announced and made public to all
program communes and local people. Resource allocation shall also be linked to performance
achieved by provinces.

12.       Monitoring and evaluation. P135-2 will also feature a comprehensive monitoring
and evaluation system, which was largely absent under Phase 1 o f the program. Baseline data
will be collected and documented. Monitoring criteria shall be developed and uniformly used
at all levels to track the progress. CEM, as the lead agency, will develop an overall monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) framework at central level, and provincial authorities are required to
maintain their own M&E frameworks to provide inputs to the central M&E system. Semi-
annual and annual reviews will be conducted -jointly with donors on an annual basis - based
on a functioning M&E system to make adequate changes and reforms. Mid-term review of the
program i s set at 2008 to take stock and introduce major adjustments, as required.

13.       Legal framework. P135-2 i s governed and regulated by a number of key legal
regulations. The overall program document was approved by the Prime Minister in Decision

                                                62

No. 7/2006/QD-TTg, dated January 10, 2006. For further guidance on implementation, the
Government has issued Inter-Ministerial Circular 676/TTLT-UBDT-TC-XD-NNPPTNT
dated August 8, 2006, setting out the main principles and institutional responsibilities for
program implementation. Other newly issued guidelines for the Program include Decision No.
1/2006/TT-BXD dated May 17, 2006, of the Ministry o f Construction, giving guidance on
investment expenditure for infrastructure construction under the program; Decision No.
164/2006/QD-TTg dated July 11, 2006, approving the list o f 1,644 communes to be included
inthe program (see maps); PMDecision No. 1922/ TTg-QHQT dated November 23, 2006 on
the use of ODA funds for P135-2; Guidance No. 2849/ KBNN-KHTH dated December 29,
2006 of the Ministry o f Finance (MOF) on financial management and reporting arrangements;
and Circular No. 01/2007/BNNPTNT dated January 15, 2007 o f the Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development (MARD) guiding the implementation o f the production component.
These and other regulations applicable to the Program are listed inthe Attachment below.

14.      Program implementation will be based on the principles o f `grassroots democracy',
enabling the maximumdegree o f people's participation throughout the whole process. It i s the
responsibility o f PPCs to disseminate program content, such as menus o f eligible investments,
lists o f beneficiary communities, financial allocations, designation of local implementing
agencies, and the accounting for and posting o f program fund allocations inpublic places and
via the mass media. Regarding the Government's policy to promote decentralization of
management and of implementation of P135 investments to communes, Provincial and
District People's Committees (PPCs and DPCs) are instructed to provide guidance and to
assign staff to support participating communes to directly manage the program.

15.      Inline with the decentralization reforms and guidelines for budget management under
NTPs, the provincial authorities are afforded an increased degree of autonomy in decision-
makingon program implementation within the planning framework set out at national level.
Province-specific decisions, instructions and guidelines are therefore a critically important
part o f the overall policy context for P135-2 implementation. This relates to resource
allocation to different components and sub-components o f the program, as well as to
implementation processes and procedures that will have a determining influence on results
and impacts on the ground.

16.      Planningprocedures. According to Inter-Ministerial Circular No. 676, procedures for
development, synthesis and assignment o f annual plans for P135-2 are implemented
simultaneously with the general planning process but should stand as a separate item in the
annual plan. That is, People's Committees at various levels make investment plans and budget
estimation for P135-2 in line with the Budget Law; and PPCs aggregate at their level and
report to C E M as a basis for fund allocation from the state budget. Financial allocation under
the annual Plan i s made as follows: when authorized by the Prime Minister, MPInotifies PPC
o f their allocation for P135 projects and programs as a separate item in the provincial general
plan; PPC submits to the Provincial People's Council for allocating P135-2 resources,
integrated with other funds mobilized locally, to projects and programs at district level; DPC
allocates the provincial budget, integrated with other funds mobilized locally, to participating
communes or villages/hamlets, within the general framework of plans decided by the
province. Within the overall budget estimates and structure determined at the provincial level,
DPC can take the initiative to revise budgets to implement projects and programs under their
responsibility.

ANNEX 5: FUNDRELATIONSNOTE

                           VIETNAMCONSULTATIVE GROUP MEETING

                                    Statement by the Representative
                                  of the International Monetary Fund

                                      Hanoi, December 14-15,2006

1.       Vietnam's overall record of economic performance has continued to be impressive over the
last year. GDP growth was sustained at around 8 percent in 2006, brisk export growth and buoyant
capital inflows ledto a continuing strengthening of the balance of payments, and poverty continued to
decline rapidly. With the government's continuing efforts to improve the economy's market
orientation, Vietnam has attracted a record amount of foreign direct investment in 2006, and it i s now
poised tojoin the WTO as its 150" member.

2.       WTO membership will undoubtedly provide Vietnam with enhanced opportunities for
continued rapid economic development and sustained poverty reduction in the coming years. The
prospect of membership already appears to have encouraged a surge of foreign portfolio investment,
contributing to an ongoing boomin Vietnam's emerging stock market. The market's warm reception of
recent issues of dong-denominated corporate bonds further attests to the possibilities for financing a
growing share of Vietnam's large investment requirements through the capital market.

3.       However, as the authorities clearly recognize, a number of challenges remain, and the outlook
i s not without risks. As we were remindedat yesterday's Vietnam Business Forum (VBF), investors in
the capital market need to be wary about the risks posed by irrational exuberance. Sizeable foreign
participation, in particular, while desirable in principle as a way to improve the structure of financing
and corporate governance of Vietnamese firms, could also increase the economy's vulnerability to
changes in market sentiment down the road. To enable the economy to reap the full benefits from
increasing global integration, macroeconomic management will need to be increasingly vigilant,
reforms of previously- protected industries will need to be steppedup, and financial system regulation
and supervision upgraded.

Short-Term Outlook and Risks

4.       The short-term outlook for growth and the external finances i s positive, but medium-term
prospects are subject to some uncertainties. While the average rate of inflation has edged down to
about 7% percent in 2006, it remains higher and more entrenched than in most other Asian countries.
Despite a large oil revenue windfall, the stock of public debt has remained on a path of rapid
expansion, reaching a level of about 45 percent of GDP in 2006. This trend is likely to continue in the
coming years, as the Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006-2010 envisages sustained
heavy reliance on public investment to remove infrastructure bottlenecks. While we recognize the
needto support growth, care also needs to be taken to improve the quality of investment, and aim for a
more balanced composition between public and private financing. This would help keep the public
debt burden within a manageable range, and would also serve to protect poverty-reducing outlays,
especially if world growth or oil prices were to decline.

Macroeconomic Policies

5.       The need to protect medium-term debt sustainability, together with the economy's strong
cyclical position, calls for a more prudent fiscal stance. While the substantial recent reduction in oil
subsidies i s welcome, the leveling off of internationaloil prices has reinforced the need to rein in the

                                                    77

growth in public spending and place the non-oil deficit on a declining path. To these ends, future
increases in public wages need to be contained, and the screening of new investment projects
improved. Effective enforcement of the new laws to curb corruption and prevent the waste of public
funds would need to be an integral part of the effort to improve the quality of investment. In this
regard, we welcome the recent adoption of a new framework to improve the management and
utilization of ODA and look forward to the report from the Government Inspectorate on the status of
the government's anti-corruption initiatives.

6.       The rate of growth of credit to the economy has decelerated considerably in 2006, and
continuation of this trend would help contain inflation and slow the growth of banks' nonperforming
loans (NPLs). However, the recent progress in this area could be quickly reversed in the presence of
ample excess bank liquidity, especially if state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) continue to be
instructedto finance large, government-approved state-owned enterprise (SOE) projects. We urge the
authorities to intensify efforts to mop up excess liquidity, avoid directed lending through SOCBs, and
introduce adequate prudential measuresto limit banks' off-balance-sheet risks.

7.       Vietnam's progressive liberalization of its exchange system has been an important element of
its strategy of integration into the global trading system. Following the removal of remaining
restrictions on current international transactions in late-2005, and the acceptance of obligations under
the Fund's Article VIII, the authorities have adopted a plan to make the dong fully convertible by
2010. We fully support this plan and stand ready to provide the authorities with technical assistanceto
ensure timely and effective implementation. While the dong does not currently appear to be
misaligned, the current strength of the external position provides a propitious environment for a move
towards greater exchange rate flexibility. Such a move would serve to cushion the economy from
external shocks, foster better management of exchange rate risks, and ensure that the authorities are
equipped to manage potentially volatile capital movements.

StructuralReform

8.       The forthcoming liberalization of entry of foreign banks under the terms of WTO agreements
can be expected to increase competitive pressures on domestic banks, and the urgency of banking
sector reform. In this context, we welcome the plans to speed up the application of International
Accounting Standards to state-owned banks, and urge the authorities to proceed with a realistic
valuation of NPLs as a basis for NPLresolution and bank recapitalizationplans. To place state-owned
bank operations on a sound commercial basis, their managers would need to be given increased
operational autonomy. While we support the government's plans to acceleratethe equitization of state-
owned banks, adequate strategic foreign investor participation would be important to help improve
governance.

9.       The new market environment also calls for a strengthening of risk management capacities and
prudential regulation of all banks. The planned increase in banks' minimumcapital requirements, and
the SBV's ongoing efforts to upgrade its supervisory functions, are welcome steps inthis direction. In
addition, the SBV, the State Securities Commission (SSC), and the Ministry of Finance will need to
adopt a unified framework to track vulnerabilities associated with portfolio capital movements,
regulate stock market-related credit, and discourage insider trading.

 10.     The imminent WTO accession has also heightened the urgency of reform in the SOE sector.
The authorities' plans to restructure and equitize most SOEs by 2010 are welcome. However, it will
also be important that all SOEs be given a clear mandate, and adequate incentives to operate on
commercial principles, and their managers granted full autonomy to make their own pricing and
investment decisions. In this connection, we welcome the recent decision to adjust electricity prices,
and urge the authorities to move forward with their plans to also adjust coal prices, liberalize the prices
of cement, steel and fertilizer, and reduce state subsidies in the energy sector. As regards the newly-

                                                    78

formed groups of wholly state-owned enterprises in strategic sectors, we encourage the authorities to
define clearly their mandates and relations with government, while establishing adequate regulatory
safeguards, where needed, to ensure that their market power cannot be used to undermine competition,
andlimit the scope for related lendingor other nonmarket-based affiliated party transactions.

11.     A continuing opening up of the trade and investment regimes would be key to private sector-
led investment and growth. As was noted by several participants at the VBF, the lack of clarity in the
legal system remains an important area of concern to foreign investors. Vietnam's impressive progress
toward aligning its legal and regulatory framework with WTO requirements now needs to be
complemented by faster steps to adopt the accompanying implementing decrees and circulars, and
ensure their transparent and equitable enforcement. We encourage the authorities to work closely with
the private sector to ensure that the new WTO-compliant legislation will be implemented in a way to
level the playing field, and simplify rules and regulations, while preventing any increase in red tape or
government intervention.

12.     Improvements inthe quality, timeliness, and dissemination of data on money and banking, the
balance of payments, public debt, and official reserves would also be essential to support informed
policy decisions and effective interaction with markets. In this regard, we welcome the recent
government decision to publish foreign debt data on a regular basis and look forward to its early
implementation. In addition, more transparent accounting, reporting, and monitoring of the
government's extra-budgetary operations and all publicly- funded projects would be helpful in shoring
updonor and investor confidence.

ConcludingRemarks

13.     Vietnam's forthcoming WTO accession i s an important milestone. Faster integration into the
global economy should facilitate achievement of the SEDP's objective of lifting Vietnam from the
ranks of low-income countries by 2010. However, the unfinished reform agenda i s long, and the
timetable for completion will need to be compressed as exposure to global competition progressively
increases. We have no doubt that, with strong commitment to reform within its leadership, and with
continued support from its development partners, Vietnam will successfully meet these challenges,
and we wish the authorities every success inthese endeavors.
