F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective

(i)      Assist villagers to develop community public infrastructure and gain improved access to
         services;
(ii)     Build capacity and empower villages in poor districts to manage their own investment planning
         and sub-project implementation in a decentralized and transparent manner; and
(iii)    Strengthen local institutions to support participatory decision-making and conflict resolution
         processes at the village, khet (sub-district) and district levels, involving a broad range of
         villagers, including women and the poor.

Revised Project Development Objective

The original PDO remained unchanged throughout the project. However, additional key performance
indicators were added at Additional Financing.

 Comments                 Total number of districts reached. *Original targets above shown in Financing Agreement. The project
 (incl. % achievement)    achieved 80% of the anticipated 2340 sub-projects in the original credit (cycles I-V); and 94% of the 3,373 in
                          additional financing (cycles VI- VIII), including training sub-projects. Given the demand driven nature of the
                          project, and the flexibility in the amounts allocated to individual sub-projects it was difficult to estimate the
                          actual number and type of sub-projects to be delivered. The lower actual value achieved following Additional
                          Financing would also be expected as the costs of individual sub-projects increased over the project to improve
                          quality and the number of lower cost training and livelihoods activities declined as a % of the total sub-projects.
                          (Note: The actual value of 3,373 reported in last ISR inadvertently included financing provided under
                          component 3a of the Lao Upland Food Security Investment Project).

Comments                  Poverty targeting overall reached its targets. A target of 15% for villages without road access was set by the
(incl. % achievement)     task team after AF and entered in the ISR in 2010. Given these are the lowest levels of poverty grading, one can
                          assume that all PG0 villages did not have road access, and that a significant number of PG1 villages also lacked
                          road access.

             Comments     The team set a target of 15% in the ISR. Meetings consist of 33% PRF officials, 33% District officials and 33%
                          kum ban facilitators, (i.e. 15% women represents just under 50% of the community participants). This target
                          was reached.
                          Attendance of non-Lao-Thai ethnic group in PRF District Decision Meetings-the team used as a proxy for the
                          no. of non-Lao-Thai speaking kum ban facilitators. In practice, all kum ban facilitators for non-Lao speaking
                          communities were from those ethnic groups and would attend the required planning and decision making
                          meeting: half of those would be women (so the % attendance would be 100% and 50% respectively). The figure
                          as a % of the total number of participants of the meetings is not illustrative as it is contingent on PRF and
                          District officials.

                       other, that officials complained they were not sufficiently involved. Overall data suggests that 13% of sub-
                       projects were derived from district (not community/kum ban) priorities with very few in the latter years of the

                     1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

At appraisal, social indicators in Lao were some of the lowest in the East Asia and Pacific (EAP)
region. Maternal and child mortality and illiteracy rates were extremely high. Most remote
village and mountainous areas did not have schools, and almost 70 percent of the labor force was
uneducated. To bring about a sharp reduction in poverty by 2005, the Government of Lao PDR
(GoL) adopted a sustainable growth with equity strategy that was articulated through four pillars:
agriculture/forestry, education, health and infrastructure, especially rural roads. The Government
had also committed to a broad decentralization framework and to the creation of an environment
conducive to poverty reduction at the local level. This included efforts to improve poverty
reduction targeting in districts, villages and households. The PRF was designed to support these
efforts by targeting poor districts with direct flows of investment and capacity -building to
strengthen decentralized decision-making and implementation down to the village level.

The primary challenges to the delivery of local services and infrastructure in rural areas were
institutional, physical and sectoral: (i) the weak capacity of relevant government institutions to
undertake a national scale project, (ii) the geographical remoteness and difficulty of physical
access to a number of areas, and (iii) the highly diverse set of needs to be addressed involving
many sectors. At the time of preparation, poor health and education indicators and low
productivity were considered to be the result of low access to health and education services,
weak agricultural extension, limited irrigation and a sparse road network. Reconciling the weak
institutional capacity with this broad scope of operational activity was a critical dimension of the
problem to be addressed.

The rationale for Bank assistance aligned with three of the four CAS objectives. It intended to
contribute to the efforts to reduce poverty through sustainable growth, to focus on social service
delivery and infrastructure, and to consolidate donor and private sector support. The PRF would
contribute to each objective by respectively: (i) targeting poor districts and allowing all villages
within those districts to compete for resources, (ii) delivering small scale investments and
services at the village level, and (iii) encouraging the participation and collaboration of the
private sector in support of training, monitoring and evaluation. The intention to put in place a
mechanism through which project resources could flow directly to villages was a fundamental
decision of government supported by the Bank.

The Bank engagement in the project was further justified by the complementarity of the PRF
with other education, agriculture and infrastructure projects and, importantly, to establish a
potential channel for the utilization of revenues from the Nam Theun Two (NT2) hydropower
scheme for poverty reduction purposes. Government ownership and commitment was also high
for the country context, with the strong commitment of government at central and provincial
levels and across ministries, the commitment of leadership at political and operational levels.
Given global and regional experience in community-driven development projects, the Bank was
well placed to support the proposed project both in its design development and ongoing
implementation.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project specified three key development objectives:
(i)    Assist villagers to develop community public infrastructure and gain improved access to
       services:
          Sub-projects approved, contracted, completed by sector, by district, by annual
             cycle
          Quality of finished infrastructure
          Increase in access to infrastructure/service
          Demand of the poor of different sub-project types
          Number and percentage of ethnic minority beneficiaries
          Number and % of poor khets served.
          Number and % of poor districts served.
          % of beneficiaries satisfied with outputs.
          Number of participating communities with maintenance plans.
          Average unit costs of completed sub-projects by project type, by district, by
             province.

(ii)    Build capacity and empower villages in poor districts to manage their own investment
        planning and sub-project implementation in a decentralized and transparent manner:
           Number of complaints filed with provincial PRFP office and percent resolved
           Number of community procurements undertaken
           Number of contractor procurement undertaken
           Percent of community procurements being undertaken
           Average amount of community procurement and contractor procurements
           Number of male and female khet and district facilitators trained
           Percent of male and female facilitators trained
           Percent of ethnic minority facilitators at khet / district level
           Number of village visits per khet per month by districts and khet facilitators.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

The overall PDO remained substantively unchanged at additional financing, although the
wording was revised; indicators were reworded to improve measurability, new indicators were
added and a number of new targets were established.

PDO I: Financing community infrastructure activities, and other community public capital
investments endeavors and training activities at the village level.
  Utilization rates of public infrastructure and services delivered by the project, measured for
    each type of sub-project:
    - Schools: Number of students per teacher; >80% of sample villages with PRFP school
        sub-projects have net school enrolment rates >80% among children ages 6-10.
    - Health Dispensaries: in >60% of sample PRFP health centers, minimum package of
        health services is provided.
    - Road/Bridges: >80% of sample villages with PRFP road sub-projects will have access to
        district center by small vehicle all year round.
    - Water and Sanitation: >80% of sample villages with PRFP water/sanitation sub-projects
        have universal access to clean and safe water.
    - Overall quality of PRFP sub-projects: >70% of inspected PRFP sub-projects meet the
        PRFP technical guidelines.
  Beneficiary satisfaction with the public goods and services provided by the PRFP:
    - >70% of allocated sub-projects were identified as priorities at village level (during the
        Village Needs and Priorities Assessment (VNPA) meetings).
    - >80% satisfaction level from the beneficiaries regarding improved infrastructure and
        services.
  Pro-poor targeting:
    - % of infrastructure sub-projects in villages without road access.

    operation and process:
    - >70% of sub-projects will have operational maintenance plans after 3 years.

PDO III: Strengthening the capacity of local institutions to support participatory decision-
making at the village, kum ban, and district levels.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

The PDO captured the target of the PRF project as “communities in poor districts chosen on the
basis of population-weighted poverty incidence?. All villages within a selected district were
eligible to participate, with higher priority being given to villagers evaluated locally as poor.
Beneficiaries included a broad range of poor villagers, including women and ethnic minorities?,
and local institutions.

1.5       Original Components

The project was structured in three components:

         Component 1: Village Project Sub-project Grants. (US$16.10m total financing 74.2%,
          US$14.98m IDA). This component was designed to finance grants for eligible sub-
          projects identified by communities. Eligible local infrastructure projects included
          transport infrastructure, schools and nurseries, clinics, community halls and other public
          buildings, communal water supply systems, irrigation and drainage systems and local
          markets. Coverage of 21 districts in 5 provinces was agreed. The ceiling of any sub-
          project was set at US$25,000; works were expected to average US$6,400. It was
          anticipated that this menu of options would expand as capacity developed.2

         Component 2: Local Capacity Building. (US$3.17m total financing 14.6%, US$2.17m
          IDA). The component was focused on the empowerment and capacity building at the
          community level. It was designed to provide support for Provincial technical support
          teams, as well as district and khet facilitators, including all operational, office and travel
          requirements to support the participatory processes at the sub-national level.

         Component 3: National Project Management. (US$2.44m total financing 11.2%,
          US$2.19m IDA). This component supported central level staffing, management,
          monitoring, reporting an operating the Poverty Reduction Fund, including all operational
          costs and technical assistance.

1.6 Revised Components

Additional Financing (US$15.0 million IDA) was approved on July 15, 2008. It was
supplemented with US$4.8 million parallel financing from the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation (SDC). The additional financing was provided to continue supporting the
development of local infrastructure and community empowerment in the poorest districts in
another three cycles of implementation until a revised end date of September 30, 2011. The
project was scaled up and restructured to enhance development impact by (i) refocusing
activities on government’s “first priority? districts only; and (ii) enhancing training of
government officials (not only local PRF staff) in participatory approaches.3
2
  The FA showed 22 districts and also noted that all villages within a targeted district were eligible to participate in the Project.
3
  The FA for AF notes the project components as Part A: Village Sub-project Grants - Carrying out of Sub-projects through the
provision of Sub-grants made available by the Poverty Reduction Fund out of the proceeds of the Grant to a village or group of
villages to finance the carrying out of the corresponding Sub-project in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Sub-grant
Agreement. Part B: Capacity Building for Communities and Local Institutions (a) Strengthening of Beneficiary capacity to
implement Sub-projects under Part A of the Project, including Sub-project identification, planning and implementation, through


                                                                  4
Accordingly, revisions were made to the following components and funding allocations:

     Component 1: Village Project Sub-project Grants. (US$8.37m additional financing IDA;
      US$4.8million SDC) Component 1 was revised to ensure the coverage of the project
      improved pro-poor targeting. The project removed seven districts that were not considered
      government “first priority?, added 9 others in the target provinces and included another
      province (Luang Namtha) with three districts, resulting in a new set of 19 first priority target
      districts. The change in coverage did not aim to reach more beneficiaries but rather focus
      assistance on those with the greatest need. Another change was the modification of the
      eligible list of sub-projects to exclude support of livelihood activities which, as private
      goods, broadened the scope of the project and required a different set of technical skills
      which the project was unable to deliver effectively across such a wide set of districts. After
      Additional Financing, the final allocation to Component 1 represented 71.48% overall.

     Component 2: Local Capacity Building. ((US$2.93m additional financing IDA). In
      addition to the community capacity building elements of this component (US$2.44 million), a
      new sub-component, Capacity Building for Local Institutions (Component 2b), was added
      (US$0.49 million). The new component was introduced in 2008 to assist district officials in
      their dialogue with communities, increase district and province officials awareness of the
      benefits of participatory planning, and training them in participatory planning methods, and
      supporting capacity building manuals and more frequent visits to villages.

     Component 3: National Project Management (US$3.69 additional financing IDA).
      Continued support for national level management through the established Project
      Implementing Unit.

1.7       Other significant changes

The activities funded with the additional financing remained consistent with the original project
objectives. Implementation arrangements through the PIU were retained. Other efforts to
improve the progress toward the PDO were included and approved at additional financing:

     Targeting of non-Lao speaking ethnic groups through an information, education and
      communication strategy and recruitment of skilled staff (communications officers and
      translators) able to better involve non-Lao speaking communities.
     Increased collaboration with line agencies through national level dialogue with line
      ministries and through enhanced support at the district level included under the new sub-
      component 2(b).
     Increased focus on O&M to be achieved through the development of maintenance plans with
      assigned responsibilities for communities and relevant district level line agencies for
      improved sustainability of sub-projects.


the provision of technical assistance, training, and goods for provincial technical support teams, and district and Kum ban
facilitators; and (b) strengthening the Recipient’s institutional capacity at the district and provincial levels to improve quality of
service delivery, promote participatory planning and facilitate dialogue between districts and communities, though the provision
of training and technical assistance. Part C: National Project Management Supporting the management and operation of the
Poverty Reduction Fund through the provision of technical assistance, vehicles and other goods.


                                                                   5
     Changes in the technical design of the project. Reflecting lessons learned, a number of
      technical changes were included in the Project Operational Manual (POM) following
      additional financing. These included revisions to the technical guidelines to improve
      construction quality standards, improved communication efforts to promote understanding of
      the PRF principles of community engagement.
     Changes to improve pro-poor targeting of infrastructure. Village infrastructure endowments
      were surveyed annually from 2008 to determine where infrastructure sub-projects should be
      focused.

                           2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis. The background analysis for the project recognized the
challenging context of Lao PDR at the time of preparation and appraisal. There was a strong
rationale for the project within the CAS. The involvement of communities in making decisions
over local development and investment was new to Lao, and the preparation adequately took
account of the national context. The PRF was developed within the framework of the burgeoning
community-driven development (CDD), social fund and local development fund operations,
being adopted throughout the East Asia region at the time, and relevant lessons were
thoughtfully incorporated. The counterpart team was given the opportunity to see and discuss the
model through exchanges with Indonesian government counterparts. The project effectively
supported the government’s ambitious strategy and targets for improving human development
indicators and focused on achievable ends. Further analysis at preparation, however, particularly
around local political economies, may have enabled more detailed preparation and subsequent
support for the implementation processes envisaged.

Project Design. The PDO focused on the development of relevant goals toward infrastructure
services, capacity building and community participation. These were innovative and achievable
within the scope of the operation and engendered a new approach in the context of a centralized
state. The selection of the social fund model was consistent with the strong focus of the GoL on
poverty reduction through enhanced basic services delivery and rural infrastructure. The model
incorporated the potential benefits of bottom up planning and village management of funds to
enhance development effectiveness, though it did not pursue the more rigorous empowerment
ends of the CDD model. This was appropriate given the highly centralized system and the
narrow space for voice and participation outside government and state affiliated structures
prevailing in Lao PDR at the time, and also the low capacity of remote communities for
grassroots financial management.

A second key parameter of the project design was the selection of the institutional arrangements,
in particular the establishment of an autonomous project implementing agency attached to the
Office of the Prime Minister.4 The project team and government counterpart considered obvious


4
  The PRF was legally established by decree as an autonomous entity attached to the Prime Minister’s office, reporting to an
Administrative Board. The executive director of the PRF managed a pyramidal structure of national, provincial and district level
consultants who carried out technical, administrative, fiduciary and community development roles. The organizational structure
is decentralized, with most tasks being decided and carried out locally. Links are made to the sector ministries at each level and to


                                                                 6
alternatives (e.g. implementation through line departments). The decision to ring fence the Fund
and focus on delivering infrastructure services and piloting new methods was made with due
note of ambitious service delivery targets and the limited capacity and understanding of local
government structures. It also seems to have been prudent in hindsight, as the decentralization
policy and structures under discussion at appraisal during the project implementation period. If
there is a question about this institutional arrangement, it is not about its appropriateness at
appraisal but whether this model should have evolved to support the development of evolving
sub-national institutional structures.

The project was complex by nature of its diversity and coverage of micro-projects at the
grassroots level. It was also highly innovative for Lao PDR at the time. Community participation
at this scale had not been attempted; a top-down decision-making model was the norm for the
types of services and infrastructure envisaged. The PRF was established with one primary, well-
positioned government counterpart and a set of three straightforward components: grants,
capacity building and project management. The three components were rational and provided a
sound structure for implementing, budgeting and reporting. Social and environmental impacts of
these micro-projects were modest.

Although the three parts to the PDO reflected the key ingredients of a social fund (service
delivery, community participation and institutional strengthening), their structure and equal
weighting were problematic. The PRF’s PDO results framework was also loosely defined,
indicators were a mix of outcomes and low level outputs, many without targets, and they did not
adequately capture the capacity and empowerment of village management and strengthened local
institutions.

The overall design of the PRF was relevant and workable, although details needed for effective
implementation were lacking – especially given its innovative nature. The challenges of
delivering and maintaining small scale infrastructure in such remote areas were not fully
recognized, and the potential safeguards issues could have been given more attention. The
participatory process, fundamental to the project approach, was not fully disaggregated across
the stages of participation. The implications of cultural and linguistic diversity for effective
participatory processes were not adequately considered. Given the challenges of working in a
state with a high propensity for top-down processes, with marginalized ethnic minority and
women beneficiaries and multi-income target districts, more detailed preparation may have led to
more effective participation in the start up phase.

Government commitment. The PRF has enjoyed high-level political commitment throughout. It
was anchored by the Prime Minister’s Office, the Administrative Board of the PRF being chaired
by a Deputy Prime Minister. The long-serving Executive Director of the PRF was well respected
and an effective advocate for the project. This commitment has been consistent throughout from
those engaged in the design, oversight and direct implementation of the PRF. The project has not
however always enjoyed the full support of all line ministries, with some questioning the
participatory approaches that underpin PRF delivery and others the institutional autonomy of the
PRF. Nevertheless, the contention that greater commitment at entry from line agencies may have

the governor’s offices at provincial and district levels. However, the PRF functions as a largely ring fenced service delivery
agency.




                                                                 7
resulted in more coordination remains unproven. The weak cooperation of some line ministries at
the national level only emerged over time, and resolution of technical issues raised by ministries
(e.g. technical standards, coordinated planning and operations and maintenance) is unlikely to
have solved the inter-governmental issues encountered. Cooperation at the provincial and district
levels has largely been satisfactory.

Assessment of Risks. At appraisal the overall risk rating of the project meeting its PDO was
considered Modest (M). Three main risks were identified; (i) political interference in PRF
operations (M), (ii) community groups unable to formulate proposals (M), and (iii) not enough
facilitators qualified to work with communities (M). The strong leadership of the PRF ensured it
was able to establish its autonomy and was not politically captured at the national level.
Community groups formulated proposals. Facilitators were identified and overall project
management ensured the annual processes were implemented. However the overall assessment
of risk at entry was implausibly low, given that the project was new in the Lao context,
challenging in any context, and contained many unknowns that were impossible to anticipate. In
hindsight, substantial risks in reaching the poor and local elite capture emerged, high risks with
regard to local capacity and grass roots procurement and financial management capacity became
apparent quickly, and risks regarding sustainability and technical quality emerged over time.
While the poverty targeting risk was adequately addressed, the capacity risks were only partially
mitigated through revisions at Additional Financing. The risks framework, rightly, introduced a
risk concerning the misallocation of resources (missing at appraisal). Sustainability risks might
have also been included.

The Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio – 2 (QALP-2) undertaken by the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) of the World Bank in 2010 rated the Quality of Design as Moderately
Satisfactory (MS): Strategic Relevance and Approach were rated Satisfactory (S); Realism of
Project Design and Risks was rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS); and Fiduciary, Safeguards
and Governance and Anti-corruption aspects were rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

2.2    Implementation

Major factors contributing to effective implementation. The implementation of the project
was relatively smooth for a complex project with a pyramidal implementation structure reaching
from the national level down to villages. Government commitment at the highest level enabled
the machinery of government, including the Ministry of Finance, to support the PRF to work
with autonomy and thereby focus on its poverty reduction ends (e.g. in the management of the
special account). Management was effective; there was a strong champion of the project from
design to completion. A stable cadre of mid-level managers emerged, and they have good
knowledge of the delivery systems.

Major factors affecting implementation. Following a delay in start up, disbursement
throughout the project was consistent and on-track, exceeding the estimated disbursement profile
during the Additional Financing phase. The key factors affecting implementation were:
 Staffing and compensation. In the first years of implementation, the project suffered from a
    high turnover of staff (35% in 2005) particularly in key senior positions, due to inadequate
    compensation. A salary grid was put in place and phased increases in salaries were
    established in early 2007.


                                                8
   Weak capacity at the lower levels of implementation. Staffing district positions (and some
    provincial) proved difficult given the remoteness of many locations. Training was limited,
    and although this improved as the project became established (and was boosted at Additional
    Financing), overall, training of PIU staff was insufficient.
   Working in decentralized environments. Other concerns that flow from a decentralized
    project implemented by communities included: the lack of banks in some provinces (e.g.,
    Saravane), low capacity of kum ban facilitators and an inadequate market of private
    contractors willing to work in remote locations.
   Inter-ministerial collaboration. Problems with line ministry collaboration at central level
    were raised at various times. While this did not affect progress in the funding and
    implementation of sub-projects, it did affect progress in relation to local capacity building.
    Practical coordination at the lower levels improved, with signs that some provinces have
    sound coordination and relationships at district level.
   Managing Information. At the national level the delays in putting in place a robust and
    reliable MIS system affected early efforts to collect and manage data.

The primary external factor to affect implementation was the 2007-8 price increases for
construction materials, which caused some contractors to cancel contracts because they could not
complete them for agreed prices.

The mid-term review (MTR) was conducted in December 2005, by which time disbursement was
largely on track. The government had established a functioning PIU and 1,347 sub-projects had
been completed. The MTR itself did not employ a strategic evaluative approach that considered
relevance, appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of the project, but it identified a few
practical concerns (staff turnover training of PRF staff, sub-project size) and slowed project
expansion. A more strategic and rigorous approach to the MTR might have enabled earlier
identification of issues that were then only addressed at Additional Financing.

A significant implementation quality concern emerged during cycle VI, when field visits and an
internal assessment raised concerns regarding the accuracy of poverty targeting. Overall, the
proportion of projects implemented in the three poorest grades of villages was in the region of
67%, with the poorest targeting occurring in the first cycle (53%) and the highest in cycle VII
(75%). In cycle VI, sub-projects implemented in the group of villages (PG0-2) was as low as
22%, while the relatively better-off villages in the target districts received the lions share (78%).
By 2009, following the introduction of a quota for targeting of poorer villages on the basis of
annual assessments, the project staff became familiar with the issue and met targets of 66% of
sub-projects and at least 50% of sub-project budgets.

The preparation of the Additional Financing (AF) grant prompted deeper reflection and more
robust analytical work on project strengths and weaknesses, which helped to inform the design of
the AF phase. The AF attempted to address the weakness in the capacity building components as
well as geographic coverage and targeting. While the latter improved, the sustained capacity-
building investments necessary to systematically sensitize and engage local government officials,
and to effectively strengthen the capacity of remote and poorly educated communities, remained
insufficient.




                                                 9
The QALP-2 undertaken in 2010 noted that the PRF implementation progress was Moderately
Satisfactory, recognizing that solutions were found to emerging problems but also finding
weaknesses with respect to targeting the poorest, compliance with procurement procedures,
supervision of social and environmental safeguards, and the weak buy-in and capacity of local
government. These were all critical to the project implementation but the QALP-2 process was
completed too late to have significant impact on project implementation. The project was not
considered at risk at any time during implementation.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project design noted the importance of Monitoring and Evaluation, allocated sufficient
budgets and established M&E as a primary task of the PIU but preparation proceeded without a
reliable baseline. A monitoring framework was agreed at appraisal and included a range of
instruments at the village, khet, provincial and national levels. A Management Information
System (MIS) was envisaged along with the staffing necessary to manage the various monitoring
and reporting processes. However, key indicators put in place at appraisal lacked clarity and
specificity in places, and included output indicators (no. projects built, no. proposals submitted,
no. visits) that were not adequate to assess progress toward the PDO. Targets were not set for
most indicators. The indicators were revised at Additional Financing in 2008 with an effort to
improve the relevance and measurability of indicators, but some targets were still not set. While
the revision led to a more rigorous results framework which focused more on outcomes and
clarified intermediate outcomes by component, the lack of targets for several indicators remained
a significant shortcoming.

Monitoring and evaluating a project with such broad coverage is a difficult task, and the project
faced and resolved a number of challenges during implementation. The process of developing the
M&E systems in PRF was a learning process, with gradual improvement over the duration of the
project. In particular, the project initially struggled with a low-cost in-house system that
compiled information of variable quality. The MIS was substantially upgraded in 2005 and
became a robust and reliable management information system by 2007. Data quality gradually
improved. Though a baseline was not produced and data was not analyzed in the early years,
analysis did improve over time and ultimately provided information on whether PRF was/was
not reaching the poorest communities. Qualitative monitoring was not undertaken or not utilized
effectively until the latter years of the project (e.g. the sustainability report). Perhaps most
importantly, the project adapted en route with the adoption of village poverty profiles for
targeting purpose from 2008 onwards, when experience showed that the poverty data provided
by the National Statistics Center did not accurately reflect realities on the ground.

Although the Bank conducted a useful evaluation in early 2008 to inform preparation of the
Additional Finance phase, evaluation is a particular weak spot and back loading of evaluations to
the end of the project contributed to a general lack of familiarity with the content of the results
framework and a lack of awareness of impacts as they emerged. This exposed the project to risks
that might have been avoided if corrected earlier in implementation. The process of obtaining
information for the ICR underlined the internal weakness in data utilization and analysis; the
independent assessments which were to provide the necessary information were delayed and
inadequately managed. The PIU recognizes the limitations of its M&E capabilities, and efforts
are underway in PRF II to strengthen the capabilities of the unit.


                                                10
2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

         1. Safeguards

The project was correctly categorized as category B – partial assessment. Although projects were
small in size, two safeguards were triggered: environmental assessment (OP4.01) and indigenous
peoples (OP4.10). Safeguard issues arose during project implementation but were minor and
mitigated through standard procedures.

     Environmental Assessment. Compliance with OP4.01 on Environment Assessment was
      rated satisfactory throughout the project. The project’s village grant component had modest
      environmental impacts which were due mainly to the construction or refurbishment of roads
      and issues of water quality. . The 2010 QALP-2 noted that there had been insufficient
      monitoring of project compliance with the environmental assessment safeguard. Subsequent
      to this, a mission was conducted and found that there were no significant negative impacts
      due to civil works, but noted a lack of safeguard reporting, and limited understanding of
      safeguard issues and procedures during sub-project selection. As a result, monitoring was
      stepped up, additional training was provided and World Bank staff in-country were enlisted
      to provide environmental safeguard support in the implementation support missions in the
      last eighteen months of implementation.

     Indigenous Peoples. Compliance with OP4.01 on Indigenous Peoples was also satisfactory.
      The project data shows that ethnic minorities comprised on average 36% of the project’s
      beneficiaries. The participatory approach adopted for planning and implementation of the
      project ensured that the needs of ethnic minorities were addressed in a culturally sensitive
      manner. The results framework included a specific target that could be monitored (no. of
      non-Lao speaking facilitators) though it did not prove to be a robust indicator. As part of the
      project preparation, a social assessment described the particular problems associated with
      improving access for ethnic groups to services. At additional financing the focus on reaching
      ethnic minorities was improved through the pro-poor targeting.

Other social safeguard issues which emerged were isolated, minor problems rather than systemic
non-compliance. While these cases were managed transparently once the PIU became aware of
them, they do raise some doubt about the appraisal of social safeguards. In particular:

     Involuntary Resettlement. The Involuntary Resettlement safeguard (OP4.12) was not
      triggered by the project. With respect to the issue of resettlement, the PRF documents note
      “forced (involuntary) resettlement is not allowed under any conditions and voluntary
      resettlement requires an early special approval from Vientiane prior to any decision in the
      inter khet meeting (POM, 2003). In the main, this requirement was understood at national
      and provincial level and largely respected. The PRF’s approach effectively provided a local
      development model for remote communities utilizing participatory approaches. However, the
      GoL’s national village consolidation policy was not without effect on the project. The POM
      specified that PRF funds were not to be used in (i) villages that had been recently resettled, or
      (ii) villages where there were imminent plans for consolidation. All road sub-projects were
      for road rehabilitation, as a result of which right-of-way and land ownership issues applied
      only to marginal road widening.


                                                   11
   A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) conducted by the World Bank in 2007,
   noted that cases of resettlement had been reported, mostly where Provinces had not followed
   project guidelines and procedures. In all, about 18 out of the 1,880 PRF beneficiary villages
   (1%) were flagged as having possible resettlement issues: three villages in Bachieng district
   and two villages in Soukouma district (Champasak province), one village in Samuai district
   (Saravan province), and 12 villages in Nalae district (Luang Nam Tha province)). Of the
   latter, 11 are potentially at risk of resettlement as a result of a planned hydropower project
   not associated with the World Bank. For these villages, the PIU has confirmed that it is
   following up on the resettlement plan to ensure that if relocated after the closing of the
   project, these villages will receive appropriate compensation and replacement for the
   infrastructure provided by the PRF project. This will be monitored carefully under PRF II,
   which has triggered the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard.

       2. Fiduciary compliance

       a. Financial Management

Financial Management (FM) arrangements in PRF met the minimum requirements of OP/BP
10.02 and operated fairly smoothly over the course of the project. PIU staff gained continuous
training and experience until their performance surpassed that of most other projects; systems
(accounts packages and an internal control unit) were gradually put in place. The project rightly
identified risks regarding advances and these were tightly controlled; quarterly Interim
Unaudited Financial Management Reports (IFRs) were submitted on time and were mostly
accurate; annual audit reports were also timely and consistently unqualified. The Bank conducted
annual transaction reviews and an integrated fiduciary review, which helped the project to
develop capacity and focus on weaker areas. Those internal control issues that emerged did not
raise significant FM flags. Nevertheless, a number of FM risks were identified at appraisal and
persisted throughout the project: the risk of misallocation of resources at the local level in the
300-400 transfers made annually, the scale of the operation, and the weak capacity of the
country.

The development of a steady track record also meant that PRF became the vehicle of choice for
disaster response activities after 2009, over-stretching PIU staff and resulting in minor problems
(in reporting, records, trainings). Community-level procurement and financial management was,
unsurprisingly, challenging in an environment marked by low levels of literacy, numeracy and
understanding of basic book and record keeping. The fiduciary reviews nevertheless noted that
some provinces/districts had stronger FM practices than others, indicating that concentrated
capacity building, monitoring and compliance checks could result in improvements in FM
performance.

The QALP-2 noted weaknesses in FM and procurement (see below), suggesting a risk of a
disconnect between fiduciary performance and supervision ratings. However, the Integrated
Fiduciary and Safeguard Assessment (IFSA) undertaken by the Bank in 2011 rated PRF as
Satisfactory. The report noted that (in the provinces visited) Provincial staff were capable, but
raised questions about the appropriateness of procedures applied given the significant level of
community payments. A checklist procedure for all community payments has since been put in
place and is being implemented in PRF II.


                                               12
       b. Procurement
Procurement in PRF can be considered in terms of (i) national level procurement, mainly the
procurement of goods, services, consultants (conducted through a standard procurement plan at
the national level) and (ii) the highly decentralized procurement of sub-projects at kum ban level.

   With regard to national level procurement, subject to World Bank prior and post review, PRF
    had a moderately satisfactory track record with minimal deviation from procedures.

   With regard to decentralized procurement, between 248 and 548 contracts are awarded
    annually to multiple beneficiaries. The project has also seen over 65% sub-projects procured
    by kum ban representatives for the construction of facilities (schools, health clinics) and
    infrastructure (roads, bridges, culverts). Procedures for these procurements were specified in
    the POM, and were subject to post review. Thirteen post reviews were carried out over the
    duration of the project, and an IFSA was carried out in early 2011. These post reviews
    documented minor procedural non-compliances in 28% of the contracts reviewed. This is not
    inconsistent with other CDD projects in EAP where experience suggests that minor
    procedural issues arise in an isolated, non-systemic way. Up to 2010, no technical deviations
    had been identified though the number of technical supervision visits was limited in coverage
    and scope. Over the 8 year duration of PRF I and thousands of contracts, only one instance of
    a possible indicator of collusion (2010) on a sub-project was reported.

The QALP-2 review of 2010 raised a number of questions regarding the procurement
performance of PRF and rated procurement as Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU). Two procedural
non-compliances were noted in the review: (i) the practice of price negotiation with winning
bidders resulting in a lower final price, and (ii) less than 3 contractors bidding and contracts
being awarded. The PIU argued that, while on the whole they could and would meet these
requirements in typical situations, on occasion, especially in remote mountains areas, these
procedures became a constraint to the implementation of sub-projects in poor rural villages – the
difficulty of finding contractors to take on construction contracts a long distance from district
centers over difficult terrain was a significant constraint to implementation; and that neither
practice resulted in inflated prices of contracts. Several issues raised by the QALP -2 review had
been addressed during the Additional Financing design – improving procurement capacity and
tightening procedural controls. Nevertheless, further efforts were made following the QALP -2 to
enhance supervision and take additional corrective actions in light of the recommendations. The
IFSA conducted in 2011, while limited in scope (and noting a possible non-compliance of the
supply of materials on a community contract, rated procurement on 7 randomly selected sub-
projects as Satisfactory (5) and Moderately Satisfactory (2).

The procurement challenges of such a broadly decentralized project operating in remote areas
seem to have been underestimated at design and under-supported during implementation. There
are indications that the project was slow to act on recommendations and similar requests were
repeated each year. Comparatively, the procurement capacity of the PRF PIU is still considered
significantly stronger than that of most other projects in Lao PDR. PRF II has further tightened
procurement controls, and enhanced procurement staffing.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The PRF II project became effective on October 12, 2011, with a gap of only 12 days following
the closure of PRF additional Financing phase. The overall success of PRF I from the perspective
of government and Development Partners was also reflected in the co-financing arrangements
put in place for PRF II, with the GoL (US$10 million), the SDC (US$10 million) and the
Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID, AUD20 million) more than
matching the IDA Grant (US$25 million) for PRF II. Counterparts and the task team worked
intensively to ensure that the transition to PRF II was smooth. PRF II, which will run until 2016,
anticipates broadening the project footprint to reach approximately 275 kum bans. As it will
retain about 50% of PRF I kum bans, it will continue to address the capacity of these
communities. The budget of US$65 million is also more targeted to allow for more intensive
support in fewer villages than was achievable in phase 1. In response to a GoL request to
reinstitute support for livelihoods through the PRF, a livelihoods and nutrition pilot is also being
implemented with parallel financing from a Japanese Social Development Fund grant (US$2.6
million).

Two key issues affect the sustainability of completed sub-projects: buy-in from line ministries
for the maintenance of infrastructure, and the continued commitment of communities. While this
remains a critical concern and there are instances where the breakdown of these two
requirements has affected the utilization and satisfaction of services, on the whole the project
reached the targets set for operations and maintenance. Community contributions were 25%, well
over the target of 15%; O&M committees were formed for 100% of the infrastructure and
facilities constructed; and 63% of these committees collected maintenance funds (albeit minimal)
and practiced maintenance three years after completion. All infrastructure and facilities were
recorded in line ministry books and maintenance arrangements were routinely formalized.
However, the commitment and capacity to maintain assets financed through PRF vary in
practice. Limited sector budgets affect the levels of maintenance. This is especially acute for
roads sub-projects, as the GoL has generally not allocated sufficient budgets for the maintenance
of rural roads.

The learning dimension of PRF improved over the duration of the project. PRF II has taken on
board many of the lessons of the first phase of the operation. It is notable that these lessons have
been taken up and applied at various levels – from the PDO down to village level procedures. Of
particular note is that the PDO is more sharply focused on access to infrastructure and services,
noting that capacity building and participation are a means to this end. Technical revisions
included measures for improved poverty targeting. A revision of GoL policy shifts the focus of
poverty targeting from the district to the narrower focus of the kum ban as the unit for poverty
targeting. Multi-year investment plans will be introduced to improve the participatory process
and strengthen linkages with local government and sector planning and budgeting. Four rounds
of grants per kum ban will deepen investment to improve impact and enhance participation
through repeated processes. The use of sector guidelines and personnel in project appraisal and
supervision, as well as procedural changes will be established to improve technical quality. PRF
II also foresees a greater focus on gender, and the feedback and complaints handling
mechanisms. Fiduciary controls have been tightened through the establishment of an internal
controls unit and the recruitment of additional procurement personnel. Finally, there is an
increased focus on M&E, including plans for regular qualitative analysis and an impact


                                                14
evaluation. While these revisions address a number of operational issues and are likely to
improve effectiveness, the issue of sustainability is still a risk recognized by the project.

Recommendations for the future. Future efforts might also focus on: (i) greater collaboration
with other projects in Lao PDR which are largely concerned with the strengthening of local
governance; (ii) strengthening of project governance features to further enhance project
transparency and accountability; (iii) more community and local government capacity building;
(iv) more rigorous qualitative analysis and experimental fieldwork, especially in relation to
gender, voice and engagement; and (v) strengthening of the PIU M&E team. See Section 6.

                                     3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory
The objectives and overall design of the PRF were relevant at appraisal, additional financing and
at the time of closing in 2011. The PRF project strongly supported key priorities of the Lao PDR
to achieve a sharp reduction in the incidence, depth and severity of poverty through four strategic
pillars (agriculture/forestry, education, health and road infrastructure). By supporting
infrastructure building and community empowerment, PRF is in line with the National Growth
and Poverty Eradication Strategy and the National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006-
2010). It also supported the complementary objectives of the CAS (2005), in particular the focus
on social service delivery and investments in infrastructure. The operation was central to
achieving country and Bank objectives. At Additional Financing, the project adapted to a critical
lesson regarding local government capacity building and refocused efforts to ensure poor villages
were benefiting first and foremost. As completion approached, in order to continue its
contribution to poverty reduction, government requested a second phase of the project building
upon the same principles, approaches and implementing arrangements. One of the overall project
achievements, and an indicator of relevance, is that the GoL embraced the PRF approach as a
key vehicle for rural poverty reduction.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory
Project performance was satisfactory in achieving the primary part of the PDO – improved
access to public infrastructure and services at the village level. Linkages to the poverty reduction
overarching goal were direct and outcomes visible. The project achieved a very broad coverage
in poverty-related investments. Largely consistent with targets set at Additional Financing, the
project implemented 3,179 sub-projects in 28 poor districts in 7 provinces: built 616 schools, 86
bridges, 65 health dispensaries, 669 clean water systems and 156 irrigation schemes; over 3,000
km of rural roads were upgraded. The focus on education (34% of total budget), public works
and transport (32%), health/water and sanitation (22%), agriculture infrastructure (4%) provides
a strong indication of its focus on rural basic services. With regard to sector indicators, the end of
project assessment of a sample of built infrastructure found that services were being provided.
Schools had on average 46 students per teacher (range 6-83) with an enrolment rate of 90% of
the schools visited. 81% of health clinics in the sample offered a minimum package of health
services to local communities. While 80% of villages opting for water sub-projects had access to


                                                 15
clean water, only 50% of roads in the sample had year round use by small vehicle. With the
exception of the all-weather requirement for roads, these values suggest that most sector targets,
while modest, were met. Technical quality targets (>70%) were reached overall, but varied
substantially, from the highly successful water supply systems (100%), to schools (79%) and the
few but problematic irrigation sub-projects (50%). Over the eight cycles of implementation, 90-
95% of the sub-projects provided remote rural villages with infrastructure and substantially
improved their access to services.

The average number of beneficiaries per year (cycle) was over 400,000. Beneficiary satisfaction
was on average 81.1%. The sector-wise breakdown was as follows: health clinic (70%), roads
(82.3%), deep wells (76.7%), spring fed water supply (81.8%), electricity (100%). Community
halls (60%) and market halls (65%) received much lower satisfaction ratings and were added to
the negative list at Additional Financing.

After some initial challenges, poverty targeting improved over the life of the project. In cycles I-
V, the percentage of sub-projects and/or budgets spent in the poorest villages (categories PG0-2)
only ranged from 30-49%. This was due, inter alia, to inadequate poverty data, a lack of defined
poverty targets, and the weak capacity of PRF staff at start-up. By cycle VII and VIII however,
this expenditure had reached 78% with project team efforts to carry out poverty profiles, clarity
on the PRF targeting and more skilled facilitators, reaching out from district centers. Overall, this
accounts for about 58% of the budget being spent in the poorest villages (PG0-2). The proportion
of ethnic minority beneficiaries (about 36% overall) also suggests that the project was largely
successful in targeting poor villages and meeting priority needs in difficult, remote areas of the
country. Parallel interventions, notably the GOL’s intensive efforts at rural electrification,
converged to bring about visible increases in access to public infrastructure.

These sub-projects were delivered efficiently overall – notwithstanding the normal caveats of
CDD projects such as thinly spread budgets and the challenges of maintaining technical quality.
Unit costs were low when compared with other government built infrastructure (35-42% of the
cost of roads and 82-88% of the cost of schools). Moreover the project delivered these results
utilizing a very different approach than had been seen hitherto in Lao, establishing the seeds of
CDD and introducing a new needs-based approach to local development. Critically it did so in
the most remote and some of the poorest parts of the country. Given the overarching goal of the
project, this objective – access to village infrastructure and services – has a significantly higher
weighting than the other capacity building objectives.

Performance against the second objective (Building Local Capacity at the village level) was
moderately satisfactory. A total of 1,113 training events were conducted in kum bans, for
approximately 68,000 community members. Capacity improved and communities were
empowered to play a central role in project processes, although the fieldwork conducted for the
ICR highlighted the lack of women’s engagement in public meetings. 852 community members
(kum ban representatives), including women, were mobilized to participate in district level
decision-making processes, manage project planning, implementation and finances. The
accountability meeting, a social audit process, was introduced by the project. This project was
largely alone among other top-down development interventions in its efforts to build capacity for
participation. These achievements, while limited, can be directly attributed to PRF interventions.



                                                 16
The primary indicators for this objective did not set many numerical targets, but did include
indicators that would start to measure community participation and capacity. The attendance of
women at district decision meetings was sound (50% of community representatives) (although
the indicator itself is unclear); all facilitators at kum ban level were non-Lao speaking,
community contributions reached 25%, well over the 15% target, and the indicator which
measured responsiveness to women’s priorities suggests that 91% of the sub-projects were on
women’s lists, well over the 50% target. Communities were mobilized in all cases to establish
O&M committees and 63% of these had mobilized funds. However, an effective conflict
resolution processes did not emerge until the final year of the project.

Performance against the third objective (Strengthening the capacity of local institutions to
support participatory decision-making) was moderately satisfactory. Enhanced funds for capacity
building of local institutions were provided at Additional Financing. 181 training events were
provided for over 310,000 provincial, district and kum ban facilitators. Progress was sufficient
for the project to deliver the sub-projects intended to reduce poverty, but increased capacity was
largely limited to the PRF project units. Targets were not set for this objective. District officials
participated in key meetings as expected. 55 training events were conducted on the principles
and approaches of PRF implementation (including community participation) for about 19,293
district and 1,607 provincial officials. The moderate shortcomings in achieving this objective
may, however, affect the sustainability and replicability of the participatory approach. The
technical support of local officials, not just PRF staff at the district level, is vital for post-project
sustainability of the sub-projects built under the PRF. While capacity building is hard to
measure, further consideration could have been given to the indicators of this part of the PDO.

The QALP-2 Assessment of the likelihood of achieving the PDO was Satisfactory/Likely.

3.3     Efficiency

An economic return was not estimated at appraisal. Analysis conducted for this completion
report to estimate the benefits of infrastructure investments by drawing on similar operations,
suggests average returns around 21%. A 2011 comparative assessment of the unit costs of PRF
and Government financed infrastructure illustrates that, with some variation between the north
and south of Lao PDR, costs were between 35% and 88% lower in PRF financed projects due to
in-kind community contributions, community-based procurement, knowledge of local costs and a
unit-costs database.

Administrative costs were initially high (60% and 35% in the first and second year respectively)
but dropped to 8-10% in subsequent years. Overall this resulted in a 15% average operational
cost ratio, lower than the 25% ceiling established at appraisal. The rolling nature of the project
saw administrative costs increase each time new provinces were added to expand coverage. If
training and facilitation costs from Component 2 are included as overheads for capital
investments (i.e. empowerment/participation is not considered an outcome of PRF but a cost of
delivering infrastructure), then the administrative cost overall is estimated at 27%.

Notwithstanding the benefits of community participation in the construction phase of village
development a technical quality trade-off was noticeable, as semi-skilled labor and lesser quality
materials were used, at times reducing quality, beneficiary satisfaction and utilization rates. This


                                                   17
risk was not identified at appraisal. Over the range of infrastructure types, an acceptable level of
quality was achieved in 100% of spring fed gravity water supply systems, but only 50% of weirs.
Utilization ranged from 99% roads to only 78% for weirs constructed with project funds. See
Table 3.3 Annex 3.

The non-cash benefits accruing to PRF sub-projects include the time saved in collecting water;
the time and cost savings of more immediate access to transport produce and/or non-forest
timber products to markets. The combinations of new village infrastructure and facilities such as
roads that linked with schools and markets, meant that beneficiaries increased productivity and
prioritized education for children. Other savings of better infrastructure included the normal
annual damage due to flooding. In sub-projects carried out under a community force account,
community members received income for work carried out, and contractors also employed local
labor, thereby generating employment for short periods in remote villages.

Beneficiary satisfaction surveys indicated a village satisfaction rate of 81% (for the sample of 82
sub-projects assessed in eight districts in four provinces). The average satisfaction rate varies
marginally from 79% in Xieng Khouang province to 81% in Savannakhet province but with
marked differences across the most popular sectors: electrification (95%), schools (83.5%-85%),
road access (82.3%) and bridges (81%). The benefits of the project also derive from the local
capacity building activities which aimed to support improved community engagement and
empowerment but are impossible to measure. Beneficiary feedback on the operational cycle and
participation opportunities, indicate very high levels of satisfaction with the approach and the
sense of ownership of assets (96%). Beneficiaries identified that the knowledge acquired through
the capacity building and implementation processes came at individual, household and
community levels, in particular an improved social capital in villages was reported in the end of
project beneficiary study. This study also indicated high levels of O&M participation for schools,
health dispensaries, water supply systems, community / market halls, weirs; 100% of
communities established committees and 63% collected maintenance funds and practiced
maintenance.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
The overall outcome rating of satisfactory reflects the strong alignment of the project with
government and Bank strategies and its continued relevance. PRF achieved very sound results in
delivering local services and infrastructure to poor and very poor villages in remote mountainous
regions of the Lao PDR, meeting the targets for improving services in priority poor areas. The
project had some success in enhancing community capacity and empowerment, though less
success in strengthening local government institutions. In delivering these results, the project was
relatively efficient – unit costs were low and economies of scale and duration kicked in after the
first few years, though the lack of accurate data makes comment on efficiencies quite general.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

       A. Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

Baseline data was not available at the beginning of the project, which has limited the ability of
the project to gauge the impacts of its interventions. Nevertheless, studies undertaken at
milestones throughout the project have highlighted the achievements and limitations of PRF in
respect to poverty impacts, gender and social development.

Poverty Impacts. While it is possible to document the physical accomplishments of the PRF,
and to expand on some of these to known outcomes, a number of parameters of the project were
critical: grants were provided for sub-projects in priority poor districts of the country; the focus
of grants met community needs (91%); and the eligible list of sub-projects and the sub-projects
selected focused on basic services: education, health, water supply and roads. The project did not
intend to cover all aspects of poverty reduction. By design, it predominately focused on
improving access to infrastructure services and facilities for poor rural communities. In terms of
process, the project initially struggled with measurement and definitions of poverty. Data
compiled by the National Statistics Center was found to be out-of-date and unreliable impeding
PRF poverty targeting up to cycle V.

Qualitative assessments suggest positive impacts as projects were selected to meet priority needs.
A qualitative assessment carried out in 2008 by a Bank team noted that stakeholders reported
positive impacts of improved infrastructure and facilities on communities in target villages – due
to improved road access, water supply, schools and health facilities though some regional
variation was noted. The final Technical, Utilization and Beneficiary Satisfaction Assessment
(2011) noted that water supply was considered the most relevant sub-project followed by
primary school, health center construction and weir construction.

Gender Aspects. Women’s voice and participation in Lao PDR continues to be limited by
traditional customs, particularly in minority ethnic groups in remote rural areas. The project
addressed gender concerns directly and indirectly. Given the increasing focus on non-Lao
speaking districts, and the poverty and gender marginalization in these areas, the poverty
targeting implicitly brought with it gender targeting. The project also aimed to make women full
participants in the planning, decision and implementation process of the PRF project; including
gender targets for PRF staff as district and khet facilitators, and khet representatives, gender-
aware processes to enable effective participation of women and the representation of their needs.

While the project made some progress in this area, the disempowerment of rural women in Lao
PDR, particularly those in remote areas, remains a constraint. Nevertheless, on those indicators
measured (i) attendance of women in PRF District Decision meetings – the target of 50% of the
community representatives was reached (31.6% of the participants in the meeting); and (ii) the
proposals coming from women’s lists?, the target of 50% was well surpassed at 91%. Gender
disaggregated data on district and kum ban facilitators and representatives is encouraging.
Counting attendance however often belies the quality of the participation taking place.
Qualitative assessments suggest that while women participated in meetings, and the needs/views
of women are reflected in the sub-project investments, their role in decision-making may be



                                                19
minimal in practice and empowerment of women does not appear to have been extended beyond
the boundaries of the project.

Social Development. Poverty, gender and ethnic minority groups are closely linked in Lao PDR.
The concerns of ethnic minorities were met by the project design through the demand-driven and
participatory processes that promoted inclusive local level decision-making. Direct measures to
involve ethnic monitories were difficult in practice, especially in the startup phase: the staff
hiring policy was thwarted by a lack of skilled kum ban facilitators, training of staff on ethnic
minority issues was not really launched and ethnic minorities were not always on an equal
playing field in the first years of the project. The M&E system was weak, including M&E of
ethnic minority data. However, over 33% of the sub projects reached ethnic minority
beneficiaries, often in extremely remote, previously inaccessible, villages.

As noted elsewhere, community participation was central to the project approach, reflected in
both the objective and the mechanism for planning and implementation. This approach exposed
beneficiaries and local government officials to a bottom up approach – in some cases for the first
time in Lao PDR. Procedures were developed and supported through district level facilitators and
the engagement of community representatives (at kum ban level) who took primary
responsibility for the management of sub-projects and “grass roots? financial management.
While capacity limitations were apparent and lessons were learned, the process was successfully
rolled out in an increasing number of provinces, with some significant regional adaptation. PRF
established, across seven provinces, a community-based model which showed all stakeholders
(beneficiaries, PRF staff and district line ministries officials) the benefits of community
engagement in local development decision-making.

The PSIA survey (Xiengkhor district, 2007) highlighted the importance of the PRF project as a
first attempt to work nationwide on a truly participatory basis, focus on the country’s priority
districts for poverty reduction, mobilize a high level of interest, awareness, commitment and
ownership among villagers, and demonstrate transparency and accountability. The assessment
raised questions as to whether the PRF was reaching the poorest areas within the poorer districts
at the time. These findings contributed to the refined poverty targeting adopted in 2009.

       B. Institutional Change/Strengthening

While the decision to establish a separate, multi-sector PIU clearly facilitated effective delivery
of grants, the question of whether institutions have been strengthened as a result remains open to
debate. Three key institutional outcomes are apparent at the various levels over which PRF has
had influence: (i) the PRF has resulted in a change in government’s policy and platform for
tackling poverty; (ii) the project has reached 21 local level institutions, bringing about a change
in the options available to them for implementing government projects and establishing a model
for multi-sector, needs-based approaches for replication; and (iii) state and non-state stakeholders
have learned the importance of communities as agents of development change. These three areas
of institutional change are related to the poverty reduction objectives, not capacity building
objectives. In order to broaden the institutional change process, the second phase of PRF II must
now ensure that these project achievements are internalized in country systems: broadening line
ministry experience and knowledge so as to better understand and contribute their offices to
reaching poor communities; achieving greater integration of PRF at the district level; and


                                                20
reaching out to new districts to link into initiatives that have focused efforts on the development
of local governance. It is perhaps in this last area of local governance where institutional change
will be most needed if decentralization policies are brought into force.

       C. Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

Perhaps the most significant positive unintended outcome was the use of the PRF as a disaster
response instrument. Following cyclone Ketsana in September 2009, the PRF was called upon to
support the rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure in a number of affected villages,
significantly expanding project activities through the Lao Upland Food Security Investment
Project (LUFSIP) and a grant from the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction supported by
AusAID. In addition, the World Bank, the SDC and the European Union (also through LUFSIP)
have increasingly drawn upon the PRF as a vehicle to support rural service delivery efforts.

                         4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
At the time of evaluation, the risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is
moderate. The decision to continue the PRF model under a PRF II project that engages both
development partners and government in co-financing, establishes a robust platform for
ownership, commitment and eventual sustainability. Financial flows are predictable and financial
management is sound, though there is a need to address procurement challenges. The project will
need to intensify its efforts towards handover and cross fertilization at local levels. Linked to
this, and a continuing technical risk, is the quality of some of the infrastructure constructed under
PRF – with both sustainability and ownership implications. While targeted communities have
engaged in participatory processes and some local capacity has been built, community
empowerment, which is essential for lasting engagement, and overall governance, particularly
accountability and transparency, require further strengthening. The political situation is unlikely
to change, and political capture of investments is likely to decrease given the revised targeting
and nature of PRF investments. In addition, the project has integrated several measures to enable
PRF II to mitigate against disaster risks.

                       5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

       A. Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall, the Bank adequately identified, facilitated preparation of, and appraised PRF in order to
achieve the PDO. Technical, financial and economic issues were duly considered. The overall
design was strategically relevant and remained so until completion; it drew on Bank experience
elsewhere but was nevertheless sensitive to the operating context in Lao PDR. In 2003, the
project was innovative, seeking to inculcate bottom up planning in a top-down centralized
environment. Key aspects of the project design included the flexibility in the types of sub-
projects eligible for finance (allowing the PRF to work across a large number of sectors) as well
as the pyramidal extension structures of a semi-autonomous agency put in place to reach the


                                                 21
poorest villages and minority ethnic groups in remote areas. The achievements in these areas
should be seen in the context of low capacity local staff located in remote districts, with difficult
access from provincial centers.

The PDO, however, was not well articulated (in three unequal objectives), and the design was
weak in key details. In particular, there was insufficient technical definition in participatory
planning, implementation and M&E. Similarly, the strategy for engaging and building capacity
of local level and line ministry stakeholders was inadequately defined and budgeted (although an
effort was made to address this at additional financing). Risks in both these areas were
underestimated. The results framework did not provide an effective basis for measurement and
monitoring of some outcomes; targets were not set for many indicators, and the reliance on
government data for initial poverty assessments affected poverty targeting. More thorough
identification of risks at appraisal would have resulted in better identification of problems in
implementation and more prompt responses, i.e., a practical and operational risk framework
could have been used as a management tool.

The QALP-2 assessment completed in 2010 concluded that the quality of design was moderately
satisfactory (3), but that the strategic relevance and approach was satisfactory (2), while the
realism of project design and risks was rated as moderately satisfactory (3). The moderate
shortcomings/weaknesses identified included the arrangements for M&E, institutional analysis,
the quality of the risk assessment, the ownership of line ministries as well as the effectiveness of
Bank management of preparation.

       B. Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Task team commitment to the project has been high throughout and has been commended by all
Government and Bank stakeholders. Task team leadership changed four times, with differing
styles and priorities but without significant problem. From the documentation, supervision in the
early years appears, however, to have been light. The frequency, intensity and technical
implementation support of missions -- less than twice a year from a headquarters-based team --
was insufficient for a project adopting a new untested approach and implementing hundreds of
sub-projects every year. Supervision missions did not consistently include the technical
(engineering) expertise needed for a project spending over 90% on construction of infrastructure
and facilities, and environmental safeguards expertise was not deployed consistently. The light
approach to reporting earlier in the project is also illustrated by the MTR (December 2005)
mission documents. The project experienced significant challenges in the early years, and would
have benefited from more candid and rigorous feedback and follow-up in the early years. Given
that sub-projects were completed on an annual cycle it is not clear why the project’s greatest
challenge in these first years (poverty targeting) was not addressed earlier.
The initial light approach to supervision changed with an evaluation at the end of cycle V (2007)
and a Bank-led qualitative assessment, as well as efforts to improve monitoring. At Additional
Financing (2008), the team introduced a number of modifications to address weaknesses
identified, in particular improving pro-poor project targeting, focusing the project on delivery of
public goods, and enhancing capacity building in government (although the latter was not
implemented effectively). In late 2009, task management of the PRF was transferred from the



                                                 22
EAP Human Development Department to the Social Development Unit of the EAP Sustainable
Development Department. Following this change, country office engagement improved, more
operational and technical expertise was brought to bear. Fiduciary supervision, both procurement
and financial management, seems to have received less attention than would be expected in a
project with so many annual transactions. Post reviews were conducted regularly, but there is
scant evidence of follow up.
The Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) ratings suggested that implementation
progress was satisfactory for the period 2002-2008, and that it declined in the latter stage (2009-
2011). The satisfactory ratings for implementation in the first stages of the projected are more
likely to have reflected an observation that the project was managing to implement a complex
project utilizing a new approach; and the later moderately satisfactory rating is indicative of the
fact that some basic problems with the quality of implementation and M&E had been identified.
In hindsight, with the exception of M&E, these ratings do not reflect the trajectory of
implementation performance, which seemed to improve over the eight years of the project as the
project staff became more familiar with the project objectives principles and fiduciary/safeguard
systems, and the pro-poor targets were met.
A rating of moderately unsatisfactory for quality of Bank supervision in the QALP-2 triggered a
further intensification of project supervision efforts. The new task task team refocused on
fiduciary and environmental safeguards, and further improved technical supervision. The Bank’s
team performed satisfactorily in terms of ensuring adequate transitional arrangements to PRF II.
A follow-on operation was established seamlessly, reflecting the lessons of PRF I, and with only
a minimal gap between closure the PRF project and effectiveness of the PRF II project.

       C.      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory: the project design was relevant to the
GoL development strategy, appropriate to the institutional context and complementary to the
Bank’s country portfolio, and remains so as PRF II proceeds. Some design details missing at the
outset were developed in the course of project implementation, Commitment to supporting the
implementation of an innovative project in a difficult context was high. Earlier periods of weaker
supervision and fairly low management attention were eventually addressed. In the later stages,
supervision was tighter, with improved country-based support. The transition to a new operation
was seamless. Overall, strong task team commitment was noted throughout and supervision
quality improved over the life of the project, though weaknesses in fiduciary and safeguards
supervision were noted.

5.2 Borrower Performance

       A. Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
The GoL located the PRF in the Office of the Prime Minister under the political leadership of the
Deputy Prime Minister, securing the political support necessary to achieve its objectives. An
intergovernmental committee – the National Leading Committee for Rural Development and
Poverty Eradication (NLCRDPE) – was established to provide strategic guidance, high-level


                                                23
coordination and oversight. This executive arrangement has protected the project, to the degree
possible, from the inevitable pressures exerted on a project cutting new ground and operating
across multiple sectors at the grass roots.

The Ministry of Finance was generally supportive and played an enabling role by providing the
Fund with the space to operate and, to some extent, agreeing to more flexible procedures to
reduce administrative procedures. Replenishments were timely. Various concerns arose over the
eight years of implementation when the Leading Committee did not seize its potential role in
fostering inter-ministerial cooperation, but the project nevertheless functioned effectively in
delivering infrastructure services to poor communities. Securing the cooperation of line
ministries is difficult in such contexts – efforts to draw in line agencies improved over the
duration of the project, with increasing cooperation from the Ministry of Education for instance,
but it continues to be an issue to be addressed in PRF II. The Governor’s offices of the provinces
where PRF operated, and crucially the District offices, were also collaborative for the most part.
Overall, government commitment is illustrated not only by the length of the project but by
Government’s decision to commit US$10 million to PRF II from the national budget, and its
efforts to ensure a smooth transition to and continuity of the successor project. A demonstrated
track record encouraged the SDC to contribute co-financing during the Additional Financing
phase of the project.

       B. Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The PRF implementing agency, operating under the leadership and management of an influential
executive director, was steadfastly committed to, and largely successful in meeting the service
delivery development objective of the project. The pyramidal structure of national, provincial
and district level units was varied in capacity but these institutional arrangements delivered
results on the ground, ensured high level commitment and attracted co-financing. The unit was
less effective in ensuring capacity-building at district and community levels.

   National Management Unit. After problems with turnover in the early stages of the project,
    the national level PIU reached a steady status. It was well staffed with committed, skilled
    professionals leading most sub-units, supporting the sub-national level as necessary to
    implement the sub-projects across the annual cycle and disbursing funds effectively. The
    technical quality of sub-projects has been adequate, with incremental improvements over the
    course of project implementation. FM has proceeded without cause for concern; record
    keeping is satisfactory. Procurement issues have arisen but have not adversely affected
    project outcomes or caused any concern for overall project governance. An effective
    complaints handling and feedback system was established only in the final year of the
    project. Monitoring was initially weak but improved over time. Capacity for evaluation
    remained weak throughout, which hampered the ability of the PIU to adapt to lessons learned
    in the course of project implementation. The PIU facilitated the smooth transition of the
    project to PRF II, and effectively assumed significant additional disaster response activities
    from 2009 onwards.

   Provincial and district capacity. Provincial level units suffered from capacity constraints
    particularly in their understanding of the project objectives (with variation between


                                               24
   provinces). The capacity of District level teams seems to have limited the development of the
   participatory approaches, although staff are generally committed, procedures are followed,
   and structures are robust. Sustained training of provincial and district-level staff was not
   accorded sufficient resources and attention. Some of the challenges of the project seem to
   have occurred at this level, especially in relation to project targeting, with some gaps in
   knowledge as to the pro-poor objectives of the project or otherwise some problems with local
   incentives and pressures. Linkages with line ministries appear to function adequately at lower
   levels.

       C. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The borrower’s performance has been sound overall, though a number of weaknesses have
affected the quality of project implementation. These include the variable understanding and
absorption of the principles of participation, limited coordination with some sector ministries,
inadequate investment in staff capacity-building, insufficient attention to complaints handling
and the moderately unsatisfactory M&E.

                                        6. Lessons Learned

Poverty targeting requires clearly defined frameworks and monitoring. The initial problems
and the time taken to identify and resolve the poverty targeting approach suggest that future
operations would benefit from clearer design targets, stronger indicators, improved assessment
and closer monitoring. In particular, the original design would have benefited from a framework
of parameters, accurate poverty assessment, clear and measurable indicators, and a process for
intensive monitoring and supervision to verify results in the first years. These process-related
actions should be linked to efforts to fully familiarize project staff with the poverty dimensions
of the project objective.

Aligning objectives with institutional arrangements. The decision to work in a parallel
structure which controlled the quality of staffing and ensured that systems and structures were
developed to deliver results on the ground possibly did so at the expense of institutionalization of
the processes and capacities in sub-national and line ministry structures. The lesson from the Lao
experience is that this trade off can be justified given the specific poverty reduction objectives,
the intention to reach villages in remote mountainous regions and the need to “protect? the
participatory and multi-sector demand-driven approach – all of which would likely have been
compromised if the project had been delivered through centralized, top-down line departments
without the experience, capacity for outreach or commitment to innovate. Aligning ambitious
poverty reduction objectives with reliable implementation arrangements was justified and
remains valid while similar conditions prevail. The vital institutional element was the positioning
of the Fund in the Prime Minister’s Office where it benefited from high-level championship and
received a level of leadership that would not have been possible if dispersed across line
ministries.

Coordination with projects supporting system development. As the project became
established and began to prove its effectiveness, there could have been more efforts to develop
synergies and cross-fertilization with those projects that were promoting organizational change


                                                25
and that focused on strengthening local governance systems. As PRF II moves forward, it would
be of mutual benefit for the PRF to forge closer links with projects that focus on the development
of local governance. PRF continues to deliver results at the grass roots in a participatory manner
and to build the capacity and ownership of district level officials in village level investments.
The efforts of projects implementing community and local development activities should be
learning platforms for the development of relevant capacity and governance in local level
structures, albeit in the context of only partial efforts toward decentralization.

Line ministry coordination and collaboration. Multi-sectoral needs-based approaches and
decentralized service delivery, present dual challenges to line ministries worldwide. The lesson
of Lao PDR is that, if coordination and collaboration are fostered with line ministry officials at
the local level, some of these barriers can be overcome. While this lesson may be most relevant
to remote local government agencies, developing “collaborative space? in local government is
achievable. Efforts can and should take place at different levels.

Community participation. While the project made every effort to implement a demand-driven
approach in a top-down centralized planning context by ensuring local community engagement
in the planning and decision-making process, the processes established did not always ensure
that the voice of the poorest in villages was carried through the kum ban to the final decision
making arena (the district) and did not always result in a more empowered community, more
able to voice needs. Improvements in the knowledge and facilitation skills of the PRF district
staff and community facilitators, and the awareness of the capacity of the communities
themselves, are vital. A number of design attributes affected qualitative engagement of
communities. These include: (i) measures of participation should be qualitative as well as
quantitative and should be assessed regularly; (ii) longer planning cycles ensure commitment and
durability of the process, (iii) the importance of the project to community interface, and the need
for sustained investment in the development of capacity at the community and local government
interfaces.

Project governance. The project design and implementation preceded the recent review of CDD
projects in the Bank which raised a number of issues concerning the governance of these
projects. Notwithstanding the implicit focus on community participation in planning,
implementation and financial management, as well as the Bank’s fiduciary controls, other
governance-related activities in PRF I were limited. As the project continues to expand, it will be
vital that efforts are made to coordinate a broader set of activities that focus on strengthening
project governance, including: (i) a focus on project transparency and access to information at
both the national and community levels; and (ii) attention to conflict of interest issues. The
“accountability meeting? which promotes reporting by the kum ban representatives and is a
forum for transparency and social audit, could form a key element of an expanded local
transparency and accountability framework.

Enhanced evaluation. More rigorous qualitative analysis and experimental fieldwork, especially
in relation to voice and engagement, and capacity building should be conducted as the project
proceeds, with far increased budgets and efforts to appoint skilled consultants that have a track
record elsewhere. As the project moves forward, the evaluation capacity in the PIU should be
strengthened. Bank execution of some of key evaluations should be considered. Funds should be
allocated for more comprehensive and reliable reporting, and international experience engaged to

improve quality, build capacity, and enhance utilization of data to inform timely learning and
adaptive management.

            a. Overview of Sub-projects Implemented

Sector focus. Component 1 financed 3,179 sub-projects totaling $30.96 million in 28 poor districts in 7
provinces and included 616 schools, 86 bridges, 65 health dispensaries, 669 clean water systems and 156
irrigation schemes; over 3,000 km of rural roads were upgraded. By the closing date, 56% of the budgets
supported social services (34% education, 22% health while 33% was spent on roads, bridges, and 4% on
irrigation). The focus was almost entirely (93%) on construction with training accounting for 7% and
costs for non-construction, non-training expenditure representing only 2.9% of the budget. The variation

Provincial coverage. Sub-projects were implemented in 28 districts located in 7 provinces. The phasing
over the life of the project (see Table 2.3) has resulted in some variation in the levels of support. The
number of sub-projects implemented by province varied from 1,225 in Huaphanh (cycle I with five first
priority districts) to 83 in Sekong (cycle VIII).

Beneficiaries. The 3,179 projects reached about 1,500 villages. Although it is difficult to estimate the
population that benefited from these projects directly and indirectly, the total population of villages
influenced by the project reached 650,000 in cycle VI. Direct beneficiaries (defined as villagers where the
sub-project was implemented/built) started with 150,280 in cycle I, and peaked in cycle IV with 413,905.
Of these, the average percentage of ethnic minority beneficiaries was 35.6% and direct ethnic minority
beneficiaries constituted 15.9%.

Poverty targeting. With regards to the poverty focus of PRF activity, the poverty targeting of the sub-
projects increased over the duration of the project – from 32% in the poorest categories (PG0-2) of
villages in the first 5 years to 70% in the final year (see table 2.4c). In cycle I-V, the % of sub-projects
and/or budgets spent in category PG0-2 villages was 53%, by cycle VIII this had increased to 70%.

               b. Quality of infrastructure
Quality of constructed infrastructure has been the subject of some concern especially in the latter years of
the project when monitoring improved and sustainability was questioned more. Utilization data collected
in 2010 shows average utilization of 96% overall. The lowest utilization occurs in drilled and dug wells
(78%), irrigation (78%) and bridge construction (85%), with the highest rates for schools (99.7%). Roads
are used irrespective of their condition however (and beneficiary satisfaction is a better indicator of this).
See table 2.8. The project has had a significant number of problems with wells (nearly one quarter of the
sample are not used), a number being damaged by flooding during the Ketsana cyclone in September
2009 (i.e. Savannakhet, Attapeu, Saravanh, and Sekong provinces). The lowest levels of utilization
occurred in Saravanh province where 18% of the sub-projects built were not utilized, compared with only
1-2% in Xiengkhouang and Huaphanh, largely due to the effects of cyclone Ketsana.

Technical assessment. The final PRF technical assessment undertaken in 2010-11, indicated that, of a
sample of 80 projects of various types, 50% of irrigation systems and wells were of unacceptable quality,
and that 33% of roads were of poor quality. (of 12 rural roads assessed, 5 are not passable during the
raining season). Quality for health, schools and water supply was found to be better, but around 20% of
these sub-projects were considered to be of poor quality. Electricity systems, community halls and bridges
were all good quality.

While later projects are built to a higher standard, technical assessment of PRF roads noted a number of
causes of poor quality construction:
     a lack of standard designs for rural road construction
     different sizes for culverts and bridges
     incomplete surfacing and compaction
     thickness of earth cover
     the earth near road site.

Improvements in technical quality have been made since 2007. In cycles I and II, district and provincial
PRF offices were responsible for designing sub-projects. In cycle III, the PRF developed standard
designs. In cycle IV, communities recruited supervisors, selected by PRF, to follow-up on technical
aspects of infrastructure with background in civil engineering and provided training. Each community
supervisor followed in average three sub-projects that he/she regularly inspected, to advise the kum ban
team on implementation process and issues to address. PRF technical advisors certified the progress or the
completion of the sub-projects into the field inspection forms and at the kum ban accountability meetings.
From cycle VI to cycle VIII, the survey design process was conducted with the systematic participation of
the local authorities and concerned line ministry officials at district level. Inspection is now staged and
linked to payments.

Nevertheless, PRF faced constraints in terms of quality control that are inherent in the CDD approach. A
large proportion of the infrastructure is built by communities (on a community force account) resulting in
occasional weaknesses in respect to PRF technical guidelines and standard designs. Moreover the PRF
menu of options allows a large scope of projects and requires a high level of expertise in different fields.
The decision to empower communities through the PRF process, the coverage and the remoteness all
make it difficult to ensure a proper quality control. This difficulty has been addressed to some extent in
PRF II design by adding a step in the PRF cycle to clarify and formalize responsibilities and assign

specific tasks to key stakeholders from District Government, private sector (contractors) and kum ban
Authorities involved in the sub-project implementation and supervision. The PRF second phase will also
mainstream disaster risk management practices and encourage spot improvement approaches for roads
sub-projects.

Operations and Maintenance. The project recognized the importance of line ministry ownership of PRF
financed infrastructure and set a target of 80% of PRF village infrastructure being recognized by line
ministries. By the end of the project 100% of PRF village infrastructure had been recorded in the official
ministry books. The project also intended to promote and monitor the number of target beneficiaries with
maintenance plans and prioritized the establishment of community operations and maintenance
committees in each province. The utilization study noted that of the 1,051 sample, 95% had established
committees, 3.4% were in progress and only 1.8% had no O&M plan.

             c. Community Contributions

Community contributions to PRF sub-projects have been monitored throughout the project. At appraisal it
was agreed that communities should contribute more than 10% of the cost of the sub-projects, in more
than 70% of the villages. This target was consistently surpassed (annual average 17.5%). However a
significant variation was seen between the original phase of the program (Cycle I-V) and the additional
financing phase (Cycle VI-VIII) as the PIU sought to reduce community contributions that came in the
form of wood (in order to reduce the potential impact of the sub-projects on deforestation). By sector, by
far the greatest contributions were made for roads and irrigation. Contributions were provided by
communities in kind, especially in the form of labor, or by providing transport for construction materials.
Many communities also voluntarily contributed small amounts of land to widen roads, construct irrigation
canals etc.

            d. Employment generation

The project provided significant support to communities that were mobilized to carry out the works
themselves. Of the overall expenditures on sub-projects from cycle I to Cycle VIII, 68% (2,168 projects)
were carried out by communities under a community force account arrangement (valued at
US$15,720,338), and 32% (1,011 were carried out by a contractor). The project does not have data on the
number of labor days this amounts to or the number of days / estimated wages paid to villagers to provide
labor to contractors.

Component 2: Local Capacity Building (US$5.50 million IDA)

Component 2 supported local capacity building in three primary areas: capacity building of the provincial
technical support team, capacity building of district facilitators and capacity building of community level
(khet / kum ban) facilitators. At additional financing, it was recognized that capacity development was
lagging and additional funds of US$0.49 million were allocated to local capacity building (under a new
component 2b). Indicators were clarified and component 2 was aligned with PDO parts (b) and (c).

To empower villages in poor districts to manage their own public investment, planning and sub-project
implementation in a decentralized and transparent manner, capacity building activities were undertaken in
three primary areas:
     manage public investment planning and implementation.
     provide technical consulting advice, and
     training to strengthen local capacities, and form a Provincial Technical Support Team, who will
         in turn provide technical engineering, and financial management assistance at the Poverty
         Reduction Fund ' s provincial level.

A total of 681 community facilitators (227 female) were recruited as PRF staff to mobilize commune
members, and to work with communities to ensure and enhance participation. This was conducted
through 3 phases:
     preparation (socialization) including village meetings; village needs and priority assessments,
        kum ban socialization meetings, district socialization meetings and provincial workshops.
     planning including village meetings, kum ban decision meeting, district decision meetings for the
        prioritization of sub-projects, preparation of design and budgets, procurement methods, kum ban
        sub-project design and budget meeting, and district decision meeting to finalize funding
        commitments.
     implementation including information meetings, mobilization of labor, training on construction,
        release funds, construction, certification of progress, cross kum ban assessment and monitoring,
        kum ban handover meeting, accountability meeting, operation and maintenance.

                    a. Community capacity building and empowerment

Capacity building. The purpose of the community capacity building was to ensure that the participatory
processes envisaged for planning and implementation of sub-projects were put in place. Capacity building
was achieved through training of kum ban facilitators, implementing team, procurement teams and kum
ban representatives.

Outcomes. Outcomes were measured by the number of sub-project proposals submitted by
communities and subsequently approved, reaching a high of 93% by the end of the project, well
over the target of 50% set down at additional financing.

Women’s’ participation. A target of 50% was also set for the number of sub-projects that met women’s
needs. Sub-projects in the last three cycles, the period during which this data was measured, reached
about 90% as indicated by the number of sub-projects selected from as priorities on women’s lists. The
building block approach which allowed women to participate in separate groups than men at the village
level was seen as being particularly effective, enabling more articulation of their household needs
(education, water supply) and less for large infrastructure projects. However while the PRF mobilized
women for project ends, very few have opted for a more public role in kum bans or districts after the
cycle was completed. A field visit conducted for the ICR noted that women’s participation in joint village
meetings was weak.

Ethnic Minority participation. The PRF also intended to ensure its activities effectively reached ethnic
minorities. Through its Ethnic Group Policy Framework (EGPF) PRF aimed to provide guidance for
addressing ethnic group needs and aspirations in line with the World Bank’s safeguard policies. Survey
(CBA) results suggest that close to 90 percent of ethnic groups saw that their needs were taken into
account. This is supported by the efforts made by the project to ensure language was not a barrier to
ethnic minority participation and benefit. Most facilitators could speak Non-Lao Tai languages.

                      b. Capacity Building for Local Institutions

An evaluation conducted in 2008 noted that not all officials recognize the benefits of the participatory
approach, and that longer term engagement would be vital to build that commitment over time. The same
study noted that the need to better coordinate CDD mechanisms in Lao PDR, overlapping and leaving
gaps in coverage. At additional financing, PRF designed a new capacity building component aimed at
contributing to the government’s objective to better harmonize and coordinate ministries and other GoL
organizations involved in poverty reduction and to ensure the long term sustainability of PRF funded
infrastructure. This sub-component intended to advocate the use of participatory planning to strengthen
the capacity of line ministries to engage communities in the planning process. The objective was also to
exchange with local institutions and to receive their feedback on the PRF work and approach in order to
improve PRF processes, procedures and manuals. It also aims at enhancing the coordination between
local institutions to contribute to efficient and sustainable management of local development. The
capacity building study conducted in 2011 assessed the efficacy of this capacity building, the awareness
and understanding of PRF approaches, and the levels of communication and coordination.

Training provided. The training courses within the PRF Local Institution Capacity Building component
generally included trainings to improve understanding of the principles and approaches of PRF,
implementation, O&M and participation. Details of the trainings provided are set out in Table 2.12.

Assessment of capacity building. The capacity building assessment generally found the training
activities to be considered by participants as good in quality, with the training events on participation and
on the principles of PRF particularly appreciated. Key findings of the study were:
         Kum ban representatives and district officials show a better (‘good’) understanding of the PRF
          approach having acquired knowledge on (i) the benefits of participatory approaches in responding
          to the needs of villagers, and (ii) the need to create capacity of communities to enable local
          people to get actively involved in their own development.
         In districts where PRF is operating a high number of district officials have been targeted for
          virtually all of the capacity building efforts. Many of the local government staff has participated
          in training on PRF principles, while others were recruited as trainers or resource persons for
          technical training on the implementation, operation and maintenance.
         A high percentage of kum ban staff members have participated in some kind training event, with
          up to 100 percent participation in specific technical training for specified target groups.
         Both groups indicated a high level of contentment (more than 90 percent) with training events in
          terms of their timely announcement and the preparation of trainers, though some trainees would
          have preferred to see more time for discussions and a better documentation of training materials.
         Similar to the results from an assessment of training, interviewees, through a ranking exercise,
          indicated that other capacity building measures, such as workshops, meetings, field visits, written
          guidelines measures and IEC tools – with the notable exception of study tours - achieved their
          goals to a high degree.

Feedback and conflict resolution: PRF put in place a Feedback and Conflict Resolution Mechanism
(FCRM) to receive feedback and to address emerging issues. FCRM Committees were composed of PRF
and government staff members operating on village, kum ban, district and provincial levels. In general,
the FCRM is perceived by committee members and communities in positive terms as a mechanism that
allows villagers to express their opinions confidentially, to ask for help to solve problems or conflicts.
Nevertheless, the numbers of complaints were low – over 8 years, only 32 relevant complaints were
received concerning in 32 sub-projects / 29 villages. An enhanced FCRM was piloted in two districts in
2011 in order to inform PRF II, and had made encouraging progress by the end of the project.
Outcome of capacity building. An outcome indicator for capacity building identified at additional
financing was the participation of local government officials in PRF District Decision Meetings. Table
2.14 illustrates the very solid attendance of Government officials (non PRF project staff) at the key
meetings where sub-projects are selected. No per diems were paid for attendance in these meetings.

   Component 3: National Project Management (US$5.88 million IDA; US$6.67 million cost)

   The funds allocated to component 3 for national level project management were utilized for
   administrative, monitoring, reporting and operational costs of the PRF at the central level, including
   necessary technical assistance and training in specialized areas of expertise. An initial allocation of about
   US$2.19 million was increased to US$7.05 million at Additional Financing. US$178,500 operating costs
   were covered by GoL from the period 2003-2010. Overall, 290 consultants were hired on a competitive
   basis in the Finance, Community Development, Engineering and M&E units of the PRF office, including
   Directors and advisory positions.

Annex 3.           Economic and Financial Analysis

Due to the needs based approach to sub-project selection, project appraisal documents did not provide an
estimated EIRR. There is also no accurate information on poverty reduction in the districts where PRF is
operating and where there are data, issues regarding the attribution of the cost-benefits make a calculation
of an EIRR challenging. In other countries that have measured the benefits of CDD projects and social
funds, favorable economic rates of return for individual sub-projects have been illustrated.5 PRF shares
the features of these projects, namely (i) support from local community facilitators to mobilize
communities and ensure technical quality; (ii) decentralized decision-making to more accurately match
resources to needs/preferences; (iii) utilizing local contractors and labor. Utilizing the sector internal rate
of return figures developed for the Vietnam Community-Based Rural Investment Project, but taking into
account the various proportions of education, roads/bridges, agriculture infrastructure and health/ water
supply that were constructed in PRF (see table 2.1) results in an EIRR calculation of 21%.

The following analysis better illustrates the cost effectiveness, efficiency and the general cost benefits of
the project through value for money investment in improving infrastructure and facilities, adopting needs-
based participatory approaches and building capacity.

Administrative costs. At appraisal, the GoL established a requirement that the ratio of administrative6
costs to total costs would not exceed a ceiling of 25%. While this was not regularly monitored, the overall
ratio of operational costs appears to be in the region of 15% (based on the assumption that national project
management costs are all administrative and sub-national costs all focused on capacity building).
Unsurprisingly for a CDD project launched in 3 provinces, some in remote rural areas, the up-front costs
were high, reaching 60% in the first year, and 35% in the second year as the project was established. The
ratio declined to around 10% was sub-project implementation began in earnest and reached a steady ratio
at about 8-10% until more provinces were introduced (adding establishment costs) and categorization
changed (when local facilitation was included in the national operating costs). If training and facilitation
costs from Component 2 are included as overheads for capital investments (i.e.
empowerment/participation is not considered an outcome of PRF but a cost of delivering infrastructure),
then the administrative cost overall is estimated at 27%.

Unit costs. Cost effectiveness indicators for the project were checked a number of times throughout the
project. In order to contain the very high unit costs of construction that had been found in Lao PDR before
appraisal, efforts were made to ensure cost effectiveness and acceptable/satisfactory economic returns by
checking against average unit cost rates across various categories of infrastructure. Table 3.2 provides a
comparative assessment of the unit costs of PRF and Government/other roads, irrigation systems, schools,
water systems and dispensary/health clinics and illustrates that, across that range, and despite the
differentiated cost structures in the north and south of Lao, costs were between 35% and 88% lower in
PRF financed projects. Unit rates were kept down because of the in-kind support of communities and the
oversight of rates by the national project management team.

Notwithstanding the benefits of community participation in the construction phase of village development
and the successes of PRF in this regard there is – typically in CDD projects – a technical quality trade-off
as semi-skilled labor and lesser quality materials are used. PRF is no exception. Table 3.3 provides a
snapshot of this trade off. It should be noted that technical quality however is not only due to the
community role in the construction process; a commonly occurring problem is the non-availability of
acceptable quality gravel and sand.

Beneficiary Satisfaction. The Beneficiary Assessment (2011), carried out in conjunction with technical
utilization, indicated a village satisfaction rate of 81% for the 82 sub-projects assessed in 8 districts in 4
provinces. The average satisfaction rate varies marginally from 79% in Xieng Khouang Province to 81%
in Savannakhet Province but with marked differences across sectors. The highest satisfaction rates are in
electrification (95%), schools (83.5%-85%) and in road access (82.3%) and bridges (81%). The lowest
satisfaction rates are in community hall (60%) and market halls (65%). The latter were built early in the
project and removed from the eligible list when efforts were made to improve poverty targeting and
reflected a degree of local capture at district level that reduced cost benefit in some specific provinces in
their first cycles. The breakdown of the satisfaction rates by provinces and type of sub-projects is shown
in table 3.4.

The non-cash benefits accruing to PRF sub-projects are similar to those in poverty reduction projects
elsewhere. For improved water supply, beneficiaries noted the time savings in collecting water; for roads
– the time and cost savings due to quicker, more immediate access including being able to transport
produce/non-forest timber products to markets, and getting children to schools located in district centers;
for irrigation – increases in incomes due to increased productivity and savings from damage due to

flooding. PRF is notable in its wide spread of sub-project types (e.g. not all the funds was spent on rural
roads) and the level of achievement in remote areas. In cycle VII, 22%, and cycle VIII, 16%, of sub-
projects were built in locations where there was no road access prior to the project.

In those cases where communities elected to carry out the works themselves, PRF provided economic
benefit not just in terms of the resulting infrastructure but because the income received by community
members for work carried out, did not leave the village but could be utilized by village households. In
those projects carried out by contractors, this benefit was less marked, but in many cases contractors still
employed local community members to provide labor, thereby generating employment for short periods
in sometimes remote villages.

Empowerment benefits. The benefits of the project also derive from the local capacity building activities
which aimed to support improved community engagement and empowerment. Beneficiary feedback on
the operational cycle and participation opportunities, indicate very high levels of satisfaction with the
approach and the sense of ownership of assets (96%). Beneficiaries identified that the knowledge
acquired through the capacity building and implementation processes came at individual, household and
community levels. Benefits in relation to the community, noted the impact on social capital in the
communities – the sense of community, the shared understanding of needs and the new ability of
communities to work together and use representatives on their behalf. At the household level, the
beneficiaries highlighted their increased ability to act as a member of development activities, their
increased trust and confidence and at the individual level they noted their increased knowledge in
identifying and prioritizing needs. Feedback, however, also highlighted their continued lack of knowledge
in negotiation.

Measures of ownership and sustainability. The project identified at an early stage the need to put in
place vehicles to ensure ownership for post-project sustainability to maintain benefits and the record of
maintenance committees and funds are notably high. The technical utilization beneficiary survey
indicated high levels of O&M participation for schools, health dispensaries, water supply systems,
community / market halls, weirs (100% committees established) and 63% of sub-projects will have
collected maintenance funds and practiced maintenance 3 years after completion. Other studies have
noted the drop off in operation and maintenance due to damage past repair (post-Ketsana), the low
standards of construction, the burden of maintenance on communities, particularly roads, and the severe
lack of resources for maintenance. Nevertheless, the project displays high levels of ownership of assets by
communities – inevitably linked to the high levels of community contribution, and the potential for
regular O&M regimes when institutionalized mechanisms of support can be established under PRF II.

Comments Received from the Project Implementation Unit of the Poverty Reduction Fund

In 1996, the sixth Congress of the Party set the objective to free the Lao PDR from the status of least-
developed country by 2020, especially in eradicating mass poverty by 2010. As rural poverty in the Lao
PDR is directly linked to access to resources, social services and livelihood opportunities, the
Government’s rural development strategy has thus two major components: improving access to essential
factors of development, and a comprehensive, poverty-focused planning process at the district level to
ensure that all initiatives are mutually self-supporting and complementary.

In 2002, the Government of Lao PDR invited the World Bank to support its efforts to deliver
development resources at the village level, targeted to the poorest districts in the country and mediated
through strong participatory processes and decentralized decision making. To this end, the Poverty
Reduction Fund was legally established by a Decree of the Prime Minister of Lao PDR (No. 073 / PM) on
31 May 2002 as an autonomous entity, overseen by a Board of Directors, and attached to and chaired by
the Committee for Planning and Investment (it moved in 2006 to the Prime Minister’s Office). The PRF
was given the authority to set its own personnel recruitment, procurement, and remuneration standards to
help it attain its objectives.

The PRF operational scope and design drew from best practices from a variety of World Bank funded
social fund and community driven development projects under implementation at the time in East Asia,
and adapted to fit with the distinct conditions of Lao PDR (based on the experience of the Committee for
Planning and Cooperation). Therefore, the PRF’s mission is to support and establish local capacity,
procedures and systems in line with the Government of Lao PDR’s decentralization policy, to efficiently
and effectively channel and utilize various funding resources including loans, government and other
donor’s funds, to reduce the poverty of rural communities. This was done through a program of highly
participative, multi-sectoral, accountable grant-based, village-managed activities such as small-scale
infrastructure projects, life skills development and income generation that enable rural poor and ethnic
minorities to benefit from the country’s move towards improving socio-economic conditions for all
citizens.

After 8 years of implementation, the PRF program has actively participated in the implementation of the
National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) and the National Socio-Economic
Development Plans (NSEDP). The PRF program has proven its capacity to effectively and efficiently
deliver resources to poor villages in remote areas by using the bottom up approach for the identification
and planning of priorities by the communities, the management of funds at the village level, as well as the
implementation of the sub-projects by allowing beneficiaries to choose whether they will implement the
project themselves or contract the implementation to a contractor.

On average, around 400 sub-projects were delivered on a yearly basis, with a strong focus towards
women’s priorities (80% of the sub-project selected), and benefiting the poorest and small ethnic groups
(for more than 1/3 of the total number of beneficiaries), with a level of community satisfaction reaching
80% in average. The bottom-up approach leads to a great level of ownership and sustainability. More than
2/3 of the sub-projects were implemented by using the community force account method, 96% of the sub-
projects are still utilized at the end of the PRF additional phase, and 2/3 of the sub-projects have a
maintenance fund in place and an Operation and Maintenance team operational. The high level of
commitment and ownership of the communities are also expressed through the level of community
contribution (16%), and contribute to the efficiency of sub-projects costs (between 35% and 88% in




                                                    49
comparison with other projects with similar focus in Lao PDR), and counterbalance the program’s
relatively high operating costs.

These excellent results were achieved thanks to the continuous support and advice of the Government of
Lao PDR through the PRF Board as well as the donors, who worked in a cooperative manner to ensure
that the PRF met its intended objectives and to improve aspects of the program’s overall performance as
necessary in the course of implementation. For instance, during the additional financing period (2008-
2011), the Program reinforced its strong focus towards delivering support to the poorest; improving
coordination with line ministries and understanding on the participatory planning approach, as well as
reinforcing the quality and sustainability of the sub-projects, based on the lessons learned from 2003 –
2007.

To ensure that disbursement did not lead PRF to wastage, leakage or fraud, intensive mechanisms for
social and financial control were instituted in accordance with World Bank guidelines. This was
reinforced by PRF local staff clearance, with villagers as signatories, of all sub-project disbursements on
the basis of confirmed physical progress. The participatory process decision making was therefore subject
to a strong set of controls over disbursements to minimize risks. In other words, the transparency and
accountability of the PRF were subject to strict procedures, leading to no significant fiduciary issues.
Nevertheless, in terms of procurement, minor procedural non-compliance were found repeatedly in a
number of the contracts reviewed by the World Bank. These issues are mainly the consequences of the
low level of literacy in some of the areas covered by the PRF, the difficulties of supervising a large
number of sub-projects implemented on yearly basis (and nationwide), the remoteness of some sites and
the difficulty of finding contractors to take on construction contracts in some remote areas. Therefore,
there is a need to further simplify financial management and procurement procedures to improve
community and contractors understanding and compliance, and also to strengthen the capacity at the
community level through proper training and use of IEC tools.

Despite the PRF impact on reducing Poverty is broadly recognized, the MIS was originally designed in-
house and was found inefficient to accurately report on the PRF outcomes, despite the improvements
made during the course of the project to mitigate this issue. The indicators were also not always reflecting
PRF targeted achievements and therefore were revised and more “outcome-focused? during the PRF
additional phase. Weaknesses were also found in the capacity of the PRF staff to properly analyze the
data collected, thus limiting its value as a management tool. Therefore specific attention will be paid
during the second phase of the PRF to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation and reporting towards the
PDO and agreed key performance indicators.

The program aimed to create stronger links between the local government and the aspirations of villagers
with project staff at district, province and national levels coordinating and building linkages.
Nevertheless, the PRF legal autonomy, the improved capacity of the PRF staff to deliver without need for
outsource, the limited budget available to support coordination and capacity building of the local
institutions and the communities may have been factors that have limited the implementation of this
aspect of the PRF. Nevertheless, the data collected show that the benefits of the participatory planning
process was step by step understood and integrated by the local authorities as the percentage of priorities
selected by the communities and changed at upper level (kum ban and district level) was greatly reduced
over time (30% in the original phase against 12% in the additional financing phase). This important
aspect of the program will continue to be a strengthened during the second phase of the PRF.

The other constraints that have affected the overall results of the program were associated with the high
PRF staff turnover at the beginning of the program implementation, difficult access to bank facilities for
the remotest communities, low capacity of some communities to manage their own sub-projects
especially in term of procurement and ensuring quality of infrastructures quality, remoteness that leads to



                                                    50
difficulties in accessing sub-projects sites and that contributed to some sub-projects exceeding budget
ceilings, lack of skilled local contractors, complex processes and procedures (i.e. procurement and
safeguards), limited capacities of some PRF consultants and concerned sector technical staff, lack of
coordination and collaboration with line ministries, lack of relevant sector infrastructure standards in key
sectors (e.g. roads), and weaknesses in the Feedback and Resolution mechanism. Many of these issues
have been solved during the first phase of the Project, and the remaining issues have been adequately
taken into account in the design of the second phase.

Due to the intended strategy of the PRF to give priority to the diffusion of the community based model on
the wide scale versus concentration of its efforts in a limited number of provinces and districts, only a 7%
of the total number of priorities identified by the communities in target districts were addressed per year.
This situation may have led to frustration and planning fatigue at the village, kum ban and district level.
This issue has also been well addressed in the design of the second phase of the PRF. Finally, there is a
need for the PRF to further improve its coordination and collaboration with other donors and agencies in
order to complement or supplement PRF support and vice versa. The PRF has made a promising start in
this regard during the second phase of the PRF with the diversification of its activities (including disaster
recovery), the formalization of Memoranda of Understanding with key sector partners, and the further
diversification of financing.

Based on its impressive record of rapid disbursement, large coverage, rapid delivery of services across a
range of sectors and focus on small rural infrastructures, the project has itself become a channel for other
funding sources focusing on improved access to water sources (SDC additional fund for water related
infrastructures), food security in rural areas (LUFSIP sub-component 3a) and post-disaster response
activities (LUFSIP sub-component 3b and a grant from the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction).
On this last point, the PRF has experienced the effects of natural disasters caused by cyclone Ketsana,
with some of its infrastructures being impacted. Therefore, as part of the second phase, the PRF has
strengthened its overall Disaster Risk Management and Response capabilities to ensure disaster-resistant
technology is integrated into standard infrastructure design and delivery.

The access to more funding sources from different donors during the Cycle VIII gave the opportunity for
the PRF to experience both scaling up of its coverage, diversification of its activities and the need for a
stronger management of its funding sources and monitoring of its activities in a short period of time. The
difficulties encountered in managing a budget that double its financial resources allocated to sub-grants in
comparison with the other cycles highlighted some of the challenges meet by the PRF and lessons learned
also feed the design of the PRF II, in its way to become a Government National program.

The performance rating by the implementation, completion and results report related to the assessment of
outcomes, assessment of Risk to Development Outcome, and the assessment of Bank and Borrower
Performance are properly justified and therefore gives a realistic and fair reflection of the strengths and
weaknesses faced by the PRF in the light of the overall socio-economic and institutional context the PRF
had started and evolved all along these 8 years of implementation.

Annex 8.        Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments Received from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation

As a co-financing partner since 2008, SDC appreciates the open-minded analysis of the project made in
the ICR. The report indeed captures well the significant results achieved by the Project, but is also critical
on its shortcomings.

SDC agrees with the overall conclusion that PRF has succeeded in achieving objective 1 (poverty
reduction), but less successful regarding objective 2 “local capacity building?; and objective 3 “local
institutions strengthening?. SDC therefore shares the assessment that the project performance has been
only “Moderately Satisfactory?, even if on the ground, the Project has significantly contributed to the
improvement of the living conditions of a very high number of poor villagers.

The conclusions on institutional change/strengthening, as well as the lessons learnt (esp. re coordination
with projects supporting system development) are very pertinent. SDC shares the analysis made in the
report that as the project moves forward, the issue of institutional sustainability will gain importance and
should be addressed with due attention.

In this regard, SDC agrees with the analysis that the i) integration into local (sub-national) set-up; ii)
linkage with other local government capacity development initiatives; and iii) cross-sectoral coordination
between line agencies; are key elements that will need to be considered with particular attention in the
implementation of PRF II to ensure that the project is well anchored into government system.

SDC is aware of the complexity of monitoring and evaluation of project such as the PRF. SDC recognizes
the weaknesses of the M&E system described in the report, but is confident that these have been
addressed in the PRF II design.

SDC considers that the rating of the Government performance is quite high, given the somewhat limited
operational support received by the project during its implementation, and the difficulties faced by the
NLCRDPE in its coordinating role. SDC however fully acknowledges and values the strong support that
PRF has received at the highest policy level.

Finally, while the issue of resettlement is addressed in the report, there is no conclusion on the role of the
PRF in this regards. An assessment of how PRF is indeed an instrument contributing to avoid resettlement
by providing services to remotest areas would have added to the analysis.

In conclusion the report confirms SDC’s own assessment that PRF is an instrument well-suited to the Lao
context, which provides new avenues to improve local service delivery and more inclusive citizens’
participation in public decisions. The report will constitute an important element for improving the future
performance of PRF.
