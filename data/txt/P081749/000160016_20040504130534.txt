Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP SSSRI
Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Project Background
The proposed Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge (the Project) is one of the rural road
upgrading components in the Shiyan to Manchuanguan (Shiman) expressway. The HPCD
includes this component in the Shiman project with the consideration of the maximizing the
benefits of the expressway to the local areas as well as the priority roads in the Shiyan's
2003-2005 road network plan. The rural road upgrading in the Shiman project will be
implemented in phases. Hanjiang River Bridge(this project) is one project of the first phase.
The proposed Hanjiang Bridge is located within Shiyan Area, northwest of Hubei Province.
This area is bordered by Qinling Mountain and Daba Mountain, with Hanjiang River through
the area dividing it into south and north parts which are locally called "Jiangnan" or south of
the water and "Jiangbei" or north of the water, respectively. The lack of transportation
infrastructure has been a critical constraint to the economic development of this region. Until
now, all of the counties under the jurisdiction of Shiyan City have been listed as national-level
poverty areas. Hanjiang River is 252 km long within Shiyan City, but only 3 bridges across
the water body two of which are on the 240 km water body upstream of Danjiangkou dam.
One is within Chengguan Town of Yun County, which is 100 km down stream of the proposed
Project. The other is a suspended bridge 30 m upstream of the proposed bridge. This
suspended bridge was constructed by the army as a stop-gap bridge which is formed by iron
suspended and wooden plates. The suspended bridge is too weak to sustain large vehicles.
However this suspended bridge is the only one in the west region of Shiyan over Hanjiang
River. Worse, it also connects the important road G316 and YunYang Road in Jiangnan and
Jiangbei, respectively. Due to safety considerations, the suspended bridge was repaired and
strengthened in 2002, extending its service life by another 2.5 years. It is estimated this
bridge will become obsolete by 2004. At that time, there will be only one bridge on Hanjiang
River within Shiyan to connect the Jiangnan and Jiangbei areas. The people should take up
to 300 km detour to access this bridge. It is apparent that a new bridge is urgently needed,
but should be close to the existing suspended bridge, to link the Jiangnan and Jiangbei.
Hubei Provincial Communication Department (HPDC) has included this proposed bridge into
its road network development planning. Map 1 shows the location of the proposed bridge.
With considerations of poverty alleviation in rural area, HPCD has applied for a loan from the
World Bank to partially finance the rural road upgrading works. Hubei Provincial
Transportation Planning and Design Institute was contracted to carry out the feasibility study
for the proposed works in Nov. 2002, which was completed in Aug. 2003. The Preliminary
Design Document has been finished in Nov. 2003 by HBCPDI.
1.2 Progress of EA

disputed areas as defined in OP7.60, natural habitats and pest management, policies related
to these subjects are not applied in the EA. In addition, the World Bank Financed Project
Office of HPCD has contracted another institute to carry out the social assessment, and a
resettlement team has been established and will be responsible for the Resettlement Action
Plan, with the major findings and conclusions to be included in this EA. Therefore the
following policies are applied in this EA:
* Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP4.01);

Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP SSSRI
In March 2003, Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute (SSSRI) was retained by the
HPCD to undertake Environmental Assessment (EA) for this project. An EA team was formed
immediately and conducted two rounds of preliminary site investigation along the proposed
project alignment, initial data collection and the various forms of consultation with the
affected public, organizations and local governments during March-April 2003. An
environmental baseline monitoring program was then initiated to cover the project area. On
the basis of the site investigation, information collection and analysis and baseline monitoring,
potential impacts of the project were identified, screened, and assessed. Relevant
environmental mitigation measures, corresponding costs, and environmental management
plan were then proposed following additional public consultation and disclosure of project
information to the public. Draft EA document is prepared in May 2003. As there are some
change in the feasibility study for the proposed works, so a revised draft EA document is
prepared in Sept. 2003. In October, 2003, a World Bank mission conducted an appraisal of
the project. According to the Aide Memoir and comments received during the appraisal, the
EA team revised this environmental impact assessment report and environmental
management plan. In March 2004, a World Bank mission officially appraised the Shiman
expressway project including the rural road components. Following comments received from
the appraisal, the EA team revised the environmental impact assessment report and
environmental management plan. In late March 2004.
1.3 Purpose of EA
The EA predicts various environmental and socio-economic impacts of the Project, and
analyzes the impacts quantitatively or qualitatively through investigation or monitoring of the
physical, biological, and socio-economic environment, and through public consultation along
the project area. More specifically, the purposes of the EA are:
* To improve the decision-making process by introducing environmental criteria and
assessment to design engineers and decision makers and to ensure the Project is
environmentally sound and sustainable;
* To ensure adverse environmental impacts be identified and evaluated in the earlier stage
of the Project development so as to develop appropriate measures including alternative
alignments and designs to avoid, mitigate, reduce or otherwise minimize the adverse
impacts to acceptable levels;
* To develop measures of compensation for the impacts which could not be avoided or
mitigated; and;
* To provide a basis for Project executing agency and relevant government agencies to
develop and implement plans for environmental management and monitoring.
1.4 Basis of Assessment
1.4.1 World Bank Requirements
The World Bank requirements include primarily the Bank's ten safeguards policies, including
Operational Policies (OP), Best Procedure (BP), Good Practice (GP) and Operational

1.8 Environment Protection Targets
Based on detailed and thorough site reconnaissance and the information collected from
relevant local agencies, the EA team has determined that within the project area there is no
natural reserve, significant scenic and cultural sites. The major environment protection
targets and sensitive settings within the area are the water body where the proposed bridge
will cross and the village adjacent to the bridge - Jiangjunhe Village. Following sections
present the details on these targets.
1.8.1 Surface Water Environment
The proposed Project will cross Hanjiang
River, the significant water source for the
national South-North Water Diversion
Project. The major water environment
protection target is therefore the Hanjiang
River, which is presented in Table 1-8-1 .and
photograph in the right.

1.8.2 Acoustic Environment and Ambient Air
As the Project will pass through a rolling
mountain area where the roadside
villages are scarce. There is only one
village adjacent to the proposed bridge.
Therefore there is only one protection
target or sensitive receptor identified for
acoustic environment and ambient air,
which is presented in Table 1-8-2 and        _________M___      ._ __

1.8.3 Ecological and Social Environment
The access roads leading to G316 road and Yunyang Road will be constructed by cutting the
hill, therefore a small extent of ecological impact will result. Based on the site survey and
investigation during this EA, the major ecological and social protection targets are
summarized in Table 1-8-3.

Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
Chapter 2     Overview of the Project
2.1 Geographical Location
The proposed bridge is located within Shiyan City, northwest of Hubei Province. The project
area is an inter-provincial joint area of Hubei, Henan and Shaanxi provinces. It is bordered by
Xiangfan city of Hubei Province to the east, Ankang Region of Shaanxi Province to the west,
Shennongjia Region and Chongqing City to the south and by Shangluo Region of Shanxi
Province and Nanyang City of Henan Province to the north. The proposed bridge will cross
Hanjiang River, upstream of Jiangjun River. The proposed bridge will be 50 m downstream of
the existing suspended bridge (this proposed bridge will replace the suspended bridge once
built). The proposed bridge will connect with Yunyang Road to the north, with G316 road to
the south. The bridge is located 110059'E and 32033'N. Map 2 shows its geological location.
2.2 Current Conditions of the Suspended Bridge
The existing suspended bridge was designed and           _ 
constructed by No. 7434 Plant of People's Liberation
Army (PLA) in July 1990. The span of the bridge is 342
m, and the width is 4.1+2X0.75 m. The bridge is for
military purpose and not registered in the Hubei Road
system. However it is an important element in the
provincial road network. The designed load of the
bridge is Class 15 trucks and Class 18 trailers. The
bridge has 14 main cables and 36 beams, with an
one-way lane for motorized vehicle and two for
pedestrians. In March 2002, HPDC contracted a - -;
special institute to inspect the bridge since the service  -
life was about to be over. By investigation, the institute
found major safety flaws in the bridge, and
recommended an overhaul. At the end of 2002, the
Transportation Bureau of Yunxi County repaired and
strengthened the bridge but the service life of the
bridge could only been extended for another 2.5 years.
Currently, the speed and load limit is strictly controlled,
with the maximum speed of 10 km/h, maximum load of
150 KN and one way traffic. During rush hours, the waiting vehicles on both ends are lined
up causing congestion. Although the bridge can merely meet the current need as traffic flow
is relatively low, it won't be able to meet the rapidly growing traffic in this part of the provincial
transportation network in the near future. The need for a new bridge to replace the
suspended bridge is urgent. The photos show the suspended bridge. Currently, the
transportation Bureau of Yunxi County has set up a management and toll station with 38 staff.
The No. 2 Traffic Police Station of Yunxi County has also set up a management at the bridge
ends to check load of vehicle and dangerous materials.

Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
2.3 Function of the Proposed Road
Shiyan City relies on the multiple modes of transportation, including road and railway which
are dominent, and water navigation, with rather complete transportation network in Shiyan.
Xiang-Yu Railway is the major railway crossing the city while the water carriage service is
largely concentrated on Hanjiang River and Du River. The road network in the form of a
"three horizontal and three vertical line" road grid has been established including trunk roads,
national and provincial roads, and rural roads connecting counties and villages. Map 2 shows
the position of the project as well as the regional network. The first "horizontal line' refers to
the Danyun Road, Yunman Road and Shanghu Road, which connect the Xiangfan City, the
Jiangbei area of Danjiangkou City, Jiangbei area of Yun County and Yun County before
entering into Shaanxi Province. The second "horizontal line" refers to the new G316 road,
which connects Xiangfan City, Jiangnan area of Danjiangkou City, Shiyan City and the
Jiangnan area of Yun County, before entering Baihe County of Shanxi Province. The third
"horizontal line" refers to the S305 road, which connects Xiangfan City, Fan County,
Zhuanshan County and Zhuxi County, before entering Shanxi Province. The first "vertical
line" refers to the road line connecting Yunxi County, Baihe County, Zhushan County, Zhuxi
County and Chongqing City. The second "vertical line" refers to the road line connecting
Yuxi-Yangwei  road,  the  Hanjiang  Suspended  Bridge,  Baoxia-Zhushan  road,
Zhushan-Xiangba road and Chongqing Road. The third "vertical line" refers to the G209 road,
which pass through Jiangbei of Yun County, the Hanjiang Bridge in Yun County, Shiyan City
and Fang County before entering the Shennongjia area.
Although this suspended bridge is not a conventional road bridge, it plays a pivotal role in the
provincial transportation network in Shiyan City. It provides a short-cut route for the western
counties of Shiyan City to cross Hanjiang River. However, as described above this bridge will
be closed by the end of 2004 when its service life ends and safety concerns. At that time
there will be only one bridge over Hanjiang River within Shiyan City. As a result, the vertical
road line in the west region of Shiyan will be disconnected at the river. Therefore the
proposed bridge to replace the suspended bridge will be a significant element to ensure the
function and intactness of the regional transportation network.
2.4 Magnitude of the Proposed Work
The total span of the proposed Hanjiang Bridge is 350 m. When including the access road,
the total length of the access road will be 696 m.
According the preliminary design, the proposed bridge will join G316 (at Yun county side) and
Yunyang road (at Yunxi county side) at the same grade. As Yunyang road elevation is higher
than G316 by about 10 m, it is planned to build a 636 m long and 8.5 m wide approaching
road at the Yun county side to connect G316. The connection road starts at the Jiangjunhe
river bank and ends at about 200 m from the existing bridge on G316 with an alignment
roughly perpendicular to the bridge. On the Yunxi county side, the bridge will connect directly
to Yunyang road with a connection road of about 60 m long and 12 m wide.

2.5  Major Technical Specifications
Based on the function and the existing capacity of the connecting road, the proposed bridge will
be constructed as Class II Standard for road bridge. The major technical specifications of the
proposed bridge are presented in Table 2-5-1.

2.6  Traffic Volume Projection
Based on the natural and induced annual growth, the traffic volume projections for 2007,
2010 and 2020 are presented in Table 2-6-1. According to a site investigation, a small
number of local residents at both sides of the river have regular needs to cross the river. It is
expected that when this project is in operation, the pedestrian traffic on the bridge will be less
than 300 person-times per day. For this traffic volume, the current design of 1.5 m pedestrian
lanes on both sides of the bridge shall be sufficient and can satisfy the cross-river needs by
the local residents.

2.7 Borrowing and Deposit Balance
The project is located at the foot of a mountain where it connects with Yunyang road and
G316. As such, the earth work is limited. On the Yun county side, there will be some
excavation for road base which will generate 25,800 m3 excessive earth requiring disposal.
At the same time, on the Yunxi county side, there will be a demand of 26,600 m3 filling
materials. It has been planned to ship the excessive earth materials from Yun county to
Yunxi county side by barge. With this plan, earth materials are expected be mostly balanced
and thus there will be no need for dedicated excessive soil disposal site in this project.
2.8 Sources and Transportation of Construction Materials
As the project is located in a mountainous region, most of the construction materials could be
supplied locally. Except No.45 cement, which need to be shipped in from outside, sand,
stone, gravel, and steel can be found from Shiyan city. There are multiple suppliers with the
city for each of these materials which can totally satisfy the project needs.
The construction materials are to be shipped in to the construction site via local roads from
both ends of bridge sites, i.e., Yunyang road and G316, respectively. Both roads are well
connected with the regional road network with good transportation conditions.
It is very convenient to ship the excessive earth materials from Yun county to Yunxi county
side by barge.
2.9 Bridge auxiliary facilities
According to project design, a toll station will be set up at the bridge for toll collection,
maintenance and administration of the bridge during the operation. As the existing toll station
for the Hanjiang river suspension bridge is close to the proposed new bridge (see Map 3 for
exact location) and the suspension bridge will be phased out following the new bridge
operation, this toll station will be moved to use for the new bridge and the existing staff at the
current toll station will also be retained for the new bridge operation.
At present, No.2 Team of Yunxin Traffic Police Brigade runs an inspection station at the west
side of the suspension bridge for over-loading and hazardous materials inspection. This
inspection station is located about 60 m from the proposed bridge (see Map 3) and will
continue its operation for the new bridge.

2.10 Cost Estimate and Financing Plan
The total capital cost is estimated about RMB 38.00 million. Part of the cost will be funded
by a World Bank loan, with the balance to be covered by Central, Hubei Provincial and local
governments.
2.11 Implementation Plan
The Project construction is scheduled to commence in the Jul. of 2004 and complete in
December 2006 with a total construction period of 2.5 years.
2.12 Analysis of Alternatives
The design team has proposed alternatives on the location and structural type of the
proposed bridge. Following is the brief discussion and comparison about the alternatives.
Alternative on bridge location
Four alternative sites for the bridge have been proposed and they are:
* Alternative 1: 500 m from the river mouth of Jiangjun River, 100 m downstream of the
existing suspended bridge, 442 m span;
*  Alternative 2: 840 m from the river mouth of Jiangjun River, 200 m upstream of the
existing suspended bridge, 390 m span.
*  Alternative 3: 600 m from the river mouth of Jiangjun River, the location of the existing
suspended bridge, 370 m span;
*  Alternative 4: 550 m from the river mouth of Jiangjun River, 50 m upstream of the
existing suspended bridge, 350 m span.
In comparison, the geological conditions at all those four locations are suitable for bridge
construction. But Alternative 1 is rather long of the bridge. Alternative 2 needs to make a 90
m long and 30 m high hill cut, to connect with Yunyang Road, resulting in a high potential of
soil erosion and interruption to the current traffic. In addition, under Alternative 2, a large
amount of house demolition would be needed and the alignment is 70 m away from the
Xiangyu railway. Alternative 3 needs to pull down the suspended bridge and the current traffic
need to be connected by ferry service. Alternative 3 will bring a rather serious impact on the
current traffic and people's daily life. In contrast, Alternative 4 is on an open and flat area
without any need for hill cutting and is the shortest among these alternatives. Therefore,
Alternative 4 is recommended as it has the least environmental impacts.
Alternative on structural tvpe of bridge
There are three types of bridge selected for comparison and they are:
13



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP SSSRI
*   Alternative 1: the arrangement of span is 60+3 X 100+60,  a pre-stress reinforced
concrete bridge
*   Alternative 2: the arrangement of span is 61+110+110+61, a pre-stress reinforced
continuous ridge frame concrete bridge
* Alternative 3: the arrangement of span is 3 X 40+50+80+50+3 X 40, a pre-stress
reinforced concrete bridge;
In comparison, with regard to technical and cost considerations, the design team
recommends the Alternative 2. With environmental considerations, the EA team reckons that
the three types of bridge all meet the requirement for flood discharge and navigation
requirements therefore with similar magnitude of environment impacts. Therefore the
consequential assessment will be focused on the recommended alternative.
2.13 Potential Impact by Raised Dam Hanjiang River on the proposed project
As the head water source for the national South-North Water Diversion Project, Danjiangkou
Reservoir's dam will be raised by 13 m under the second-phase Water Conservancy Work.
This work will begin at the end of 2003 and complete by 2008. At that time, the water level at
the normal storage will be 170 m. Furthermore, the local government has planed to built a
water power plant (Gushan water power plant ) in Hanjiang River 8 km downstream of
proposed bridge. According to technical information, after the dam work and power plant be
finished, the flooded area will extend to the Lijiapeng of Yunxi County, 0.5 km downstream of
the proposed bridge. And the water level will be 181 m.
The design team has already taken into full account of the potential impact by the raised dam
of Danjiangkou Reservoir and Gushan water power plant. Based on elevation calculation for
the Yunyang Road and G316 Road to the both sides of the proposed road, the current
elevations are higher than the raised water level. The Jianjunhe Hanjiang river bridge is
designed for the 100 year flood. As Hanjiang river is a planned Class IV navigation water way, it
requires 8 m clearance. The design bridge height is higher than 194.48 m, meeting the navigation
clearance requirements as well as the 100 year flood elevation. Based on the above analysis, the
water level rises due to the Hanjiang river dam downstream and Gushan hydro power stations will
not affect the project. Furthermore, as the bridge is designed for the 100 year floods, the impact
from flood is minimal.

which arises from south Qinling Mountain of Shaanxi Province, and flows through Shaanxi
and Hubei Province from west to east, before joining the Yangtze River at Longwangmiao at
Hankou of Wuhan City. The total length of mainstream Hanjiang River is 1577 km with a total
catachment of 159,000 km2, about 8.8% of the total of Yangtze River.
The area hydrology is characterized by the historical average flow of 23.1 billion m3 and
average flow rate of 732 m3/s. The maximum water level is 184.54 m and the minimum level
is 171.82 m. The average level is 173.37 m.

North to Hanjiang River is Qinling Mountains, and south is Wudang Mountains. There are no
embankments on both sides of the river. The maximum width of the river surface is 410 m,
and minimum, 150 m.
The navigation channel in the area is controlled by the narrow water surface at the bridge
site and navigation service only can be sustained in the high flow season. According to the
river navigation planning, the navigation scale at present is Class VI on this section with 90%
pass rate and the future navigation scale will be improved to Class IV on this section.
3.2 Social Environment
The proposed project is located at the joint area of Yunxi County and Yun County, both of
which are under the jurisdiction of Shiyan City. By this proposed project, Yangwei Town in
Yunxi County will be connected with Hujiaying Town in Yun County. Shiyan City, Yun County
and Yunxi County are clearly the direct impacted area.
Shiyan City is in the northwest of Hubei Province, bordered by Xiangfan City to the east, by
Ankang Region of Shaanxi Province to the west, by Shennongjia and Chongqing City to the
south, and by Nanyang Region of Henan Province and Shangluo Region of Shaanxi
Province to the north. Under its jurisdiction, there are 5 counties, 1 county-level city and two
urban districts. The area of the city is 23,700 kM2, 12.7% of the provincial total. Except the
urban area of Shiyan which is well developed on automobile industry, all counties which are
centered on agricultural production fall into the national-level poverty standards.
Geographically impeded by Qin-Ba Mountains, economic development is very slow due to
poor transportation conditions.
Yunxi County is at the northwest of Shiyan City, bordered by Qinling Mountains to the north
and by Hanjiang River to the south. It is a national -level poverty county. The land area of the
county is 3509.6 kM2, 97.3% of which is dominated by hills and mountain range, leaving only
287 km2 cultivated land, equivalent to 0.86 mu/capita. Till 2002, the total population of the
county was 502,000, with 418,300 of them as agricultural production. The annual net income
per capita of agricultural population is RMB1,401.
Yun County is situated at the middle part of Shiyan City. It is the joint area of Hubei Province,
Shaanxi Province and Henan Province. It is the national-level poverty county. The total area
of the county is 3863 kM2, equivalent to 5,794,550 mu. The mountain, cultivated land, water
surface, road and village accounts for the total area of 81.2%, 10.3%, 4% and 4.4%
respectively. There is a total of 596,833.5 mu of cultivated land, equivalent to about 1 mu per
capita. Under the jurisdiction of the county, there are 12 towns and 14 town-level villages. Till
the end of 2001, the total population of the county was 591,000, with 470,500 agricultural
residents, accounting for 79.6% of the total. It is therefore obvious that the economy of the
county is centered on agricultural production.

3.3 Eco-environment
Vegetation Cover
The vegetation species are abundant in the project area. massion pine trees are dominated
in the area. The forest coverage rate is 45.65% in the whole Shiyan city, 35.87% in Yun
county and 28.98% in Yunxi County, respectively, below the city-wide average.
On the side of Yunxi County, the rivebank is characterized with steep cliffs and well covered
with underbrush and grass. On the side of Yun County, The riverbank is characterized with
flat alluvial plain which is cultivated by local people. Within the project area, no virgin forest is
found.
Wild Animals
This project area has been significantly developed with a long history of human activities.
The existing Yunyang Road and G316 Road were built many years ago. A large number of
residents have been attracted to the roadside area, resulting in a severe damage of the
ecosystem necessary to support large wild animals. According to information from forest
authorities of both Yun county and Yunxi county who have the jurisdiction on wildlife
protection, only small mammals, such as deer, hog badger, and fox as well as birds are
spotted in the mountainous areas, distant from the Project site.
Acquatic life
According to the collected information from relevant local authorities, the aquatic life in
Hanjiang river are main fishes The fish species are carps and other commonly found species
with no protected or otherwise endangered species.
Status of Soil Erosion
According to the Soil Conservation Planning for Hubei Province, the Project area is
designated as a key area for soil erosion monitoring. Severe soil erosion, primarily non-point
erosion, often occurs in this region. According to the local forestry department, the soil
erosion degree at the site of the proposed bridge is medium, with the erosion mode being
3000Vtkm2.a.
3.4 Natural Resource
Tourism Resource
According to a site survey during this EA, no significant scenery is found within the directly
impacted project area.
Mineral Resources
According to a site survey during this EA, no significant mineral source is observed at the site
of the proposed bridge.
Cultural Propertv
17



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
According to the confirmation from the local cultural bureau and EA team site investigation
and observations, no above ground cultural property is found within the project site and no
record of underground archaeological finds are in the inventory lists of local cultural
authorities for the area.
3.5 Baseline of Environment Quality
In order to understand the baseline environmental status in the project area, the EA team has
collected information from relevant government agencies and carried out an environmental
monitoring program for noise, water and air quality. Map 3 presents the locations of the
monitoring points covered in the EA.
3.5.1 Acoustic Environment Status and Assessment
According to the site investigation, the EA team reckons that the current acoustic quality at
the project site is mainly impacted by the traffic noise of the current suspended bridge and
the impact is rather light because of the low traffic flow in general. However, areas near the
access road to the bridge are affected by the traffic on Yunyang Road and G316 Road.
Since there is only one sensitive receptor within the project area, Jiangjunhe village, the
Environment Monitoring center of Yunxi County has been contracted to monitor the noise
level on the village. The monitoring program lasted for one day, and one measurement was
taken at day and night each. Monitoring points have been placed at the location 1 m in front
of the sensitive receptors facing the proposed road. Table 3-5-1 presents the monitoring
results.
Table 3-5-1 Monitoring result of acoustic environment

It can be seen that, the noise level in daytime and night time is 61 and 51 dB respectively,
slightly exceeding Class II standard, but meet Class IlIl standards. The noise level is
expected to rise when the project is completed since more traffic flow will be attracted to the
area.
3.5.2 Surface Water Environment and Assessment
3.5.2.1 Drinking Water Intakes in Project Area
Hanjiang River is the sta;rting point and source for the national South to North Water
Diversion Project. During the site investigation of this EA, the EA team paid an attention to
the potential impact to the water quality of the downstream water from the project site and
18



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
area 50 km downstream from the project site have been investigated for any water intakes.
The site investigation showed that there is no water intake within the surveyed area except a
discarded intake for a copper mine which had been closed. Further downstream, the intake
for Chenguan Town Water Supply Plant of Yun county is 70 km downstream of the project
site, and domestic water intakes for Danjiangkou City and Hanjiang Group Industry are 200
km downstream of the site. It is reckoned that these intakes would not be affected by the
project.
3.5.2.2 Water Environment Status and Assessment
In order to understand the baseline status of surface water quality, the EA team has visited
local EPBs. Historical monitoring records confirmed that the surface water quality in Hanjiang
River can basically meet Class II standards.
In addition, the Environment Monitoring Center of Yunxi County has been contracted by the
EA team to carry out a water quality monitoring program and the monitoring location was on
the proposed bridge site. The monitoring program lasted for 2 days. The results are shown in
Table 3-5-2 below.

Chapter 4 Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures
The proposed Hanjiang Bridge Project will cause potential adverse impacts on the
surrounding natural, ecological and social environments during both the construction and
operation phases. As there is no significant natural habitat, scenery, forestland or cultural
property within the assessment area, EA team identified that the potential impact is limited to
the water quality of Hanjiang River, the soil erosion caused by hill cutting and Jiangjunhe
Village which is the only sensitive receptor to Project activities, based on a safeguard
screening. Following the impact assessment, specific mitigation measures have been
developed to minimize these impacts.
4.1 Impact on Surface Water Environment and Mitigation Measures
The water pollution sources in the construction phase are expected to be domestic
wastewater from the construction camp and the waste (machine oil, construction debris,
sediment, etc.) dropped to the river and in-water construction during construction of the new
bridge. In the operation phase, the major water pollution sources are surface run-off from the
road surface and the accidental spills of hazardous materials occurring on the bridge. This
section provides detailed analysis of these impacts and proposed mitigation measures.
4.1.1 Construction phase
Domestic wastewater and solid waste
The new bridge will cross the Hanjiang River, at the location 50 m downstream from the
existing suspended bridge, and two construction camps will be set up at the south and north
side of the river. If not carefully selected, such as too close to the river or other areas
vulnerable to quick surface runoff, and there is no any wastewater treatment, the camps will
result in certain impacts to water quality of the river from their discharges. It is expected that
each of the camps will have about 50 workers, and as such the total wastewater generated
from the two camps will be 2.5 m3/day based on the unit rate of 50 I/capita/day. Because the
construction period of the bridge will last for 3 years, the total domestic waste will be a large
amount.
Material Stockpile
There will be a large amount of materials stockpiled near the construction site. Without
efficient and effective measures against strong wind and surface runoff, the materials can be
released to the river either directly (airborne and then precipitate) and/or through surface
runoff. The oil dripping from construction equipment will also cause water pollution in the
river.
Barge Shippinq of Excessive Earth
The barge shipping of excessive earth from Yun county to Yunxi county side may generate
some impacts to water quality if soil spilled during shipping. The impact would be primarily
21



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP SSSRI
increased suspended solids in the river.
Construction of the New Bridge
According to the engineering design, the main span of the reinforced concrete piers is 110 m
and the total length is 350 m. The arrangement of span is 61+110+110+61m. The pier is 1.2
m thick.
The bridge construction will take 3 years to complete. The piers will be constructed using the
cofferdam method, which will firstly piled with steel pipes, then with steel sleeves to the
designed height before casting concrete into the drilling holes. The water remained in the
dammed space will be pumped out to the river for final concrete casting to build supporting
cap. The dams will be removed after the piers are built.
From the above process, it is clear that the major pollutants are most likely to be oil and
suspended solid, as analyzed as follows:
*   Suspended solids will be generated primarily from piling, erection and dismantling of the
cofferdam which disturb the sediment in the river bottom, as well as materials
transported to and used in the construction site such as mixed cement. The disturbance
to the sediment is expected to be limited to 100 m from the pier location as the river
bottom is well compacted. The materials dripping is also limited to the area immediately
adjacent to the site and expected to be a small amount. Both sources of suspended
solids are expected to affect a small area of water body, approximately less than 100 m
from the pier sites. The impacted water may not be suitable water consumption or
aquatic life and will be visually unpleasant. There is no water intake within a 20 km area
from the bridge, however.
*   The piling and drilling for piers will also generate a large amount of spoiled materials
which if dumped to the river will cause rising suspended solids in the water. This spoiled
materials will however be transported to the land for disposal according to the
engineering plan;
*   Pier construction machines, particularly boat-based machines, may leaks and machine
maintenance may also cause oil dripping. Such leaks and dripping could cause oil
pollution of the river. The impacted time, unless suspended solids which can easily
participate, may last relatively long period of time.
*   As the Hanjiang River is also a water navigation channel, the bridge construction will
have a certain effect to the water transportation traffic, including water traffic accidents.
Should such accidents involve oil spills or leaks, major pollution events may occur.
Mitigation Measures during Construction
Mitigation measures to be taken during bridge construction are to:
* Enhance construction management, especially orderly, well organized and scheduled
construction activities;
Monitor the water quality closely at areas near the bridge, to detect any abnormal or
pollution promptly so that appropriate mitigation and, if necessary, remediation measures
22



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
may be taken.
*   Locate the construction camps far from the river and all of the domestic wastewater from
the camps will be treated by septic tanks. Solid waste from the camps will be disposed at
designated sites.
*   Locate material stockpiles far away from surface water bodies and the area subject to
heavy surface run-off. The powder materials will be bagged and/or covered. Interception
ditches will be built around the stockpile site to catch the surface runoff and direct it to
appropriate discharge locations.
*   Earth work shipping across the river will have high enough free board to prevent it from
dropping to the river during shipping. The loading and unloading will also be conducted
following the pre-designed procedures to prevent spills, and earth will be compacted well
in the barges.
*   Provide steel net at the pier construction location to prevent the construction solid
waste from dropping to the river. Outside the cofferdams there will be filter cloths to further
intercept sediment from the construction areas. Disposal of sediment to the river will be
strictly banned. Instead, the sediment will be removed to the bank for proper land disposal.
The solid waste will be used as the materials for road construction wherever possible;
otherwise it will be disposed in the small disposal areas designated for this Project.
*   Well manage equipment maintenance and operation to prevent spills and oil dripping.
*   During the in-water construction, the contractor will be requested to contact the water
navigation authority to properly arrange and schedule the construction activities. As the
project area has a certain amount of the navigation activities during the high water seasons
but none during the dry season, the in-water construction will be arranged to the extent
possible during the dry season to minimize the potential impact to navigation. In addition, the
contractors will ensure that appropriate lighting and warning signs will be provided to alert
the water traffic. When necessary, the contractor will invite the navigation authority staff to
the site to guide the in-water traffic.
4.1.2 Impact in the operation phase and mitigation measures
The major pollution during operation phase to water environment would stem from two
sources: one is waste accumulated on the road surface from the motor vehicle exhaust
emission, tire wore out, waste dropped from vehicles and other waste materials which could
be washed to the receiving water bodies along with surface runoff. The other is accidental
pollution such as hazardous material spills and leakage resulting from traffic accidents
involving tanker trucks near the river.
Road Surface Run-off
The accumulated pollutants on road surface, debris of abraded tiers, soil attached on vehicle
body, oils dripped from passing vehicles and spills of various materials would all be
discharged into water bodies by surface run-off. Clearly the major pollutants are oil, organic
matter and particulate matter. These pollutants will contaminate water in the river. According
to the monitoring results for road surface run-off from other road projects, the load of oil and
SS will be the highest during the first 30 minutes of a rainfall. Then the pollutant
loads/concentrations in surface run-off will gradually reduce and remain stable after 40-60
23



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
minutes of the rainfall as the road surface is cleaned by the continuous rainfall. At this time,
the average concentrations of SS, BOD and oil are expected to be 100 mg/I, 5.08 mg/I and
11.25 mg/I, respectively.
Based on the previous experience on similar road projects, in the operation period the road
surface runoff will have limited impacts to the river, since the catchment area of the bridge is
only 5000 M2. Minor increment of some pollution parameters are expected with the run-off
being discharged into the river, however by the assimilation of the river, the impact will be
small, typically without changing the water quality classification. However in order to deal
with accidental pollution events, preventive measures are necessary especially considering
the sensitive nature of the Hanjiang River..
Accidental Events
As the critical transportation corridor for Shiyan City to cross Hanjiang River. According the
traffic volume projection, there will be 1292 MTV/d traffic on the bridge at the early operation
period. The goods or material flow on the existing suspended bridge include coal, minerals,
chemical fertilizer, oil, pesticide and sand. When the new bridge is built, and the suspended
bridge will be out of service and the current goods flow will be shifted to the new bridge. At
that time, the proposed bridge will carry some amount of oil and pesticide. Although there is
no water intake around the proposed bridge, in view of its strategic position in water supply
both to the national water diversion project and the local water purification plants downstream,
any accidental events will cause severe impact on drinking water source. In addition, as a
Class VI navigation channel, once ship crash occurs, leakage of material from the crashed
ship would pollute the water in Hanjiang River.
Probability analysis method is commonly used in China to estimate the likelihood of such
accidental events. In general, such accidents are very rare, about once in a couple of ten
years, according to the past traffic accidents records. Although the probability of leakage of
dangerous material for this proposed bridge is very low, about 0.030/a. the consequence is
severe and could even be catastrophic if a major accident occurs on the bridge. Effective
mitigation measures, such as strengthened management, intensified traffic signal and good
maintenance of road, should be taken to decrease the probability.
There is a certain level of risk of water traffic accidents. The environmental consequences will
be severe should a barge involved in the accidents contain hazardous materials. It is
therefore essential to enhance management during the operation phase while emergency
plan needs to be prepared and implemented to minimize such risks.
Water Pollution Mitigation Measures
*   In order to prevent trucks involved in a traffic accident over the bridge from falling directly
into the Hanjiang river, the bridge will include a special design to reinforce its guardrails.
Such a design is so strong that it will prevent vehicles from falling even driving directly
toward the guardrails. In addition, at the both ends of the bridge will include accident
prevention designs.
*   The bridge will have sufficient and appropriate lighting. In addition, warning signs for
24



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP SSSRI
safety as well as speed limits will be erected on the both ends of the bridge.
A complete drain collection and diversion system (totally 176 diverged drains has been
designed) will be designed and installed on the bridge to collect surface runoff from the
bridge. The system will also include holding tanks off the bridge to receive the surface
runoff, which will have a certain settling, oil/water separation and holding capacities, with
a total volume of 10 m3 each. At the normal time, it would help hold and provide a certain
level of treatment for storm surface runoff while during an accidents resulting in spills and
leaks, the tanks will serve as holding tanks to intercept and hold spilled hazardous
materials and prevent them from discharged into the Hanjiang river.
* A management station, with the joint toll service and full-time staff, will be set up to
manage and take emergency plan. Suggest use the management station of the
suspended bridge.
* Besides crashing prevention design of the piers themselves to be included with
consultation with the experts in the field, guiding lights and warning signs will be designed
to minimize the risk of barges crashing to the piers. Neon lights will be installed on the
piers above the highest water table, to ensure safe navigation under the bridge even
under fogging weather. The piers will be coated with flexible materials such as thick
rubber, etc. to help absorb the impacts in an event of a crash and minimize the risk of
damage to the barge, as well as piers.
Emergency Plan
An emergency plan will be established including the duties and responsibilities of the leading
group and associated departments, the emergency technology, process, equipment and
staffing, monitoring system and reporting system.
Establishing emergency leading group and designating emergency leadership
The Traffic Bureaus of Yunxi and Yun Counties will coordinate the various governmental
agencies, such as local EPBs, water supply company, public security bureaus, fire
department, environmental monitoring center and navigation authority. Staff from the above
departments will form a leading group for the emergency plan and one person will be
designated as emergency leader. The emergency center will be set in the bridge administration
station, with hotline being manned by full-time staff around the clock. If an accident occurs, the
leader of the group will be immediately informed, and the remaining procedures in the
emergency plan will then be kick-in.
Yunxin county communication bureau will be responsible for daily maintenance, toll collection and
administration of the bridge once it is completed. The bureau will utilize the staff working on the
Hanjiang river suspension bridge and utilize the same toll and administration facilities currently in
service for the suspension bridge for the new bridge. At the same time, the traffic inspection
station by the traffic police, which is located near the suspension bridge will also be reserved and
used as the inspection station for the new bridge. The bridge administration station is therefore an
ideal selection for setting up the emergency response facility. Under the normal operation
conditions, the bridge administration station will have staff on duty 24 hours a day. These staff,
following proper training, will possess ability for preliminary responses of accidents and other
emergency events, responding first time of the accidents and taking appropriate emergency
measures. The police station at the bridge site will continue to be responsible for inspection of
25



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
trucks with hazardous materials in their payloads. The inspections will include three certificates, in
accordance with the Guidelines for Chemical Hazardous Materials Transportation Administration
issued by the State Council, as well as physical inspections of the trucks for their fitness for such
materials transportation.
Once accident occurs, the staff of the bridge administration station can take appropriate
emergency measures. In addition, the station will also be responsible for informing the
accidental event occurred near the bridge to the emergency leader who will in turn take
further actions.
Emergency facilities
The emergency facilities and resources, including chemical agent, fire-fighting equipment are
required to for the emergency center. These facilities will be stored near the bridge site, at
the bridge management station. More elaborated and additional materials and equipment will
be stored in the emergency center. Table 4-1-1 below gives the details.

upon the other staff immediately to the site to take necessary actions, to prevent discharges
of pollutants or toxic matters into the water body. If the water is polluted, the leading group
would inform the various water intakes to stop operation as may be appropriate, and
remediation measures will be taken to deal with the event. The bridge will be closed
temporary if necessary to allow appropriate and orderly handling of spills if any and other
mafters in the accidents.

4.2 Impact on ecological environment and mitigation measures
The focus of this section is on the issue of soil conservation caused by digging for access
road connection.
4.2.1 Soil Erosion Analysis and Mitigation Measures
The proposed Hanjiang Bridge will connect with the existing Yunyang Road and G316 Road.
Since Hanjiang River flows in a valley, surrounded by high mountains, and Yunyang and
G316 Road are all located at hillside. It is therefore inevitable to cut the hill in order to build
the connection and access.
The project is located at the foot of a mountain where it connects with Yunyang road and
G316. As such, the earth work is limited. On the Yun county side, there will be some
excavation for road base which will generate 25,800 m3 excessive earth requiring disposal.
At the same time, on the Yunxi county side, there will be a demand of 26,600 m3 filling
materials. It has been planned to ship the excessive earth materials from Yun county to Yunxi
county side by barge. With this plan, earth materials are expected be mostly balanced and
thus there will be no need for dedicated excessive soil disposal site in this project. However,
hill cutting will interrupt the geological structure of the mountains and destroy vegetation
cover, causing soil erosion. The possible soil erosion may occur from the construction
activities and filling areas before protective works are complete and borrow pits, as well as
any areas where surface soil and vegetation is disturbed. In particular, soil erosion is most
27



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP SSSRI
like to occur in the raining season from June to September each year.
The following mitigation measures have been developed against soil erosion:
*   Temporary, simple drainage system will be built before the construction of road base and
deep cutting. The system will include echelon shaped ditches adjacent to the road base
to be expanded and interception ditches in sites where there are large catchment areas.
*   Guard or protective facilities will be completed within 15 days after the construction of
road base and mountain cutting. The road slope will be protected by grass and
mortar-brick embankment will be built on water saturated road base.
*   The access road involving amount of earth work will be scheduled to avoid draining
season, and the construction contractor will be requested to keep close contact with
local climate stations to take protective measure before heavy storms. The drain system
will be cleared in a timely manner prior to draining season. The surface slope of each
earth layer will be 2-5% and be compacted before rainfall and end of each work shift.
*   Certain protective materials, such as grass matting, will be kept ready for rain day when
they may be used to cover the deep slope bare soil and other vulnerable sites from
heavy soil erosion.
*   0.5 m deep holding/sedimentation ponds and retaining wall will be built at the steep
slope, disposal and borrow pits. When the construction is completed, the ponds will be
filled and flatted.
4.2.2 Other Ecosystem Impact Mitigation Measures
*   As April to June of each year are the spawning season, the in-water construction activities
will be banned during this period to minimize the impacts to fish. The construction will be
scheduled for the dry season where possible.
*   The connection roads will occupy a small amount of mountainous land in the Yunxi County
side , which is currently covered by wild grass and shrubs. There is no large tree in this area.
The occupied land will be compensated according to the relevant requirement from the local
forest authority, prior to the construction. Furthermore, the construction sites will be well
defined and any construction activities outside the pre-defined areas will be strictly
prohibited.
*   The land in Yun County within the project area is covered by cultivated land which is
valuable in such mountain region. Construction activity should be well managed to limit
land occupation to the defined boundary of the site and avoid damage of plant beyond
the site.
*   The construction camps and material stockpile sites will be carefully selected on waste
land where possible, to avoid occupy cultivated or wood land. When the construction is
completed, the land will be leveled, restored and re-landscaped by the contractors.
4.3 Impact on Acoustic Environment and Mitigation Measures
Construction Phase
28



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
Noise during the construction phase will mainly arise from construction equipment and
transportation vehicles, causing increased noise levels in the areas surrounding the
construction sites. According to EA team's site survey, there is only one sensitive receptor
along the project, Jiangjunhe Village. Therefore the focus of the acoustic assessment is
placed on the village area.
According to the Noise Limit at Boundary of Construction Site (GB12523-90), the limit for
nose level for day time and night time are 70-75 dB(A) and 55dB(A) respectively. Based on
the experience of similar works, the impact distance of noise from construction equipment is
40 m in day time and 200 m in night time. In addition, the transportation of construction
material on road will cause noise impact to the receptor. Currently, houses of Jiangjunhe
Village spread closely along the access road to the proposed bridge, overlapping of noise
from the current traffic on G316 Road, construction activity and material transportation will
pose severe impact on some residents. The mitigation measures are as follows:
*   Provision of noise insulation windows to 9 houses in Jiangjunhe Village, with the total
cost of RMB 10,800.
*  The construction materials will be transported on the existing road to the construction
sites. The transportation schedule will be carefully designed to minimize the adverse
impact on residents, as well as the traffic on the existing road. The transportation
vehicles will be requested to slow down and banned from horning when passing houses.
*   The construction activity in residential area will be scheduled in daytime only, and the
noisy equipment should be prohibited from night operation.
*  The construction equipment will be well maintained to keep it best operating conditions
and lowest noise levels possible.
Operation Phase
According to the traffic flow projection, the traffic volume will be doubled in 2007 after the
proposed project is complete, reaching 1292 MTE/day and 1562 MTE/day in 2010 and 3019
MTE/d in 2020. At these, however, the total projected traffic is still very low. There is no
suitable mathematical model for projection of such low traffic flows, therefore the traffic noise
level has not been modeled in this EA. In fact the increased traffic will certainly increase the
noise levels from the current 61 dB(A) at the day time and 51 dB(A) at night. Although no
specific modeling data is available, based on experience from other roads with similar traffic
volumes, noise levels will be raised by 3-5 dB(A) during the operation phase, which are
expected to exceed the Class IlIl standards designated for such sensitive receptors. However,
by provision of noise insulation windows, 10dB(A) noise level will be reduced in the affected
house. Therefore the noise impact could be effectively controlled by the proposed mitigation
measures in operation phase. The following additional measures will also be taken to
mitigate the increase noise impacts to sensitive receptors:
Enhanced management on vehicle on the bridge, to prohibit over-load trucks;
Motor vehicles speed will be limited by warning and traffic control signs to be erected near
the sensitive receptors.
* The road will be well maintained to ensure good surface conditions to avoid increased
noise from poor road conditions.
29



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP SSSRI
4.4 Impact on Ambient Air and Mitigation Measures
As the bridge and connecting road will adopt concrete surface instead of asphalt, there is no
hog mixing plants, and thus no asphalt emission issues. The major air emissions in this
project are expected to be airborne dust from construction sites and construction traffic.
Concrete Mixing Impact Assessment and Mitigation
Concrete mixing will likely to cause airborne dust, particularly during materials loading and
mixing, affecting air quality in the surrounding areas. However, as the road surface work is
not very large, requiring only 4770 m2 of surface pavement, there will be a need of a small
mixing plant. If the site of the mixing plant is not well planned, it could impact the surrounding
areas so a major mitigation measure is to properly select the site to have sufficient distances
leeward form sensitive receptors. such as Jiangjunhe Village and Lijiapeng Village. The
mixing plant will also be covered to the extent possible to minimize the potential of dust
airborne. Otherwise, provide sufficient protection to workers at these stations is needed.
Air-borne Dust Impact and Mitigation
The main factors affecting air-borne dust are the traveling speed of vehicles, wind speeds,
handling of bulk and powdering materials, dust fall on road and moisture on road. The
traveling distance of air-borne dust is closely related to wind speed. According to the
monitored data on Jing-Jin-Tang expressway during construction phase that, at the 150 m
leeward, the TSP is 5.093mg/m3, exceeding the Class 2 standard of National Environmental
Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996). As described previously there are a few sensitive
receptors within this distance including schools, hospitals and residential housing which
could be impacted by the dust. However, the air-borne dust could be effectively controlled by
water spraying.
Following measures are to be taken:
*   Contractors will be requested by contracts to provide water spray vehicles to water the
unpaved ground, storage piles and other areas where airborne dust may originate. The
water spray operation will be carried out in dry and windy day, at least twice a day
(morning and afternoon). The frequency of water spray near sensitive receptors, such as
villages and school, will be increased as may be needed.
*   Speed of transportation vehicles entering in the construction sites and passing through
the villages will be restrictedly limited. The truck transporting powder materials, such as
cement, sand and lime, will be covered.
*   In order to avoid air-born dust pollution, the excessive earth work should be collected
using as filling material or trucked away rather quickly with minimum storage at the sites,
Motor Vehicle Emission during Operation Phase
According to traffic volume projection for this Project and EA team's past experience, the low
volume of this project will not cause significant impact on ambient air quality. The limited
amount of emissions is expected to quickly dispersed with little impacts to the overall air
quality in the area. It is anticipated that the current Class II standard will be maintained during
the operation phase.

4.5 Assessment of impacts of the bridge auxiliary facilities
As this project is very close to the current suspension bridge, about 50 m, and the existing
five stories administration station building for the suspension bridge is also very close to the
new bridge (see Figure 3), it can be utilized as the administration station for the new bridge.
According to the arrangement of the project owner, after the new bridge construction, the
facilities and staff at the current administration station will be transferred to the new bridge for
toll collection, maintenance and administration. Clearly, there will be no new sources of
pollution for the new bridge auxiliary facilities. Based on EA team's site investigation, the
main pollutants form this administration station includes a small amount of domestic
wastewater. This wastewater is treated in septic tanks and the supernatant is drained by local
farmers for agricultural land uses. The sludge is collected by the local sanitary unit for proper
proposal. Following these measures, there is expected very little adverse impacts. Similarly,
the existing police inspection station will also be used for the new bridge and there will be no
new sources of pollution.
4.6 Assessment of existing suspension bridge
According to an inspection report for the suspension bridge prepared by the Hubei Highway
Bureau in March 2003, the bridge has a certain safety concern. In the end of 2002, the
Yunxin county communication bureau conducted a major repair of the bridge but that repair
can only last another 2.5 years safe operation of the bridge, i.e., to the mid 2004, when the
bridge will reach its designed life. As the current World Bank financed new bridge will be
constructed by 2007 the project owner plans to conduct another repair and strengthening to
ensure the safe operation until 2007. The suspension bridge will be phased out when the
new bridge is constructed and put in operation.
According to project plan, after the new bridge construction and operation, the existing
suspension bridge will be dismantled. But there is no detailed plan or timing for the
dismantling yet. However, in order to eliminate the safety concern, the suspension bridge will
be closed immediately following the new bridge operation, prohibiting motor vehicle and
pedestrian traffic. Traffic and waming signs will be erected to guide the traffic through the
new bridge. As the new bridge has 1.5 m wide pedestrian lanes on both sides, it can also
meets the pedestrian traffic and the closure of the suspension bridge will not have impacts to
the pedestrian traffic and local residents river crossing needs.
The suspension bridge dismantling will have certain impacts, including mainly:
* Short term impact to water quality. As this is a suspension bridge and has no columns or
any other in-water structure, there will be no in-water dismantling. The impact to water
quality will be mainly from dripping of materials when the suspension bridges are
dismantled. As the dismantling is expected to be short (about a week), the impacts from
materials dripping to the river will be short and will disappear when dismantling activities
are complete.
As Hanjiang river is a navigation channel and if the timing of dismantling is not



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Brdge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
appropriately selected, the activities will affect water navigation and potential safety
concerns.
* Dismantling activities pose safety risks. If the site is not well sealed from the public, it
could be a safety concern to the surrounding residents.
As the impacts are mostly shorted termed, the following mitigation measures will be adopted:
*   Prior dismantling operation, the contractor will be requested to inform the public,
navigation and hydrology authorities and coordinate with the authorities for the optimal
timing.
*   Reasonably arrange the construction time, and prohibit dismantling activities in the
period of April to June, which is the spawn time. The dismantling will be arranged in the
dry season if possible to avoid impact to navigation.
*   Strengthen the site management and completely seal off the construction sites to ban
strictly access of any vehicles and pedestrians into the dismantling sites. Dedicated staff
will be assigned to the site for safety.
4.7 Land Acquisition and Resettlement
Land Acquisition and Resettlement
The total land to be occupied by the proposed project will be 18.25 mu, with about 10 mu
cultivated land. Most of the cultivated land to be occupied is in Jiangjunhe Village. Because
there are 200 mu cultivated land and about 200 people in the village, occupation of about 10
mu cultivated land would result in a 5% loss of the agriculture of the village. As the per capita
land ownership is 1 mu/person, some people will lose a large portion or all of their land if the
loss is not shared by the whole village. Therefore their livelihood will be severely affected.
Sufficient compensation will be paid to the affected people, to ensure them recovered
livelihood.
In addition, there are 1527.86 m2 houses to be demolished. About 12 households will be
relocated.
Mitigation Measure
A resettlement team has been set up by HPCD to prepare a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).
At the time this report was prepared, the project RAP had been completed and submitted to
the World Bank for review. HPCD has promised to follow the policies and guideline of the
World Bank and national laws to carry out the land acquisition and resettlement
compensation.
4.8 Social Impact
Significant positive social impact will be brought by the proposed Project, such as the
following:
* Improved local transportation conditions, reduced traveling time and traffic accident;



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
* Easy access to services and markets. In particular, the vulnerable groups will have better
access to medical and education services.
* The bridge design has the provisions for pedestrian traffic, including a 1.5 m wide
pedestrian lane on each side. This is in compliance with relevant design code of the
country and meets the expected pedestrian traffic volume. On both sides of bridge are
small communities with no large markets. Most traffic on the bridge is motor vehicles
with minimum pedestrian. At the present, the pedestrian traffic across the river is about
150 per day. The expected pedestrian traffic after the new bridge is expected to not
exceed 300 per day. For this volume of traffic, the two 1.5 m wide pedestrian lanes on
the bridge will be adequate.
* Promoting economic growth in the region, promoting flows of goods and providing easy
access to market. The improved transportation infrastructure will also help attract outside
investment and support the local economic development.
* The Project construction and operation will bring funds to the local economy and provide
employment and income opportunities. This will help the poverty alleviation effort in the
Project region.
At the same time, however, some negative social impacts will be brought as the result of
project construction, including land occupation and house demolition, traffic blocking during
construction, interruption of some irrigation facilities, safety of people during construction,
especially to vulnerable group as school children and elderly, inducing some epidemic
diseases spread, such as SARS etc. These impacts could be effectively mitigated by the
following measures:
*   Construction activity will be limited to the site and any damage of vegetation cover
outside should be prohibited.
*   The existing irrigation facilities will be protected, and any interruption will be minimized
and restored as soon as the construction is complete. Spoil materials are prohibited from
dumping into the irrigation canals.
* Enhance construction management, especially orderly, well organized and scheduled
construction activities. Warning signs like "construction ahead, reduce speed" will be
installed by contractors on their road sections, a staff will be designated by the contractor
to guide traffic when necessary to avoid traffic blocking in G316 road and Yunyang road.
*  Traffic warning signs will be installed at some sites, such as Jiangjunhe village, access
road entrances and bridge, and a safety education program will be carried out on the
people affected.
*  Transportation of material and operation of equipment will be carefully scheduled based
on public consultation although these will not cause significant impact.
*  The construction camps will have a management system for hygiene, sanitation and
environmental control. Health training will be provided to all construction workers
particularly the knowledge for prevention and control of epidemic diseases such as
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), AIDS and hepatitis B, etc. The construction
camps and living quarters will be cleaned and disinfected regularly, providing a clean
and healthy living environment to construction workers. All workers will be checked for
their health regularly including temperature checks. An emergency plan will be in place
to quarantine workers who suspected of having SARS or other infectious diseases and



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
hospital authority will be informed immediately.
4.9 Management of Construction Camps
According to the construction schedule, the workers will live in two camps at each side of the
river. But a certain area of land will also be required to store construction equipment and
materials. Two such temporary camps will be set up. The construction camps will have a
management system for hygiene, sanitation and environmental control. Health training will be
provided to all construction workers particularly the knowledge for prevention and control of
epidemic diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), AIDS and hepatitis B,
etc. The construction camps and living quarters will be cleaned and disinfected regularly,
providing a clean and healthy living environment to construction workers. All workers will be
checked for their health regularly including temperature checks. An emergency plan will be in
place to quarantine workers who suspected of having SARS or other infectious diseases and
hospital authority will be informed immediately. Septic tanks will be provided for construction
camps, which will be cleaned regularly. The drinking water quality will be ensured to meet the
national standard for drinking water.
The contractors will be selected based on competitive bidding. They will be requested to
prepare various construction management plans and rules under the supervision of the
Project owner and to provide training, including environmental training to workers. The
environmental training program will cover environment management, construction safety,
noise, dust, camp management and health. In addition, environment management will be
included in the contract and its implementation will be under the supervision of the Project
owner and the environmental supervisor designated by the owner.
4.10 Environmental Benefit
The potential positive environmental benefits of the proposed project are:
*   Reduced soil erosion by improved drainage system along road and protective works
*  Saving on resources by increasing vehicle operation efficiency, lowered fuel
consumption, reduced air-borne dust, noise and air emission;
*   Improved transportation condition between the west and east area of Shiyan City, saving
traveling time of vehicles on road and reducing likelihood of traffic accidents on the road
and during the ferry;
*  The degree of impact on the sensitive receptors will be monitored and effective
mitigation measures will be taken wherever necessary, thus the environmental quality
of the sensitive receptors will be ensured.
4.11    Safeguards Assurance and Compliance
There are nice other safeguards policies, besides OP 4.01, in the World Bank which could



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
apply to a Bank financed project. The Project EA includes an initial screening and, where
triggered, full application of the safeguards policies. The following summarizes the safeguard
issues for this Project.
* OP 4.04 Natural Habitats - There are no natural reserves or significant natural habitats
within the project area, thus this policy is not applied.
*   OP 4.11 Cultural Property - The EA team has undertaken a cultural property survey
and assessment. No cultural sites have been found within the assessment area, thus
this policy is not applied
*   OD 4.20 (being converted to OP 4.10) Indigenous Peoples - There are no indigenous
people settlement centers within the project area, thus this policy is not applied
*   OP 4.36 Forestry and OP 4.09 Pest Management - There are no forest, even large
area of woods, and the storage of pesticide is not increase as the result of the project
implementation, thus these policies are not applied.
*   OP 4.37 Safety of Dams, OP 7.50 International Waterways and OP 7.60 Disputed
Area - These policies need not to be applied.

5.3 Response to Public Concerns
The public consultation shows that the local people are very supportive of the Project and
want the Project to be completed as soon as possible. The people surveyed well understood
the Project contents and had most concerns related to the noise and traffic safety. Their
concerns have been recorded. EA team has cooperated with the design team to develop the
responsive mitigation measures which have been included in the report. Following are the
responses to these concerns:
39



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Brdge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
Concern: Land Acquisition and Resettlement
Land occupation is inevitable to any road projects. The roadside residents understand the
necessity of land acquisition. Most of the residents agree the land acquisition plan provided
they get reasonable compensation. The residents asked for direct compensation to their
hands. The compensated house should be within the same village.
Response: A resettlement team has been designated by HPCD to prepare the RAP and the
team has already had the feedback about these opinions from the public. The HPCD has
promised to safeguard the public interest based on the national laws. Therefore the affected
people would not suffer loss of living quality.
Concern: Employment of local labor force
The public and government wanted the project to employ the local labor so that they could
have more income opportunities from the Project construction and operation.
Response: The EA team has transferred the requirements to HPCD who have demanded
the Yunxi Counties Transportation Bureau to give full consideration of employing labor from
the local sources. The locals can be used as hard labor and after technical training, the locals
can also be employed for jobs requiring more skills.
Concern: Traffic Blocking.
The public is concerned that construction activities could close the roads and impede the
traffic.
Response: The construction will be carried out in half of the road at a time to minimize the
impact on traffic. Warning signs like "construction ahead, reduce speed" will be installed by
contractors on their road section, a staff will be designated by the contractor to guide traffic
when necessary.
Concern: Soil Erosion
The public is concerned on the increased soil erosion due to construction activities.
Response: EA team and design team have given this issue a serious consideration.
Effective measures have been designed to control soil erosion, such as clear defined
boundary, provision of drain and protective works. Vegetation cover will be restored after the
work is completed.
Concern: Water Quality in Hanjiang River
Hanjiang River is the source for the National South-North Water Diversion Project. The
construction of the bridge should be well managed, and effective measures should be taken
to address the concern of water quality.
Response: EA team is particularly concerned about the water quality impact on Hanjiang
River, and has designed mitigation measures for each state of project process. The risk of
dangerous material leakage has been analyzed. Detailed management plan and emergency
plan have been prepared. It is believed that the impact on water quality will be minimized by
these measures.
5.4 Information Disclosure
40



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
Both of the Environment Impact Assessment Report and the Environment Management Plan
will be disclosed to the public when they are prepared. In view of the difficult distribution of
information in such remote mountainous region, the EA team has carefully designed the
means for information disclosure. The EA documentation will be placed in the village
committee, and another copy will be placed in the Library of Yunxi County which is easily
accessible to other stakeholders. As newspaper is not well distributed in the villages, the
village's broadcasting and the public bill board are used to disclose information. In addition,
the following means will also be used:
*   Shiyan TV station will be used to broadcast the information, covering the brief
introduction about the project, and the location where the Ea documentation is placed.
*   Information which covers the brief introduction about the project, and the location where
the EA documentation is placed. is announced on the bill board of Jiangjunhe and
Lijiapeng Villages.
*   Some printed booklets are placed in the existing bridge administration station to be given
to passing vehicles and pedestrians by the station staff. The booklets include a brief
project description and key results of EIA, as well as the places for the full EIA report for
public review.

Chapter 6       Conclusions
The main conclusions drawn from the EA process are as follows:
Current Environment Status
* This proposed project is located in the west region of Hubei Province. By the proposed
bridge, Yunxi and Yun Counties, both are national level poverty counties, will be
connected. The proposed bridge will be a vital linkage to the Jiangnan and Jiangbei and
will provide the short cut road to the counties in Shiyan City.
*   Hanjiang River flows in a valley formed by two mountains. The slope on the Yunxi side is
flat which is cultivated by the local people, on the high land underbrush and grass
dominate the vegetation cover. On the side of Yunxi County, the gradient of the land is
steep which is covered by woods. However at the bridge site, there is no trees around,
but underbrush. No cultural properties, scenic region or natural reserves are found during
the EA site survey.
* Soil erosion is severe in this project area. The soil erosion mode falls into the medium
degree.
* Hanjiang River is the source for the National South-North Water transfer Project, and the
current water quality of the river is very good, can meet the Class II standard.
* The acoustic environment is affected by the current traffic noise on Yunyang Road and
G316 road.
* The ambient air quality is very good, with monitored NO2 can meet Class I standard and
PM10 is within the applicable Class II standards.
Environment Assessment Conclusions
* It is inevitable to cause impact on the water quality in Hanjiang river by the proposed
project. EA team is particularly concerned about the water quality impact on Hanjiang
River, and Efficient and effective measures have been developed in this report for each
state of project process. The risk of dangerous material leakage has been analyzed.
Detailed management plan and emergency plan have been prepared. It is believed that
the impact on water quality will be minimized by these measures.
* Soil erosion would be likely caused by hill cutting. Mitigation measures have been
designed to minimize the potential impact on soil erosion.
* Noise arising from both construction and operation phases will cause negative impact on
the roadside Jiangjunhe Village. Responsive mitigation measures have been developed
in this report to minimize the impact.
* Because the limited quantity of work for this proposed project, the concrete surface is
only 4770m2, the mix station will be very small. Such impact arising from mixing
operation will be effectively mitigated by careful site selection and enclosed operation of
mixing station as well as water spray on dirt road and storage piles. Although the traffic
volume is expected to rise as the result of improved transportation condition, it will still
remain low. Based on comparative analysis, the ambient air quality can still meet Class II
standard during the operation phase.
42



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
*  A resettlement team has been designated by HPCD to prepare the RAP. The public
interest will be safeguarded based on national laws. And the living quality of the affected
people will be improved by the resettlement.
*   The construction activity will be carefully designed and coordinated by transportation
department. Staff will be designated to guide the traffic on road to avoid traffic blocking
and minimize the impact on traffic.
*   With appropriate management of construction camps, treatment of wastewater generated,
and disposal of the solid waste from the camps, the impact of the camps will be
minimized.
*   Extensive benefits to the local transportation infrastructure, economic development as
well as convenience and standard of living of the local residents will result when the
project is completed.
This bridge project will significantly improve the local transportation condition, thus bring
substantial benefits to the local economy, people's income and agricultural restructuring. It
will also provide an easier access for the roadside residents to market, service and education.
As a result, life quality of the local residents will be improved, and poverty alleviated. As the
negative impacts to environment will be minimized and mitigated, this project has received
strong supports from local people and governments. As a general conclusion, this EA has
found this Project environmentally acceptable, provided all mitigation measures designed for
this Project are well implemented.

7.3.3.2 Monitoring Reporting System
Environmental monitoring reports for both the construction and operation phases will be
prepared by the Environmental Monitoring Center of Yunxi County. During the construction
period quarterly reports need to be prepared and submitted to the HPCD and Yunxi county
EPB and for the operation phase annual reports are to be submitted to Yunxi County
Transportation Bureau and EPB. The monitoring result will be discussed in the report to
identify whether the environmental standards are met, and whether new measures are
needed to mitigate any new and unexpected adverse environmental problems identified
during monitoring. These new measures will be implemented after approval from the HPCD
and/or local Transportation Bureau.
As the Project owner, HPCD and local Transportation Bureau will respond to the report.
51



Jiangjunhe Hanjiang River Bridge EIA and EMP  SSSRI
When any unexpected environmental impacts are monitored and identified, the Bureau will
organize the review, approval and coordination of the implementation of new mitigation
measures.
The construction period will be three years and each year environmental monitoring cost will
be RMB30,000.. For the operation phase, RMB 20,000/year will be required for the
monitoring. In addition, a contingency of RMB 50,000 will be set aside for accidental
monitoring and mitigation/remediation planning. A full-time staff at the bridge management
station will be provided for maintenance of greening, drain system and bridge
7.4 Personnel Training
The success of environmental management for the Project relies on the knowledge, and
experience of the personnel involved in environmental management. As contemporary
methodologies and approach towards environmental management for road construction and
operation are still new to the agencies in the local department concerned, extensive training
will be needed. HPCD is responsible for organizing the training.
The personnel training will cover environmental regulations, standards, and responsibilities,
etc. The details of the personnel training program are presented in Table 7-4-1.
