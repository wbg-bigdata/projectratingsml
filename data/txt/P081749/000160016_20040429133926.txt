Resettlement Concepts and Definitions
Definitions
Resettlement refers both to land acquisition and associated adverse impacts caused by
the project, and the mitigating measures (i.e., compensation for assets, economic
rehabilitation, housing replacement) provided to displaced persons.
Compensation, in cash or in kind, is calculated at replacement cost and provided to displaced
persons for loss of land, structure or other fixed assets. Compensation is provided to displaced persons
in full, without deduction for depreciation or any other purpose.
Income restoration and restoration of living standards is the key resettlement
objective. Resettlement planning should aim to improve the incomes and living standards
of displaced persons. At minimum, incomes and living standards should be no lower than
the standards that prevailed before the project.
Displaced Persons
Project displaced persons refers to all the people who, on account of the execution of
the Project, had or would have their (1) standard of living adversely affected; or (2) right,
title, interest in any house, land (including premises, agricultural and grazing land) or any
other fixed or movable asset acquired or possessed temporarily or permanently; (3) access
to productive assets adversely affected, temporarily or permanently; or (4) business,
occupation, work or place of residence or habitat adversely affected; and "displaced
person" means any of the displaced persons.
Vulnerable People
Vulnerable people refer to the people that are most liable to adverse impacts among
the displaced persons, and those whose living circumstances make them less able to adapt
to the changes imposed on them by the project.
Aims of Resettlement
* The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) aims at reducing the impacts of land
acquisition and relocation and thereby to minimize involuntary resettlement through
optimized project design.
* Through equitable resettlement policies and effective restoration plans, the RAP
aims at providing full compensation at replacement cost for the losses of displaced persons,
ensuring improved living standards and income level following resettlement or at least
restoring their former standards.
* The RAP aims to minimize losses of affected institutions, enterprises and shops



caused by land acquisition and relocation, carrying out proper resettlement of affected
institutions, enterprises and shops, improving their profitability or at least rehabilitating to
their previous standards
* The RAP should provide special assistance to vulnerable people (such as the
elderly living alone, widows, orphans, single-parent families, the disabled, or members of
minority groups), such as giving priority to selection of replacement housing or
employment.
* Displaced persons should have ample opportunity to participate in compilation of
the RAP and their opinions should be taken into consideration in formulating resettlement
arrangements. Resettlement implementation will be subject to both internal and external
monitoring.
* The RAP should ensure that displaced persons receive any necessary transitional
assistance for the period of relocation or economic rehabilitation.
* The RAP should optimize planning of resettlement areas so that adequate public
infrastructure and service facilities are provided in a timely manner.

in the east, connecting Bai River of Shanxi Province, linking Xichuan of Henan Province,
and bordering on the "automobile city", Shiyan in the south, the district has always been
known as "the Barrier of Hubei, the Door of Henan, the Gorge of Shanxi. and the
Periphery of Sichuan". The total area of the county is 3, 863 km2, and the land pattern is
known as "Eight mountains, half water, one cropland; half roads and farms". Yun as a
county has more than 1, 700 years' history. After the founding of the PRC, the
organizational system of Yun County has undergone many changes, and it was established
as the attached county of Shiyan City since 1994. At present, 15 towns, 3 townships, 518
villagers' committees are under its jurisdiction. The area under the jurisdiction in 2002 is
3863 km2, the total population is 603.9 thousand (among which 319.4 thousand are males,
284.5 thousand are females, and the proportion of male and female is 112.3), and the
population density is 156 persons/krn2. In 2002, the GDP of the district is 1.631 billion
Yuan.
Yunxi lies in the border area in the northwest of Hubei Province, north bank of
Hanjiang River, and at the south foot of north section of Qinling Mountain. It spans 1090
30' - 1100 37' E, and 32° 50' - 330 15' N. It borders Yun County in the
southeast, faces Baihe County of Shanxi Province across a river in the south, borders
Xunyang and Zhenan County of Shanxi Province in the west, and links Shanyang and
Shangnan counties of Shanxi Province in the north. The county town is 618 km away from
the provincial capital, Wuhan, and 108 km away from Shiyan City. The longest lateral
separation from the west to the east is 115 km, and the longest longitudinal separation
from the north to the south is 46 km. Yunxi has a long history. From as early asl million
years ago, people labored, lived and multiplied here. The Yunxi County was established
520 years ago in Mingchenghua 12 year (1476). 9 towns, 7 townships, and 310 villagers'
committee are under the jurisdiction of Yun County. By the end of 2002, the land area of
the county is 3, 509 km2, the total population is 503.4 thousand (among which 262.8
thousand are males, and 240.6 thousand are males, and the proportion of male and female
is 108.4), and the population density is 143 persons/ km2. The GDP of the county in 2002
is 1.104 billion.
The project affected regions are of long history, rich hurnanist and natural resources.
At present there are 7 categories and 24 major humanistic and scenic spots. Among them,
Wudang Mountain is one of the famous mountains in China, and also the well-known
Taoist scenic spot, and the birthplace of Wudang martial art. The UNESCO lists the
ancient structures of Wudang in the World Culture Relics. Other humanistic and scenic
spots are: Wujiagou Folklore Village known as "World Folk Culture Banpo Ruins", China
Han Nationality folk song village, Lujiahe, and Danjiangkou ( the biggest artificial

freshwater lake in Asia) Reservoir in the east; Shennongjia, the virgin forest with traces of
savages, the exile culture of I 000-li Fang County. hot spring for both drinking and bathing,
and karst cave groups, in the south; Zuxi Chu Great Wall which is called "internal Great
Wall" by historians, peculiar and beautiful 1 8-li-long gorge, Zhushan Du River drifting
scenic spot. and Yunxi Longtan River scenic spot in the west; the ancient Shangjin city
originating from Wei and Jin period, Xuangu Guan, and 1000-mu stone forest to be
developed in the north.
1.2 The Economic and Transport Condition of Affected Areas
Generally speaking, Hubei belongs to a moderately developed region. In 2002. the
GDP per capita in Hubei is 8, 319 Yuan, which ranks 14 in 31 provinces, municipalities
directly under the Central Government, and autonomous regions. The five counties under
the jurisdiction of Shiyan City fall into the category of the third class backward counties,
and the major indicators of economy are below the average level in Hubei. (See table 1-2).

Notes: the data underlined are obtained in 2001.
As is indicated in table 1-2, compared with other counties and cities, the indexes of
the affected regions are of a lower level. In 2002, the GDP per capita of Shiyan and its
subordinates, Yun County, Yunxi County, and Zhushan are respectively 1469, 5619, 6124,
and 6203 Yuan less than the average GDP per capita in Hubei province. At present, Yun
County, Yunxi County, and Zhushan belong to national grade poverty-stricken counties.
Shiyan became a provincial city in 1973. Known as "Automobile City", Shiyan was
4



built because of automobiles and prospered also because of automobiles. Afier 30 years'
construction, the comprehensive economic level enhances dramatically. Shiyan becomes
one of the biggest automobile manufacturing bases, the core of "Automobile Industry
Corridor", and is the biggest center city in the "borders of four provinces", "E, Yu, Shan,
and Yui.
Industry plays a leading role in the economy of Shiyan City. In 2002, the GDP of the
city is 23.152 billion Yuan, among which the production value of the second industry
reaches 12.722 billion Yuan. accounting 54.9% of all. Automobile industry occupies the
absolute predominance in industrial system, the overall production value of which
accounting 85% of total production value of industry of the city. In 2002, the total outputs
of automobiles are 170.2 thousand. On the basis of the development of automobile
industry, Shiyan City also develops other related industries such as rubber, metallurgy,
construction material, electric power, medicine, textile, and food, and an industrial system
of special features is formed.
The first industry mainly consists of farming and animal husbandry in Shiyan. In
2002, the total output value of farning, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery is 4888.87
million Yuan, among which farming accounting 64.1%, forestry 4.5%, animal husbandry
28.5%, fishery 2.9%. The major crops are wheat, corn, paddy, oil plants, spicery cigarette,
tu-chung, tung oil, ginger, and tea. In 2002, the total grain yield is 723.5 thousand ton, the
total vegetable yield is 1036.9 thousand ton, and the total yield of oil plants is 62 thousand
Yuan.
The tertiary mainly includes service, culture, education, science, and public health. In
2002, the total output value of the tertiary is 7.543 billion Yuan, accounting 32.6% of the
total output value. The proportion of the output value of the three industries is 12.5: 54.9:
32.6.
Zhangwan and Maojian Districts are the urban areas of Shiyan City, the economic
levels of which are relatively higher than that of Yun County and Yunxi County. In 2001,
the GDP per capita of the two districts are respectively 2, 780, and 3, 463 Yuan; the
revenue per capita is respectively 311 and 365 Yuan; the net income per person of peasants
is respectively 2,667 and 2, 301 Yuan. In 2002, the salary per person of the employees is
respectively 9, 186 and 9, 489 Yuan. As headquarter of Dongfeng Motor Co., the pillar of
Zhangwan district is automobile industry, and other industries include: machine,
metallurgy, chemistry, textile, construction material, medicines etc. The major industries in
Maojian District are automobile accessories, metallurgy, chemistry, and construction
materials. At present, three agricultural bases of vegetables, forest special products, and
livestock and poultry, are constructed. The new development setup with the tertiary
industry as the main body, and the industry in the city proper as the pillar, and the
agriculture in the suburb as the basis, has come into being.
5



Yun County is a national grade poverty-stricken county. The agricultural population
is 508, 000, 84.8 % of the total population. By the end of 2002, the actual area of cropland
is 32.42 kilo hectares, 0.81 mu per person. Due to the scarcity of cropland, large-scale
agriculture production cannot come into being, and basic organization system is household
contract responsibility system established in the early 1980s.
Agriculture plays a leading role in the state economy. The major crops are wheat,
corn, paddy, potato, bean, oil plants and tea, and in recent years, the planting of orange,
ginger, pawpaw, and vegetable has been developed.
The major industries are machine, metallurgy, cigarette, construction material, and
chemistry. The key light industries include papermaking, wine making, and green food.
The pattern of development of product series and business of scales has initially come into
being. The major tertiary industries are restaurant, business, catering business, and
transport service.
In 2002 in Yun County, the GDP is 1.631 billion Yuan (the price for the indicated year;
it is the same infra), and the GDP per capita is 2, 700 Yuan. The GDP of the first industry
is 524 million Yuan, that of the second industry is 536 million Yuan, and that of the
tertiary industry 571 million Yuan. The proportions of the three industries are 32.1: 32.9:
35.0. The average salary of the employee per year is 6, 879 Yuan, and the average income
of the rural habitant is 1, 596 Yuan. In 2002, the revenue is 140.98 million, and the
financial expenditure is 213.96 million, which indicates the financial difficulties in the
County.
Yunxi is also a national grade poverty-stricken county. With 444 thousand
agricultural populations, 88.1 % of the total, Yunxi is a typical agricultural county. By 2002,
the cropland area is 28.70 kilo hectares, 0.86 mu per person. Household contract
responsibility system remains the basic agricultural system. The agricultural production of
scale is difficult to be formulated. Thus the economic condition of the county is
unsubstantial
As a typical agricultural county, the first industry plays a leading role in economic
structure. Corn, wheat, paddy, bean, gingili, rape, spicery cigarette, tu-chung, tung oil,
ginger, and tea are the major crops, among which the most influential are spicery cigarette,
tung oil, and ginger. Yunxi is the first speicery cigarette manufacturing base in China, of
which the quality of tobacco leaf is fine. Tu-chung is one of the "Four Tu-chung Bases" in
China. The yield of tung oil ranks the second in China, and the yield per capita ranks first
in China. As a result it is known as "the Tung Region". The yield of ginger ranks first in
China, and the county is the largest ginger production base.
The development of the second and tertiary industries is unsubstantial, which mainly
include the production of automobile accessories, medicine and chemical industry, mining,
and water and power resources exploitation.
6



In 2002, the GDP of Yunxi County is 1.104 billion Yuan (the price for the indicated
year), and the GDP per capita is 2, 195 Yuan. The GDP of the first industry is 565 million
Yuan, and that of the second industry is 21 0 million Yuan. and the third 329 million Yuan.
The proportions of the three industries are 51.2:19.0:29.8. The average salary               of
employees per year is 8, 564 Yuan, and the average net income of rural habitants is 1. 580
Yuan. In 2002, the revenue is 68.92 million Yuan, and the financial expenditure is 188.12
million Yuan. The revenue not being able to cover expenditure, it is one of the 12 most
poverty-stricken counties with financial difficulties.

Hejia, Huocheling, Tianheping, Wangjiawan, Bamudi, Xiangkou, Lishiguan, Erdaoya,
Jiaochangguan, Dingjiawan, and ends at Manchuanguan, the juncture of Hubei and Shanxi
Province. The total length of the line is 105.86 km. The planned speed of vehicles is 80
km/h, the width of roadbed is 24.5 m, and the net width of large and medium sized bridges
7



is 2* 11.Om.
Hubei Communications Planning and Design Institute (CPDI) started the feasibility
study of Shi-Man (Shiyan-Manchuanguan) expressway project from September 2001. The
Feasibility Report was completed in June 2002. In September 2002, Hubei Province
Development Planning Commission, and Hubei Province Communication Department
examined the Feasibility Report. In September 2002, Hubei Province Communication
Department decided to apply to World Bank for loan to construct the Shi-Man Expressway.
In October 2002, CPDI finished the compiling and revision of Shi-Man Expressway
Project Feasibility Report.
In the Feasibility Report, CPDI puts forward two plans for Shiman Expressway
(Shiyan-Manchuanguan).
A line plan

tunnel, at Yinpo runs out of the tunnel, then runs along Hui River to Baomiaodi, then joins
A Line till the end.
A Line plan is recommended as Shi-Man expressway plan after comprehensive
comparison and analysis of project, environment, and resettlement work of the two plans
by experts. The total length of the line is 106 km. The planned speed of vehicles is 80
km/h, the width of roadbed is 24.5 m, and the net width of large and medium sized bridges
is 2*11 .0m. All the work will get started in 2004, and finished in 2008. The expressway
will be open to traffic in the same year.
Entrusted by Hubei Communications Department, CPDI entrusts the Second
Shipping Administration Project Survey Design Institute of the Ministry of
Communications with the formulation of an environment appraisal outline and
environment impact appraisal.
The construction of this project will speed up implementation of "develop the west"
strategy, and the construction of the expressway linking the west and central China, and
strengthen the economic link between the Changjiang economic zone and southeast China,
9



and accelerate the social and economic development of regions along the line.
1.4 Land Utilization of Affected Areas and Land Acquisition Impact
According to statistics of 2000 Shiyan City Land Use Changes Survey, land available
in Shiyan city is classified into 3 categories: agricultural land (cropland, garden plot,
woodland, grazing land and other agricultural land), land for construction, and unused
land. The total area of land available in Shiyan is 2, 367, 440.64 hectare. of which the
cultivatable land with an area of 1, 901, 526.76 hectare accounts 80.32% of the total, the
cropland with 251, 639.78 hectare, accounts 10.6% of cultivatable land, and the
uncultivated land with 383, 803.6 hectare, accounts 16.21% of cultivatable land.
With 16.21% of land unused, the land utilization ratio of Shiyan is only 83.79%. The
land used is not fully exploited. 2/3 of the croplands are medium and low-yield fields.
The major types of land in Zhangwan District, Maojian District, Yun County, Yunxi Couty
are paddy field, dry land, vegetable plot, woodland, waste hills, etc, among which paddy
field and vegetable plot with rice and vegetable as major crops are of highest productivity;
planted in dry land are grain and economic crops such as wheat, sweet potato, potato, and
yellow ginger, etc. Rice ripens once or twice a year. The project affected regions are
mainly mountainous area; therefore, though the land is vast, cropland area is small. The
expressway land acquisition is limited to a belt area, though the number of villages and
households affected are large, the influence rate are generally below 10%. Project
Resettlement Office (PRO) and relevant local departments will designedly reclaim land or
improve medium and low-yield fields so as to minimize the impact of land acquisition of
the project.
1.5 Measures to Minimize Resettlement
During the process of planning and designing the project, Hubei Provincial
Communications Department communicated and coordinated adequately with relevant
departments so as to optimize project plan and minimize resettlement work under the
precondition of meeting the technical needs and protecting environment.
1.5.1 Principles
The following principles are to be abided by under the condition that technical
standards are not lowered and environment protection requirements are met:
(1) Avoid relocating towns, densely populated districts in rural area, schools,
hospitals, factories and mining district, large-scale enterprises and relatively big
institutions.
(2)Avoid relocating humanistic spot, and historic reservation.
(3)Occupy the least fertile cropland possible; make full use of unprofitable land such
as barren hills, wasteland, and waste tidal flats.
10



(4) Avoid villages and towns of which the cropland per person is little and reduce the
number of labor forces to be resettled to ensure the normal function of production and life
of the masses living along the line.
(5) Avoid large scale water conservancy and power infrastructures.
(6) Avoid intersection with railway, national and provincial road, and important
pipelines.
1.5.2 Measures
(1) While deciding general trend of the line, first decide the key regional spots to be
avoided, and then after comprehensive analysis of tentative plans from the aspects of
project work, environment protection, and resettlement decide a preliminary plan.
(2) Make the on-the-spot investigation on the basis of preliminary plan, collect
information about the landform, physiognomy, cultural relics, mineral resources, and
economic planning, solicit opinions from local government and masses along the line,
with the key protection units as focus of attention, determine regional tentative plans.
(3) Make investigation of amount of entities to be relocated, people's opinion, and
economic conditions. In compliance with relevant State laws, regulations and policies,
decide land compensation and labor resettlement rates. Make a detailed investigation of
amount of land and structures relocated, and the condition of rural land, crop land,
population structure, economy, etc.
(4) Collect information about cultural relics along the line.
(5) While choosing location for attached service and other temporary projects, PRO
and expressway design department shall make on-the-spot investigation together with
local village, land management and planning departments to choose appropriate location
so as to requisition least fertile land.
(6) Calculate relocation expenses and general investment of the project (including
expenses for environment protection) according to resettlement investigation result. Hold
joint conference of three parties (project, environment protection, and resettlement). Fully
taking local economic planning, and opinions of local government and people into
consideration, analyze and compare investigation result from the following aspects:
*   Comparison of investments on project,
*   Feasibility of resettlement of labor forces (including both agricultural and
non-agricultural forces),
*   Analysis of resettlement capacity of environment within a certain range,
*   Fully taking production raw material supply, water supply, power supply and
means of transport, etc of enterprises to be resettled into consideration, under the
condition of maintaining the production capacity and scale of the enterprises,
analyzing the degree of difficulty of carrying out the integral moving,
*   Whether it is easy to recover affected facilities for production and living water,
11



* Analysis of the degree of difficulty to recover and improve the living standard of
relocated people in combination with the development potentiality of local
economy to ensure that the project construction would not affect the living and
production of people along the line,
* Comparison and analysis of project benefits and comprehensive social benefits,
Through the comparison and analysis of the above-mentioned aspects, and
consultation with local opinions on how to optimize the plan, decide the final
recommended    Ian.
Cases of Optimizing Design and NMinimizing Resettlement
Case 1: Optimization of the section from K19+400 to 1(24+000
In the original design. there is a channel to the left side of the section from K23-i-400 to
K23+700. and the construction of expressway will mak-e the channel pass into disuse, which
will bring adverse impact on the water supply of the area. At the same time, the original
section fromKlI-9+600 to K20+100 and the section from K21+700 to K22+600 have favorable
landform for constructioun, but the original design ignores impact on local habitants, and
renderu a lot of relocation. As the section from K 19+820 to KS 1+640 is only 20 m away from
an elembentary school, the construction will inevitably bring adverse impact to the health of
students'as well as teachers of the school. Upon the request of resettlement department, the

1.6 Feasibility Study of Techniques and Economy
Feasibility study of techniques and economy was submitted to State Ministry of
Communications in January 2003 and National Development and Reform Commission,
and is expected to be ratified in the latter half of 2003.
1.7 Preliminary Design and Final Design
Entrusted by Hubei Provincial Communications Department, CPDI plans to finish the
preliminary design in October 2003, and complete the final design in January 2004. and
road experts designated by Communications Department examine the design.
1.8 Ownership of the project
The project ownership belongs to Hubei Provincial Communications Department.
1.9 Social Appraisal of Project Impact
Entrusted by Hubei Provincial Communications Department, Social Investigation
Research Center of Beijing University formed a social appraisal group in the latter part of
July 2003, and formulated "Social Appraisal Outline of World Bank Financed Shi-Man
Expressway Project", and designed the "Questionnaire of Social Appraisal", and the flow
chart for the investigation work. Before the investigation, the Center collected and
analyzed relevant literatures of project areas and spots to be investigated.
Social appraisal group went to 10 investigation spots from August 6 to August 18,
and conducted a 12-day social investigation. The group strictly abided by the flow listed
below:
Interview with cadres from counties (districts), townships, and representatives of
villagers-  drawing maps (maps of communities, maps of distribution of family
households etc) --sequencing (including sequencing of favorable impacts and adverse
impacts of the expressway project, sequencing of factors influencing the development of
local economy, sequencing of beneficiary groups) -*survey by questionnaires -interview
with households.
For this investigation, the Center visited Hubei Provincial Communications
Department, Project Office, Statistics Bureau, Help-the-Poor Office, the Communications
Bureau, Help-the-Poor Bureau, and government of Shiyan City, Yun County, Yunxi
County, and Zhushan County. The Center also organized 10 forums, interviewed 11 cadres
of townships and villages, visited 4 schools, and distributed 302 questionnaires and
collected back 200 valid questionnaires, the rate of return being 66.3%. There are 52 cases
of thorough interviews with villagers.
On the basis of the investigation, the appraisal group submitted the Social Appraisal
Report in August 2003, which is very helpful in optimizing and the design of the project
and formulating RAP. The result of the appraisal indicates that no communities of ethnic
13



groups are affected, and the project will not leave great adverse impact on project areas.
1.10 Resettlement Investigation
According to the requirements of preparation work. the PRO finished the social and
economical study along the principal line of recommended line from November to
October 2002. PRO finished supplementary resettlement investigation according to the
changes made and the design of interchanges and connection lines from May to June
2003.
1.10.1 Range of Survey
While conducting the survey, the preliminary plan for Shi-Man expressway was not
completed, so two limitations exist: first, the red line marking the acquired land have not
yet been decided; second, the location of temporarily used land have not been determined.
For this reason, the PRO decides to adopt the following measures after consultation with
CPDI:
First, the belt area on both sides of and within 40 m away from the center line is
decided as the investigation range. Draw two lines parallel to and 30 miles away from the
recommended center line, and the belt area within the two lines is regarded as the project
affected range, and the two lines are taken as simulation red lines of recommended lines.
In addition, special survey will be conducted on sensitive spots according to principles and
standards stipulated in Project Environment Appraisal Report.
According to the estimation of CPDI, the range within the simulation red lines
basically includes the actual red line range. After the completion of preliminary design, the
following two can be carried out in 1/2000 work chart: sample the whole line, calculate
the error in relocation work of simulation red line range and actual red line range; as for
the section with big errors between the simulation red line range and actual red line range,
adjust data on the chart.
Second, after the completion of preliminary plan, CPDI makes additional
investigation for land to be temporarily used along the line.
-The relocation range of this resettlement action plan includes major line,
interchanges, , and the land permanently requisitioned for service district of the whole
project.
-The relocation range of this RAP includes permanent relocation rendered by
environmental impact.
1.10.2 Investigation Contents
(1) The location, category, and area of the land to be requisitioned within the
investigation range,
(2) The location, category, area, and cost of construction per unit of structures to be
14



relocated within the investigation range,
(3) The location, category, and numbers of the land attachments,
(4) The location, category, numbers, and proprietary units of power and
communication facilities within the investigation range, and measures to be taklen,
(5) The population (including the relation of family members, their sex, age,

2. Project Impacts
2.1 Definition of Affected Regions and Investigation Range
From December 2002 to January 2003, Hubei Province Communicationi Department.
PRO. Center for Resettlement Research of Wuhan University. and CPDI conducted an
on-the-spot investigation on expressway resettlement. The investigation personnel.
according to the expressway lines designed and decided by CPDI, decided that the area on
both sides of and within 40 m away from the center line as the investigation range (see
chart 1), they also registered the cropland, houses, and attachments to the ground one by
one, and made an detailed investigation of the families and the family members, which
provides reliable data for "Resettlement Action Plan". At present, the project is in the
preliminary design phase, and project designing unit will optimize the alignment, and
resettlement data are subject to adjustment, and PRO will promptly amend and improve
"Resettlement Action Plan" according to the adjustment of data. Meanwhile, any change
in the impact of project and reasons leading to the change will be reported to the World
Bank before the implementation. The "Resettlement Action Plan" is applicable to affected
population added later.

2.4 Land Acquisition Impact ratio
The impact ratio of land acquisition in the affected area is not high due to the
following factors: for one thing, the land requisitioned for expressway is in the form of a
belt; for another, occupation of large area of cropland is avoided to the full or as possible,
therefore the absolute quantity of land requisitioned in a village is not large. Investigation
shows that generally the impact ratio of land acquisition is 6.5%. But on the other hand, as
the line of the expressway runs along river valley or mountain valley in certain areas, and
the said areas are cropland-concentrated areas, the impact ratio of these areas is relatively
high. Furthernore, in several interchange and service area, as large areas will be
requisitioned, the impact ratio will be correspondingly high.
According to the investigation, there are 16 villages slightly affected, accounting
35% of all affected villages, and the impact ratio is below 5%; the impact ratio of another
16 villages, 35%  of all affected villages, is 5-10%; the impact ratio of 9 villages, 20%  of
affected villages, is between 10-15%, 5 villages, 11% of all affected villages, are heavily
influenced by the project, the impact ratio of which is more than 15%; and there are 3
villages of which the impact ratio is above 20%, and these villages and the respective
impact ratio are: Tongshugou village of Zhangwan District, 20.30%; Zhengjiahe Village of
Yun County, 20.14%; Jiaochangguan Village of Yunxi, 22.56%.
Resettlement offices at various levels have already consulted and will further consult
with all affected villagers about specific resettlement methods and ways. According to the
survey, of the 46 villages along the line, the impact ratio of 32 villages is below 10%; the
impact ration of 14 villages is above 10%. For villages with impact ratio below 10%, the
impact on land is minor, and few households has cropland totally acquisitioned. As for
individual family which hopes to get land compensation, the resettlement can be carried
out by land readjustment within a small range. Therefore, the resettlement office will focus
attention on the 14 villages with impact ratio above 10%, and with large areas of land
acquisitioned. For specific resettlement method and plan, please refer to chapter 5.

The survey indicates that, of all the relocated structures, timber and earth structure
27



tak-es up 52%, brick and timber structure II%, simple structure 15%, brick and concrete
22%. Market survey and analvsis of individual case indicates that the compensation to
brick and concrete structure, brick and timber structure, and simple structure is enough for
affected family to rebuild new one with the same area and structure.
As the families with earth and timber houses are relatively poorer, and earth and
timber houses take up 50% of the relocated structures, resettlement office shall pay special
attention to this group of families. Investigation on the houses to be relocated indicates
that, of the 982 earth and timber houses, there are 610 households (3, 048 people, 5 people
per household) for which the earth and timber house is their major houses (non-attached
2     M2                0 M2
houses), and the relocation area is 91, 500 m  (150 m2 per household, 30 m  per capita).
Part of the families with earth and timber house plan to reconstruct brick and timber house
or brick and concrete house due to the enhance of living standard and lack of building
materials; for these families the compensation might not be enough to cover
reconstruction cost. After consultation, the resettlement office and affected persons have
come to an agreement: the compensation rate for earth and timber house is 110 yuan/M2.
For families wanting to rebuild earth and timber house, the compensation is enough to
reconstruct house of the same area; for families wanting to rebuild brick and timber house,
the compensation to earth and timber house of 150 mi2 per household, 30 mi2 per capita, is
enough to rebuild brick and timber house of 100 mi2. After reconstruction, the average area
per capita is more than 20 m2, which reaches or exceeds the standard set up by the state for
rural well-to-do society. For individual families of earth and timber houses which have
difficulties to rebuild earth and timber house due to restriction of conditions (uch as lack
of earth source), and decide to build brick and timber structure, the resettlement office will
provide fund to ensure that the area per person is no less than 20 M2.
According to the investigation, in Zhangwan and Maojian District, the structures to
be relocated are mainly brick and timber, and brick and concrete structures, whereas, in
Yunxi and Yun County, the structures to be relocated are mainly earth and timber
structures. This situation exactly reflects the social and economic level of the four districts
and counties. As for each type of affected structures, PRO will decide replacement cost
and formulate corresponding compensation rate on the basis of investigation and
consultation. As for houses of relatively poor families, PRO will advance corresponding
compensation rate after careful study of individual cases and make sure that these families
can rebuild houses with the same structures and area as their original ones. As for families
which cannot rebuild houses due to various reasons, PRO will formulate special assistance
measures. For detailed information, see compensation rate in chapter 4, and rebuilding of
houses in chapter 5.
For those poor households, whose earth-timber house will be relocated and are not
able afford the new house, the Project Resettlement Office will provide fund help to make
28



sure they will at least have 20 square meter brick-timber house per capita.
2.6 Affected Attachments to the Ground and Special Infrastructures
According to investigation, of the attachments to the ground, the area of level ground
is 71,905.4m2, the number of wells is 437, the length of enclosing walls is 5, 735m, the
number of tombs is 5146, and the number of big timbers is 119,901, the number of small
timbers is 24,161, the number of full-grown fruit trees is 188,802, and the number
immature fruit trees is 36, 56. For specific number, see table 2-6. Affected special
infrastructures are mainly power and communications facilities, which are under
administration of relevant management departments. Resettlement Office at each level
shall consult with the corresponding departments of these infrastructures. For the number
and distribution of these special infrastructures, please refer to table 2-7.

2.7 Affected Families and Population
According to the investigation, altogether there are 5, 302 households, 21,176 people
affected along the line, among which 3,683 households are only affected by land
acquisition, accounting 71.9% of the total affected households, the number of people only
affected by land acquisition is 14, 477, accounting 68.4% of total affected population; the
number of households affected only by relocation is 597, accounting 11.3% of the total
affected households, the number of people affected only by relocation is 2, 286,
accounting 10.8% of the total population affected; and the number of households both
affected by land acquisition and relocation is 1, 022, accounting 19.3% of the total
affected households, and people both influenced by acquisition and relocation is 4, 413,
accounting 20.8% of the population affected. (See table 2-8) For detailed information of
families and people, see annex table 3.
In the socioeconomic investigation, an investigation of the relevant situation of 6,
699 people of 1, 000 families are conducted, and the investigation covers the
characteristics of the population and socioeconomic features. For specific information of
affected people, see table 2-9.
In accordance with State Land Laws, and relevant Hubei provincial laws and
regulations, the computing formula for the agricultural population to be resettled is as
follows:
Agricultural population to be resettled =area of requisitioned cropland
Area of cropland before acquisition/Agricultural population
The rural organization at the village level is the basic collective unit that has land
usage right in China. Provided the state requisitions land for construction, the relocated
population will be calculated with the village as a unit, and the resettlement will be carried
out within the village. According to the real situation in the rural area, normally, the
adjustment of land is mainly conducted on the basis of the land available in the group.
Only when the land resources of a group cannot meet the need of the land readjustment,
will inter-village adjustment be considered. In the affected areas, the resettlement of the
affected agricultural population will try to be carried out within a group. Calculation
indicates 6,593 agricultural populations are to be resettled. For specific information, see
table 2-10.

2.8 Affected Enterprises and Institutions
The land acquisition and relocation covers 22 enterprises and institutions, among
which 3 are elementary schools, I is middle school, 9 are enterprises, and 9 are institutions.
The resettlement office has carried out investigation on affected units, and obtained
information about the operation status, number of employees, and degree of impact. For
the general condition of affected enterprises and institutions, see table 2-11.
As is indicated in table 2-11, the impacts on these enterprises and institutions roughly
fall into 3 categories:
First category: attached non-production structure. As for these affected structures, the
enterprises will get cash compensation according to relevant policies, and the enterprises
decide whether to rebuild new structures or not.
Second category: production structures. As for non-key structures, the enterprise can
rebuild new structures in the neighborhood with the compensation fund. The rebuilding
and rehabilitation of these structures won't affect the actual operation and production of
these enterprises, and won't involve the resettlement of labor forces, and loss of profits. As
for major production structures, it is necessary to rebuild structures in another place.
Third category: institutions (such as schools or road maintenance squad). The
rebuilding and rehabilitation of these structures won't influence the normal functioning of
38

3.2.1 Abstract of Relevant Laws and Regulations of the State and Hubei
Province
*  Land compensation fund is paid to rural collective economic organizations;
compensation for attachments to the ground and young crops is paid to the
owners.
*  Resettlement subsidies for land acquisition must be exclusively used for the very
purpose and not be misappropriated by anyone. Provided certain people are to be
resettled by the rural collective economic organization, the organization receives,
manages and uses corresponding subsidies; the same for other units that resettle
corresponding population. For those who needn't to be resettled by unified
measures, they either get subsidies directly or retain them as insurance after their
consent. (Article 26 of "Enforcement Bylaw of the Land Law")
*  Land requisitioned shall be compensated for on the basis of its original purpose of
use.
Compensation for requisitioned cultivated land shall include compensation for land,
resettlement subsidies and attachments and young crops on the requisitioned land.
Compensation for requisition of cultivated land shall be six to ten times the average
annual output value of the requisitioned land for three years preceding such requisition.
Resettlement subsidies for requisition of cultivated land shall be calculated according to
the agricultural population needing to be resettled. The agricultural population needing to
be resettled shall be calculated by dividing the amount of requisitioned cultivated land by
the average amount of the original cultivated land per person of the unit the land of which
is requisitioned. The standard resettlement subsidies to be divided among members of the
agricultural population needing resettlement shall be four to six times the average annual
output value of the requisitioned land for three years preceding such requisition. However,
the highest resettlement subsidies for each hectare of the requisitioned cultivated land
shall not exceed fifteen times its average annual output value for the three years preceding
such requisition.
Standards of land compensation and resettlement subsidies for requisition of other
types of land shall be prescribed by provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
directly under the Central Government with reference to the standards of compensation
and resettlement subsidies for requisition of cultivated land.
43



Standards for compensation for attachments and young crops on the requisitioned
land shall be prescribed by provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly
under the Central Government.
If land compensation and resettlement subsidies paid in accordance with the
provisions of the second paragraph of this Article are still insufficient to help peasants
needing resettlement to maintain their original living standards, the resettlement subsidies
may be increased upon approval by people's governments of provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government. However, the total land
compensation and resettlement subsidies shall not exceed 30 times the average annual
output value of the requisitioned land for the three years preceding such requisition.
(Article 47 of "Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China")
* The rural collective economic organization, the land of which is requisitioned,
shall accept supervision by making known to its members the income and
expense of the compensation received for land requisition.
The compensation and other charges paid to the unit for its land requisitioned is
forbidden to be embezzled or misappropriated. (Article 49 of "Land Administration Law
of the People's Republic of China")
A construction unit that obtains right to the use of State-owned land by such means of
compensation as assignments shall, in keeping with the standards and measures prescribed
by the State Council, pay among other charges compensation for use of land such as
charges for the assignment of land-use right, before it can use the land. As of the date of
implementation of this Law, 30 percent of the compensation paid for the use of additional
land for construction shall go to the Central Government and 70 percent to the local
people's governments concerned, both of which shall exclusively be used for developing
cultivated land. (Article 55 of "Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of
China")
Generally, the period for temporary use of land shall not exceed two years. (Article

3.2.2 Relevant Prescriptions in the World Bank's OP/BP4.12
OP4.12 and BP4.12 of the World Bank cover elaborate polices of involuntary
resettlement, whose main articles related to this project include:
* Policy objectives of Resettlement
(a) Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized,
exploring all viable alternative project designs.
(b) Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be
conceived and executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient
investment resources to enable persons displaced by the project to share in project benefits.
Displaced persons should be meaningfully consulted and should have opportunities to
participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs.
* Measures to achieve the goals
(c) The resettlement plan or resettlement policy framework includes measures to
ensure:
(i) The displaced persons know their options and rights pertaining to resettlement;
(ii) The borrower consults with and offers choices to displaced persons on technically
and economically feasible resettlement alternatives; and
(iii) The borrower provides prompt and effective compensation at full replacement
cost for losses of assets attributable directly to the project.
(d) If the impacts include physical relocation, the resettlement plan or resettlement
policy framework includes measures to ensure:
(i) The borrower provides displaced persons with assistance (such as moving
allowances) during relocation; and
(ii) The borrower provides displaced persons with residential housing, or housing
sites, or, as required, agricultural sites for which a combination of productive potential,
locational advantages, and other factors is at least equivalent to the advantages of the old
sites.
(e) Where necessary to achieve the objectives of the policy, the resettlement plan or
resettlement policy framework also includes measures to ensure:
(i) The borrower offers support after displacement, for a transition period, based on a
reasonable estimate of the time likely to be needed to restore their livelihood and
standards of living; and
(ii) The borrower provides displaced persons with development assistance such as
45



land preparation, credit facilities, training and jog opportunities.
*   Particular attention should be to the needs of vulnerable groups among those
displaced, especially those below the poverty line, the landless, the elderly,
women and children, indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, or other displaced
persons who may not be protected through national land compensation
legislation.
*   Preference should be given to land-based resettlement strategies for displaced
persons whose livelihoods are land-based. These strategies may include
resettlement on public land, or on private land acquired or purchased for
resettlement. Whenever replacement land is offered, resettlers are provided with
land for which a combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and
other factors is at least equivalent to the advantages of the land taken. If land is
not preferred option of the displaced persons, the provision of land would
adversely affect the sustainability of a park or protected area, or sufficient land is
not available at a reasonable price, non-land-based options built around
opportunities for employment or self-employment should be provided in addition
to cash compensation for land and other assets lost. The lack of adequate land
must be demonstrated and documented to the satisfaction of the bank.
*   Payment of cash compensation for lost assets may be appropriate where (a)
livelihoods are land-based but the land taken for the project is a small fraction of
the affected asset and the residual is economically viable; (b) active markets for
land, housing, and labor exist, displaced persons use such markets, and there is
sufficient supply of land and housing; or (c) livelihoods are not land-based. Cash
compensation levels should be sufficient to replace the lost land and other assets
at full replacement cost in local markets.
*   Displaced persons and their communities, and any host communities receiving
them, are provided timely and relevant information, consulted on resettlement
options, and offered opportunities to participate in planning, implementing, and
monitoring resettlement. Appropriate and accessible grievance mechanisms are
established for these groups.
*   In new resettlement sites or host communities, infrastructure and public services
are provided as necessary to improve, restore, or maintain accessibility and levels
of service for the displaced persons and host communities. Alternative or similar
resources are provided to compensate for the loss of access to community
resources (such as fishing areas, grazing areas, fuel, or fodder).
*   Patterns of community organization appropriate to the new circumstances are
based on choices made by the displaced persons. To the extent possible, the
existing social and cultural institutions of resettlers and any host communities
46



and groups are honored.
3.3 Resettlement Polices Appropriate to the Project
In line with aforesaid State and local laws, regulations and relevant policies of the
World Bank, PRO sufficiently consults with displaced persons on, and draws up the
following resettlement policies appropriate to the project on the base of the reality of

4. Compensation Rates
In accordance with relevant State laws and regulations and Operational Policies of
the World Bank on involuntary resettlement, on the basis of thorough surveys of social
economic development of regions along Shi-Man Expressway, and sufficient consultation
with affected units, persons and relevant departments of local governments, PRO set up
resettlement compensation rates in "Resettlement Action Plan" so as to improve displaced
persons' livelihoods and standards of living or at least to restore them to pre-displacement
levels as soon as possible.
4.1 Basis of Compensation Rates
4.1.1 Basis of Land Compensation Rates
Compensation for land acquisition includes: land compensation, resettlement
subsidies and compensation for young crops. According to relevant State and provincial
laws and regulations, average output value of the requisitioned land for three years
preceding such requisition must be determined and a reasonable compensation multiple
must be chosen in order to decide the aforesaid three kinds of compensation. While
deciding land compensation rates of the project, PRO takes the following three factors into
full account: 1) Decide high rates to the limit within the permitted range of laws and
regulations for the affected regions for these regions are poverty-stricken. 2) Respect
opinions of experts of the World Bank to decide compensation rates, the compensation
rate of the project shall not be lower than those of other ongoing expressway projects
connected to this project. 3) Even though lands of the affected regions are generally of
lower productivity than the average of other regions in Hubei Province, and average
output of lands varies in different districts and counties, the highest output shall be
referred to decide the base number of land compensation rates.
1. Land compensation rates
1) Compensation base numbers
Through survey, PRO finds that there mainly are paddy fields, dry lands, vegetable
plots, woodlands, waste hills and other types of lands in Zhangwan District, Maojian
District, Yun County and Yunxi County. Paddy fields and vegetable plots have the highest
productivity; peasants mainly plant rice and ordinary vegetable in them and get almost
equal income from the two types of crops. In dry lands, peasants generally plant cereals
and economic crops such as wheat, sweet potato, potato, yellow ginger and etc. Crops
growing in paddy fields ripe once or twice annually. Yun County got the highest average
52



annual outputs from both paddy fields and dry lands between 2000 and 2002, which were
respectively 451 kilograms and 377 kilograms. State purchasing prices of rice and wheat
are respectively 1.0 yuan/ kilogram and 0.95 yuan/kilogram, whereas corresponding
market prices are 1.05 yuan/kilogram and 1.0 yuan/kilogram. Considering that the affected
regions are under poverty, PRO calculates output value per mu as per market price so as to
fully safeguard interests of both displaced persons and affected regions. As a result, the
highest average output values per mu of paddy fields and dry lands in the aforesaid two
districts and two counties for three years preceding such requisition are respectively 474
yuan and 377 yuan. Abiding by the following principles 1) adopt high rates possible
within the permitted range of laws and regulations for the affected regions in that they are
poverty-stricken, 2) respect opinions of experts of the World Bank to decide compensation
rates of the project, and the compensation rate shall not be lower than those of other
ongoing expressway projects connected to the very project, PRO consults with local
departments concerned and affected units and persons and then decides to take 474 yuan
as the compensation base number for paddy fields, vegetable plots and ponds; 377 yuan
for dry lands, nurseries, woodlands and house sites; 200 yuan/ mu for other types of lands
without output. Compensation for recovering ponds is decided to be 3000 yuan/ mu
accordingly.

2) Compensation multiples
According to current regulations and policies, the realities of Shi-Man Expressway
and regions along the line and consultation with local departments, PRO deterrnines 8
times to be the compensation multiples for all types of lands.
3) Land compensation rates
In accordance with aforesaid compensation base numbers and multiples of all types
of lands, PRO calculates compensation rates of lands requisitioned for Shi-Man
53



Expressway. Please refer to table 4-2 for details.

2. Rates of resettlement subsidies
In line with State land law and related Hubei provincial laws and regulations,
resettlement subsidies for requisition of cultivated land shall be calculated according to the
agricultural population needing to be resettled. The agricultural population needing to be
resettled shall be calculated by dividing the amount of requisitioned cultivated land by the
average amount of the original cultivated land per person. The resettlement subsidy to the
agricultural population needing resettlement shall be four to six times the average annual
output value of the requisitioned land for three years preceding such requisition. As for the
project, computing formula of the agricultural population needing to be resettled is:
RCL
AP to be resettled = O /
OCL/AP
Notes:
AP = the number agricultural population
RCL= the area of requisitioned cultivated land
OCL= the area of the original cultivated land prior to requisition
AP= the number of agricultural population
State and Hubei provincial laws and policies stipulate that the resettlement subsidy to
the agricultural population needing resettlement shall be four to six times the average
annual output value of the requisitioned land for three years preceding such requisition.
Taking the reality of regions along Shi-Man Expressway into account, PRO calculates
resettlement subsidy for each member of the agricultural population as per six times,
which is the highest times of the average annual output value of the requisitioned land for
three years preceding such requisition. Since the average annual output value of the land
requisitioned by the project for three years preceding such requisition is 405 yuan
according to the classification of requisitioned lands, each member of the agricultural
population concerned gets 2,430 yuan of resettlement subsidy. Therefore, 16,020,990 yuan
54



is needed for 6,593 agricultural persons, i.e. 3,427 yuan per mu..
3. Compensation rates for young crops
As for requisitioned lands with young crops, young crops are compensated at the
average annual output value of the requisitioned land for three years preceding such
requisition: 474 yuan/ mu for paddy fields and vegetable plots and 377 yuan/ mu for dry
lands. Trees of woodlands are compensated as attachments to the ground instead of young
crops. For waste hills, lands and tidal flats, there is no compensation for young crops.
4.1.2 Basis to Decide Compensation Rates for Structures
All the structures affected by the project will be compensated at their corresponding
replacement costs. In January and May 2003, PRO, local resettlement offices and Center
for Resettlement Research of Wuhan University, which are the investigation and
consultation organization of the project, selected representative households, enterprises
and institutions, carefully studied several cases and analyzed replacement costs of various
types of structures in the affected regions so as to obtain respective accurate figures. Box
4-1 shows several carefully studied cases of bricks and concrete structures.

All the cases aOre most representative, thus they provide reference for PRO to set
reasonable compensation rates as per replacement costs.
As for brick and concrete houses, because houses in the cases above are built in
recent years and prices of various building materials have hardly changed and even fallen
down recently, consulted compensation rate for them is 260 yuan! square meter, which is
enough for affected households to build new ones with the same areas and structures.
As for brick and timber houses, houses in the cases above were built 10 years ago;
now it costs more money to build the same one with the same quantity of labor and
material in that prices of material and labor forces have risen. PRO obtains the following
current prices of items concerned from local building market:
Brick: 0.15 yuan! block
Tile: 0.14 yuan! piece
Earth: 5-7 yuan! stere
Timber: 200 yuan! stere (Generally, it costs 20 steres of timbers to build 100 square
meters of houses of bricks and timbers.)
Laborer: 22 yuan! day
Combining case 4 of Box 4-1, all kinds of basic costs to build a 130-square-meter
house of bricks and timbers are:
Brick: 35000 blocks, 0.15yuan/ block; 35000*0.15=5250yuan;
Tile: 22500 pieces, 0.14yuan/ piece; 22500*0.14=3150yuan;
58



Sand and cement: 1500 yuan
Timber: 26 steres, 200 yuan/ stere (including freight); 26*200=5200yuan
Laborer payment (including family members): 220man days, 22 yuan/ man day;
220*22=4840 yuan
Cost of ground leveling: 2000 yuan, including building barricade and drainage ditch
House site purchase fee & commission charge: 2000 yuan
Total cost: 23940 yuan
Cost excluding cost of ground leveling & commission charge: 19940 yuan
Average cost excluding cost of ground leveling of house site & commission charge:
151 yuan / square meter
Through consultation, the project compensates brick and timber houses at the rate of
160 yuan/ square meter, which is enough for affected households to build new ones with
the same areas and structures.
The total area of affected earth and timber houses are 99, 323 square meters, which is
52.5 % of the total area of all the affected structures. Therefore, reconstruction and
rehabilitation of them is the most important issues concerning house compensation of the
project. PRO also does special research on them.
Box 4-2: analysis of compensation rates for earth and timber houses
In order to obtain actual information on households along Shi-Man
Expressway who have earth and timber houses, PRO and the consultation
organization conducted thorough studies to learn basic situations of the
households and details of the houses and then got elaborate and full basis to set
compensation rate for earth and timber houses.
Basic information of households uith earth and timber houses: as per survey
on relocated houses of the affected regions along the line, there are totally 982
housebolds with houses of earth and limbers needing to be resettled. Thereinto
610 households, 3048 persons in total (5.0 persons per household), have the earth
and timber houses as their major houses (non-subordinate houses); and 91, 500
square meters, 150 square meters per household and 30 square meters per person,
will be relocated. According to survey on relocated households, above 90% of
earth and timber houses were built more than 15 years ago and the oldest even
lasts for over 50 years. Besides, about 50°o of the households uith these houses
plan to build new ones in the coming two or three years even Shi-Man
Expressway would not start and their houses would not be relocated.
Furthermore, 80% of households with earth and timber houses to be relocated
intend to build new brick and timber houses, but the rest 20% have not decided to
choose which kind of structure.
59



Construction cost for earth and timber houses:
Combining case 5 of box 4-1, basic costs to build a 140-square-meter earth
and timber house are:
Tile: 24000 pieces, 0.14yuan/ piece; 24000*0.14=3360yuan;
Earth: 140*7=980 yuan
Sand and stone: 300 yuan
Timber: 28 steres, 200 yuan/ stere (including freight); 28*200=5600yuan
Laborer payment (including family members): 200man days, 22 yuan/ man
day; 200*22=4400 yuan
Cost of ground leveling of house site: 2000 yuan, including building
barricade and drainage ditch
House site purchase fee & commission charge: 2000 yuan
Total cost: 18640 yuan
Cost excluding cost of ground leveling of house site & commission charge:
14640 )uan
.Average cost excluding cost of ground leveling of house site & conmmission
charge: 105vuan / square meter
Feasibilitv analysis of compensarion rates for earth and timber houses: based on
investigation. PRO consults with displaced persons and arrives at a consensus that
compensation for houses of earth and timbers is 110 yuan per square meter. The rale is high
enough for households who hope to build ones of the same structures and same areas. And
80% of the relocated households who hopes Io build brick and timber houses can also build
houses of 100 square meters with compensation calculated as per 150 square meters per
household and 30 square meters per person. Moreover, new houses of bricks and timbers can
ensure each member of these households get more than 20 square meters of residential area,
which reaches or exceeds the State prescribed  wvell-off" level. Provided particular
households with houses of earth and timbers have difficulty in rebuilding houses of the same
structure and have to build new ones of bricks and timbers, PRO will help them with
subsidies so as to ensure 20 square meters of residential area per capita As a result it is
certain that compensation rates of the project for houses of earth and timbers can ensure that
living conditions of the displaced persons will be rehabilitated and improved.
4.1.3 Basis for Other Compensation Rates
Except for compensation rates of requisitioned lands and structures, PRO consults
with the displaced persons and decides compensation rates of all types of attachments to
the ground, special facilities, moving allowances and transition subsidies of affected
households in line with local market prices and compensation rates of similar projects.
60



Take telecommunication facility as an example: according to affected situation obtained
from investigation, the facility administrative department advances compensation demand
report to rehabilitate the facility; PRO employs professional department to examine and
evaluate the report and then arrive at a consensus on compensation rate of the facility with
the administrative department as per exarnination and evaluation result.
4.2 Various Compensation Rates
In line with the aforesaid bases of compensation rates, compensation rates for all
types of affected lands, buildings and other items applicable to the project are listed in

The affected special facilities mainly refer to power supply and communication
facilities. These facilities will be compensated at replacement cost, on the basis of
consultation with power and communication departments. The relocation shall be made
before the acquisition to ensure the normal life of people along the line.
5.4 Relocation and Rehabilitation of Attachments to the Ground
The attachments to the ground will be compensated at replacement cost, and owners

5.5 Reconstruction of Enterprises and Institutions
Resettlement investigation indicates that there will be 22 enterprises and institutions
being affected along the 106-km-line. Impacts on these enterprises and institutions roughly
fall into 3 categories:
First are non-production attached houses to be relocated. As for this kind of affected
structures, cash compensation will be made according to relevant compensation policies.
The enterprise will decide whether to reconstruct it or not.
The second category is structures for production. As for the non-key structures, the
enterprise can reconstruct them with the compensation fund in the neighborhood, which
will not affect the actual production and operation of enterprises, and will not incur loss in
profit or unemployment. As for key structures for production, resettlement shall be made
in the form of reconstruction in another place.
The third are structures of institutions such as school and road maintenance squad.
These structures shall be reconstructed, and the reconstruction will not affect the normal
functioning of these institutions and nor the employment.
The following principles shall be insisted on in the relocation of enterprises and
institutions:
*   Relocated structures and attachments of affected enterprises shall be compensated at
replacement cost;
*   Loss of profits incurred by relocation, and salary for workers of affected enterprises
shall be compensated;
*   Relocated structures and attachments of affected enterprises and institutions shall be
compensated at replacement cost, and relocation shall be conducted at appropriate
time so as to avoid interruption of normal functioning of these enterprises and
institutions.

5.6 Production Resettlement for the Displaced Population
From April to June 2003, personnel of PRO went to 142 villager groups alone the
line, publicized resettlement polices, declared survey results of resettlement and urged the
villager groups to make their own resettlement schemes on the basis of sufficient
consultation. After wide discussion and consultation, all the villages and production
groups chose different resettlement methods according to their own realities and members'
wills. Statistic analysis shows displaced persons choose the following resettlement
methods: 1) Readjust land within a production group and the collective uniformly uses
land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies; 2) Directly distribute land
compensation funds and resettlement subsidies to households with land requisitioned and
the displaced persons settle themselves; 3) Uniformly use land compensation funds and
resettlement subsidies, and take advantage of the project construction to reclaim new
cultivated land and make up lands of affected households; 4) Uniformly use land
compensation funds and resettlement subsidies to improve cultivated land so as to increase
output per mu and develop industrial and tertiary business. Besides, statistic analysis
indicates that 40% of the village groups hope to directly distribute land compensation
funds and resettlement subsidies to affected households because the amount of
requisitioned land is small. The rest 60% select the agricultural resettlement method and
uniform utilization of land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies, with the hope
to resettle the agricultural population by land readjustment or reclamation.
70



5.6.1 Agricultural Resettlement Method
Agricultural resettlement method means: let peasants whose contracted lands were
requisitioned regain lands by land readjustment. In details, gather all the cultivated lands
of a village firstly and then share them equally among the current population so that
laborers with land requisitioned will get new lands. Then these affected laborers will
resume agricultural production in the village, the nature of household registrations and
occupations remaining unchanged. During land adjustment, all the villagers should
participate in consultations and come into consensus on how to use land compensation
funds and resettlement subsidies. If requisitioned lands are few, no households were
completely requisitioned of lands and all the villagers agree, land compensation funds and
total resettlement subsidies can be directly disbursed to affected peasants.
In line with wills of the aforesaid villager groups, all the local resettlement offices
decide the following principles of resettlement on the basis of sufficient consultation:
As for villager groups whose impact ratios are under 5%, land compensation funds
and total resettlement subsidies can be directly distributed to peasants affected by land
acquisition with villagers' consent.
As for villager groups that hope to readjust land, land adjustment will be finished in
slack seasons before April 2004. Refer to house reconstruction sites of relocated
households and allot lands near the reconstruction sites to them so as to restore and
improve their production and livelihoods in the shortest time possible. The vulnerable
households will get lands with the same amount and quality as those preceding such
requisition, and at the first 4 four years when the reclaimed cultivated land become
mellow soil, the households will get 150 yuan additional compensation per mu per year.
Between land acquisition and re-distribution of reclaimed land, households will be
compensated at the rate of temporary land acquisition from the land compensation fund.
As for villager groups that have land reclamation plans, PRO will organize villagers
to check computation of reclamation cost and make elaborate reclamation plans along
with units undertaking the project and technicians of land administrative departments. The
plans will be implemented after approval of district and county resettlement offices.
Regions along Shi-Man Expressway relatively lack cultivated land resource and the
per capita area is limited. In this situation, resettlement offices at all levels employ
technicians of the project-designing unit and land administrative departments to guide
resettlement information declaration and policy publication. They also encourage villager
groups to scheme land reclamation plans in the light of local land resources and possibility
of the project construction so as to remedy the impact of land acquisition. As per
consultation and survey results, regions along Shi-Man Expressway will reclaim 2,287 mu
of new cultivated land with the project construction. Table 5-2 shows the detailed land
reclamation plans.

Land reclamation will reduce the overall impact ratio of land acquisition from 6.5%
to 3.7%. In the 46 villages affected by land acquisition, 6 can increase area of cultivated
land and enlarge the carrying capacity of environment; 34 is able to control impact ratio
within 10%; 5 within 20% and only one at 20. 1%. Please refer to table 5-3 for details.

Feasibility Analysis of Reclaiming Cultivated Land along Shi-Man Expressway
Between April and May 2003, PRO, along with local governments and land
administrative departments, surveyed land condition of regions along the line. The survey
shows there are many low basin valleys and intermountain basins with altitude lower than
500 meters in the aforesaid regions; climate there is mild and moist enough for crops to
thrive. In addition, the project construction designing indicates that the project will bring
over one million steres of waste materials in total, using which will solve partly the
shortage of land source and completely the deposit of waste materials.
As a result, from May to July 2003, PRO organized villages and production groups
along the line, land administrative departments and the designing unit to draw up land
reclamation plans according to local situation, the project design, and 2001-2010 Shiyan
municipal planning of land consolidation and rehabilitation. All the villages and
production groups concerned will reclaim 2,287 mu of new lands.
Since capital for villages and production groups above to reclaim new lands depends
on land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies, rates of the two immediately
relate to the implementation of land reclamation plans. Therefore, PRO, Shiyan Bureau of
Land and Resources, Center for Resettlement Research of Wuhan University and the
project designing unit, synthetically analyzed several typical land reclamation projects of
the project affected regions in recent years; and the designing unit would elaborately
devise the land reclamation plans for some typical villages and production groups then
make investment budget thereof.
Analysis of expense on implemented land reclamation plans of the project affected
regions
a. Land reclamation project of Tumen Town, Yunxi County
Carried out in 2002 by the government of Tumen Town, Yunxi County, the project
(No. 420322020) lasted for 2 months, consolidated 177 mu of land and reclaimed 127 mu
of new cultivated land with the total investment of 354 thousand yuan, per mu of which
cost 2,776 yuan. It located at Baishugou of Tumen Town, civil work thereof included
digging and filling steres of earth or stone work, building retaining ridges and loanings,
laying live-earth layers and constructing networks of forest. On average, each plot of new
reclaimed cultivated land has a gradient within 5 degrees and a live-earth layer thicker
than 0.6 meters.
b. Land reclamation project on river tidal flats of Danjianguogou, Bailang Town, Yun
County
Carried out in 2003 by the government of Bailang Town, Yun County, the project
(No. 420321077) lasted for 3 months, consolidated 1530 mu of land and reclaimed 850 mu
of new cultivated land with the total investment of 2,500 thousand yuan, averagely 2,940
yuan per mu. It located at Danjiangguogou of Bailang Town, civil work thereof included

constructing diversion dams, leveling ground, building loanings, laying live-earth layers
and constructing networks of forest. On average, each plot of new reclaimed cultivated
land has a gradient between 2 and 5 degrees and a live-earth layer thicker than 0.6 meters.
Case analysis of expense on land reclamation
Production group 2 of Tongshugou Village planned to reclaim 20 mu of land in a
mountain valley near the line of the expressway. Designed by CPDI, its civil work
included digging and filling steres of earth or stone work, leveling ground, building
retaining ridges and loanings, and laying live-earth layers.
In line with current price level, "Budget Drafting Procedures for Land Consolidation
and Rehabilitation Project" and "Construction Quota of Hubei Provincial Water
Conservancy Hydroelectric Project" made by Financial Department of Ministry of Land
and Resources and Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Center of Ministry of Land and
Resources, CPDI made the following budget for the project:
Item             Quantity  Unit price (yuan RMB) Amount (yuan RMB)
Earth & stone (stere)  5787          6                   34722
7.5# grouted stone(stere)  105      25                    2625
Cultivated soil (stere)  6217       3                    12434
Laborer (man)           600         20                   12000
Machine                                                   2000
Explosive                                                 500
Contingency (1 0 %)                                       6428
Total                                                    70709
As per the budget, it costs 3,535 yuan to reclaim one mu of cultivated land. But the
unit price will fall to 1,800 yuan/mu if all the steres of earth or stone abandoned by the
project construction are used for reclamation, and 2,674 yuan/mu if half of the steres are
used.
To verify price of reclaimed cultivated land, PRO consulted with Shiyan Bureau of
Land and Resources, which provided it with "2001-2010 Shiyan Municipal Planning of
Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation". The "Planning" stipulates investment budget
rates per unit area of new cultivated land in Shiyan City: 3,000 yuan/mu for flat areas,
3,500 yuan/mu for low mountainous regions, 4,000 yuan/mu for alp regions and river tidal
flats.
Summarizing the above analysis, every mu of reclaimed cultivated land costs
between 3,000 yuan and 4000 yuan. It will be less than 3,000 yuan if steres of earth or
stone work discarded by the project construction are used. As a result, rates of land
compensation funds and resettlement subsides for the project, which are respectively
7,219 yuan/mu and 6,443 yuan/mu, are able to fully meet the cost demand of reclaiming
new cultivated land in the villages and production groups with land reclamation plans.

5.6.2. Non-agricultural Resettlement Method
Since villagers in some affected villages and production groups do not mainly live by
land production, they insisted on using land compensation funds and resettlement
subsidies as capital to invest on non-agricultural production and business. After careful
survey and consideration of displaced persons' opinions, PRO regarded it as a practical
resettlement method for affected regions. There are mainly two non-agricultural
resettlement methods: one is directly distributing total resettlement subsidies and partial
land compensation funds to affected households to allow their independent operation of
non-agricultural production and business; the other is utilizing land compensation funds
and resettlement subsidies to develop village non-agricultural economy and compensating
affected households with corresponding lands through land readjustment. The villages
shall hold villagers' meetings to determine the resettlement method.
Besides, PRO requires villages that decide to set up collective non-agricultural
business to make elaborate and reliable fund utilization plans (See table 5-5 and 5-6 for
table format of plan). Then senior resettlement offices would examine and approve the
plans, appropriate reasonable resettlement funds according to the feasibility and actual
progress of the plans and check the executions regularly. The PRO and External
monitoring organization will pay particular attention to villages with a large amount of
lands requisitioned and large land compensation funds, and especially those with more
than 50 mu of land requisitioned, with focus on the supervision of formulating fund
utilization plan and the utilization of funds.
5.6.3 Resettlement of Villages Heavily Affected by Land Acquisition
Laying great emphasis on the resettlement of 14 villages with impact ratio above
10%, PRO paid enough attention to the publicizing of resettlement policies, public
consultation, resettlement funds utilization, formulating of land reclamation plans and
other chief links in these villages, and required them to scheme elaborate resettlement and
rehabilitation plans. Under the guide and organization of local resettlement offices and
after repeated consultation and study, the 14 villages made plans as follows:
Tonzshugou Village. Jianghan Street. Zhangwan District
With 1,854 villagers and 1,769 mu of cultivated land, of which paddy fields are 375
mu, dry lands are 1,019 mu and vegetable plots are 375 mu, the village kept 0.95 mu of
cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 2, 3, 4 and 5 thereof involved in land
acquisition, have 596.1 mu of cultivated land in total but 121 mu of them are requisitioned,
thus the impact ratio is 20.30%. Combining consultation results and the project
construction, the village planns to uniformly reclaim 55 mu of land at Tongshugou, of
which 20 mu for Production group 2, 15 mu for Group 4 (these 35 mu are dry lands) and
the left 20 mu for Group 5 (these 20 mu are paddy fields). If 3, 000 yuan is needed for
76



reclaimation of one mu cultivated land, the total cost of land reclamation is 1,650
thousand yuan. And the impact ratio of land acquisition will decrease by 11.07% after land
reclamation.
In line with compensation policies, the village will get 919.964 thousand yuan of land
compensation funds and 400.95 thousand yuan of resettlement subsidies; minus land
reclamation cost, the balance is 1.155914 million yuan. After public consultation in May
2003 and villagers' meeting between May 17th and I9th organized by PRO, the villagers
finally arrive at a consensus on resettlement method: in Production group 3, directly
distribute land compensation fund and resettlement subsidy to affected households; in
Production group 2, 4 and 5, households that desire for land will get land of the same
amount as the requisitioned preceding such requisition from new reclaimed land, and
households without such desire will directly get land compensation funds and resettlement
subsidies; the ultimate balance will be used for promoting collective public welfare
undertakings.
Huiia Village. Jianghan Street. Zhanawan District
With 376 villagers and 302 mu of cultivated land that are completely dry lands, the
village kept 0.8 mu of cultivated land per capita in 2002. The project requisitiones 31.7 mu
of aforesaid dry lands, all of which are in Production group 4, so the impact ratio is 10.5%.
After consultation, combining the project construction and the guide of land
administrative departments and engineering technicians, the village plans to uniformly
reclaim 40 mu of land at Huangjiagou at the unit price of 3,000 yuan/mu, i.e. totally 120
thousand yuan. Land reclamation will increase cultivated land of the village. Excluding
the aforesaid land reclamation cost, 328.88 thousand yuan of land compensation funds and
resettlement subsidies of the village, which are respectively 235.04 thousand yuan and
213.84 thousand yuan as per compensation polices, will be left.
After public consultation in May 2003 and villagers' meeting on May 18th organized
by PRO, the villagers finally arrive at a consensus on resettlement method: firstly use land
compensation funds and resettlement subsidies to reclaim new lands, then allot new lands
to households whose lands are requisitioned at the same amount as the requisitioned, and
finally use the balance to develop collective public welfare undertakings or promote the
service sector.
Maoping Villa2e, Jianghan Street. Zhangwan District
With 878 villagers and 605.8 mu of cultivated land that are completely dry lands, the
village kept 0.69 mu of cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 2, 3, 4, 5 and
6 thereof are involved in land acquisition and have 101.6 mu of cultivated land
requisitioned, thus the impact ratio is 17.19%. Combining consultation results and the
project construction, the village plans to reclaim 160 mu of land, of which 20 mu for
Production group 2, 30 mu for Group 3, 60 mu for Group 4, 20 mu for Group 5 and the
77



left 30 mu for Group 6. Cultivated land of the village will increase after such land
reclamation. Calculated at 3,000 yuan/mu, the total cost of land reclamation is 1.650
thousand yuan, minus which 965.533 thousand yuan of land compensation funds and
resettlement subsidies of the village, which are respectively 1.127203 million yuan and
318.33 thousand yuan as per compensation polices, will be left.
After public consultation organized by PRO in June 2003, the villagers finally arrive
at a consensus on resettlement method: firstly use land compensation funds and
resettlement subsidies to reclaim new lands, then uniformly readjust lands of the village in
accordance with the principle to ensure affected households get cultivated lands no less
than the requisitioned ones, and finally use the balance to develop collective public
welfare undertakings or promote the service sector.
Liuiiahe Village, Jianghan Street. Zhangwan District
With 957 villagers and 1,077 mu of cultivated land that are completely dry lands, the
village kept 1.13 mu of cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 1, 2, 3 and 4
thereof are involved in land acquisition and have 135.4 mu of cultivated land requisitioned,
thus the impact ratio is 12.57%. On one hand, per capita cultivated land of the village is of
a relatively large amount, and each member will still has 0.98 mu after land acquisition.
On the other, no household has land completely requisitioned. Therefore, all the villages
agree to directly distribute resettlement subsidies and compensation for young crops to
affected households. The collective uniformly uses land compensation funds. In line with
compensation policies, the village will get 1.597023 million yuan in total, of which
1.397763 million yuan is land compensation funds and 199.26 thousand yuan is
resettlement subsidies.
Zhengiiahe Villane. Liubei Town. Yun County
With 1,039 villagers and 1,011 mu of cultivated land, the village had 0.97 mu of
cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 thereof are involved in
land acquisition and have 203.6 mu of cultivated land requisitioned, thus the impact ratio
is 20.14%. And per capita cultivated land after land acquisition is 0.78 mu. Since the
village lacks land resource for reclamation, the villagers consult together and decide to
readjust lands within the village after land acquisition. The total 1.48037 million yuan of
land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies will be uniformly used to develop
collective public welfare undertakings and promote the service sector. Besides, taking
advantage of the project construction, the village would invest 200 thousand yuan to
explore local resources of sand and stone and erect a quarry plant that would employ 50
laborers.
Jiaochangpo Village. Chengguan Town, Yunxi County
The village has 1,766 members and 271 mu of cultivated land. Production group 3
thereof, with 366 members and 233 mu of cultivated land, is requisitioned 40.1 mu of
78



cultivated land, so the impact ratio is 17.2%. For one thing, the village has been
incorporated into Chengguan Town, its laborers mainly work in second and tertiary
industries, and total 3.62 million yuan of agricultural production value in 2002 only took
up 12.5% of the total output value of the village, which was 28.96 million yuan. For
another, the village lacks land resource for reclamation. Moreover, its villagers are
unwilling to be engaged in agricultural production because the village is the
communication hub of Yunxi County and the villagers have opportunities to enter the
service sector. Under this situation, the village discusse resettlement method and decide to
distribute directly land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies to affected
households and not to readjust lands. In line with compensation policies, the village will
get 274.731 thousand yuan in total, of which 121.641 thousand yuan is land compensation
funds and 153.09 thousand yuan is resettlement subsidies.
Wangiiaping Village. Chenu-tuan Town. Yunxi County
With 2,399 villagers and 1,619 mu of cultivated land, the village kept 0.67 mu of
cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 thereof are
involved in land acquisition and have 208.1 mu of cultivated land requisitioned, thus the
impact ratio is 12.85%. Being the planned service area of the expressway, the village is
estimated to get 30 positions and plenty of opportunities to develop service industry from
the construction and operation of the service area. As per compensation policies, the
village will get 1.720624 million yuan in total, of which 826.384 thousand yuan is land
compensation funds and 894.24 thousand yuan is resettlement subsidies.
Since the village lacks resource for reclamation and some peasants hope to take
advantage of the construction of the service area to undertake non-agricultural production,
Production group 1, 4, 7 and 8 agree to distribute directly land compensation funds and
resettlement subsidies to affected households and not to readjust lands; Production group 6
and 10 decide to readjust lands and use land compensation funds and resettlement
subsidies for developing collective public welfare undertakings and promoting the service
sector, and the benefits will be distributed according to the ownership of the acquisitioned
land.
Guandimiao Village. Tumen Town. Yunxi County
With 2,149 villagers and 1,204 mu of cultivated land, the village kept 0.56 mu of
cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 thereof are involved in
land acquisition and have 235.7 mu of cultivated land requisitioned, thus the impact ratio
is 19.58%.
The village plans to reclaim 101 mu of land, of which 37 mu is for Production group
2, 30 mu for Group 3, 10 mu for Group 7 and the left 24 mu for Group 8. The impact ratio
will fall to 11% after land reclamation with the total investment of 303 thousand yuan at
the unit price of 3 thousand yuan. Minus the land reclamation cost, 1.126229 million yuan
79



of land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies, which are respectively 1.05705
million yuan and 1.880279 million yuan as per compensation policies, will be left. After
consultation, the villagers finally decide that: firstly use land compensation funds and
resettlement subsidies to reclaim new lands, then uniformly readjust lands of the village,
and finally use the balance to develop collective public welfare undertakings or promote
the service sector.
Bamudi Village, Xiangkou Township. Yunxi County
With 1,638 villagers and 1,648 mu of cultivated land, the village kept 1 mu of
cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 1, 2, 3 and 4 thereof are involved in

and finally use a part of the balance to rehabilitate and improve water conservancy
facilities so as to raise output per mu and the other part to develop collective public
welfare undertakings or promote the service sector.

With 1,854 villagers and 1,769 mu of cultivated land, the village kept 0.95 mu of
cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 thereof are involved in
land acquisition and has 215.7 mu of cultivated land requisitioned, thus the impact ratio
was 12.19%.
Combining the project construction, the village plans to reclaim 123 mu of land, of
which 50 mu is for Production group 1, 25 mu for Group 3 and the left 48 mu for Group 5.
The impact ratio will fall to 5.2% after land reclamation with the total investment of 369
thousand yuan at the unit price of 3 thousand yuan. Minus the land reclamation cost,
1.489057 million yuan of land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies, which are
respectively 0.915217 million yuan and 0.94284 million yuan as per compensation
policies, will be left. As the communication hub of Yunxi County, the village gets a lot of
opportunities to develop non-agricultural production from communication construction. In
May 2003, the villages widely discussed development planning after land acquisition and
at last came to a consensus that: firstly use land compensation funds and resettlement
subsidies to reclaim new lands, then uniformly readjust lands of the village, and finally
80



use a part of the balance to improve infertile land and the other part to develop collective
public welfare undertakings or promote the service sector. As for land improvement plan,
Production group 1 will be take charge of the improvement of 30 mu of cultivated land,
Group 2, 15 mu, Group 3, 32 mu, Group 4, 17 mu and Group 5, 30 mu.
Lishiguan Village. Xiangkou Township, Yunxi County
With 1,085 villagers and 1,708 mu of cultivated land, the village kept 1.57 mu of
cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 2, 4, 6 and 7 thereof are involved in
land acquisition and have 230.9 mu of cultivated land requisitioned, thus the impact ratio
is 13.52%.
Since the village is rich in land resources, the villagers generally suggests in public
consultation to use land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies to reclaim new
lands. According to its land resource, the village plans to reclaim 133 mu of land, of which
15 mu is for Production group 2, 90 mu for Group 4 and the left 28 mu for Group 6. The
impact ratio will fall to 5.7% after land reclamation with the total investment of 399
thousand yuan at the unit price of 3 thousand yuan. Minus the land reclamation cost,
1.569624 million yuan of land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies, which are
respectively 1.400004 million yuan and 0.56862 million yuan as per compensation
policies, will be left. With unanimous resettlement desires, all the production groups of the
village insiste on readjusting land after land acquisition, making use of the project
construction to reclaim new lands, ameliorating old lands to enhance productivity and then
using the balance to promote public welfare undertakings.
Huangyunpu Village, Xiangkou Township. Yunxi County
With 1,053 villagers and 982 mu of cultivated land, the village kept 0.93 mu of
cultivated land per capita in 2002. Production group 2 and 4 thereof are involved in land

public discussion and consultation that land compensation funds and resettlement
subsidies be used to reclaim new lands. As a result, the village plan to reclaim 155 mu of
land, of which 60 mu of dry lands for Production group 2 and the left 95 mu (80 mu of dry
lands and 15 mu of paddy fields) at Zhangjiawan and Houdang for Group 4. Production
group 2 would also improve 35 mu of old lands with low productivity. Land reclamation
will increase cultivated land of the village. If 3 thousand yuan/mu is deemed as
reclamation price, it will cost 465 thousand yuan to reclaim new cultivated land. Minus
the land reclamation cost, 0.408035 million yuan of land compensation funds and
resettlement subsidies, which are respectively 0.579005 million yuan and 0.29403 million

therefore are affected by the project to a great extent. But other affected villages with less
land requisitioned also carrie out similar public consultation and planning. Please refer to
table 5-4 for utilization of land compensation funds and resettlement subsidies of each
village. The present resettlement and rehabilitation planning is just the result of
82



preliminary consultation before scheming "Resettlement Action Plan". Once the land
acquisition formally starts, resettlement offices at all levels will urge affected villages
more to perfect and fulfill various rehabilitation plans and really use resettlement funds to
restore the production and livelihoods of the displaced persons on the basis of sufficient
consultation with them. Besides, resettlement offices at all levels, with the external
monitoring organization as well, will monitor the utilization of resettlement funds of all
villages.

5.8.3 Management and Monitoring of Resettlement Funds
Village resettlement funds will be managed and monitored according to the following
procedures:
1.    Examination, approval and preparation before appropriating resettlement funds
(1) As per social survey material, affected villages provide senior resettlement offices
with detailed affected situation for examination and approval.
(2) In line with development actuality and future of local social economy, PRO,
Shiyan Municipal RO, county (district) resettlement offices, the extemal
monitoring organization and local governments of the affected villages will train
village administrative departments and guide them to make development planning
and resettlement fund utilization plans that accord with local reality.
(3) On the basis of sufficient consultation with displaced persons, guide and advice
of departments concerned, village administrative departments draw up and submit
village fund utilization plans to county (district) resettlement offices to get
approval. Table format of village fund utilization plans can be similar with those
of Table 5-5 and 5-6.
(4) County (district) resettlement offices examine, approve village fund utilization
plans and guide the perfection of them. Villages without feasible utilization plans
would not be appropriated resettlement funds for the time being.
2.    Management and monitoring of resettlement funds
(1) After examination and approval of village fund utilization plans, county (district)
resettlement offices appropriate resettlement funds by stages as per planned
schedules.
(2) Organs at village level report actual use of resettlement funds to township and
county (district) resettlement offices each month, and county (district)
resettlement offices to PRO every quarter.
(3) Besides monitoring actual use of village funds through reports, county (district)
and township resettlement offices regularly or irregularly investigate the

6. Resettlement and Rehabilitation
of Vulnerable Groups
6.1 Definition of Vulnerable Groups
Vulnerable groups are people, compared with ordinary displaced persons, who
suffered more from production and living affected by resettlement and need more efforts
and assistances to restore their original production and standards of living owing to
various reasons. Based on this definition and reality of affected districts, the project
decides the following basic types of vulnerable groups among persons displaced by the
project while conducting surveys for preparation of the project resettlement:
*   Widowers, widows, orphans and childless couples;
*   Households with several disabled members;
*   Households with few laborers and heavy burdens of upbringing;
*   Households suffered from natural or man-made calamities and with great difficulty in
production and living;
*   Households meeting other particular difficulty in reconstructing residential housing
and production rehabilitation;
*   Other poverty-stricken households enjoying relief of civil administration departments.
6.2 Vulnerable Households Affected by the Project
Upon aforesaid definition of vulnerable groups, from November 2002 to January
2003 and from April to June 2003, the PRO, with the help of local resettlement offices,
thoroughly surveyed affected households along the line and got a gross list of those
especially poor. Table 6-1 is the result. During the process of resettlement, resettlement
organizations at all levels and the external monitoring organization as well will track its
implementation and opportunely find out households with particular difficulty in
resettlement and rehabilitation of production and living so as to reasonably settle down
each poverty-stricken household.

6.3 Helps to Vulnerable Households
Vulnerable households will get the following help:
*   Fund: resettlement offices will support them with subsidies during house relocation.
*   Service: resettlement offices pay for and production groups assign laborers to help them
remove and reconstruct houses.
*   Grant priority to choose house sites for reconstruction.
*   Get lands with amount and quality at least equivalent to requisitioned lands and enjoy
priority to lands with sound cultivating condition and near location when lands are
readjusted.
*   Resettlement offices require village collectives to firstly ensure and concern about
interests of vulnerable households when using land compensation funds and resettlement
subsidies to initiate public welfare undertakings or economic entities, and to firstly choose
members of vulnerable households for laborer employment.
6.4 Estimation of Funds Needed to Help Vulnerable Groups
Trough resettlement investigations, the project office currently decides 30 vulnerable
households, and total funds to help them are 90,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan per household.
Since 33,000 yuan per household is estimated unit price to facilitate calculation, it shall not
be taken as actual standard of subsidy. In actual resettlement, fund and laborer assistance
will be provided to each vulnerable household as per principles and methods mentioned in
6.3.
Table 4-4, Shi-Man Expressway resettlement budget, does not list this type of funds
in that its amount is not large.

8. Public Participation and Consultation
In order to set resettlement work of the project on reliable bases, PRO and
resettlement offices at all levels, taking advantage of socioeconomic survey, investigation
of social impact and other opportunities and along with consultative organizations, widely
propagandize and introduce basic situation of the project by all means, ask displaced
persons for opinions and consult with them on problems concerned. The results of public
participation and consultation provide basis for perfection of resettlement schemes.
8.1 Public Participation and Consultation Already Taken
The project office organizes design organizations, consultative organizations, local
resettlement offices and displaced persons to publicize and consult on important issues
involved in the planning stage of resettlement. Please see table 8-1 for main disclosing and
consultative activities that have been taken.

When surveying people living in recommended regions of their opinions on
resettlement from December 2002 to January 2003, PRO sampled one third of
households and selected one member aged above fifteen from each household to
answer questionnaires of the expressway construction. Consolidated results are in
table 8-2:

(Choosing one or above)
I To provide us with funds for      27.67
our independent development.        27.67
2 To supply enough lands.           28.41
3   To  provide  chances  of        31.92
_    non-agricultural jobs.
The survey shows: first, resettlement offices along the line did not make enough
propaganda for the construction of the project or State policies of resettlement, so
households that do not know or know a little about the project take up 74.5%. Second,
households knowing State policies of resettlement are only 14.02%. Third, the public have
106



the desire to build expressways, judging from the fact that more than 90% of them regard
it beneficial to the State, collectivities and individuals, and 95.53% of households agree to
develop this project. Fourth, the public have high ideological consciousness, believe that
the State would appropriately handle compensation for resettlement, support infrastructure
construction and submit to resettlement. Fifth, the public pay enough attention to
environmental protection and desire to green expressways, build soundproof facilities and
etc. Sixth, the public expect to build more passages to facilitate production and living.
Seven, the public generally require to get funds for self-development or be compensated
with enough lands rather than getting other helps.
Correspondingly, PRO has designed measures to reinforce propaganda: requiring
each local resettlement office to publicize plans of the expressway construction and State
regulations and policies of resettlement by fully utilizing the public consultation meetings,
broadcast, television and other media. Beside, it strengthens coordination with
departments of environmental protection and the project so as to properly plan passages
and environmental protection measures.
* Compensation rates of houses, crops and property loss
PRO consulted with resettlement offices at the municipal, district and county level on
compensation rates before designing Resettlement Action Plans, then advanced a
preliminary scheme after considering opinions of affected villages, collectivities,
enterprises and institutions. But the final decision will not be promulgated unless it is
checked by the World Bank and approved by the provincial people's government.
* Selection of new house sites
With the help of the project designing organization, all the township resettlement
offices have drawn up schemes for collectivities of affected households, enterprises and
institutions to choose reconstruction sites for their houses or buildings, and they will
consult more with displaced persons on details of implementation in further process.
* Impacts on houses, attachments to the ground and property
During socioeconomic surveys, the project designing organization, investigation
executing organization and affected units and households check and ratify impacts on
houses, attachments to the ground and property together. Because displaced persons
checked carefully and underwrote registers that were thereafter input to computers, their
affected extents were accordingly inforned to PRO. In the implementation of resettlement,
resettlement offices at all levels shall publicize various affected extents and resettlement
policies to displaced persons with "Resettlement Information Booklets".
Between April and June 2003, PRO, Shiyan Municipal Resettlement Office and
Shi-Man Expressway Preparation Committee as well, launched a large-scaled
supplemental survey of resettlement along the whole line. It includes two aspects: one, to
fully collect opinions and proposals on rehabilitating production and life of the public of
107



143 affected production groups; two, to investigate resettlement along the interchange, and
service districts along the line, and living standards of affected population. The
investigation result showed that displaced persons prefer land adjustment and cash
compensation to other rehabilitation methods.
In June 2003, PRO and local resettlement offices widely consulted with and collected
opinions from affected villagers' groups along the line on feasibility and specific schemes
of land reclamation after requisition. It showed that all the villages and production groups
along Shi-Man Expressway were enthusiastic about reclaiming lands by taking advantage
of the project construction after land acquisition, and they could reclaim 2287 mu of new
lands.
8.2 Further Plans of Consultation with Displaced Persons
As preparation and implementation of the project advances, PRO and local
resettlement offices shall conduct further consultative activities. Main contents to be
consulted are below:
* Specific opinions of displaced persons on the project design.
Local resettlement offices inform villages and production groups along the line of
component designs of the designing organization prior to starting construction. Once it
starts, PRO will perambulate along the line, and determine specific locations and
dimensions of components with production groups. It will also organize the designing
organization to modify aspects that the public generally disputes about under the premise
that technological standards of the project be met.
*  Selection (at least twice) of house reconstruction sites and rebuilding
methods
*  Compensation for relocated households and disbursing schedules thereof
*  Resettlement methods   of laborers   and  rehabilitation  measures  of
agricultural production
* Rehabilitation  means of roads and     water systems affected  during
construction
*  Other important problems that displaced persons concern about, e.g.:
indirect impacts of the project construction on the production and life of
residents living outside regions marked red.
The agenda of further consultation of all resettlement offices with displaced persons
is in table 8-3. As per the plan of PRO, districts, Shiyan city and counties can irregularly
hold consultation meetings with the public and submit reports to PRO. Besides joining
consultations organized by PRO, the monitoring organization can independently consult
with displaced persons on other monitoring issues, collect their grievances and
suggestions and provide monitoring information for resettlement offices at all levels.

8.3 Means by Which                     the Displaced            Persons Participate in
Consultation during Implementation
1. Direct means:
* Villagers' colloquia
To hold colloquia with representatives of villagers or village leaders to gather central
issues that villagers concern more about, collect their opinions and ask local governments
and resettlement offices for suggestions
* Consultation meetings with enterprises and institutions
To sufficiently consult with legal person or representatives of enterprises on
relocation addresses, compensation rates and other issues and finally come to consensus.
2. Indirect means:
The public give grievances, opinions and advice to villagers' committees, monitoring
organizations and resettlement offices at all levels, then resettlement offices provide
feedbacks of resolutions as per handling procedures.
8.4 The Role of Independent Monitoring Organization in Public
Participation and Consultation
*   To provide central issues that villagers concern more about (compensation
rate, laborer resettlement, schedule of the project implementation and etc.)
and report grievance issues
* To periodically consult and hold colloquia or interlocutions with displaced
persons
109



* To put forward opinions and proposals of how to handle grievances
As the project advances, resettlement offices will record public consultations among
the project unit, displaced persons and the independent monitoring organization and then
consolidate them into archives.
8.5 "Resettlement Information Booklet"
In order to ensure all the displaced persons opportunely and fully know policies and
implementation details of the project resettlement, PRO shall hand out "Resettlement
Information Booklet" to all the affected households among affected regions. The booklet
will specifically list affected extents of affected households, resettlement policies and
compensation rates appropriate to the project, the project implementation schedule,
procedures to dispose displaced persons' grievances and complaints and etc. It will be
distributed to displaced persons before the project construction formally starts. Below is
its format and style:

10. Internal monitoring
10.1 The Objectives of Internal Monitoring
Internal monitoring refers to the continual monitoring by the project office and
resettlement-executive institutions through the vertical management systems on the
implementation of "Resettlement Action Plan" so as to comprehensively, opportunely and
accurately know the resettlement progress, discover and solve problems and provide basis
of decision for smooth implementation of resettlement work.
The objectives of internal monitoring are: to standardize and guide the internal
monitoring conducted by the project office, resettlement-executive institutions and
organizations related to resettlement activities; to ensure that resettlement is executed
rigorously in line with "Resettlement Action Plan"; to guarantee that monitoring and
appraisal of resettlement are systematically, normatively and efficiently undertaken so that
relevant persons and organizations know the actual implementation of resettlement,
discover and remedy its problems in time.
The principles of internal monitoring are: investigate, learn and appraise the
implementation of "Resettlement Action Plan" at regular intervals; accurately collect and
analyze data to ensure the accuracy of monitoring results; scientifically, objectively and
justly evaluate the implementation of "Resettlement Action Plan"; submit timely reports to
the project office and the World Bank so that they can know the project progress and make
scientific decisions in time.
The function of internal monitoring is: internal monitoring is an important part of
internal management of the project, which aims at knowing well resettlement activities;
collecting, analyzing and sharing data and information on resettlement progress, fund and
quality, by setting up and using the resettlement information management system;
discovering existing and potential problems; finding out their causes and advancing
suggestions and schemes of disposal.
The project office and resettlement-executive institutions carry out internal
monitoring of resettlement activities, and the former regularly submit internal monitoring
reports to the World Bank.
10.2 Executing Procedures of Internal Monitoring
Internal monitoring consists of two stages: preparation and implementation. The
former begins from the identification of the World Bank, goes through project preparation,
pre-appraisal and appraisal, and then ends with approval. The latter lasts from the
beginning of resettlement enforcement to the realization of resettlement objectives.
1. The preparation phase of internal monitoring
117



The project office and local governments shall establish professional organizations of
resettlement in the early preparation phase. The project office shall set up a special
institution with competent professional resettlement personnel to tak-e charge of
resettlement so as to get complete and objective data and facilitate the participation of
other organizations. Arrange internal monitoring and evaluation in the preparation phase.
The preparation work of the project office includes:
-- Train the personnel of project office and resettlement-executive institutions on
resettlement policies and experiences of the World Bank, State resettlement policies,
design of Resettlement Action Plans, resettlement implementation, monitoring and
evaluation of resettlement, etc.
--Employ professionals and professional institutions as early as possible to assist it to
design Resettlement Action Plan; organize social economic investigation; draw up
Resettlement Action Plan with the help of professionals and institutions;
--Set up a resettlement information management system with the help of
professionals and institutions;
The preparation work of the resettlement-executive institutions includes:
--Sign an elaborate resettlement implementation contract with the project office
--Set up or improve resettlement-executive institutions at all levels and provide
necessary personnel
--Train personnel of resettlement-executive institutions; conduct social economic
investigation and design Resettlement Action Plans with the project office and
professional institutions
--Set up an information management system of resettlement execution
2. The implementation phase of internal monitoring
In this stage, Shiyan Municipal RO, district and county resettlement offices should
provide PRO with actual activity records and resettlement information of household and
unit samples chosen by the monitoring organization to ensure the tracking monitoring of
resettlement activities. PRO will regularly inspect township and village offices and verify
submitted materials of resettlement progress.
The project office should do the following in the phase:
--Be in charge of internal monitoring of resettlement activities as per the
Resettlement Action Plan;
--Submit an elaborate internal monitoring report to the World Bank at a half-a-year
interval;
--Update statistical data of resettlement implementation and improve the resettlement
management information system;
118

10.4 Methods of Internal Monitoring
For the monitoring of resettlement work within the resettlement system from top to
bottom, it is necessary to build a normative, smooth and vertical resettlement information
management system between the project office and resettlement-executive institutions at
all levels to track and reflect resettlement progress of sub-projects in all the districts. The
resettlement offices at different levels submit the resettlement progress, utilization of
funds, effects of resettlement, etc to the superior level and process and analyze the data
with the information management system.
Resettlement offices of the project have established perfect management information
systems to completely, opportunely and accurately store and manage all kinds of data of
resettlement implementation.
Internal monitoring will be conducted in the following ways as per exact
implementation of the project:
1. Standardized system of statistical report form:
The monthly report form reflects appropriation schedule of resettlement funds and
quantity of relocated objects. Reflecting the progress of work by the information of fund
appropriation, the report form is submitted to senior departments from the department at
lower level at the end of each month.
2. Periodical or aperiodic report of work
PRO, Shiyan Municipal RO, county, district and township resettlement offices and
the independent monitoring organization communicate with each other about problems
120



and relevant information of resettlement implementation in various forms and advance
different solutions to the problems.
3. Regular meetings
In the early days of every month, PRO will hold a coordination meeting of
resettlement with Shiyan Municipal RO, county and district resettlement offices to report
implementation progress and problems, share working experience and discuss solutions to
problems.
4. Inspection
PRO will regularly or irregularly inspect specific aspects of resettlement work of
resettlement offices at lower levels, go to the spot to investigate and handle resettlement
issues, and verify working schedule and enforcement of resettlement policies.
5. Exchange of information with the external monitoring organization
The project office and local resettlement-executive institutions should often contact
and exchange information with the external monitoring organization and take its findings
and evaluation as reference for internal monitoring.
6. Combination of questionnaires and visit investigation
Sample a certain number of households or collective units by equidistance sampling
to investigate resettlement work with report formn to check whether the actual
compensation funds, moving allowances, compensation for interrupted labor and green
crops are paid to displaced persons and units, and to check whether resettlement is
rigorously executed in line with Resettlement Action Plan. Investigate all the
enterprises and institutions.
PRO will conduct the first investigation after affected objects get their first
compensation funds. After the first investigation, PRO will take remedial measures
as  per  investigation  results  and  complained   problems, and    then  track
implementation of these measures. In the form of irregular questionnaire survey,
tracking investigation will focus on resettlement of affected laborers, land
adjustment, disposal of complained problems, opinions and suggestions of the
public consultation, house selection and etc.

10.7 Period and Report of Internal Monitoring
Internal monitoring is a continuous process and its comprehensive monitoring
activity is conducted at least quarterly, and more in the critical time such as when the
resettlers move.
In the preparation phase of the project, the internal monitoring organization
cooperates with the World Bank to compile regular and irregular internal working reports
with different styles for different projects and stages. After starting the implementation,
make brief weekly and monthly reports and detailed quarterly, semi-annual and annual
reports for projects of great influence; brief quarterly reports and detailed semi-annual and
annual reports for those with little impact. Make special reports as per requirement of
project management. Draw up summary reports after the ending of implementation.
Resettlement-executive institutions at all levels submit internal monitoring reports to local
governments at the same level, senior executive organizations and the project office. The
project office submits an internal monitoring report to the World Bank semi-annually.
122



11. External Monitoring
In the process of resettlement implementation, an external monitoring organization
will be delegated to regularly monitor and evaluate actual resettlement and rehabilitation
to ensure they are executed according to Resettlement Action Plan.
Centre for Resettlement Research, Wuhan University, undertakes external monitoring
of resettlement work- of the project. The objective of external monitoring is to provide
evaluation of resettlement work by an organization independent of governmnent, check
implementation of Resettlement Action Plan from a broad and long-term point of view.
The organization shall track resettlement work to evaluate whether resettlement:
1. Complies with relevant State laws and regulations of resettlement
2. Follows policies of the World Bank on involuntary resettlement
3. Improves or at least restores livelihoods and standards of living of displaced
persons to pre-displacement levels.
11.1 The External Monitoring Organization and Personnel Thereof
Centre for Resettlement Research, Wuhan University, has rich experiences in
resettlement investigation and external monitoring. It was established in 1984 and was
determined as a financed organization of the United Nation Fund for Population Activities
(UNFPA) in 1985. It is a comprehensive academic research institute specializing in
scientific research, teaching, consultation and service, with rich experience in social
economic survey and resettlement. It participated in the resettlement research of Three
Gorges Project resettlement work between 80s and the early 90s of 20' century. Since the
middle of 90s, it has undertaken resettlement consultation or external monitoring of the
following projects: the World Bank Financed Hubei Jingzhu Expressway Project III and IV,
Inner Mongolia Tuoketuo Electric Power Plant, Xiao-Xiang section of Han-Shi
Expressway of Huibei Province, Gan-Yue Expressway of Jiangxi Province and Asian
Bank Financed Wuhan Waste Water Treatment Project. To carry out external monitoring of
the project smoothly, the Centre has set up a work team to take charge of the external
monitoring. While choosing external monitoring personnel, the team takes the following
factors into consideration: (1) The personnel have participated in similar projects, have
rich experience in social economical survey, understand requirements of the World Bank's
policies of involuntary resettlement and master relevant State and local laws and policies
of resettlement. (2) They should work hard and have capability in independently
conducting social investigation, and have outstanding communication skills. (3) A certain
percent of them should be females. According to these standards, the External Monitoring
Organization has chosen 11 personnel. For specific information, please refer to the table

11.2 Responsibility of the External Monitoring Organization
The External Monitoring Organization will undertake the following activities:
* Conduct baseline survey of living standards before resettlement activities are
taken to learn basic situation of displaced persons' production and life.
* Track and monitor execution of resettlement activities during resettlement
implementation. Collect and report opportunely opinions and grievances of
displaced persons to PRO and local resettlement offices. Submit monitoring
reports to resettlement offices and the World Bank.
* Track and investigate changes of displaced persons' production and living
standards. Evaluate resettlement activities and measures.
* Basing on investigation and sufficient consultation with displaced persons,
advance constructive opinions to PRO and local resettlement offices so as to
ensure smooth advancing of resettlement work and fast rehabilitation of displaced
persons' production and living standards.
11.3 Methods and Procedures of External Monitoring
The External Monitoring Organization will adopt the following methods to monitor
resettlement:
(1 ) Basing on resettlement survey, set up a database of displaced persons and
124



regularly visit and interview them. The External Monitoring Organization will fully use
the data of social economic investigation and the resettlement information management
system established by the project office to dynamically manage and duly learn information
of relocated households. By taking advantage of databases, the organization makes
face-to-face interviews with affected households in their homes to learn actual
resettlement progress, listen to grievances, dissatisfaction or suggestions, and publicize
relevant State policies, the World Bank's requirement and information of project
construction.
After obtaining lists and data of displaced persons from LRO, the External
Monitoring Organization will go to affected households to interview them with no
company of local resettlement personnel or administrators. The personnel engaged in
interview shall be relatively stable so that the interviewers and interviewees can trust each
other, which will facilitate the work.
( 2 ) Hold irregular forums with displaced persons in displaced population
concentrated area. The External Monitoring Organization will hold forums with displaced
persons to get their opinions on important issues. Forums can be either formal or informal;
personnel of resettlement organizations at the basic level can be invited to take part in it or
not: all depends on the actual situation of the time.
(3) Observe on the spot. Personnel of the External Monitoring Organization will
visit resettlement sites regularly or irregularly to observe actual resettlement on the spot.
(4) Case study. The External Monitoring Organization will investigate typical cases
of resettlement, analyse the roots of problems, find out solution and put forward opinions
for reference.
(5) Survey with questionnaires. As for rehabilitation of resettlers' production and
life and ideas of resettlement work, the External Monitoring Organization will conduct
sampling survey, analyse results in time, solve existing problems and provide experience
for resettlement work of the next year.
11.4 Main Contents of External Monitoring
11.4.1 Monitoring Resettlement of Affected Enterprises and Institutions
Shi-Man Expressway resettlement involves 22 enterprises and institutions, which
generally have strong capability to negotiate with resettlement organizations and protect
their own interests. Resettlement of institutions can be ended in a short term since they can
use compensation funds to build or rent working places. Enterprises with partial
unimportant producing process affected can also easily adjust their production
arrangements to resume production and operation. It is also a precious opportunity for
certain enterprises to take advantage of this project to replace lands and move out of
downtown for new development. The External Monitoring Organization will track and
125



monitor these units' resettlement through calls and case study. It will focus on:
* Whether schedule of resettlement is arranged reasonably
*   Whether loss in production and business is compensated
*   Whether enterprises shift their loss onto employees.
11.4.2. Monitoring Resettlement of Relocated Households
The project mainly involves house relocation of rural residents. Resettlement of this
group of displaced persons is another focus of external monitoring. The External
Monitoring Organization will pay special attention to the following indexes:
*   Whether compensation rates of house and other attachments to the ground are
determined as per replacement cost
*  Whether full-amount compensation funds are paid in time
*   Whether selection of house sites are decided through consultation
*   Whether schedule of moving is reasonable
*   Whether subsidies for interim and moving are paid
*   Whether compensation for object is equal to its value
*   Whether infrastructures such as roads, water and electricity supply of new
resettlement locations are complete and who is responsible for them.
11.4.3. Monitoring Resettlement of Resettlers' Production
According to characteristics of affected land and the characteristics of its operation,
the External Monitoring Organization will emphasize on the following aspects:
*   Whether compensation rates of all types of land are decided in accordance with
relevant State laws
*   Whether fund appropriation procedures can ensure affected production groups get
due compensation for land
*   Whether and in which form the amount of land requisitioned, compensation rates
and compensation amount are publicized to all the villagers
*   How to decide distribution scope of land compensation funds if they are directly
distributed to individuals, and whether land is to be readjusted
*   Whether there are definite and feasible plans for uniform  using of land
compensation
*   Whether villagers whose interests are involved are inquired for opinions on how
to fornulate land compensation utilization plan and how these plans are
ultimately formulated
*  How to distribute profits obtained from use of land compensation and how to
protect actual economic interests of affected labourers
*   How land reclamation plans are executed and what are the effects
126



11.4.4. Monitoring Operation of Resettlement Organizations
Capable, professional and efficient resettlement organizations are reliable assurance
of the smooth progressing of resettlement, so monitoring their functioning is the important
part of external monitoring. The external monitoring will be conducted in the form of
on-the-spot visit and verification of materials and records, which includes:
*   Whether personnel arrangement at different levels meets the requirements of
resettlement work
*   Whether resettlement organization at different levels have necessary working
conditions
*   Whether their personnel are qualified to undertake resettlement work
*   The training of their personnel
* The management of internal documents.
11.4.5. Monitoring Resettlement of the Vulnerable Groups
The vulnerable groups should be paid especial attention to by both resettlement
organizations and the External Monitoring Organization. The latter will track and monitor
the following aspects of them by visiting their homes, analysing questionnaires and typical
cases:
*   Which special privileges the vulnerable population enjoy in resettlement
*   Whether the poverty-stricken households can afford new houses
*   Whether poverty-stricken households get assistance during relocation
*   What measures   are taken   to  rehabilitate the  production  of rural
poverty-stricken households
11.4.6. Baseline Survey of Living Standards of Displaced Persons
Prior to the formal enforcement of resettlement, the External Monitoring
Organization will set up a basic database of Shi-Man Expressway resettlement by
sampling survey that is conducted with structural questionnaires. Sampling survey takes
all the affected households covered by the social economic survey conducted in the
preparative stage of the project as population and chooses the households to be surveyed
by stratified sampling. It is roughly decided that sampling percentage of households
affected by house relocation is 10%, that of households affected by land acquisition is
10% and by both relocation and acquisition is 15%.
The baseline survey of living standards of affected households mainly includes:
household composition, production and business, house floorage, household annual
income, employment structure, household annual expenditure, traffic condition, water
supply, electricity supply, living environment, self-evaluation of production and life, and
etc.
127



11.4.7 Monitoring and Appraising Resettlement Effects
After resettlement is formally executed, the External Monitoring Organization will
continuously track and monitor its effects.
The External Monitoring Organization will track affected households a half year later
after they are resettled. Similar to the baseline survey of living standards, the following
survey is conducted in the form of sampling, and by structural questionnaires reflects the
impact of resettlement on survey objects so as to appraise resettlement effects.
Similarly, it will choose samplers as per the same principle of the baseline survey and
try to track the same objects. After ending the baseline survey, the organization will set up
a database of all the surveyed samples as a sample base of the following survey. As for a
few of objects difficult to track due to different kinds of factors, find out clues from the
database of social economic survey and investigate affected households of the same kind
in the same region as substitutes.
Contents of the following survey and baseline survey are arranged well so as to
facilitate comparing and analysing change of affected households' life and production
before and after resettlement. Meanwhile, enquire displaced persons for their opinions on
resettlement to provide reference for the evaluation of resettlement effects.
11.5 Report of External Monitoring
Basing on information obtained from observation and survey, the External
Monitoring Organization compiles external monitoring reports in order to: 1), objectively
report the progress and existing problems of resettlement work to the World Bank and
PRO; 2), appraise the social economic effects of resettlement and give constructive
opinions and suggestions to improve and perfect it. Specific dates to report to the World
Bank and PRO are:
* Before June 30 every year, submit a midterm resettlement monitoring report to
the World Bank and PRO.
* Before December 31 every year, submit an annual resettlement monitoring report
to the World Bank and PRO.
* Half a year after the ending of the whole resettlement work, submit a
comprehensive post-evaluation report of resettlement.
Generally, a monitoring report should at least include: 1) monitored objects of the
report; 2) resettlement progress; 3) chief findings of the monitoring organization; 4)
important existing problems; 5) basic evaluating opinions and suggestions of external
monitoring.
The reports of External Monitoring Organization should be written in both English
and Chinese and be submitted to PRO and resettlement experts of the World Bank. Prior to
formal submission, the External Monitoring Organization shall inforrn related personnel of
resettlement offices and ask for their opinions on the content and forn of the reports.

procedures to fill in questionnaires, (3) meanings of various problems and codes thereof and
interpretations of different concepts, the guide will unify surveyors' interview approaches. query means
and filling standards so as to standardize interview actions, strengthen the comparability of survey data
and ensure a high overall quality of survey. Before starting survey, surveyors should refer to
questionnaires, carefully read and master all the requirements of survey advanced by questionnaires
and the guide. During the process of the survey, surveyors shall illuminate problems without direction
in the guide and punctually contact supervisors.
1. Basic Rule of Survey
1) Surveyors keep patient and careful in the process of interview and win as
much cooperation of interviewees as possible.
2) Surveyors ask all the questions in a questionnaire in turn and record
interviewees' answers exactly. Surveyors are forbidden to write answers
themselves or replace interviewees to make answers without asking
interviewees questions or before interviewees reply.
3) In principle, interviewees answer all the questions in a questionnaire; if
interviewees decline to reply, feel it difficult or inappropriate to reply, or
advance answers that exceed the code range or have equivocal meanings,
surveyors can attach one or more pages to the questionnaire to elucidate the
reasons.
4) Surveyors can obtain actual answers to questions relating to reality by
various means and examine interviewees more minutely if necessary.
Surveyors should also check whether interviewees' answers are consistent
with those to other relevant questions on facts.
5) Surveyors must keep exactly interviewees' reply to ideological questions;
they must keep a neutral stance during interview, avoid influence
interviewees with their own attitudes and are not allowed to induce
interviewees to make answers.
6) Fill in questionnaires in the following three ways: T  as for questions with
only one right answer, firstly mark  v before the figure preceding the code
of a choice considered to be right, then fill the figure in the code box; () as
142



for enclosed questions with multiple choices, choose one or more answers
considered appropriate, mark v before figures preceding corresponding
codes and then fill the figures in code box; (  as for numerical open
questions, directly fill answer in code box for there are no codes for
questions.
7) Fill only one figure in one code box in the format of flush right, and add 0
preceding left-hand digit if the figure does not have full digits.
8) Surveyors examine whether there are mistakes or omissions in questionnaires
immediately after ending a survey; add detailed explanation to problems
needing illumination or having ambiguity; and ask interviewees again if
necessary.
