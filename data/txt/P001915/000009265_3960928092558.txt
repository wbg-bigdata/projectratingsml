MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO HAURITIUS FOR A SECOND RIGHWAYS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Mauritius for US$30.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed
Loan would be on IBRD terms with 17 years' maturity with 5 years' grace and
would help address the needs of the Ministry of Works with respect to
improving its capacity for road maintenance and traffic management.
Background
2.        Mauritius is a small middle-income country; it is an export
oriented economy and, therefore, is highly dependent on foreign trade. In
view of the remoteness of the country from its trading partners,
international connections are of special concern to Mauritius as it aims to
improve its integration with the world economy. The country's foreign
trade depends significantly on the availability of an efficient road
transport system feeding its international seaport and airport. Inter-
island communication is generally light and irregular.
3.        The country has witnessed a remarkable economic progress during
the last five years, unprecedented in Sub-Saharan Africa. The rate of
economic growth averaged over 6 percent per year during this period, while
the rate of unemployment declined from 19 to 4 percent during the same
period. In step with the economic development, total freight and passenger
traffic also grew at about 8-10 percent per annum during the same period.
4.        Being small and still monocultural, the economy of Mauritius is
overly dependant on exports of sugar and garments and development of
international tourism. The economy, thus, remains highly vulnerable to
exogenous factors such as weather induced output fluctuations or unforeseen
movements in the terms of trade. Given the country's present thrust for
increased exports and liberalizing imports to promote competition, a higher
premium is being placed by the country on the more efficient operation and
utilization of existing transport assets carrying significant volumes of
foreign trade and on investments designed to remove critical bottlenecks on
international trade routes.
5.        The Bank's strategy in Mauritius over the next few years will be
on helping the country to sustain and extend the benefits achieved so far
mainly through economic and sector work and very selective lending. This
means helping the country to maintain its generally sound macroeconomic
policy posture and macroeconomic discipline; to promote increased
productivity within the sugar industry's level of production, leading to a
gradual release of resources for other uses, and improve the price

inentiveo and other ihatitutional bystems for agricultural
diversificatiohn  to divaersify industrial exporta and fulfill the necessary
related skill and institutional requirements; and finally, to aasess the
edtvironental itpact of rfaource utilitation, dnd help integrate the
environ tal. concerns into the country'a developtment process.
6.        A favorable balance of payments outlook over the next several
years and the availability of extarnal finance froi othet sources at
trlatively softer terma from bilateral landers means #a considerable decline
in the Bank's role as a major financier. In view of these alternative
financing source., Mauritius plans to limit its IBM borrowing to areas
where the Banrk can provide useful analytical inputs which may not otherwise
be available and we believe this selectivity in appropriate. Among these
areas would be agriculture, environment and infrastructure. The proposed
Project will help to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks, thereby
facilitating the process of diversification of exports, both in agriculture
and industry an well as an expansion of the tourism industry.
7.        A Country Economic Memorandum ontitled 'Mauritius:  Managing
Success" (Report No. 7661-HAS) w-an issued on July 10, 1987.
S.        The Project has three objectivest (at strengthening and
improving important road sections with higb traffic intehsity to increase
the capacity and service life of these roads to meet increasing traffic
demand of & growing economy; (b) addressing the needs of the Ministry of
Works with respect to improving ito c&pacity .or road maintenance and
traffic managementl and (e) establishing effective vehicle safety and
environmental improvements (such as vehicle emaission control procedures) in
the sector.
9.        The Project would include the first phase of a four-year $ 107
million program (1990-1993), to strengthen, improve and maintain the road
network, manage traffic, and vehicle safety and emission control, to meet
the high priority transport needs of the country. The Project would
compriset (a) strengthening and improvement of 45 km of main roads, (b)
resurfacing of 130 kmi (c) equipment for routine maintenance operations;
(d) traffic management; (e) vehicle safety and emission control; and (f)
provision of consultancy services to assist in project implementation. The
estimated cost of the first phase would be US$43.6 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$30.0 million.



-3-
Rationale for Bank's Involvement
10.       The proposed Pnoject follows the First Road Project (Ln. 2337-
MAS) in aiming to support the Government effort to ease critical transport
bottlenecks on the principal highway network of Mauritius, vital for
internal transport, international trade and tourism to promote export
earnings and conserve energy. At the same time the proposed Bank
participation would address important institutional matters such as
efficient operation of the newly established road maintenance organization
with equipment requirements, technical assistance and training and would
also act as catalyst to enlist financial assistance from other
international agencies. The proposed Project would also provide for
improved traffic management, traffic safety and environmental improvement
(such as vehicle emission control) consistent with the Bank's proposed
environmental strategy program, and all the elements taken together would
strongly influence the future development of the sector.
Actions ARreed
11.       Principal items discussed and agreed upon with the Government
during negotiations and incorporated as covenants in the Loan Agreement
include: (1) timely budgetary allocations for road maintenance and review
of annual maintenance plans in the light of previous year's experience; (2)
preparation by December 31, 1991 of an Action Program for vehicle safety
and emission control; (3) preparation by December 31, 1991 of an Action
Program to ensure effective traffic control; and (4) preparation by March
31, 1990 of a time bound training plan for the period 1990-1993.
Benefits
12.       The major economic benefits from the Project (about 80%) would
come from savings of the vehicle operational costs and reduced maintenance
costs of the road system. The proposed Project would also provide for
improved traffic management, traffic safety and environmental improvement
(such as vehicle emission control). All investments would yield first year
benefits ratio (FYR) of 12% or more. The weighted average ER of all civil
works and equipment components, which account for 93% of total project
costs is 28%.
Risks
13.       The proposed Project supports high priority investments under a
four-year program. The economic justification of the Project components
has been well established even under unfavorable hypotheses concerning
Project costs and user benefits. The technical solutions adopted are based
on adequate engineering and technical studies. The possibility of some
delays due to difficulties in taking actual possession of land along the
roads to provide adequate drainage facilities and foot-paths might occur.



- 4 -
However, little additional land is likely to be needed for the Project, as
doat of the land requirements are already part of the Government's road
reserves Risks from inadequato project implementation also seem minimal as
the physical components of the Project are essentially a follow-up of the
on-going First Highways Project.
Raeoendat -One
14.        I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
