N DmbUatlw       The growth of motor veNice traffic on the prlmary NiwaY network of
Maurhtas has brougt Into sharp foous the hadeQjacles of many road
sectons whore desen standards are deficient and the accdent toll
is heavy. The proposed Project would address ts core problm by
selectivy  strengthenrg  and brrovng bnortant road sections wtth NM
traffic Intensity to hcrease the capa&.cy and service llfe of these
roads on an economrcally viable basis.  The proposed Project wouik &a'o
address the needs of the kdnistry of Works with respect to hprovng Its
capacity for road maintenance and traffic managanten Establisthig
effective  automobile en*sslon control proceidres and marpower
development In the sector will aso formn an integul part of the Project.
amems            The major economic benefits from the Project (about 80%) would come
from savhng of the vehicle operational costs and reduced maintenance
costs of the road system.  The proposed Project wouK also provkie for
hproved traffic management, traffic safety and envrormnental
W[rovement (suc  as vehicle emission control).
1bkx             The propo.%d ProJect supports hih priority hnvestrmnts based on the
Govemrre"   FY88-90 Devepnment Pian. The economic JustUfkcatlon of
the projepct  . nents has been well estabIshed  even under
unfavorable hypothes concerning project costs and user benefts.
The teodWcal sokAtlon  adopted are based on adeq.ate enkerin   and
teChrcal studes.  The pcssblUty  of some delays due to dcffcutles In
takhg actual possession  of lanZ along the roads to provIde adequate
dralhage faclties and foot-paths mght occur.  However, MlttIe addtional
land is Ikely to be needed for the Project, as most of the land
requrements are already part of the Goverrment's road reserve. Risks
from hadequate project ktementation  also seems n*imal as the physical
corponents of the Project are essentially a follow-up of the on-go0g
Higways Project

1.01       Maurfitls (IBRD Map 21703) Is sItuated in the hdan Ocoan about 2.400 'm
from the African mahianda   In addtKor to the main Wand, Maurltus, there are a few smaller
Isands scattered  in the Indan Ocean, the most bportant of which  s Rodrigues.  MaLtuk.s
has a dense road network to kntegate Its 2,400 sq km of territory and to serve the
needs of Its population of about 1 ntUion on the main iandu    In addtIon, about 35,000
people live In Rodrigues and other sma  islands.  About hatf of the main sliand is arable
land; the rest Is made up of rocks and mountahious slopes too steep for oAtivatln. With
the exception of a few rocky areas, mostly alng the sea coast, the terraIn does not
pose too much diffttty  for land transport.
1.02       In view of the raeoteness of the country from Its tradig partners,
International conectiore are of speclal concern to MaurtLus as Kt ahn to kipove tts
Integration wtth the world economy. The country's forslgn trade depends signficantly on
the avalablIty of an efficient road transport system  feedIng KS 'nternatlonal seaport and
akrport  Inter-sand  comricatlon is generally Wt and Irregular.
1.03       The cotry has wtnossed a remarkable economic progress during the last
five years, unrpecedented In Sub-Saharan Africa. The rsite of economic growth averaged
over 6 percent per year durVg tNh period, whle the tate of unemloyrrent declined from
19 to lee  than 4 percent durig the same perod  In step with the econaroc develoment,
total frelgt and passenger traffic also grQw at about 8-10 percent per arvi during the
sao period.
1.04       Beng esmal and sWUA monocual, the economy of Maurtk  Is overly
dependent on exports of sar and garmnt  and development o  Iternatonaxl toursm.
The economy, thus, remahs hlguy vuwrable to exogenous factor- such as weather
hnduced output fbctuations or unoresoen movremnts in the tenns of trade. Given the
countrys preeent ttruat for ncreased exports and llberatdng  hpots to promote
conpetKin, a Noer premium  is bein  placed by the cowt   on the more efficient
operation and utilzation of exItin  trarnport assets carrykf  sktigcant voIUns of

1.06       The road network consists of about 1,800 in of roads which are   clasid
hIto tour categore   motorways, main roads, secondary roads and oUwr roads (Table 1).
Motorways and mahk roads togethwr constitute naly hanf of the network, while the other
half Is made up of secondary and other roads. The motor"ays, main roads and secondary
roads are paved Only about 140 lan of rural roads are stI urpaved
1.07       The motorways coripise the Port Louis-PhoenIx Nc (15 kn) and the Port
Louis-PanVemoussse  ln  (11 Ion), wh   are prlmarily desigred to relNeve trafflc congestion
In and around Port Louil  The main roads  constituto prb,cpal Zcs of the country's road
network and comect  detrict headquartern  and main urban populatlon centers with one
anothr    and wlth Port Louis, the capitaL  Over 45 percent of the population roside In
the Port Louis and Plahes Wilhems  dstzlcts and there Is a  corv:entration  of h,ustry,
coanerce and aministration  In these region    The spectrun of sfracoe transport
faciiti  has, therefore, receved concentrated  attention h thiss  region  and the
accessbIlty  of the sland as a whole Is good and every viage on the IWand Is served by
an all-weather road. WhNe the density of roads is Ng, ts qualfty needs    substantal
kh rovement (Chapter II).
1.08       The motor vehicle flet hI 1988 totaled slId,tly over 90.800 (Table 2), of
wch about 3,300 vehiles were owned by the Goverrient  Tha  floeet i amposltion Is
rather stable, about 35 percent passenger cars and about 15 percent landrovers and
pick-ups vans; these two categorie  accournt for neary half te ftleet sie.  The trucks,
traers ard buses corstue  less tan 10 percent of the flet.  Other types of vehicles,
namely, motorcycles, autocycde, tractors, dumpers, road roUers. etc. account for slgiit
over 40% of the fleet size. Over the perlod 197-84, the fleet was alnost stagMtg
and the average amual growth was only about 2 percent Of late, the growth rate ot
motor vehicle fleet has picked up and has abiioet doubled. The wahNg of the bn6rt
quota on motor vehlices In 1984 and of customs  utibs on goods vehicles skco 1987 has
largely   h tlun     the recent kwease h growth rates.
1.09       Passenger transport Is now rogtaated, while freit transport Is, by and large,
deregated.  The private car ownershp which was 35 hhVatants per car hI the 1987 is
expected to be about 30 habitants per car I early 1990's. There wE sti be a high
rellance on the pubic passenger transport servkces for meeting the transport needs of
the vast majority of the popuatlon.  Bus operation  I Mauritius Is presently carried out by
the National Trwuport Corporation (NTC) which Is a parastatal, fow private bus conPanles
(Unitd Bus Servce, Rosei Transport, TrIolet Bus Service anm Mautan Bus Transport)
and about 380 Idvividal bus operators with a total fleet of about 1,456 bes (Table 3).
The h'dvldual operators own about 45 percert of tne bus fleet  There are a'out 20
dcfferent makes of buses hI the country and the bus fleet is ag"g (Tables 3 &nd 4). Bus
operational statistics (Table 5) hdcate that average jowneys Per day, average vehcle
kimeters per day vmd average groes recelts per day all have hkiaeased betwoen 1983
and 1987. There Is, however, sfklcant variation In the operatlonitl performance amongst
the 7rportant bus conparie (Table 6). The National Transport Authority (NTA) Isues

the world and ts potentW  for the development of Itesntinal tourbn, air trani'ort has
particuluar    otance In the development of transport sector strategy.  Passenger traffic
at the Plaisance alport has grown steadly from 396,000 hI 1984 to 643,000 In 1988
(Table 8). wi addUton to the  International akport at Plalsance, capable of aononodatkng

responbty  for th  mangent, co-ordnaton  and polcy kftatives f c  the transport
sctor Is dvked   on  various mrhdstrlee/departments.   Mnstry of Works (MOW) Is
responebe  for develpment and matenance of motorway  and nih roads, wtle tti
upkeep of seondary and other roads Is the responsibility  of loal authorlties.  The

1.15        Transportation  projects hkcuded In the development plans orl$nate both at
the micro--level through the hustr!al enterwrbes  and local authorities (especially for
muncipal and local roads) and at the macro-level throug   MEPD. The demands for
transport by the economic enterprises and sectors are reconcild by MEPD i
consultation  wtth the   shtry  of Fhance (MOF) with due regard to the Govemnent's
policy obJectives to-
(I)     encourage more efficient operation and utlzation of the exstktg
transport hfrastructure  with speclal en*hasls on the hprovement
of external srade routes canry    substantlai vokm, of goo90

effticent,
(lii)   encourage mass transportation  by public conveyances-ansd
(iv)     promote and strengthen  the transport comares' ser- fhanckg

The Govennent's geral  avproach to assln priority to completion of on-gorV  projects
and to rehablltatkoimprovement  of exstkg hnfrastructure  based on the above
conskderations appears reaeonable
1.18        The cost recovery polcy In the tranport sector is highly satisfactory.  The
MMA and AM (in dharge of operations and iranagement of Port Louis and the national alrne
respectively)  are fhancaly  viable and have registered  slgfcant profits In successive
years (Tables 9 and 10). The Clvi Aviation Departmnt Is also operatkg on a sound
Meandal basi  (Table 11). The fuel pricI   poies of the Goverrnment are reasonable;
there are no subekdes (Table 12). The revemues from road transport are    sufficient to
nmeet the armual development and maintenance of road Infrastructure on a pay-as-you-o
basis (Tables 13 and 14). The flnanrcal performance  (Table 15) of the nportant bus
conpanbes hgNits the urgent need for hV,oved prouctivity  In this sub-sector to
ensure financial vlablity.

orghated as ag1o.tural tracks whi~  were progresuvely  bproved but wKthout proper
design and constructilo   As a resut, pavements are heterogenous, structuray  weak and
lack drahage.  Many roads are confined between agicutural fkeds (sugarcane), wlth not
enoug  room to provide adeqwate shouiders, and roadside draiage systems  Due to the
heavy voUme of traffic, routine road maintenance operations caried out by the Minstry
of Works (MOW), can no onger arrest road deterioratiom   Thm  has caused a backlog of
road maintenance, and traffic acckdents have inoreased kn the last two years by about
24% and fatalies by about 16X  Tmm  network thus ne    b,vrovement, strengthening  and
adewate maintenance to provide an acceptable level of sevice to the road users.  These
tasks have successfully started under the Flst Hlw ays Project, wtere about 75 kn of

2.02       Ahnost al road sectio    are predomiantly  passenger traffic oriented.
Passenger cars and buses genorafy constitute about 70% of the total srber of vehicles
plykrg daNly on such roads.  Shoe a majority of thes  trips are for busess and work
purposes, there are two dstnct peaks of daily traffic, one between 8 and 10 hours In
the morning and the other between 4 and 6 In the afternoorL
2.03       Mauritlus' road net%ork Is charactertzed  by hld  vobme operation on a lbted
part of the road network with about 10% of the kiometrage carrying about 50 to 60% of
the total traffic.  Ths has two hportant hplcations  (I) that Nhay  Investments In
Mauritius should be focused prtnarly on these high traffic denslty areas; and (U)
dsperson  of effort too thiry over a large sectlon of other road sections should be
avokied
2.04       Due to the hth density and clse proxbty of urban areas to one another,
dbUnctlon betwen urban and rural roads Is diffcult to make. This is reflected  h the
traffic pattern on the isand. Besides motor vehicles, pedestrian trips In and around
urban areas are siWfcant   Absence of adewate foot-paths in th_e  areas PO86
serious traffic hazard.  Thre are no aninal drawn vehicles on roads In MaltusK.
2.05       Urregulated axle loads of the fleet of heavy trucks have considerably
damaged the main roads In Mauitus. The Goverrnment has recently (1985) enacted
leWslatlon prescribing the axle load biVts on shgle axle (10 tons) and tandem axle (the
sum  of the axle welts varyig between 20 and 24 tons depending on axie spachgs).
Recently, several mobile axle load control eqWipment acquired under the Fbst Hglway Loan

2.06        The MOW, through Its Tsctiial Department (TD), Is responsble  for
construction,    rovement and maintenance of motorways and main roads, and also for
construction  and maintenance of builings.  Rural roads are ad rWstered by the three
district councils, wiHe the krrovement and maitenance of Lrban roads Is the
responsbility  of the five  uncial councils.
2.07        Prior to May 1989, the TD comPrlsed dght professonal sectkxne   Roads,
Buldns, Materlals Laboratory, Traffic, Mecharical, Sewerage, Quantity Surveyhg and
Architecture.  Road works were carried out by nine district units which were undo  the
responsibillty of five territorlal units (North, South, East, West and Port Louis). Thees
units were also kn charge of building works, and hence reported to two Headquarter
sectons. Under the responsibility of the Mechanical Engineering Section, a Central
Workshop In Plane Lauzun (Port Louis) with five outposts (Mahebourg, Vacoas, Centre de
Flacq, Rose-Hill and Terre Rouge) ls In charge of maintahhg road equ.pment and vehices
of other miristrIes/departments,   This orgarization, aKthough It had succeeded  in keepin
'- roads passable all year round, could no longe handle adeqwately the maintenance
needs of the road network which were becomng hcreaslngiy  conplex due to heavy traffic
volunes.  Furthermore, long and cumbersome procurment and adymrstrative  procedures
and lack of properly trained staff were scoe of the major constraints facng the
organizaticn.
2.08       In an effort to mrove and streni,,den  Its road maintenance capacity, the
Govemnent has created In May 1989 a fulklfdged  decentralized  road maintenance
organization  (Chart 1). Under the overall responsibility  of the Princpal Engineer, road
maintenance operators wIN henceforth  be carri  out by three dvsions each conprsirg
three districts.  These dvisons are  North (Port Louis, Panpleousse and Riviere Du
Rarpart districts); Center (Moka, Flacq and Grand Port districts); and South (Plains Wnms,
Rlack Rlver and Savane ditrcts).  These units hav^ been asslged  adequate equipmert,
personrve, material and suppllee to carry out routie road maintenance operation  and
emergencies works wlthin ther Jlsdction.  The Prhctpal Ernner, with the assistance of
Dlvision Ernweers, Is responsble  for plannirg overal maintenance operaUons and
monitoring kementatlon through performance accounthg.  Lkder the new organitational
arrangements, the Prhcpal Engineer (Planning) Is responsble  for plarnnng, deslgn and
supervsIon  of new construction  and Wrprovements.  In addition, the Govemment has also
taken a poicy decbion 'o contract out resurfacing  (pertodic maintenance) works to
private contractors. Wltn regard to management of road maintenance equipment, whle the
organizational set-up of the Central Workshop (Chart 1) remaho the same, based on the
recorilnJatkr  of a racentiy  caroTeted cxTisultant's study, the Goverrmnt has
Introduced  satisfactory kirovements In the operatonal procodres.  These hinude
streamlining of procurement and disbursement procedures, and hntrodction of a system of
incentives for the staff. With these ehanges, the new set-up Is expected to become more
efflcent In tacklin  road maintenance operations.
2.09       Each of the TD's sections, except Quantity Surveyin  and Architecture, are
headed by Prhcpal Ernweers; the Quantity Surveyig and Architecture  Sections are



headed by a Quantty Surveyor and Prrcpal Architect respectIvely; they all report to the
Chief Enerr.  The Mecharical Engterkg  Sction is staffre  by a prhlipal nre, two
mchanical engIners, two mechanical officers, a workshop supevir,   sufficient ruber
of support staff, and has a work foroe of about 100 qualified technicians (mechanics,
e    nqctrlcas, fitters, blacksniths, etc...).  Road maintenance operations eploy about 3000
staff khckaa   about 60 hil-4evel staff, 200 tecvdans, and 2740 laborers.  Afthoui
adeWate rmewlcay, this work foroe Is not fuly traked to efficiently  carry out
maintenance operatons.  UndLr the proposed Project (para 3.18), a trahhg program  would
be hnlmted to ut'ade the skins of these personnel.
2.10        MaurUius has adeQwate faciKts for trakhg cvil works persorv-el.  The
UIveralty of Maurtkus offers courses In civN, mechanal and eectrical en0neerlng.  The
hdustrial Trade Training Center (ITTC) at Beau-Basshi, establied  In 1969 with LNDP/ILO
assstance, and the ITTC at Ptton, estabished  In 1979 with assistance provided under the
Bankts Fhst Ed&cation Project (Loan 1 033-MAS), provide vocatonal traIIg to about 480
students each year. The oourses offered at the ITTCs hclide mehanical engineering,
wektng and metal fabrication, masorry ani concrete work, etc.  In addtin, the Lycee
Polytechnique set up In 1982 with the assistance of the French Govermnent provides
courses In cvIl, mechanical and electrical tngieArIn  for about 112 students arually.

period, the share of transport Investment Is about 14% of the total public sector
Investments (table 16-19). The earmarked hnvestments would amount 'o about 54 percent
for roads (Rs. 720 NIl!bn, I.e., about US$55 nillikn), 33 peroont for port (Rs. 450 rillon,
I.e., about US$35 nillion) and 13 percent for aWport (Rs. 179 rillon I.e. about US$14

3.05          Two successive  studcs were carried out In 1985 and 1988 urder FAC fhiancig
to dentify the maintenance needs of the networks of motorways (27 kn) and mah roads (840
kIn). These studles kIentifed about 404 km of roads (Anex IVa) whic need resurfachg over
the next four fiscal years (FY1990-1993). These roads are of the same ciaracterIstics as
those descrbed above (para 3.04) and carry about 500 VPD to 19000 VPD. Currently, they
receive some spotty routhe maintenance operation on an aninual basis.  CoaeecAntly, there
Is an urgent need for general protection  of these roads to avoid premature breakdowrL  The
works proposed cLsst of: (a) clearnig and repalrng drainage structures; (b) clearing and
regravelNg  of shouldrs; (c) patcho*   and reeealng; (d) execution of double suraco
treatments or asphalt concrete wearig courses; and (e) provkl,g pavement markigs, sWng
and sigial. The frst tranche of 130 kms of heavily traveled roads (1 600 VPD and above)
have been hcuded under the Project (Annex lVb). Durin  the appraisal mssion It was ageed
that the resurfacing program wi be updated annually dlrig the execution of the proposed
Project In accordance with pavement and appurterioss  condtior, volune of traffic and
traffic flow to alow costent circulation   The resurfacing  program  would need an aunual
budgetary provbion of  .R 50 ffmlWon dmIng the four-year period, FY90-93. At present.
provisin for these worKs Is nelgble (para 3.08). The Tecrical Departmen  of MOW wIN
prepare bIddIng docunents and supervise execution of these works Mid  wW be carred out
by private contractors.
3.06          Cora.uItancy studes have also been carried out for Identifyin  routie
maintenance requirements of the entire network of motorways (27 kn) and main roads (840
bin) over the next four fiscal years (FY1990-1993). Routne maintenance operation  wi

3.07          Patching and reseaing operatkxos wI be carried out by force accoun.L  These
oWeratkins w  be carried out by brigdes  two In each of the three tenitorial sectkons (para.
2.08). Force account operatkxis consisti   of clarin  of shoulders  clearing and repairin
of dtche  and culverts, roefng of potholes, mhior repairs and pantiog of brt s   renewing

3.08          To s4pport tte   operatkmns, the proposed Program wI provkie eqoxnent
materlals and supple - (Anrexes V (a) and (b). Amrual fundki requirements for routine
maintenance operations are esthnated at MuR 15 (US$1.0) mlion for FY90-91 and MuR 24 (US$
1.6) mllion for FY92-93. At present, If works are properly classfied, actual expendture  for
routine maintenance amounts to approxlmately MuR 13 (USS0.9) millin (currently, allocation for
perodce maintenance under budget category "other roads work has prinarily been used for
routine maintenance work).
3.09          The Program for routie maitenance Is deolied to buld sufficient capacity
wlth  the MOW to fully carry out maintenance operation  on the total network under tts
urisdction  (840 km of main roads and 27 km of motorways) and to take on addKtlonal
maintenance operatons when called upon to do so on an emergency basis.
3.10          MOW ha3 recently reorganlzec  Its road maintenace operatior  by separathg
maintenance works of roads from bulins (paa 2.08). Lnder the new set-up execution of
road maiterance works has been decentralzed  with appropriate delgation of powers so that
works can be carred out more effectively.  In addton, the mechanical workshop is beng
reorganized  based on reomindatlons  of a rcentUy completed organization study carried out
by Governent officials wth the support of consultant.   The reotbedations  of tNh  report
have been accepted, In prhdpe, by the Goverrment.

5.01          The major Interest of Maurltkus' Pub'lc Sector hnvestment Program  (FY 1988-
1990) Is to preserve the past and existng investments In the economy, hinrove prodctvity
and increase operational efficiency.  For the road subsector this translates Into rehabilitation
and bWroved maintenance cf the prcxa! arteres with heavy traffic density.  MaurltkLs
attaches a very high priority to the b,povement of Is extemal trade routes (para 1.02).
The growth of motor vehicle traffic on the prklary hligway network of Maurftkis has brought
into sharp focus the hadequacies of many road section  where deslgn standards are
defient and the accident toll . heavy (Tab'e 20). The proposed Project would address
thmse core problems by selectvely  strengtherg  and hprovhg bportant road sectons based
on sound economic consdkerations.  Furtheriore, the proposed Project would also address the
needs of the MWistry of Works with respect to bTvrovN  Its capacity for road malntenance
and traffic management  HLunan resource development in the transport sector wMI be an
in.egal part of the Project
5.02          The mportant oc:miodtles that would be affected by the knproved roads are
agrIcultural produce especially sugar, construction  materials hdiudhg cement, fruIts and
vogetabls, petroeun  products, hdustrial raw materials and hport/export of general cargo.
bproved road cornections would also stkumate tourism  dvslopment.  The ultkmate
benefiaries  of the proposed Project would be rnad users who, due to the diversity of
traffic using the road network, come from a wide range of sectors and Icome groups.
Because trarnport enterprises are coroettive, It Is expected that the benefits which would
Iitialy accrue to the transport users would be gradually passed on to the economy in
neral.
IL  Pro  t Costs and Bunt its
5.03          The economic evaluation of the dfferent subpro,ects is based on the feastilty
studis and economc analyses unidertaken by the consultants unlder the aegis of the Mnistry
of Works. These studies were reviewed and dicussed with the concerned agencies and
margnal sub-projects were either reformulated  or postponed as a result of the review.
5.04          The traffic projections for the different sub-projects  are based on past
traffic trends, gasoline and dise  consumptlon  profie (Table 21) and planred hcreases In
production and conourmtlon In the zones of infmace.  Since no generated/hiduced  traffic Is
anticpated to develop on the Project roads (the roads have been paved for decades), the
expected traffic growth takes Into account nomal traffic growth only.
5.05          For calculatng  the econoxic benefts and costs. internatonal prices have been
used for  rported equiprnent, materlals and other tradeable commoditles.  Land and other non-
tradeable Items ke aggegates, skilled and unskilled construction labor have been valued at
local prices.  Economic costs net of taxes were estknated for aHl investrrmit costs,
maintenance costs and operation costs.
5.06          The quantitaUve economic analysis of the Project road sectons takes account
of savigs In vehicle operatng eosts, passenger travel tknes and road maintenance costs.
For bushess journeys made wlthn the  Mkence area of the Project roads, ttne savh9s were



- 27 -
vakied at 1.1x average hourly wage rate to take account of overhead oosta.  The value of
tie tor rxnon,4use   tro was given a corwervative  estkato of 1/4 x average hourty wage
rate. Quantlfled benefits dLse 4o the proposed Project would result makVy (about 80%) from
avokded extra htway maintenance coets and redAced vehdcle operathg costs.  eneftts de
to icreased comforto convenlence  and safety have not be  taken into accowit.
5.07          The projected traffic volumee Imply annual growth rates in the range of 2% to
101. These rates are wed below those that occurred in the Project road segnents durkg the
perod 1985-88. The present hlg  growth rates have been assumned to taper-off sigflcantly
from  10% per arnma  for cars and vans durig 1988-90 to 7% per arun durng 1991-95 and
further down to 5X per arn dLrfg 1996-2011 wtth the Wloy slwdown In the growth of the
eorany In the futiLe. Medilun trucks, heavy trucks and buses are expected to grow at
slower rates (Anex 11) over the economk  lHe of the road works. The state and
cawractersUtcs  of the exstin  l*s whlch  are to be strengthened  and rehabilitated  by the
proposed Project and estsmated cost-benefit strearm are descrbed briefly In Amex 11.

5.08          Based on the most probable estkmates of constructin, eqW.nent and
maitenance costs, the proposed Investments on cifferent Project conVonents produce
economic return (ERs) rangn  from 21% to 50% (table 5.1). Al investnents would yild fst
year beneft ratio (FYR) of 1^% or more. The welted average ER of al cliv works and
eqummwnt components, which account for about 93% of total Project costs Is 28%. If the
resurf achg  program  of high traffic density roads were not ndertaken, vehcle operathg
costs on the progresslvely  deterioratig  pavements would Inrease and those hNway sections
whch would fall prematurely would require corplete recaostruction  at a cost relaUvely hiWr
than that of an hyedate ovlay.  Repacement and modenmzation of low efficiency  litted
capacity road machhery wiN upgrade MOW's -.aintenance capaciy and reduce road maintenance
costs  Tecifdcally advanced fied testin  and laboratory equomnt are primarily desigred to
irove traffic operation., pavement managaot and quallty control on maintenance
operatons of the entire pubic road networks.  The above ERs urderstate  the ful benefits of
the Project by excludhg benefts due to icreased traffic safety, qualty of servie and
convenIence  of travelers on the hrroved facitie.  Sentvtty  analyses were carried out to
test the effect of variation In construction and eQpment costs and users' benefits on the
above estmatea.  Even under the Lnfavorabe  assmption  of 15% Nger
construction/equipment costs, confi'ed with a 15% redction In uers' benefits, the ER's
remain acceptable withti the range of 15% to 34% with an overal wgdited ER of 21%.
5.09          The tranhg and tedhical assstance conponent of the proposed program  and
the vehicle emssIon control coTuponent whose benefts could not be quantled  are considered
as an integal part of the Project to upgrade the management and operations of the
transport sector hdckig  krovement of the envirorinert and whose benoefts would permeate

1.          A3 BlAck Rtve  Road (28 Km) - Thb road section  rikcs Al (Royal Road' to
Black River and provwides an hiportant conoctlon between Port Louls and the hlly
popovated district of Plain Wihemi to the scuthwest part of the Island. The wdtth of the
road Is varyin  between 6.25 m and 7.40 m. The drahage In some section Is tadequate.
About 2,000 veNcies, 300 of wtkh were heavy vehicles, were usig this section in 1988.
It Is  stkhated that traffic on this section wIl hicrease by aIout 8% to 10% per year
during 1989-90 and 4% to 7% per year during 1991-95 and thereafter increase at the
rate of 2% to 3% per year up to 2,011, approxknately the econonic life of the kTvroved
proJect sectlon.  The road crosses urban, semi-urban  and rural areas and passes through
IridustrIal areas and sugarcane fleids.
2.          A8 Saint Jean Road (2.0 km) - This Is the main road through Quatre Bomes.
Its width is about 7.40 m and shoukJers do exist. In 1988, the cverage daily traffic
voume was about 14,500 vehicles, of which about 1,300 was heavy comr.arclal veNices.
Traffic Is further expected to grow between 5% and 10% per anrum for cars and pick-up
vans and between 2% to 6% per anumi for buses and trucks over the next 25 years.
Heavy passenger traffic Is a dominant feature of the road sectlon. hkrovement of the
traffic flow in Saint Jean roundabout and strengthening of pavement are urgent.
3.          a2 Pabna Road (9 km) - This section links the Plalne Wihems district to Black
River road and c osses the urban area of Pakna. Except on a small stretch nside the
urban area, there is no foot-paths and klntudinal drahage Is ver> Inadequate.  As
nunerous pedestrians wak al    the road in and around the urban area, the existig road
characteristics pose serious traffic hazarud The width of the road varies between 6.40
and 7.40 m. In 1988 on the average about 3,300 vehicbs were operathg on this section
About 1,000 of this traffic consisted of trucks, heavy trucks, trailers and buses. Trafflc
along tNs section Is expected  to grow at an arnual rate of 5% to 8% for cars and pick-
up vans and 2% to 6% for buses and trucks dhring the next 25 years.
4.          Fllc en Flac Road (7 km) - This section inks A3, near )Jnctlon of Pabna road
to the coastal village of Flic and Flac. The first part of the road crosses sugarcane
fields. The Influence area of tHs road has considerable potential for development of
tourlsmr  In 1988 the average dally traffic volume was about 1,800 of which about 33%
was commerclal vehices.  Traffic on ths sction Is expected to grow betwoen 6% and 8%
per year for cars and vans and betweon 2 and 5% per year for trucks and buses for the
next 25 years.

two atwrnative courses of action are possble  (a) applying an overlay as an Immediate
strergwnv  procadure or (b) to cca-,-Aetely rocontruct those sWctlons aiter theY fall.
Economic analysis was made on the basis that If thb overlays were not applied, vehicle
oowatin  costs on the przgressively  deteriorathg  pavement would hicrease, and those
hNghway sections which would fall prematurely would reqalre coplete reconstruction at a
cost relatively hIgher than that of an eimedlate overlay.
6.          VehIce operatin  costs (VOC) on the project road section  have been
esthr.ated separately  for each road, and for every year. takin  into account the condt!on
of road surface, the expected deterloration from clbnate and traffic, as well as the
maintenance operation carried out on the roads.  VOCs were calculated by consultants
(OCEOM) usng hNhway deskn and maintenance standard model (HDM). Six typical vehicle
groups were selected (cars, pick-up vans, meC'isn trucks, heavy trucks, trailers and
busas) and unrt VOC savhgs based on wlth' and 'wlthoutn the project scenarios were
assessed   Based on the cost/benelt streams (Table 11.1 attached) for each road section
ERs were estknated

7.          AboLt 130 ki,i. of hg  traffic density (1600 vehices per day and above)
roads have been hcluded under the project  Many of these roads are beig subjected  to
heavier axle loads, and In many cases heavier traffic vo&zres than they were designed for,
with consequent raNd pavement deterioration  and sixortened  Itfe, and the risks of serious
pavement falures In future.  Usually In such cases, two aternative courses of actlon are
posstl3; ka) applyig an overlay as an rmmedlate measure to Wrove road standard or (b)
to completely reconstruct those section after they fall. Economic analysis was macie on
the basis that If the overlays were not appled, these Nglway sections would fall
prematurely  and would rewikre substantially  hlgher costs for complete reconstruction.
